VISITS TO STAKES, WARDS AND MISSIONS 

It has fallen to my lot since our last conference to visit a number 
of the stakes of Zion, to be present at the dedication of a number of 
meeting houses in the various wards, and to dedicate four chapels and 
recreation halls in the missions of the Church. 

I have also had the pleasure of being present at a meeting on the 
Hill Cumorah, which was held in commemoration of the one hundredth 
anniversary of the delivery to Joseph Smith of the golden plates from 
which the Book of Mormon was translated by the inspiration of the 
living God, and also to attend a meeting in the Sacred Grove at Palmyra, 
where God, our heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ appeared to the boy 
Joseph Smith — the most remarkable .and wonderful vision that we 
have any record of in the Holy Scriptures. 

I rejoice in the growth of the Church and in the general prosperity 
of the people. There have been quite a number of changes in the various 
stakes and wards since our last conference.

STATEMENT BY THE U. S. ATTORNEY GENERAL 

I have decided this morning to make rather brief remarks person- 
ally, and to read from the revelations of God to the Latter-day Saints, 
but before doing so I want to call attention to a very remarkable state- 
ment made by the attorney general of the United States. This state- 
ment was made at Bedford Springs, Penn., June 22, 1927 : 

ON OBSERVANCE OF LAW 

"When intelligent, educated men hold up to ridicule the rules for 
its conduct which society has made, intimate and by innuendo and sug- 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



gestion advise that such rules ought to be violated ; ridicule and revile 
as undesirable members of a community, men sworn to defend and en- 
force its rules ; devote their intelligence, wit and resources to making- 
crime and criminals interesting and attractive, why is it not expected 
that the thoughtless, the unfortunate, the ignorant, the vicious, will try 
to get rid of ,the oppressors of the criminal in any way, by any means, 
any violence that will be most effective? 

"Because someone pays for the doing of it, and because the great 
body of law-abiding citizens is complaisant and says nothing to show its 
disapproval, flippant, jeering writers, publishers, soap-box orators, 
cabaret performers sow the wind; and society reaps it in whirlwinds 
which blast and destroy." 

The attorney general, without mentioning prohibition, asserted 
that in buying any commodity, traffic in which is forbidden by law, the 
purchaser is directly sanctioning and rewarding a violation of the law 
in exactly the same manner as does the receiver of stolen goods, by 
making the transaction profitable. 

"It will not do," he asserted, "to say in the same breath : 'I believe 
in and demand enforcement of the laws of the country, and I will pay 
well any man who will violate these laws.' " 

I regret that his speech was not published in full in the dispatches, 
because it is the speech of a statesman, the speech of a man who loves 
his country and is desirous of maintaining and upholding the laws of 
that country. 

THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS ON THE SUBJECT 

In the very first revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants we find 
the following: 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the pro- 
phecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"Whiat I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, 
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the vpice of my 
servants, it is the same." 

We read in one of the revelations : 

"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say ; but when ye do not what 
I say, ye have no promise." 

I wish that I had the ability to impress upon the Latter-day Saints 
the necessity of searching the commandments of God, the revelations 
from the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth, as contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants. If we as a people would live up to those won- 
derful revelations that have come to us, we would be a bright and 
shining light to all the wide world. 

"Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of 
God hath no need to break the laws of the land. 

"Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right 
it js to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet."" 

"According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered 
to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all 
flesh, according to just and holy principles; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, 
according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may 
be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. * * * 

"And for this purpose I have established the Constitution of this land, by 
the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed 
the land by the shedding of blood." 

LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION 

All Latter-day Saints believe absolutely that the Constitution of 
our Country was inspired of God, and that he used wise men, noble men, 
as instruments in his hands for establishing that Constitution, and when 
any law is enacted and becomes a constitutional law, no man who spends 
his money to help men break that law can truthfully say that he is a loyal 
citizen. 

"And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my 
will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them. 

"And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle 
of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is 
justifiable before me. 

"Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church in 
befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land. 

"And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this 
cometh of evil. 

"I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore you are free indeed; and the 
law also maketh you free. 

"Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. 

"Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and 
good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold ; otherwise whatsoever 
is less than these cometh of evil. 

"And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake jail evil and 
cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth 
out of the mouth of God." 

"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things ; for he that 
is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant ; wherefore 
he receiveth no reward. 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness ; 

"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a 
commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same 
is damned. 

"Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that 
obeys not my commandments ? 

"Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled ?" 

"I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing. 

"Then they say in their hearts : This is not the work of the Lord, for his 
promises are not fulfilled. But woe unto such for their reward lurketh beneath, 
and not from above." 

Another statement in this book is that "there is a law, irrevocably 
decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all 
blessings are predicated: 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that 
law 'upon which it is predicated."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE WORD OF WISDOM 

"A Word of Wisdom for the benefit of the council of high priests, as- 
sembled in Kirtland, and the Church, and also the Saints in Zion. 

"To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation 
and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal 
salvation of all Saints in the last days. 

"Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and 
the weakest of all Saints, who are or can be called Saints." 

And every Latter-day v Saint knows that tea, that coffee, that to- 
hacco, that liquor, are the things that this Word of Wisdom says it is 
not pleasing unto God that we should partake of. There are many Saints 
who say: "Oh, that is not by way of commandment;" but it is "the 
order and the will of God." And what does the Lord promise to you 
and to me and to every Latter-day Saint who observes this Word of 
Wisdom ? 

"And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow 
to their bones ; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures; 

"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

A CALL FOR HELP TO DO RIGHT 

May God help you and me and every Latter-day Saint to observe 
the Word of Wisdom, that we may have health and hidden treasures of 
knowledge, and that God will allow us to live here upon the earth until 
we have filled out the measure of our creation ; and may God help you 
and me to uphold the laws of our land in every way within our power, 
is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I would be very happy, my brethren and sisters, if I were able to 
impress upon this congregation of Latter-day Saints and upon those 
who may be present who are not identified with the Church, the vital 
importance of that part of the remarks just made by the President of 
the Church which refers to our obligation to magnify, uphold and sustain 
the civil law by which we are governed in our temporal affairs. 

UPHOLD AND SUSTAIN THE CIVIL LAW 

I have made, while sitting here upon my seat and listening to the 
President, some notes which I desire very briefly to call to your atten- 
tion. To me the establishment of the government of the United States, 
and the development of this nation of which we are citizens, did not 
come by chance, but was a thing of destiny, just one of the incidents 
connected with the development of the purposes of the Lord in the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV1NS 



7 



consummation of his great plan, looking to the redemption of his 
covenant people, coming in the time in which it was to come, developing, 
as he decreed it should develop, and accomplishing, notwithstanding all 
of the weaknesses and shortcomings of its people, the purposes for 
which it was intended. 

WE OCCUPY SIMILAR POSITION TO ISRAEL OF OLD 

It had its inception more than four thousand years ago, when 
the Lord called Abraham from his home in Chaldea, and entered into 
covenant with him, a covenant which was to be everlasting, that he 
would make of him and his descendants a great people, and that through 
them all of the nations of the earth should be blessed. It is a long 
time to go back four thousand years, and the time which is allotted to 
me would not justify an effort upon my part to do so. It is sufficient 
for me to state to you, and this can be definitely and fully demonstrated, 
that the history of the Israelitish people from that time until the 
present, brings us, step by step, to the condition which we occupy 
today. The way, is clearly marked. Trie path in which they have 
traveled in the past, as well as the road which will lead to the consum- 
mation of this covenant which God entered into 1 with them, are all 
plainly outlined in the scriptures which we have before us. 

A GOVERNMENT DESIGNED FOR ALL MANKIND 

The coming of Columbus to this continent was not a thing of 
chance. It had been foreseen and foretold by the prophets of God. 
The coming of the Pilgrim fathers to New England, of the Dutch to 
New York, and the cavaliers of the Old World to Virginia, was not 
a thing of chance, it was just the chosen combination of men and women 
who were calculated to make up the composite government which was 
established at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the United 
States. They were prayerful people, they were people who had faith in 
God, they prayed to him and their prayers were answered ; and, as stated 
in the scripture which the President has read, it was under the Lord's 
inspiration that these men were moved upon to give us this government 
under which we have so rapidly and wonderfully developed. It was not 
to be a government of Englishmen, nor of Dutchmen, nor of royalty 
represented in the cavaliers, nor of French people who were in Louisiana, 
and to the north of us, in Canada, but a government designed for the 
benefit of all mankind, a government which was to make all people 
equal under the law. 

CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LAWS ARE SEPARATE 

The beginnings of it in this dispensation were had when Martin 
Luther struck from the people of the Old World the shackles which 
bound them to a policy by which the church sought to dominate the state 
and government in civil, as well as religious affairs — a thing which the 
Lord has told us is not his will, that we are responsible to him for our 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



faith, for the morality and the righteousness of our lives. He has told 
us just as definitely that we are responsible to the civil law, SO' far as 
the control of our temporal affairs is concerned. What could be ac- 
complished without the proper administration of civil law ? There would 
be no protection for society, the weak would be subject to the power 
of the strong, to prevent all of which fundamental laws of our country 
have been enacted by wise men. How wisely the Constitutional law 
of our country has been framed ! It provides for a legislative body to 
carefully study and enact the laws of our country. These men are 
not to execute the laws that they themselves make — it would be a danger- 
ous thing — but an administrative department of government is pro- 
vided, which is to execute and administer the law enacted by the legis- 
lative body. They are just laws. It may he that laws have been enacted 
which were in a sense undesirable. A way is provided by which they 
may be abrogated or amended, and that is the proper mode of procedure. 

GLADSTONE ON THE 1 CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES 

I desire to quote what William Gladstone, one of the greatest of 
our modern statesmen, says in regard to the Constitution of the United 
States : ; 

"The Constitution of the United States is the most wonderful work 
ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of men." And 
he speaks truly. It was the work of God, his wisdom manifested in 
the men who created it and brought it forth. Gladstone is right. 

THE NEED OF EMPHASIZING LAW OBSERVANCE 

Now what is the necessity of calling attention to this matter at this 
particular time ? I believe that we who are present know that the neces- 
sity does exist. You only need to read the reports that come to us from 
the various parts of the United States, and from our own state and 
county. There is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that lawlessness is 
running riot. Men go, boldly and unmasked, and shoot their way into 
the treasure-houses of this country, killing, if law-abiding men stand in 
the way, in order that they may carry away that which does not belong 
to them. Men violate, unblushingly, the laws of chastity and virtue, 
which are the very foundations upon which all good governments may 
stand. Men holding public office violate that trust which has been re- 
posed in them by the people, and themselves stand out violators of the 
very law that they are appointed to magnify and uphold. Only this 
morning you who read the papers saw an account of one of the most 
atrocious crimes that could be named, said to have been perpetrated 
by an official who has been appointed to administer the law, not to 
violate it, in which at a threat of life he takes a woman into an auto- 
mobile, carries her away to a secluded place, and there keeps her during 
the entire night. I have passed a good, part of my life among uncivilized 
people. I have been with Indian tribes from the Canadian border to the 
interior of Mexico, and I have never in my experience encountered a 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



9 



tribe of Indians who would tolerate lawlessness of this character in the 
indifferent manner that we do. Men are arrested, prosecution is sought, 
the best legal talent available is called in for their defense, and there is 
scarcely one chance in ten that they will be convicted. Witnesses un- 
blushingly perjure themselves, while attorneys who pose as respectable 
members of society, with full knowledge of the fact, encourage them 
in it. 

OFFICIALS BESET WITH VEXATIOUS LAW SUITS 

Officials who conscienciously endeavor to execute the law are beset 
with vexatious law suits, the money for which is furnished by lawless 
people, until they are driven from office. 

I do not refer to local conditions alone. Is there need to call the 
attention of the people of the United States, of our own state, of this 
entire inter-mountain country, to the necessity of following the admo- 
nition of the Lord, in the scripture which has been read to us, that in the 
selection of the men who are to administer the law, we should choose 
men of integrity? and there are plenty of such men, many of whom 
are now in public service. Do not understand me to infer that there 
is not integrity in the administration of our public affairs, but by some 
means rogues slip in, under the shadow^ of good men, before their 
character becomes known. 

CALLING OF THE CHURCH TO UPHOLD RIGHT AND OPPOSE CRIME 

I speak plainly upon this subject, my brethren and sisters, because it 
appears to me to be vital to our welfare. I do not direct my remarks 
to Latter-day Saints alone, but to the people of all creeds, professions 
of faith, or of no faith at all. I know that politics has been held up to 
us as a thing so sacred that the Church has nothing to do with it, and 
should not refer to it. I ask you, in heaven's name, what is the 
calling of the Church, if it is not to oppose lawlessness and crime, and 
seek to establish righteousness; if it is not to stand firmly for the 
proper administration of the law, and to oppose violation of it that peace 
and prosperity may abide with the people of our country, which can 
be had under no other conditions? 

DESTINY OF NATION FORETOLD 

I wish that the people of the world could be made familiar with the 
contents of the Book of Mormon, this American scripture which has 
been before the world during a century of time. It outlines the destiny 
of this nation, tells jt as plainly as history will tell it after its destiny is 
accomplished. It makes very plain this fact : That if the government 
is to be perpetuated, as it may, if it is to endure as God has decreed 
that it may, it can only be by service to the God of the land, who is 
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master. That is definitely decreed. 

AN APPEAL TO CITIZENS TO UPHOLD THE LAW 

I appeal to good people everywhere, not to any political party, not 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to any particular church, but to all people, to use their influence to 
bring to pass righteousness in the administration of the civil affairs of 
our country, and I make this appeal to both the church and the state, 
for both need it. Do men preach righteousness who themselves violate 
the civil law? Ask the preachers of today for the answer. Do men 
standing in high places in governmental affairs violate the law? Go 
back to Washington and investigate. How can we expect, as this states- 
man from whom the president has quoted, asks, that the common people, 
one of whom I am, who look to their leaders for example, shall honor 
and obey the law when they see it constantly violated in higher callings 
of life? Violation of the law is an evil under any circumstance, but 
when the law is violated by people who are chosen to maintain and 
administer it,' it becomes a double offense in the sight of God and man, 
because a man not only becomes a violater of the law, but he breaks the 
trust placed in him, the trust which his fellow citizens have reposed 
in him and which he has sworn to discharge. He thus becomes doubly . 
guilty. 

nation's salvation rests with its citizens 

My brethren and sisters, I shall not prolong my remarks. We leave 
this question with you. We want you to understand that the salvation 
of this nation rests in the hands of its citizens, not in the hands of 
those who control, its civil affairs at present, but those who hold the 
franchise, and are to exercise it in the future. It appears to me that if 
the importance of this were understood, greater care would be exercised 
in the selection of men for public office. 

There are enough of such men, and to spare, to administer our 
public affairs. There are good men, honest men, in all political parties, 
and associated with all churches, and many who are allied with neither 
party or church. I do not appeal to any particular group of people, but 
to Christian people the world over. 

TEACH AND PRACTICE PURITY OF LIFE 

I appeal to you to teach and practice righteousness and purity of life. 

Do you know what those Indians to whom I have referred would 
do with a woman who violated the law of chastity ? They would split 
her ears, and cut her hair in a maimer that she would be recognized 
for what she is, wherever she went. They would never allow her to 
marry in the tribe again, and the man who would be guilty of offences 
such as are almost daily committed in our communities, would be 
put to death. It may have been a barbarous law, but it kept those people 
free from the sin of immorality, until they were corrupted by the white 
man who came among them and introduced his more civilized mode of 
life. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. May his spirit be with us 
during the meetings of this conference.

PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH WHAT IT STANDS FOR 

The report made by the President indicates to you that the Church 
is developing ; it is progressing. Word comes to us from one of the mis- 
sions of the United States that more than fourteen thousand copies of 
the Book of Mormon have been distributed by the Elders of the Church 
in that mission during the present year. It is a wonderful thing. It is a 
wonderful achievement, indicating that the people of the United States 
are becoming interested. They are beginning to understand the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, what it stands for, what it lives 
for, and what\it is willing to die for to the last man if necessary. The 
constitutional law which God has given us for our guidance, has made 
us, through observance of it, the dominant nation of the world today. 
I pray for God's blessings upon the government, its president, its 
legislators, upon the state government, its governor and its officers who 
have been chosen ; those who seek to administer the law in righteousness. 
May God bless and give them success, I pray, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

A solo, "The Lord is mindful of his own," was sung by Mrs. 
Jesse Morley. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiarit for cour- 
age, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all — they were 
men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted. 

"Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for theyi had been taught to 
keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him." — Alma 53 :20, 

THE MISSION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS . 

The mission of the Latter-day Saints may be considered in two 
great aspects ; one, the proclamation to the world of the restoration of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ — the declaration to all mankind that God 
the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared in this dispensation to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. That in itself is a wonderful message. 

There are in this audience sixty-two missionaries who are prepar- 
ing to go abroad to give this proclamation. They are but representa- 
tives of two thousand others who, paying their own expenses, are 
abroad in the world declaring in all rsincerity that God, as a /loving 
Father, ever mindful of the children of men, has revealed the means 
whereby mankind can return to his presence. That is one important 
phase or mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The other great purpose of the Church is to translate truth into 
a better social order, or in other words, to make our religion effective 
in the individual lives of men, and in improving social conditions. It 
is the second aspect to which I wish to call attention this morning. 

I have read from the fifty-third chapter of Alma, which gives an 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



account of young men who were exceedingly valiant for courage, for 
strength, and activity — men who were true at all times in whatsoever 
thing they were entrusted. Who were these young men? They were 
sons of parents who were equally true to every trust. Their parents 
were converted Lamanites who, when the Spirit of God came upon 
them, devoted their lives to the service of their fellow men, and in their 
ministry in the Church covenanted that they would never more take 
up arms against their brethren, never more go to war. Such was their 
oath ; such was their covenant; and they were true to it even unto death. 

A MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE 

One of .the most beautiful .pictures given in all literature is the 
picture of these parents going out to meet enemies who came against 
them with swords, and sacrificing their lives rather than to uncover 
the swords they had buried and given their word not to' unearth. One 
thousand of these parents suffered death rather than violate their 
covenant. Meeting no resistance, the enemy, being conscience-stricken, 
stopped the massacre, after a thousand men had proved that they pre- 
ferred death to the violation of a trust. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTHOOD 

I mention this because parenthood has much to do in inculcating 
courage and trustworthiness in children. The law of cause and effect 
is working in parenthood as it is in any other law of nature. There is a 
responsibility upon all, and especially upon fathers and mothers, to set 
examples to children and young people worthy of imitation. Parents 
must be sincere in upholding law and upholding the priesthood in their 
homes, that children may see a proper example. Respect for law and 
order, as charity, begins at home. 

These young men were true to every trust. They were men of 
integrity. I cannot think of anything which will contribute more to 
the establishing of law and order than for each individual to cherish 
integrity and honesty in his or her heart. Integrity, honesty — the 
Latter-day Saints stand for these fundathental principles. They are 
generally noted for their integrity and honesty, and it is with sorrow 
we receive the word, whenever it comes through the press or by voice, 
that one of the Latter-day Saints has failed in his obligation to trust. 

THE VALUE OF INTEGRITY 

I remember with what pride I listened to a conversation over the 
telephone in one of our stakes. The president was called from the 
dining table to the telephone. His part of the conversation I heard, 
and I can give both. The gentleman at the other end, no;t a member 
of the Church, was a real estate man. He had in his office a man who 
was making a purchase but who could not pay the entire sum for the 
property. The purchaser claimed to be a member of this Church, and 
the real estate dealer called up the president of the stake to confirm 
this statement. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY

"Do you know," said the realtor, "Mr. Blank?" 

"Yes," said the president. 

"Is he a member of your Church?" 

"He is." 

"Is he in good standing?" 
"Yes," replied the president. 

"Thank you," said the real estate dealer. "He is here to make a 
loan. If he is a member of your Church in good standing I will 
trust him." 

Integrity, the first principle of success. "Give us the man of in- 
tegrity, on whom we know we can thoroughly depend, who will -stand 
firm when others fail, the friend faithful and true, the adviser, honest 
and fearless, the adversary, just and chivalrous ; such a one is a frag- 
ment of the rock of ages." Integrity is the first step to true greatness. 
Men love to praise, but are slow to practice, integrity. To maintain it 
in high places costs self-denial. In all places it is liable to opposition, 
but its end is glorious, and the universe will yet do it homage. "A man 
of integrity will never listen to any plea against conscience." 

MR. BABSON J S COMMENT 

Many of you are familiar with a comment on this fundamental 
principle by Mr. Roger W. Babson, the great statistician : 

"The things which we look upon as of great value: the stocks, bonds, bank- 
books, deeds, mortgages, insurance policies, etc., are merely nothing. While 51 
per cent of the people have their eyes on the goal of Integrity, our investments 
are secure ; but with 51 per cent of thepi headed in the wrong direction, our 
investments are valueless. So the first fundamental of prosperity is integrity. 
Without it there is no civilization, there is no peace, there is no security, there 
is no safety. Mind you, also, that this applies just as much to the man! who is 
working for wages as to the capitalist and every owner of property. 

"Integrity, however, applies to many more things than money. Integrity 
requires the seeking after, as well as the dispensing of, the truth. It was this 
desire for truth which founded our educational institutions, our sciences and our 
arts. All the great professions, from medicine to engineering, rest upon! this 
spirit of integrity. Only as they so rest, can they prosper or even survive. 

"Integrity is the mother of knowledge. The desire for truth is the basis 
for all learning, the value of all experience and the reason for all study and 
investigation. Without integrity as a basis, our entire educational system would 
fall to the ground ; all newspapers and magazines would become sources of 
great danger, and the publication of books would have to be suppressed. Our 
whole civilization rests upon the assumption that people are honest. With this 
confidence shaken, the structure falls. And it should fall, for unless the truth 
should be taught, the nation would be much better off without its schools, news- 
papers, books and professions. Better have no gun at all, than one aimed at 
yourself. .The cornerstone of prosperity is the stone of Integrity." 

George Washington, the father of our country, said : 

"I hope I shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what 
I consider to be the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man." 

THE APPLICATION 

Now, the application of this thought. In addition to what we have 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



heard this morning from the President, I would like to read this from 
the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"We believe that governments were instituted of God for the -benefit of 
man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, 
both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society. 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magis- 
trates to enforce the laws of the saime; and that such as will administer the 
law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the 
people." 

No Latter-day Saint can be true to his country, true to his Church, 
true to his God, who will violate these laws which relate to 1 the moral 
welfare and the spiritual advancement of mankind. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS MUST UPHOLD THE LAW 

There is much being said now about the law prohibiting the manu- 
facture and sale of liquor. Latter-day Saints should uphold that law 
everywhere, at socials, at banquets. Civil officers, members of clubs, 
who are contributing to the formation of public opinion ought to be 
proud to uphold that law. It is a constitutional law, and it is time that 
the leaders of this country, the politicians, the statesmen, the leaders in 
civic affairs in the state and in the cities should so speak of this law, 
so act towards it, that public sentiment would be turned in favor of its 
enforcement. Latter-day Saints, we are expected to uphold it and to 
uphold every other law which contributes to the advancement and peace 
of mankind. And these laws against the manufacture and sale of in- 
toxicating liquors are such laws, and our conditions now in society, 
with millions of automobiles, the drivers of which must be at their 
very best, active mentally, quick to respond physically in emergency, 
make it necessary that we eliminate from society anything that will be- 
cloud the brain or leave the driver's hand unsteady. We are living 
in a condition in which we cannot with impunity foster traffic in intoxi- 
cating liquors. God said long ago that they were not good for man. 
Our boys and girls, from the standpoint of integrity and consistency, 
should take a stand against the use thereof. 

TRANSLATE OUR RELIGION INTO PERFECT SOCIAL CONDITIONS 

All should take pride in making "Mormonism" a synonym for 
trustworthiness, temperance, chastity, honesty, justice — these are funda- 
mental principles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and by exemplifying them in our lives we contribute to the transfor- 
mation of society, we translate our religion into better social condi- 
tions and bring salvation and peace to men here and now. 

May our Father in heaven guide and protect the missionaries who 
are out proclaiming the restoration of the gospel. May he bless Israel 
here at home, who, through faithfulness, will contribute to an im- 
proved social order. May it be recorded also of our young men : 
They are men of truth and soberness — men who are true at all times 
in whatsoever thing they are entrusted, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I have been much impressed, my brethren and sisters, with the 
instructions given to us this morning. I realized while listening to 
the remarks and instructions that in what has been said there is inspira- 
tion for many sermons. I would like to discuss for a moment the 
statement contained in the Doctrine and Covenants to the effect that 
there is "a law irrevocably decreed, in heaven, before the foundations 
of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated, ,and when we 
obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which 
it is predicated." In effect, as I understand it, this means that obedi- 
ence to principle and law brings blessings. Conversely, we may say 
that disobedience to principle and law will fail to produce desired 
results. 

I am impressed with the statement made by Brother David O. 
McKay with regard to the matter of integrity. This great fundamental 
characteristic is too often lacking among mankind. Some years ago 
one of the great national engineering societies, composed of many 
thousands of members, sent out a questionnaire to these various men 
throughout the country, asking them to indicate the requisites to suc- 
cess in engineering work. The result of that questionnaire was in 
some respects rather surprising. Instead of specifying the first requi- 
site as technical skill and knowledge, the statement generally made 
was that the first requisite is character and integrity, and that other 
things should follow. I am sure that that characteristic is recognized 
as being most important for the welfare and lasting success of men 
everywhere. There are conditions prevailing, as has been stated today, 
that require the development of integrity and stability among the people 
of the United States and of the world generally. 

To produce the greatest results in this direction it will invp^ve 
thorough training of young people. Theodore Roosevelt declared, in 
speaking of the development of boys, that "if you are going to do any- 
thing permanent for the average man, you have got to begin before 
he is a man. The chances of success lie in working with the boy and- 
not the man." I think it was Henry VanDyke who stated that few 
men over twenty-five years of age change their habits of thought and 
action. I do not believe that to be entirely the case, although it is' 
probably true in mo^t instances. 

In my own experience in the gospel of Jesus Christ, I' know that 
the Lord has power to and does change men's hearts and their desires 
and determination when they are much older. This occurs when they 
are brought to a condition of repentance, through an understanding 
of the fact that the things they are doing are not in conformity with his 
laws. No matter what their age may be they can repent and change 
entirely their habits and course of action, and their desires and deter- 
mination. If time would permit, experiences could be related indi- 
cating such changes which have entirely altered the course of life of 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

men in the world who have come to a knowledge and acceptance of 
the principles of the gospel. 

It being the case that character and integrity are recognized gener- 
ally as a prime requisite to supcess and progress, I am sure that the 
principles of the gospel which we have espoused, if they were observed 
by the people of the world generally, would develop these very quali- 
ties in them. I appreciate the fact that olbedience to the principles of 
the gospel requires will power, and will power is developed through 
integrity. So that, in a sense, the observance of these principles re- 
quires integrity, and also produces integrity. That is true with regard 
to every principle of the gospel. 

So far as the Word of Wisdom is concerned we realize that, as 
the Lord has said, those who observe this principle and endeavor to 
live in accordance with the spirit of it will receive blessings — temporal 
and spiritual blessings. They develop physically, mentally and spir- 
itually, and as they do so they develop their will power to resist the 
things that are contrary to the desires of the Lord and their own well- 
being. 

If time permitted we could discuss at some length the benefits 
that come from observance of the Word of Wisdom, and the bad 
results that come from the lack of observance of that principle. Medical 
authorities are agreed that the use of cigarettes is harmful, that it 
tends to weaken the moral fiber of men and women, and that in addi- 
tion thereto the use of cigarettes by women not only weakens their 
moral vitality, but also interferes with the functions of motherhood 
and the welfare of their children. Shall it be said that those who use 
cigarettes are morally unfit, or that they are not living in accordance 
with moral principles? I will not say that, but I do say that they are 
able to maintain their morals in spite of, rather than because of, the 
use of cigarettes and tobacco. I realize the fact, and I believe it is 
recognized, that those who do use tobacco are weakened thereby, and 
any success they enjoy is in spite of the fart that they use it. This is 
just as true of the use of liquor and narcotics, which injuriously affect 
the moral stamina as well as the physical body. 

Some time ago the claim was made to me by a man who is giving 
his main efforts toward money-making, that the most successful men 
of today in the business world are using liquor notwithstanding it is 
contrary to law. At random I have noted the statements made by vari- 
ous men of prominence relative thereto. I would like to show the atti- 
tude of such men, some of whom did not use liquor even when it 
was not against the law. 

Richard Washburn Child said of Theodore Roosevelt that in years 
of intimate acquaintance he never knew him to take any stimulant other 
than hot milk. Henry Ford is strongly against the use of liquor, and 
does not even allow smoking by his men. Tom Mix, the noted movie 
artist, does not smoke or drink. Calvin Coolidge is opposed to the 
use of liquor. Mussolini,' the great Italian dictator, says, "I abstain 
rigidly from all kinds of alcoholic beverages, even from the lightest 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



17 



wines." Also, he says, "Coffee is never served me at any meal. It is 
a stimulant, compelling by its action a useless nervous effort, resulting 
in no concrete good." Charlie Chaplin, the noted movie comedian, says 
he does not use liquor. It is further stated that once in a while he uses 
a cigarette, but without enthusiasm. 

The result of the observance of the Word of Wisdom is that it 
develops integrity and character in men and women. Whether they 
acknowledge that these principles have been given of the Lord, or 
whether they accept them as coming from medical science, the observ- 
ance of the same makes for their welfare. From whatever source or 
idea they gain the conviction, it is for their benefit if they observe it ; 
and, if they fail, it is for their injury. In like manner every principle 
of the gospel brings its own blessing. 

Now, of course, as Latter-day Saints we realize that the thing the 
Lord desires of us is that we should observe his commandments be- 
cause we love him and because we recognize in him the fulness of 
wisdom. Yet, while we accept these things as coming from the Lord, 
we also gain understanding of the reasons why they are for our blessing. 

The principle of tithing is for many people a difficult one to ob- 
serve. Yet there are many people outside of this Church who, while 
not recognizing any direct revelation from the Lord for the observ- 
ance of the principle, read the Bible and find that in early times this 
principle was observed. Therefore, they are undertaking to live it. 
/ They call themselves tithers, and are faithful in the observance of that 
principle. Not-long since there was a man in my office from the East — 
a Presbyterian — and we were discussing the principle of tithing. He 
stated that anyone who would observe the principle of tithes, would 
find that nine-tenths of his income would go as far as the ten would 
otherwise go. It seems from an economic standpoint a difficult thing 
to understand and appreciate, and yet that is the testimony of many 
people. 

I would like to relate to you briefly an instance that occurred in 
a ward in one of the stakes in Canada. Some years ago the people were 
in a critical financial condition because of the failure of crops. At 
that time a special tithing campaign was inaugurated and the people 
were encouraged to fully obey this principle. From that time, about 
five years ago, up to the present they have continued to suffer at least 
partial losses of their crops. Some of the people moved away, mainly 
non-members of the Church. But the members of the ward under- 
took faithfully to live the principle of tithing, and as evidence of that 
it is shown that in the six months' report for this year, 90 per cent 
of those who should observe the principle of tithing had observed it. 

What is the result? In spite of the fact that crop conditions and 
climatic conditions have not been entirely favorable ; in spite of the fact 
that at the time they were financially embarrassed, the people have been 
blessed and prospered. They have practically gotten out of debt, they 
have become more united, their attendance at meetings is remarkable, 
and the activities of the ward are unusual. They are living the prin- 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ciples of the gospel. They have been relieved of their obligations. They 
have learned how to do things, they have brought in dairy cows, sheep 
and hogs, and have learned to manufacture the raw materials of the 
farm into products that will sell profitably. The result is that they are 
in a position to go forward, and they are now building a meeting-house 
which they expect will be paid for within a year. A little ward of 
that kind, under the most unfavorable conditions, through renewing 
their covenants and observing this principle, have gained financial bless- 
ings. More than that, they have gained spiritual blessings which come 
through the observance of it. And so the blessing comes to every one 
of us according to the way we live it. 

I am convinced of the fact that the principle of tithing is a prin- 
ciple of blessing, spiritually first, financially second, and that it offers 
opportunity to relieve ourselves of obligations that may press upon us, 
and will increase our progress and growth in the gospel and in life. 
I know that it develops in every one that obeys it the qualities of integrity 
and determination to be worthy of the trust that is placed in us, so 
that our word shall he as good as our bond. I know that the observ- 
ance of this principle will bring us up to that standard. . 

It is the same with regard to the principle of fasting and fast offer- 
ings. The Lord declared many years ago through his servants that the 
Latter-day Saints should observe fasting. The Savior in his day 
taught this principle. Those who observe that principle are /physically 
stronger and better off, the digestive system has the opportunity to 
rest and to gain strength and vigor to be able to carry on its func- 
tions. Some of the worst diseases of the people of the United States 
today are due to digestive troubles through overeating. The principle 
of fasting, properly observed, will help us to enjoy greater vitality. It 
will also help us to develop increased will p'ower and determination, to 
overcome and to resist the temptations which come to us in life, and 
it will develop in us the spirit of sympathy and consideration for our 
fellowmen. And so, the observance of this principle will bring the 
blessings which we desire to enjoy and which we need to enable us 
to become better men and women. 

In like manner the observance of the principle of prayer yields 
remarkable blessings. It is a principle that is being neglected very 
seriously throughout the world today by many people who have gotten 
away from the love of God and faith in him. This principle, drawing 
one to the Lord in humility, and in faith, asking him for the things 
we desire, and giving him gratitude and praise for his blessings to us, 
is a source of strength and power that will enable us to overcome our 
weaknesses, and develop in us faith and determination to do right. ' 

I do not feel that I ought to take more time, my brethren and 
sisters. I desire to testify to you that the observance of these principles 
will bring blessings to men that will develop in them integrity and 
uprightness, initiative, faith, and ability to stand against all the winds 
of contrary doctrine, or of temptation or trial. Observance of these 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



19 



principles will enable us to go forward and live in humility in accord- 
ance with the will of the Lord. 

May the Lord bless us that we may train the young men and 
women especially, that they may be qualified and developed in the 
observance of these things, and thereby become men and women of 
integrity, in order that the next generation shall be able to carry on 
every phase of activity in the most effective way, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

Senior President of the First Council of Seventy 

I call yo^ur attention, my brethren and sisters, to what is desig- 
nated as our Twelfth Article of Faith, which reads : 

"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magis- 
trates ; in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law." 

I think by reading this Article of Faith as a text I shall be able 
in my thinking to be in harmony with the spirit of this meeting by* 
reason of what our president has said, and this meeting may be the 
dominating influence of the entire conference. 

On my way home from the East recently, when passing through 
Scranton, Pennsylvania, I picked up the current paper of that day, and in 
it was a statement from the census returns of the United States, taken 
from the Census Bureau, Washington, that crime was increasing, in pro- 
portion, faster than the growth of our population, according to the in- 
crease of persons sent to prison. Complete returns from thirty-one 
states, covering fifty-eight of a total of ninety-nine state prisons and 
reformatories, listed 27,018 new prisoners received by these institu- 
tions in 1926, as compared with 21,054 in 1923, the firsjt prison census 
year in this country, or an increase of 28.3 per cent. There were 34.1 
prisoners for 100,000 population jailed last year, as against 27.9 in 1923. 

Then as we came through Denver, I picked up the Rocky Moun- 
tain News,- and in it found a column devoted to crime and its increase. 
I do not have time to read it, but it would be very enlightening to do 
so. It would, however, occupy too much time. Let it be sufficient to 
say that the writer of that special column traced the crime of our coun- 
try from the highest stations in political life, from those who had been 
found guilty of crime in the President's cabinet, through governors of 
states and mayors of cities, down to the lowly stations in life. It con- 
stitutes a rather severe arraignment of the present status of the United 
States in the matter of law observance. One statement was to the 
effect that according to General Lincoln C. Andrews, former Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury, there are no less than 40,000,000 drinkers in 
this prohibition country, and "home-brew is becoming a nation-wide 
enterprise." ( ; 

And so throughout in the column he discusses the question of 
violation of law and the increase of the volume of it. 

Then, on the evening that I arrived home, I chanced to pick up 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a Salt Lake paper, and noticed that the Chief of Police in our city 
was calling attention to "special juvenile delinquencies" in the city, and 
giving special instructions to the police officers of the city to under- 
take the arrest of the development of this species of crime. In that 
article there is a list running through crimes of four days that makes 
the heart sick, crimes committed upon juveniles, and crimes by juve- 
niles, that no man can read, I am sure, and not be moved by sorrow at 
the spectacle it represents. 

You will see that coming in contact with these incidents, through 
the public press, on my way home, and just upon my arrival here, 
brought me in contact with, and reminded me of, the subject that has 
been under discussion for the last thirty years in this country by pub- 
licists, by statesmen, jurists, and various institutions that stand for law 
and order. 

. I have been interesting myself in this subject for some length of 
time. I happened to come upon some notes since arriving home wherein 
I found a discourse delivered by myself in this tabernacle, in 1924, in 
which I set forth, after elaborate statistical investigations, the support- 
ing evidence for a statement which had been made by Chief Justice 
Taft, in 1908, before the Bar Association in New York, to the effect 
that "the administration of law in our country was a disgrace to civiliza- 
tion." There was much disputation that arose over that statement, 
which led me to an investigation with," to me, startling results, only to 
be convinced that our Chief Justice was within the truth in making 
that very strong statement. 

We cannot go into statistics in relation to this subject now, 
but you will be interested in hearing this quotation from the words of 
Judge Alfred Talley, of the Court of General Sessions of New York, 
when introducing into office a new jurist a year or two ago. He said 
to him in giving him his charge : 

"One of the things that you will come to learn is that you have come to the 
bench of the greatest criminal court in the world, and the oldest court of any 
kind in the United States, at a time when this country is suffering under an 
indictment which proclaims it to be the most lawless on earth. You will find 
that the United States must plead guilty to that indictment. Most of the 
desperate criminals are mere boys." 

And that I think is one of the tragical things connected with the 
growth of crime, that its increase is chiefly among the youth of the land. 
Judge Talley continued: 

"You will be heartbroken at discovering that the vast majority of defendants 
are under nineteen or twenty years old, and that is going to be your distressing 
problem." 

Another statement I want to read to you is an excerpt from the 
report of the Commission of Law Enforcement, presented to a meet- 
ing of the American Bar Association in San Francisco, several years 
ago ; and the conditions have not changed since then, only to grow worse. 
This is the statement : 

"Crime and lawlessness in the United States have been steadily on the in- 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



■21 



crease and out of proportion to pur growth, and there has been a steady and 
growing disrespect for law in our nation. This is not a result of the war." 

You know we are disposed to blame pretty much all of this spirit 
of lawlessness to the effect of the great World War. But this authority 
denies that and offers this in proof: 

"We do not find the proportional increase in crime from 1916 to 1922 greater 
than from 1910 to 1916, (That is the year before we went into the War) and 
we have not been able to discover that crimes of violence have materially increased 
in France, in England or Canada during or since the War, although the effect of 
the War naturally must be more marked in those countries." 

There is much more that might be said in evidence of this, but 
perhaps it is unprofitable, and impossible at least, for me now to discuss 
the obvious. The testimonials are so overwhelming, the crowd of wit- 
nesses is so great that as American citizens we are face to face with 
the fact that in our country we are Kving in an age of lawlessness; aind 
therefore I deem it important that for ourselves and for the world, 
as far as we can reach them by proclamation, it should be known that 
in these mountains, in the Church of Jesus Christ, stands a people 
pledged to the support of law and of order, and I think Latter-day 
Saints no less than the world ought to have their attention called to 
that important truth. 

Many reasons crowd in upon our attention that are interwoven 
with this great theme, the keynote of which President Grant has struck 
in his opening remarks this morning. 

I shall only take time to note here one, ,but that one represents 
a great contributing cause of the growth and increase of lawlessness 
in our country. It arises from the uncertainty in the execution of the 
law. Perhaps in the foundation of our government, in establishing 
the constitution of our country and our state constitutions, the people 
of that generation had been under the iron heel of oppressive govern- 
ments so long, that they became extremely anxious to protect the indi- 
vidual against encroachments of tyrannical administration of law, and 
therefore over-emphasized the rights of the individual and the protec- 
tion of those rights, and had less concern for the larger rights and the 
protection of society from criminals. In this spirit the legislation has 
run in our states and in our nation, viz : to safeguard and to provide 
every possible means for the protection of the rights of those who are 
accused of crimes. And these laws, favoring so strongly the criminal, 
have been so used by skilful attorneys for the defense, that the adminis- 
tration of law has become a science for protecting the criminal from 
the just judgment and punishment of his crimes. 

We have a very prominent case in mind now and of recent occur- 
rence that illustrates this point. iSix years ago two men were con- 
victed under due process of law in the state of Massachusetts for shoot-

analysis of that case, of course. But they were found guilty. By the 
skill and cunning of lawyers for the defense, however, delays and 
appeals, based on exceptions to procedure, and in devious ways, the 
execution of the sentence was postponed from year to year. The radical 
element of the community organized for withstanding the execution 
of the law. They went on from one scheme to another, growing, it 
seemed to me, more desperate in their determination to thwart the 
law, and the execution of the sentence in pursuance thereof, and this 
for seven years from the time the crime was committed. Millions in 
the United States, aided and abetted by some of the foremost newspapers 
of the land, begged and pleaded for a mitigation of the sentence pro- * 
nounced by the court. Fortunately, as I view it — fortunately for the 
stability of the administration of the law — the state of Massachusetts 
withstood all these appeals, and at last the law was vindicated, not- 
withstanding its long delay. I was struck myself with the splendid 
answer that Governor Fuller made to the dramatic appeal of the wife 
and the sister respectively of these two condemned men. His answer 
was, and I believe it will become historic : 

"I am sorry. My duties are outlined by the law." 

Governor Fuller refused to interfere with the final execution of 
these sentenced men. 

We have in this case an illustration of one of the great defects of 
administration of law in the United States, that is, "the law's delay," 
and the uncertainty of punishment. Let that thing continue, and crimin- 
als will mock the law. 

A touch of divine wisdom comes into this question from the distant 
past. Solomon left on record this remarkable statement: "Because 
sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the 
heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." Eccl. 8 :11. The 
whole consensus of legal opinion upon this subject is to the effect that the 
uncertainty of the execution of the penalty encourages desperate men 
in crime. 

If it were in harmony with the feelings of the brethren — and I 
know nothing of what their feelings are on this subject — it seems to me 
that we could with propriety voice the sentiments of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this conference by a proper reso- 
lution making known this our great principle, announcing our convic- 
tion of duty in the sustaining of the law, by publishing this Article of our 
faith in such a resolution. It would be a proper occasion, in the face of 
these increasing crime waves, to let our country know where the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands upon this question. 

President Grant, I beg to venture one more thing, even if I tres- 
pass a little on your time. I cannot leave this subject without calling 
attention to an important declaration in the Book of Mormon, inci- 
dentally referred to by some of the brethren in their remarks this ' 
morning. They are the words of the Prophet Moroni. Hearken unto 
this, Latter-day Saints, and I would like to see this, too, coupled with the 
resolution to which I have referred, as the message of the American 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 23 

volume of scripture to the great Gentile nation that now is in control 
of this land, the U. S., and has great influence throughout the whole 
continent : 

"And he [God! had swSrn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that 
whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, 
should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the 
fulness of his wrath should come upon them. 

And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it 
is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or 
they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. 
And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. 

For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore 
he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the 
everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among 
the children of the land, that they are swept off." 

Now, mark you :' 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees 
of God — that ye may repent, and not "continue in your iniquities until the fulness 
come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as 
the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done." (Ether 2:9-12). 

Only three weeks ago, about now, I had the pleasure of standing 
upon the summit of the Hill Cumorah in company with President 
Grant. Being there upon that height of land, which so splendidly 
commands a view of the whole surrounding country, I could not refrain 
from recalling the time when Moroni stood upon the crown of that 
hill with the evidence of the ruins of the civilization of his people 
about him. And this warning, written in the Book of Ether, let me say, 
in closing, comes from the prophet of God who was also the historian of 
the great Jaredite nation, by abridging and translating their history into 
the Nephrite language. This warning comes, then, from the historian of 
one civilization that had perished about the Hill Cumorah ; it came also 
from the same man who was a witness of the destruction of the civiliza- 
tion of his own people at the same place. I hold that he was com- 
petent to speak upon this question, and it is most fitting, and 
is one of the evidences of inspiration, in this Book, that one 
so competent to speak in warning should be chosen to be God's 
mouthpiece in warning this great Gentile nation, holding dominion 
over the land in our day, to beware of their course lest they, too, forfeit 
their rights to the pride of place they occupy among the nations of the 
earth. For great as our nation is, it is not above the powers of destruc- 
tion if it observes not the conditions upon which it may hold its position 
upon this land. 

May the blessing of God so come to the Gentiles that they shall not 
share the fate of the nations that have preceded them, is my earnest 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Doxology." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Elmer E. Taylor, president 
of the Young stake of Zion. 

The meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

Promptly at 2 o'clock p. m., President Heber J. Grant opened 
the meeting by announcing that the choir and congregation would sing 
the hymn, "Do what is right." 

After the singing the opening prayer was offered by Elder W. 
Aird McDonald, president of the San Francisco stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "For the strength of the hills we 
bless thee." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE RELEASED AND ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

APPOINTED 

In announcing the changes that have taken place during the last 
six months I overlooked a most important change ; namely, Brother 
James E. Talmage, of the Council of the Twelve, has been honorably 
released, with his good wife, to return home, from presiding over the 
European mission, and Brother John A. Widtsoe and his wife will 
succeed them in presiding over the mission and the Relief Society in 
that great mission. We will now hear from Brother John A. Widtsoe. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters : President Grant has announced the call 
which has come to me, and I wish to say that it always has been a great 
privilege to me to serve in the work of the Master. I am glad to obey 
the request that has been made of me and shall go forth, with mine, to 
do the best we can in behalf of this high and holy cause. Like every 
other elder in Israel, called to serve, I feel humble and incapable, of 
my own strength, to accomplish the work that lies before me ; but I have, 
faith, I may say absolute faith, in the inspiration that guides this Church 
and kingdom, and I know that, throughout the ages, the Lord has made 
use of the weak things of the earth to accomplish mighty purposes. 
With that faith I go forth gladly at the request and call, and under the 
authority, of those who preside in Zion, with the prayer in my heart 
that good may come of the action taken. 

OUR OBLIGATION TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 

I recognize, with Elder McKay, who spoke briefly oh the subject 
this morning, that we are under obligation to preach the gospel to all 
the world. Every person must hear the truth ; every honest heart must 
be warned. It is our bounden duty, from which we may not and cannot 
escape, to do this work. Throughout the world there are hosts of 
honest hearts who love and seek the truth, but who are so hedged about 
by the traditions of their fathers and by the conditions of their lives, 
that they find it difficult to recognize the truth when it is placed before 
them. It is not only a privilege to attempt to break down this barrier 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



25 



which stands between truth and untruth, but it is also a solemn obliga- 
tion and a heavy responsibility. Many years ago in the days of my early 
boyhood I came out of the European countries, into this blessed land, 
blessed above all other lands, to live here. As my memory goes back 
to my mother country, and later to the days I spent in the European 
countries in my early manhood, as a student, I feel that there are in 
those countries a very great number, perhaps untold hosts of men and 
women, children of God, honest souls, whom we may reach if the Lord 
will but assist us in our labors. 

GOD OVERRULES ALL THINGS FOR HIS PURPOSES 

I was impressed this morning by the remarks made by President 
Ivins, that throughout all the ages of history the hand of God has over- 
ruled the actions of mankind, that nothing is done except as the Lord 
may use it for the accomplishment of his mighty purposes. No truth 
has become more living in my soul throughout my life than this. I have 
little belief in chance, little belief that things happen just because we, 
often stupid people, do certain work in our blindness. The things accom- 
plished by humanity become in the end God's accomplishments, as he 
makes use of them in working out his infinite purposes. So, with respect 
to this great missionary activity to which we have devoted so much 
of our strength from the beginning of this dispensation, I cannot help 
but believe that the mighty changes that have come in this latest day 
of civilization, the vast physical, economic and social changes, have all 
been brought about through the goodness of the Lord for the accomplish- 
ment of his latter-day work. The printing press came into existence, 
and by it the Word of God has been brought to all people. Then in this 
day, when the Lord has restored the gifts and blessings of the gospel 
and the organization of the Church, have come other marvelous means 
by which we may speak the eternal truth in our keeping to all the world. 
The steamship came'that we might carry the truth from continent to con- 
tinent, across the great oc'eans ; the railway that we might deliver the 
sarne everlasting truth to every part of every land ; the telephone and 
the telegraph, and now the radio, that we might spread, the truth of 
the gospel over all the world. In time we shall be able to utilize all 
these agencies to bear our witness to the peoples of the world, that we 
may stand free from blame before our Maker in the last great day. 

THE SPIRIT OF GOD THE STRENGTH OF ZION 

The spirit of God is upon the face of the earth ; it enters the hearts 
of men. That spirit tempers human acts, and impels humanity to actions 
of righteousness. That same spirit serves as a powerful preparatory 
agent for us in our gospel labors. In fact, the most important thing 
for every person engaged in this great latter-day work is that we do 
rely upon the assistance of the Spirit of God. No man can safely stand 
in his own strength in the holy labor assigned to us, but we must stand 
before our daily duty with the knowledge that the Spirit of God is within 
our reach to assist us, to bless us and to carry us on in our labors,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OBEDIENCE TO THE GOSPEL WILL SOLVE ALL DIFFICULTIES 

We were all deeply impressed this morning by the message of 
President Grant and of those who elaborated the thoughts in his opening 
address. This is indeed a day of wonderful blessings for humanity, 
but correspondingly great temptations. When much light is given, 
the contrasting darkness is also deep ; where there are our present im- 
measurable opportunities for service, there are also temptations to do 
evil such as never before has been known. This condition has existed 
in all ages. The battle between righteousness and wickedness has always 
been waged actively. It is our duty, our business as a chosen people, 
to teach righteousness and truth forever and forever to the world until 
the end shall come. When we teach righteousness, the key to our con- 
quest of evil will be the application of the few simple principles that 
constitute the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel is not a compli- 
cated system, but is simple and easily understood. It may be brought 
into the hearts of men ; it may be used in their daily lives ; and if we 
use the simple principles of the gospel in fighting wickedness and in 
establishing righteousness, our course will be well set and our success 
will be fairly promised. 

INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF "MORMONISM" MOST CONVINCING 

During the last few weeks I have been reading, with my brethren 
and sisters throughout the Church, the glorious book of doctrine known 
as the Book of Mormon, which came into the hands of the Prophet one 
hundred years ago. In that book we find over and over a repetition of 
the methods by which wickedness may be overcome ; for throughout 
that whole book runs the great message that, in the words of Alma, 
wickedness or sin is never happiness. The beginning of our teaching 
to those who tend to depart from righteousness is that out of 
unrighteousnass man may never win happiness, and happiness is the 
most fundamental and the choicest desire of humanity. 

In my reading of the Book of Mormon I am always reminded that 
the witness of the truth of this work — restored through the instrumen- 
tality of the Prophet Joseph Smith — lies within the \vork itself. One 
does not have to go into external places for proof, since within the 
work itself, within its doctrines and organization lies the most convinc- 
ing witness of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon itself, I have no 
doubt, within the next few years will be corroborated by all manner 
of discoveries. Men are digging in the earth ; things are found that 
we did not dream of a few years ago. A man voiced the opinion a 
few days ago — a visiting Englishman — that every new discovery in 
American archaeology tends to confirm the truth of the Book of Mor- 
mon. We shall use such finds and discoveries for the establishment in 
the hearts of seekers after truth, of the correctness of the Book of 
Mormon. Yet, within that book itself there lies in the history it tells, in 
the doctrines it sets forth, and in the pictures that it paints, the most 
convincing evidence of its truth. I have always felt that the best ap- 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



27 



proach to the gospel of Jesus Christ is through the study of the internal 
evidences, found within the Doctrine and Covenants and the Book of 
Mormon. 

ETERNAL VALUE OF THE BOOK OF MORMON 

There are only two kinds of books in the world. First, the kind 
that lasts for a -day, published by the tens of thousands, but have only 
a momentary existence, then pass away. The other kind of books are 
few in number, written and produced under the inspiration of divine 
power; they live on throughout the ages. They are the books that 
contain principles of eternal truth"; the doctrines that live and last, that 
satisfy the needs of humanity irrespective of time and age. They become 
the permanent possession of mankind and shape the destinies of man- 
kind. In the Book of Mormon we have just such a book, one which 
contains those eternal, true principles, that may be read upon all occa- 
sions, in all emergencies and in all ages. It belongs with the Bible to 
the class of everlasting writings. The religious classics of the world 
have survived the centuries, and have influenced the destinies of man- 
kind, because they contain perhaps a grain here and a grain there of 
such eternal truth. The Book of Mormon does not deal with trivial 
things, — the battles and contests, the conquests of the enemy and the 
treaties made, the many difficulties of history, form merely a back- 
ground against which the principles that really make the book are illus- 
trated. The teachings of the Book of Mormon appear against a narrative 
of historical events, but the events are of little consequence in comparison 
with the lessons that are taught for man's guidance in any day. 

KEYS TO SOLVE OUR PRESENT PROBLEMS 

Keys to the solution of the difficult problems that were dis- 
cussed this morning — none more difficult in the course of history — - 
are found in the Book of Mormon in a few simple teachings that are 1 
presented over and over again. First, there is constant teaching against 
atheism and all unbelief, and for belief in the existence of God and his 
son Jesus Christ, and - that a definite plan has been proposed by God our 
heavenly Father, for the salvation of his children. I am not so certain 
but that today the most dangerous enemy to truth is the feeling on the 
part of some men that they must dedicate their strength to destroy faith 
in God. Within the last two years, one of the great states of the Union 
has authorized by law the formation of an association for the advance- 
ment of atheism, an organization apparently supplied with ample funds, 
formed for the purpose of proving to the American nation that there 
is no God. We cannot solve our social or economic problems except 
upon the basis of faith in the existence of God and man's relationship 
to his Father in heaven. Therefore, we do not hesitate, as a people, 
to teach all the world faith in God, which by this time should be so 
much a part of man as the blood and bone and marrow of his physical 
organism. Out of the pages of Nephite days comes also the lesson 
that men dwindle in unbelief and become wicked and practice evil if 
they allow themselves to become unequal in their social and economic 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

relationships. This is a land of liberty, yet we are beginning, though we 
are founded upon the doctrine of equality, to have classes of the wealthy, 
the learned, the powerful, and of those who have neither power nor 
wealth nor station. This Church teaches the equality of humanity, that 
that Lord, loves all his children equally, if they but do his will ; that he 
reaches out for us all, and that the glorious destiny of a place near him is 
for all if we only make use of that which he has offered us. In this 
marvelous book there is a third warning, already discussed here. When 
men begin to defy the laws of the land and the laws of God — usually 
two aspects of the same inclination — when lawlessness grows and in- 
creases, then men and women begin to depart from the truth. Some 
will call themselves better than others in their own estimation ; their 
faith in God diminishes; soon they are overwhelmed by the difficulties 
that of necessity come to the disobedient,. and ultimately they will receive 
the terrible punishment quoted this morning by Brother Roberts from 
the Book of Mormon. 

TESTIMONY 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It is dear to me. It has helped me in 
times of joy and in times of sorrow. It has been like a great beacon light 
to guide me in all the affairs of my life, not merely in the Church, but 
in those beyond the Church, in matters of State and of private concern. 
I have found it possible to use the simple principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ for my upbuilding and strengthening, for bringing 
me into closer communion with the great unseen universe which, after 
all, is the great concern of everlasting life. I am grateful for the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. I am always thankful that missionaries were sent into 
my native land; grateful that my mother, throbbing with faith, had 
courage to receive the gospel and go into the waters of baptism, to 
leave her home and friends and relatives, and all her loved ones. I 
am grateful for the thousands of Latter-day Saints who have done 
likewise, who, either in person or by their children, make up this vast 
congregation. We are children of faithful and courageous parents, 
who have opened the door to us, and made clear to us the joy oif ac- 
cepting and living the eternal truth of God. This Church is the bearer 
of truth. God bless us, and make us steadfast in the truth. May we 
walk always according to our best light before our Father in heaven, 
I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In calling upon the Presidents of our United States missions, we 
would be very pleased to have them speak briefly and give us a little 
account of the condition of their missions. Inasmuch as we have over 
two thousand of our people in the mission field I am sure the Saints 
would be deeply interested in knowing the condition of the missions. 
We will ask Brother Rey L. Pratt to be the first mission president to 
speak ; 



i 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

ELDER REY L. PRATT " 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to he in attendance at this 
conference, and to report the condition of the mission over which I 
have "been called to preside. In the first place,' I am happy to say to 
the fathers and mothers of the missionaries in the Mexican mission 
that they are all enjoying at the present time good health; they are 
in splendid spirits. They manifest a determination to fill their mission 
in honor and to reach with their testimonies and teachings as many of 
our Father's children as lie in their power. 

You, my brethren and sisters, undoubtedly are acquainted with 
the fact that due to the present religious controversy in Mexico, and 
existing laws, it is impossible for our ministers or missionaries who 
are of foreign birth, that is, not Mexican citizens, to labor and officiate 
within the Republic of Mexico. Consequently we have been obliged 
to withdraw from that land all of our active missionaries from Zion. 
We are happy, however, in the fact that our local priesthood in some 
twenty odd branches in the Republic of Mexico are doing all that is 
possible to maintain the organizations of the branches, and to continue 
the holding of meetings and the administration of the gospel among 
that people. Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances existing in that 
country at this time, and the fact that so many missionaries, about 60 
per cent of the force that we ordinarily have, have been withdrawn, 
the people are doing remarkably well. They are faithful in attendance 
at meetings, and in payment of tithing. We are in constant communi- 
cation with them by letter, and their leaders manifest to us not only a 
belief in the principles of the gospel, but a knowledge that these prin- 
ciples are true. They pray for the return of the missionaries to that 
land, and a continuation of the preaching of the gospel among their 
people. ' 

It may be a revelation to some of you to know that there are great 
communities of Lamanite people of Mexican nationality, residing in 
the large cities of the south and southwestern parts of our country. 
In the city of Los Angeles alone it is estimated that there are between 
fifty and seventy-five thousand Mexican people living in sections of 
the city pretty much by themselves. In that city we have a remarkable 
work started and are making great progress. Your boys and ,girls who 
are down there in that mission are happy to he engaged in that work 
and find no difficulty in confining their labors to a people who speak 
a foreign language. They have acquired the language with remarkable 
success, and success is attending their labors. The same might be 
said in relation to other cities along the border. We have missionaries 
- in Mesa, Arizona, in Ray and other places around the great mining 
parts of Arizona. We have missionaries in Tucson ; we have mis- 
sionaries in Bisbee, and Douglas, also in Albuquerque and southern 
Colorado. They are doing a splendid work in El Paso, Texas. We have 
missionaries in Del Rio, San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, Eagle 
Pass, Laredo, and Brownsville, all in Texas. At a recent conference 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



held in the southeastern part of our mission at Laredo, at which Elder * 
Joseph Fielding Smith, of the Council of Twelve, was present, we 
were able to preach to a congregation of some two hundred and twenty 
people at some of our sessions. I remember to have gone to the same 
city only a few years ago, at which time I surveyed the situation, and 
there was not so much as one who had any sympathy for us within 
the confines of that city or surrounding country. I am proud to be 
identified with the missionary work there. I am proud of the young 
men and the young women who comprise our missionary force. I 
love the work of the Lord. I bear you my testimony that the gospel 
is true. 

And, my brethren and sisters, as I stand before you this after- 
noon, I make a plea for tolerance for the Lamanite people; they are 
our Father's covenant children. I have learned it more intimately than 
I ever knew it before, in the last twenty-one years of consecutive mis- 
sionary service among them. I was acquainted with them years before 
that, and, notwithstanding all that is said to the contrary in the press 
and "by people who might think very lightly before they speak, I have 
never been injured at their hands, nor have any of your boys or 
girls been injured at their hands. And although it may seem para- 
doxical to send a lady missionary among people who are so maligned, 
and expect her to get away unhurt, the chivalry of the Indians, spoken 
of by President Ivins this morning, is a safeguard even to your daugh- 
ters, and you need not fear for them even among the people of Mexico 
or the Lamanite people. There are underlying reasons why they fight, 
and I want to tell you that if I were suffering as they have suffered 
for four hundred years, I would be ashamed if I did not fight as they 
fight. There is wrong, of course, in the country, and it would take 
a long time to explain it to the satisfaction of the people as I under- 
stand it. I pray God that he will right the wrongs of that oppressed 
people, and that freedom and liberty and right and justice may come 
to them. I bespeak for them your sympathy and your love. Brethren 
and sisters, in the name of consistency, let us give them credit for being 
what they are, because through their fathers we truly have this great 
volume of scripture, this New Witness for God, the Book of Mormon, 
and it is replete with promises to them of a redemption, and an uplift 
from the conditions under which they labor. I lament, perhaps as 
much as anyone, the existing conditions in the Republic of Mexico, 
and all I can do is to' pray that right will triumph. I firmly believe 
that it will, and I wish that we could extend to them sympathy and 
the right kind of help which is not always condemnation. 

May the Lord help us to see the right and to do it, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER CHAS. A. CALLIS 

President of the {southern States Mission 

Brethren and sisters: When Elder David O. McKay was speak- 
ing this morning of the two thousand young Lamanites and their splen-

did mothers, I was led to reflect that in the Southern States mission 
there are young men and women who have these same qualities, and 
their fathers and mothers have the same devotion, and give the same 
counsel as did those noble Lamanite mothers. Today our elders go forth 
to encounter dangers that are more fatal, in a way, than the sword. 
These mothers in Zion are giving their children wonderful and soul- 
saving counsel that enables them to battle, with faith and in the might 
of God, the evils in the world. 

One day during the summer, while attending a conference in the 
most southerly part of the»mission, I offered the elders a week's rest 
because of the intense heat. I was a little surprised at the unwelcome 
spirit in which my offer was received. The district president spoke 
up and said : "Brother Callis, we would rather keep on working. We 
have the spirit of our work, and are afraid that we would lose it if 
we took a vacation." That is the spirit of the missionaries in the South. 
Deeply imbedded in their hearts is the glorious truth contained in 
the Book of Mormon, that when ye are in the service of your fellow- 
men, ye are in the service of your God. 

Through the kindness of the First Presidency an extensive build- 
ing program is being carried on. We are going to build a new chapel 
for the Catawba Indians. Never among any people have I witnessed 
more faith than among these people. The president of the branch 
certainly does not believe in race suicide, because he is the father of 
twenty-one children. We have built a neat little chapel for the Choc- 
taw Indians, and these people are receiving the gospel with joy. What 
a wonderful change is coming over the spirit of the people ! I suppose 
you will be inclined to wonder at the statement that fully 10 per cent 
of the missionaries in the South — and this is a conservative estimate — 
are the descendants of men and women who obeyed the gospel in the 
Southern states and migrated to the West. This is one proof of the 
vitality of "Mormonism." 

Only a few weeks ago we held a conference up in the mountains 
of East Tennessee. There were twenty-three members of the Church, 
including the elders, and from eight hundred to a thousand people, 
non-members, in attendance at our conference. There was not a note 
of discord — peace, good will, tolerance, prevailed. For this change 
I praise the Lord. I do not forget the labors of the elders in the early 
history of that mission, who suffered much tribulation to establish 
the foundation upon which we are now building. 

Consider the sterling qualities of these young men. It has been 
my sad duty to go to more than one of them and say: "My brother, 
I have received the sad news that your mother, or your father, is dead." 
These young men have wept, they have sorrowed, but the noble resolu- 
tion in them to continue in their mission was unshaken, and in the 
strength of God they have gone ahead with their missionary labors. 1 
Fathers and mothers have said: "Our crops are a partial failure, but 
we are willing to continue to sacrifice to keep ontr sons in the mis- 
sion field." Where would you go to find nobler faith than this? And 
this faith comes from a belief in the Book of Mormon and the other 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



standard Church works, and in the restored gospel. Surely such faith as 
that cannot be justly characterized as a base faith. I want to say to 
you parents that God will bless you for the sacrifice you are making 
to keep your sons and your daughters in the mission field. It is sacred 
in his sight, and you will share in the joy and the glory that comes to 
your sons and daughters through bringing souls unto God. I love the 
missionaries. It is an inspiration to be with them. I love their parents, 
the faith, and the Church which is the mother of men, for producing 
these fine characters and instilling in their hearts that unwavering 
faith that sends them into the mission field in the spirit of sacrifice 
and service, to proclaim the everlasting gospel to the world. 

I bear you my testimony that this gospel is the power of God 
unto salvation, that this Church is built upon the foundation of apos- 
tles and prophets; that it is being led today by divine revelation, and 
that these- young men and young women in the mission field enjoy the 
spirit of inspiration to help them in the districts where they labor, and 
God is with them. This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I take great pleasure, my brethren and sisters, in reporting to 
you the condition of the Central States, as far as our missionary work 
is concerned. I think no father or mother need have any fear con- 
cerning his or her sons or daughters who are engaged in this labor, 
for I doubt if there is any institution of learning in the country that 
will broaden and develop a young man or young woman more, or give 
them an experience that will compare with that obtained in the mis- 
sion field. 

Our missionaries are active ; young men and young women, going 
out with scarcely any experience, get ''right into the work with as much 
faith as you could expect them to have. My testimony to you is that 
the work of the Lord is growing in the hearts of the children of men, 
that the youth of Zion are not weakening by any means, but that they 
are growing stronger. We have some missionaries in the field without 
money and some with money. They are splendid young people and are 
not afraid of work. They go from early in the morning until late at 
night. : We do not have to urge them, but sometimes have to call a 
halt, especially among women missionaries who are so interested in 
their labors that they often work harder than their strength allows. 
But after all, they stand the test and seem to hold up their part of 
the work as favorably as the elders do, and frequently can go where 
an elder cannot go. They have many conversations among their 
own sex. 

Latter-day Saints are found in every nook and corner, almost, of 
the Central States mission — from Brownsville, Texas, to, the northern 
part of Missouri, and from Louisiana almost to El Paso, Texas — six

states. Little organizations are found almost in every county, and 
in many of the great cities. We ask the elders to hold meetings once 
a day if they possibly can, and that no night shall pass without their 
being in a cottage meeting, if possible, or in a street meeting, or in 
some of the halls or churches of that mission. Let me say again that 
nothing finer than the spirit of those young people can be found any- 
where in the world. They are faithful and true to their calling every 
day. They are not concerned with temporal matters, consequently 
they grow rich spiritually, and as a result of their time in the field, 
they become well acquainted with the gospel. I take great pleasure in 
saying to you, my brethren and sisters, that there has not come to me 
in my life any other joy or pleasure that has compared with this mis- 
sionary labor. ' , 

I know that the Latter-day Saints at home are doing a great work. 
Our work could not be done without the parents who sustain us in 
the mission field ; unless we are all united there cannot be success. 
I say to the missionaries frequently: Brethren and sisters, you. ought 
to do well, every father and mother, ^brother and sister and little child 
is praying for you daily, that you may be successful in the mission 
field, that the Lord will preserve you and that you may be able to 
reach the hearts of the children of men. 

We do not have enoughj missionaries. There are thousands 
of men and women who have not heard the gospel, and who 
will never : hear it unless we are able to reach them in some 
other way than by the present method. I do not know how 
it can be done unless through the radio, but there are hundreds and 
thousands of young men and young women growing to manhood and 
womanhood in the Central states, who have never seen a "Mormon" 
missionary. A way to reach them the Lord undoubtedly will arrange ; I 
know that he is at the helm. I am as sure as that I stand before you 
today that our Father who appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in the state of New York, in that Sacred Grove, and introduced his 
Son Jesus Christ, has never been very far away from the Church, and 
that Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, who appeared to the 
Prophet Joseph, has honored this Church and organized the destinies 
of it, and speaks through its leaders. I am just as sure of that as I 
am that I live. I want to go on record before the world in my testi- 
mony that the Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that he is with the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that his work is 
growing in "the earth and will continue to grow until the time comes 
for him to call a halt and say enough. No one knows when that time 
will be, excepting him who governs and rules and guides the destinies 
of the children of men according to their works. We have friends as 
well as enemies, but the Church does have many friends in the mis- 
sion field among those who are not members of it. 

We have had the opportunity this year of building three churches. 
President Grant was in pur mission a short time ago and dedicated 
three buildings in the state of Missouri.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We are celebrating at Independence, Missouri, this week, the cen- 
tennial of that city. It has been one hundred years since Independence 
was made a village. This Church is taking its part in the pageant, 
in the parade, in the contributions, in the printing and everything that 
is being done. We have been accorded all that is due us, and I take 
great pleasure in' saying to you that the Church has many friends in 
that section of the country, and the Spirit of the Lord is moving upon 
the hearts of the children of men, and his work will be accomplished 
in his own due time. 

I pray the Lord to bless us that we may honor his name continu- 
ally. I pray for those who are not of us, that they may listen to 
the elders whoi happen to come to their doors, and be led to glorify 
the Lord's name through baptism by his servants, and I do it in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

As I came onto the grounds to attend the meeting this afternoon, 
I met about a half dozen missionaries who had just returned from the 
Northern States mission. I observed them as they stood on the sidewalk, 
and thought, How splendidly these young fellows have developed in the 
mission field. They are a clean-looking set of fellows. They have 
done a remarkable work out in the world. Most of them have been 
district presidents ; and, because of the summer work, they remained 
in the mission field longer than the usual time in order that they might 
take their missionaries out into the country and show them the ad- 
vantages of traveling without purse or scrip, and placing their full 
reliance in God the eternal Father. I am grateful for the mission, 
because it results in wonderful progress with the missionaries ; and 
while some of our boys and girls may come into the field in the spirit 
of adventure, may think that it is the usual thing for boys and girls to 
do, I am quite certain and can bear testimony that they are not very 
long in the mission field before they realize the necessity of getting 
close to God the eternal Father, and of giving service in the great cause 
to which they have been called. Our missionaries are faithful, and they 
are doing a good \vork in traveling among the people. 

We have just finished our country campaign, and the missionaries 
have returned to their districts for the winter with the testimony that 
God has been with them and has blessed them wherever they have 
been. I sent a questionnaire to the missionaries to be answered and 
returned by them. One of the questions was : "How many times did 
you have to sleep out because of not receiving entertainment from the 
people?" It is remarkable how few times the missionaries have had 
to sleep out during' the country campaign. Their testimony has been 
that God has been good to them, and they came back with joy and 
happiness in their hearts because of God's mercy to them. 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR

The missionaries, on their return home, make the statement that 
the time spent on a mission was the best time of their lives, and often 
the younger people who had not had a similar experience might question 
the statement. But if they should have the same experience I am quite 
certain they would come back with the same testimony, that missionary 
life has been the best time of their lives. They do not mean good times, 
like we might have at parties ; they do not mean the good times that they 
might have at school ; they do not, mean that it has been a happier time 
than the very happy life that they have had in the home, which is the 
most sacred place the boy and girl can be ; but when they say that it has 
been the happiest time of their lives they mean that they have been 
closer to God the eternal Father than they have ever been before. It 
is because of service, it is because of doing things for God and his Son 
Jesus Christ that there comes into their souls that humility, that testi- 
mony, and that joy that is superior to all other joys that can come into 
one's life. 

We are very grateful to have in the Northern states mission such 
a splendid group of students as are attending the various universities 
located in Chicago and the surrounding cities. They are keeping their 
faith. We are proud of them because they can still find time— the 
majority of them — to come to Church and partake of the sacrament and 
attend the Sabbath school, that they may have their spirits renewed for 
the studies of the week. They are a wonderful help to the Church 
wherever they are, because of the strength of their testimony and their 
desire to be of service in the mission field while they are attending 
school. Our boys and girls who are in the Universities have things 
brought to their attention that might make them wonder at times, or 
might make them thing deeper and cause them to search deeper into the 
religion of God the eternal Father, and "Mormonism" as you search 
into it, gives an answer to most of the problems that come to the 
student or to the missionary. When they encounter a problem that 
cannot yet be solved to their satisfaction, they hold on to the faith 
of their fathers and their mothers, and are willing to serve God and 
wait until the time comes when the question can be answered by study 
and by the revelations of God. 1 

We are happy because of the Saints of the Northern states mission, 
because of their faithfulness and devotion to God's work. They are 
willing to go out on the street corner and give service and proclaim the 
gospel. I am sure God will bless them because of their devotion and 
desire to be of service in his great work in the mission field. 

May God bless this great work, and strengthen the missionaries as 
they go out into the field. May he bring them home, as these young 
fellows to whom I have referred have been brought home, clean and 
fine, and above all, with a testimony of the truthfulness of the restored 
gospel of Jesus Christ, is my prayer, in his name. Amen.

36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

President of the Western States Mission 

My brethren and sisters : It is a privilege to be present on this 
occasion and make a report of the work in the Western states mission. 
Conditions in all of the missions of the United States are quite similar, 
and all that has been said by the mission presidents who have spoken 
is equally true of the missionaries laboring in our mission. No finer 
group of young men and young woman can be found anywhere in the 
world. They are men and women of integrity and faith ; loyal and true 
to the covenants that they have made with God, undaunted and un- 
afraid they carry the gospel message to the people, manifesting in their 
lives the faith which has come to them through their obedience to the 
gospel and the call made of them to proclaim the message of salvation to 
the people of the world. The burden of their message is that God has 
spoken again to the world through a modern prophet. They have testified 
that God lives, that Jesus Christ is in reality the Son of the living God, 
the Redeemer of the world. They have borne witness to the divine mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the re-etsablishment of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ in the nineteenth century. We affirm that Joseph Smith 
came in the hour of the world's greatest need and was the instrument in 
the hands of God of restoring to the world the authority of the holy 
Priesthood which gave to men the right to act in the name of God and 
reveals every principle and ordinance necessary to the complete salvation 
of the human soul. 

We have laid down the gauntlet and declared that God is no 
respector of persons, that all men who repent of their sins and yield 
obedience to the ordinance of baptism and the laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost shall know of the doctrine whether it is of 
God or man. Hundreds have accepted the challenge and bear witness 
that they know the gospel, as we teach it, is true and the very power 
of God unto salvation, that doubt has been removed from their souls and 
a peace and joy they have never known before have come into their lives 
I am happy to report that all of the missionaries without exception are 
rendering meritorious service. 

The attitude of the people in the Western states mission towards 
our work is very much changed since first I went into that district 
to labor as a missionary — we are received in many places with open 
arms where a few years ago we could not get a hearing. Elders have been 
accorded the privileges of preaching in many churches and invitations 
have been extended to present our -message before some of the/ theological 
schools of our district. The press has been very friendly and accorded 
us much space in advertising our work. Many of the missionaries have 
traveled in the country districts without purse or scrip and have reported 
some wonderful and unusual experiences. I would relate just one 
circumstance: two of the elders laboring in the Denver district reported 
that while traveling without purse or scrip about one hundred miles east 
of the city, they sought entertainment for the night at quite a late 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



37 



hour. They were invited into a home. The man and his wife were the 
only members of the family and they had but one bed. These good 
people insisted that the elders should sleep in the bed while they slept 
upon the floor. The man who had thus entertained them was a pro- 
testant minister. He showed a real Christian spirit. Such entertainment 
is not usually accorded our missionaries. I am very grateful for the 
measure of success that is attending our efforts. The missionaries are 
imbued with the spirit of their work. They love it, and their greatest 
desire is that the people of the world might be impressed by their 
message. 

It is true that some of our missionaries are illy prepared when they 
come into ithe missions, but it requires only a, short time until they 
are able to present the gospel message to all with whom they come 
in contact. 

I was impressed with the counsel given by the President this 
morning advising the (Saints to search the scriptures, to read the Bible, 
The Book of Mormon, and become familiar with the revelations given 
to the Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith. If this is done in 
the homes, our missionaries will be better prepared to give a reason 
for 'the "hope that is within them when they arrive in the mission. 

We are making some progress in providing comfortable places for 
our members in which to worship. At the present time we are building 
two meetinghouses and one recreation hall. We have also purchased 
one chapel this year. 

I feel that I need not say more. I am happy to be engaged in this 
work. I know that it is of God. I bear testimony to its truth, and 
the influence that it is having upon the lives of men and women in the 
world is for good. God grant unto us the spirit of this work, that we 
may go forward in the performance of every duty that he requires at 
our hands, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

President of the Northcentral States Mission 

My brethren and sisters : I prize highly my standing among thi9 
people. I would rather have my standing in this Church than all the gold 
of Ophir. I would rather be where I am now, laboring in the ministry 
of our Lord, than in any other place that I kniow of. To labor with 
these young men and young women, to meet them in their weakness, 
when they arrive in the field, and then to watch them grow and in- 
crease in their power, is an inspiration that you cannot get anywhere 
else in the world. They undergo a wonderful transformation and a 
steady, constant growth. Some of the young men and young women 
who come into the field do not have a testimony of the gospel, but 
within a few short months they stand before the congregations of the 
world and bear witness, out of the abundance of their hearts, that they 
know the gospel of Jesus Christ is trn§.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Not so long ago at the close of one of our conferences, a young 
lady missionary only nineteen years of age who had just arrived in 
the field came back into the building as I left it. I found her weeping, 
and asked her what was the matter. She said : "Brother Allred, I 
do not believe that I can do this work. I just feel that I cannot do it." 
After talking with her a few moments, I laid my hands upon her head 
and blessed her and promised her that if she would put her attention 
to the work and trust in God, that God's pohver would come into 
her soul until her heart would be overflowing with a testimony of 
the work of God. Three weeks later I happened to be in that same 
district again, and I met this same girl standing on a street corner, 
bearing witness to the people that she knew the gospel as restored is 
true. In talking with her, she said : "Brother Allred, I have had 
more glory in the last three weeks than I have had before in all my 
life put together." What is the change which gives this joy? Where 
is the strength of this Church? Is it with these brethren on the stand? 
no. I will tell you, the strength of this Church lies in the testimony 
that God implants in the hearts of its members, and once that testi- 
mony is implanted in the heart of a boy or girl he or she will go 
through fire for the religion that they are preaching in the world. 

Not long ago we sent two young elders, at the beginning of this 
summer's work, into a country district. One of them was from San 
Francisco and the other from Alberta, Canada. One was nineteen 
years old and the other twenty. They began their work in a certain 
county, and five preachers in that county, when they saw the activities 
of these elders, decided that they ought to hold some anti-"Mormon" 
meetings. So they called these meetings together, and five of them 
sat on the stand. They sent to Chicago for an anti-"Mormon" lecturer 
who had labored in Utah, and who knew all about the "Mormons." 
He came, and they held, a meeting. They actually asked the sheriff 
of the county to come and sit close to the front where he could take 
care of these two "Mormon" boys, lest they do someone bodily harm. 
The preachers held three anti-"Mormon" meetings, and the boys fol- 
lowed after them. One man told me afterwards that the dignity of 
these young men, the spirit that accompanied their talks, the power 
that was behind them, convinced him that they were not what these 
preachers said they were. And afterwards that man and all his family 
joined the Church. When these two elders were asked to take this 
country trip they did not want to go, they said that they had made a 
lot of friends where they were, and they thought they ought to follow 
up what they had been doing. They said to the district President: 
"You are taking us away and putting two elders in our places, and 
we do not want to go. We would rather stay here." As they talked 
this matter over in their meeting, the president of the district arose 
and said: "I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that if you will take 
this trip, as you have been called to do, you shall have more friends 
where you go than you have ever had here. You shall heal the sick 
in every direction in which you travel, and the very elements shall be : 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 



39 



subject to you." These two boys went out and came back and testi- 
fied that the Lord had healed the sick wherever they had gone, that 
the very elements had been subject to them, that they had commanded 
the elements to be still when they interfered with their meetings, and 
the elements had been stilled. I tell you people, there is a power in 
this Church which the world must yet recognize. I am wondering 
what the answer of the world would be if we were to' ask them, today, 
Whence comes this power? How can we get these young men and 
young women to go out into the world and devote their attention to 
this work, and how is it that they make such growth? 

Not long ago we received a wire from Port William, Ontario, Can- 
ada. A family living there said that they had lost three of their children 
by drowning in the river, and for us to come at once. The preachers of 
the town said : "These 'Mormon' elders will never travel four hundred 
miles to attend a funeral service. You might just as well let us hold it." 
The Saints replied : "The elders will come if there is a possibility of 
their doing so." When we got to the place we found that they had 
arranged for the funeral service to be held in a little chapel. Twenty 
minutes before the time for the service to commence, we went to the 
chapel and found it crowded, and hundreds of people were there who 
could not obtain entrance. I. said to Elder Jones, the presiding elder, 
"We will have to find a different place in which to meet." We went 
down the street a block where a funeral service was being held in a 
church, and we requested of the preacher the privilege of holding our 
services in his church. "Well," he said, "I will see the elders." He 
conferred with the elders and came back in a few minutes and said that 
he felt he could not allow us to meet in his building. We went back. 
Just across the road from the undertaker's parlor was the city hall, and 
in this hall was a large auditorium. We asked the mayor over the phone 
if we could not hold our service there. He said: "We have refused, 
four times in succession, to allow your elders the use of that hall." We 
said : "We know you have, but don't you think that under the conditions 
you ought to open the hall and let us hold a funeral service there?" 
Then he said: "I think possibly we could." 

"How many people will your hall hold ?" 

"Six hundred." 

We carried the caskets across the road into this hall and in ten 
minutes every seat was taken. As we had five preachers, the mayor, 
and the Salvation army captain, sitting on the stand with us, my soul 
went out in prayer to God that he would magnify us that we might 
be able to make these people, who were in mourning, wipe away their 
tears and look up and not down, forward and not back, and that we 
might also be able to let the people of that city who had been so 
prejudiced that they had never heard the voice of a "Mormon" elder, 
know what the doctrines and teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ 
and our conceptions of life and the world to come, really are. When 
it was all over we found that we had made, not one friend, not one 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



family of friends, but that we had made scores of friends. One man 
said to his wife when he went home : "You are all the time asking 
me to go to church and hear the preacher. If you will get a preacher 
in our church like those elders I will go every Sunday." Another 
man said : " I do not know what it is in this 'Mormon' Church, but 
it is remarkable that these elders can come up here and make these 
people wipe away their tears and influence them in such a way that 
they can go to the cemetery and lay away three of their children at 
the same time and not weep. Our preachers cannot do it, but these 
elders of the 'Mormon' Church have done it." 

I want to say to you today that the gospel of Jesus Christ will 
meet every human need, and it will meet it fully and completely, for 
this is God's work, it is not the work of man. I bear witness to this 
fact today, with all the earnestness of my soul, and I testify 'that he 
will carry it through successfully to the end. 

We are grateful for those very splendid young men and young 
women who come to our mission who will face any kind of cold 
weather — and we have a lot of it up there — to preach the gospel. They 
are going into the homes of the people. The doors are being opened 
in such numerous instances that we are not able to take care of them 
all. We need more elders, "an'd we need them to come out into the 
field like those who are there. 

Let me say to you in closing, you fathers and mothers who have 
girls in the mission field: Do not fear for them while they are there. 
Let your fears begin when they return home to the body of the Church 
and throw off the harness of responsibility. Those boys and girls, 
while they are engaged in the ministry, are growing every hour, and 
the longer they stay the faster they grow. 

May God bless this work at home and abroad, that men and 
women, holding responsibility in it, may be endowed with the 
spirit of their office and calling, that we may work day and night for 
the furtherance of the purposes of God, and that his purposes might 
be accomplished and his will prevail on earth as it docs in heaven, 1 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters: As I stood before this conference six 
months ago, after having been called to preside over the Eastern states 
mission, I had very little conception of the influence which that mis- 
sion would have upon my life. In the East we have some thirty-four 
million people to approach, or seventy or eighty times as many as 
there are in this state. We have only a comparatively few missionaries 
to do the work. I went through that mission with Brother Ballard, 
of the Twelve. He was there with me for twenty-three days. He spoke 
every day. He made thirty-six stalks in the twenty-three days that 
he was with us, and the wonderful results that came from those meet- 



ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 



41 



ings, each of which was attended by a great many investigators, are 
simply marvelous. He was with us in June, and possibly a few days 
in July. During the months of July ana August ninety-nine new con- 
verts were baptized into the Church of Christ. We have not been 
able to keep it up in September. I have just received a telegram to 
the effect that we had only twenty-one baptisms during September, 
sixteen of whom were converts. 

I feel thankful to the Lord that we had a member of the Twelve 
with us in that great mission. I am also certain that we do not under- 
stand the Eastern states. I know that I did not. I had been in New 
York not less than twice every year for twenty or twenty-five years, 
but I did not understand it. There is more distinct evidence of preju- 
dice against the Latter-day Saints in the Eastern states than anywhere 
else that I can conceive oi'. We cannot get at them, comparatively 
speaking. It is difficult in a city of eight or nine millions of people to 
reach a great many, but we go from door to door and we are reaching 
some of them. If some of the authorities could stay in the larger 
cities and communities in the East, from Vermont and New Hampshire 
down to West Virginia — all of the states lying along the Atlantic 
coast belonging to the Eastern states mission — if they could stay there 
a little more and not just go there on a short trip, but do as Brother 
Ballard did (some of the other apostles no doubt have done the same), 
and realize the possibilities of that mission, I believe that a whole lot 
of good could be done. 

So far as our missionaries are concerned, I must confess that 
I did not believe it possible that young men and women whom I knew 
who went into the Eastern states or any other mission, with the limited 
knowledge and experience they possessed, could obtain the strength 
of testimony that they do. But I say to you that 95 per cent of the 
missionaries who are in the Eastern states sincerely believe all that 
they tell about the Book of Mormon and about the "Mormon" religion. 
They have become thoroughly aroused to the fact that they are engaged 
in the service of God. So far as I know, not a single one of our mis- 
sionaries is sick. They are all anxious to work, and it is their greatest 
desire to stay fully two years in the mission. A lady missionary whom 
I released a little before her time was up, telegraphed me the other day 
that she would like to find out what was the matter, she- wanted to 
stay her full time. I wired back to her and explained why she should 
be released. But that is the spirit, and that is the good feeling that 
there is in the Eastern states mission. 

I am very much more gratified today about being called as a 
missionary in the Church of Christ than I was six months ago. I was 
rather fearful that the many other things I had done in my lifetime 
were so different from going into the missionary field, that my atten- 
tion would be distracted from the work that ought to be clone; but 
the Lord has been with me and I feel that there is not any other thing that 
interests me in the least so long as I am in New York and doing this 
work. I have traveled all over the mission now. I have been over 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



two-thirds of the mission the second time and expect to spend all of 
my time in getting around among the Saints. Let me say to you here 
that 1 am not trying to preach the gospel to the Saints. The mission- 
aries, your boys and girls, are doing that. I cannot preach very much. 
I say a few words at the end of the meeting, but after such meetings 
I sit down with the missionary elders and sisters, and we hold a two 
or three hours' meeting. We do not get up on our feet and talk to one 
another, but we sit around the table and discuss the situation. I think 
we have all come to the conclusion that we are all serving the same 
Master, that we have but one thing to do and that is to see that more 
people get a knowledge of the truth. I have taken the elders away 
from the Saints, very largely. I think that they are needed to preach 
the gospel to those who have not heard it. I have said to the local 
priesthood in the branches, you take care of the Saints and let the elders 
preach the gospel. We have had remarkable success in a majority of 
the branches. I hope to have more success. I hope that we may have 
a still better year this year than last. Last year was the ban- 
ner year of the mission. There were two hundred and nineteen con- 
verts last year. In the first nine months we baptized one hundred and 
eighty-three new converts, and we will do better than last year before 
this year is ended. We are paying comparatively more tithing in the 
East than you are at home. We are doing wonderful things with the 
people that are living there. So, no doubt, are all other missionaries. 

I feel grateful for the privilege of laboring jn the mission. Let me 
just ask you one thing. There are hundreds of you who have relatives 
and friends in the East or in other missions. Why don't you write 
to the elder who presides in the mission where your friend lives, and 
say to him: "I have a friend, Mr. John A. Jones, living in such a 
street and such a town ?" and we will ascertain the rest. We will ap- 
proach them right. We will not try to convert them, we will just go 
and call on them and try to continue calling on them until we get them 
interested in the gospel. But we would like to have you help us to the 
extent of giving us the addresses. Merely John A. Jones, New York, 
doesn't mean a thing. We have tried it, and can't do) a thing with them. 
But give us John A. Jones, 212 Olive street, New York, and they 
will be visited. We need you, we are relying upon you. The more 
than eighty missionaries who are laboring in the Eastern states are the 
ones who are telling them about the gospel of Christ, as you are living 
it, and we hope that there may be some success come from their efforts. 

I testify to you, as I have done to the people in the East, 
that the gospel of Christ has been restored. That was an old story with 
me. I am more than ever confirmed in it, ahd I proclaim it to the peo- 
ple with whom I come in contact. God bless the Saints at home. It 
is gratifying to have an opportunity to stand before them occasion- 
ally and tell them what we are doing, because that is really what is 
interesting. 

God bless you all is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER WM. R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am extremely happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to 
report the condition of the Northwestern states mission. When I re- 
port the condition of the mission and my feelings, I want to associate 
with myself my good companion and wife, who is a big factor in what 
little degree of success we have attained this year. We are immensely 
happy in our labors, and we have been working together, trying with the 
help of the Lord to further his great work in. the earth. We have a 
great field in which to labor, covering a tremendous area of country, 
but our population is nowhere as numerous as President Henry Hi 
Rolapp reports in the Eastern states. 

In the past ten months I have traveled over twenty-five thousand 
miles visiting the Saints and friends of the Northwestern states mis- 
sion, and I am very happy to report a wonderful spirit of cordiality is 
now extended to us ' in that section, by the press. The freedom of 
the press and the way in which the newspapers voluntarily write articles 
about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is indeed gratify- 
ing to us, and at no time do we ask for favors 1 but that those favor's 
are granted. 

We have seven thousand members of the Church residing in that 
mission. We have thirty-seven branches, fifty-three Sunday schools, 
seventy Primaries, twenty-four Relief Society organizations, and sev- 
enty-four missionaries now laboring in the field. We could use many- 
times seventy- four missionaries had we them to use. At the present time 
in our Primary work we have recently organized, in the city of Seattle, 
a Primary in the Orphans' Home. This is a sectarian orphanage. In 
this Primary organization we have one hundred thirty-five children. 
We met with the Board of Governors and the matron of that institu- 
tion and laid our plans before them and asked for the privilege of 
organizing a Primary, giving them to understand that we are members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They asked us 
to come and hold a class. The class was held. The children were 
divided into their groups, just as you would organize them here at home, 
and at the close, in the presence of the governing body of that institu- 
tion, they came and said : "Can you not occupy at least one hour each 
day with such work as this ?" We have three other Orphans' Homes in 
Seattle that are open to us, but we have only four little missionary girls 
to take care of that work, and with our numerous other duties we are 
handicapped. We are not even attempting to organize primaries in those 
homes until the time comes when we can get reinforcements. We are 
happy to tell you that the Presidency have listened to our plea and 
will send to us eight or ten young women in the immediate future who 
will constitute the reinforcements necessary, and then we will proceed 
at once to organize other Primaries. -W e have four young ladies labor- 
ing in Tacoma. They have seven primaries there to take care of, or a 
Primary every day of the week. So I could go on indefinitely, telling 
you oi this work.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



1 We have today in this audience, I am quite sure, one of our young 
missionaries who has just been released atter serving twenty-eight 
months in the mission field. Last spring he and his companion were 
laboring in Olympia, Washington, on the Pacific coast. I said : "Elder, 
I want you and your companion to go over into Montana. You take 
the highway and travel without purse or scrip. I don't want you to 
ask for a ride during your entire journey. Travel as if you had a desti- 
nation in view and you will have plenty of opportunities to ride." The 
first day they rode over a hundred miles in an automobile, and at the 
close of the day, as they were leaving him, the gentleman with whom 
they were riding put his hand into his pocket and gave them four dol- 
lars and forty-three cents, and said : "Boys, I don't want you to go 
hungry." The next day another gentleman picked them up, gave them 
a ride of a hundred and seventy-five miles. His father-in-law, who 
happened to be in the car with them, a little man, was very quiet and 
had nothing to say all day, but had listened to the conversation. Towards 
evening, he said : "Boys, I remember many years ago meeting two 
'Mormon' missionaries, away back in my old home town, the city of 
Carthage, Illinois. I do not remember what those men preached about, 
but I do remember the words of one of the songs they sang." And, by 
the way, we sang that hymn for our opening song this afternoon. He 
said : "I cannot remember all the words, but part of the words of that 
hymn were these: 'Do what is right, let the consequence follow.' " The 
Elders opened their grips and took therefrom a little pamphlet hymn- 
book and sang the hymn, "Do what is right." The old gentleman sat 
there with his eyes bedimmed with tears, and from then on he was 
talkative in the extreme. 

We have a young lady sitting in the congregation this afternoon 
who, a few months ago, held a street meeting on the streets of Tacoma, 
Washington, in company with her companion and the elders. At the 
close of the meeting, just as they dismissed, a gentleman spoke up and 
said, "May I say a word?" The privilege was granted him. He said: 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that the city of Tacoma, Washing- 
tion, is honored in the presence of these young men and women repre- 
senting the 'Mormon' Church. I only wish that we had more such 
young men and young women as they are." He was one of the repre- 
sentative business men of Tacoma, Washington. 

And so I could go on. Our Saints are working unitedly together. 
We are enjoying the work. We took a caravan to the Canadian temple 
this summer. One hundred and ninety-three people from our mission 
made the trip to Cardston, traveling in automobiles the entire distance, 
some of them going sixteen hundred miles. The experiences of that 
caravan, the spiritual uplift, development and growth as a result of that 
trip, time will never last long enough to efface. I bear you that witness, 
my brethren and sisters. The treatment that we were accorded in 
the Canadian temple was simply wonderful. 

Just one word further. I have a clipping from one of the leading- 
newspapers of the Northwest, which I would like to read to show 
you the spirit of the press. In speaking of the Book of Mormon and 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



45 



that auspicious 22nd day of September, the writer said this. It is an edi- 
torial, by the way : 

"While Messrs. Dempsey and Tunney are pummeling each other for a 
million dollars or so at Chicago Thursday night, a scene quite different will be 
unfolded through Utah on that occasion. 

"On the 22nd day of September, 1927, it will be one hundred years since 
the Angel Moroni delivered to the prophet, Joseph Smith, the gold plates which 
had been deposited for centuries in the Hill Cumorah, near Palmyra, New York, 
from which plates the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power 
of God. I i . i 

"Believe it or not, as you choose. The undoubted fact remains that the 
'Mormon' people have contributed vastly to the upbuilding of the west. Literally, 
they made the deseret 'blossom like a rose.' In these days of quarreling 
religious sects it is worth while to point to the thrift, industry, discipline and 
co-operation of the 'Mormons' to show what may be accomplished by a church 
organization in the practical development of a commonwealth. 

" 'All for one and one for all,' to employ the slogan of The Three Guardsmen. 
has ever been their watchword. 

"The other night as the train moved by the well-kept homes and ripe gardens 
in the outskirts of Salt Lake City, the Pullman porter who lives in Chicago, 
remarked : 'They still think a heap of Brigham Young in this town.' 

"And well they may. Whatever may be said of the teachings of 'Mormonism,' 
Brigham Young was one of the ablest and most remarkable administrators and 
leaders of men and women ever developed in our American civilization." 

In closing allow me to repeat the words of one of the poets : 

"We are building every day, 

In a good or evil way; 

And the building, as it grows, 
i Shall our inmost selves disclose, 

And, in every arch and line, 
All our faults and failings find. 

"We may build a palace grand, 
Or a wreck upon the sand. 
Do you ask what building this. 
That can show both pain and bliss, 
That can be both dark and fair? 
Lo, its names is Character. 

"Build it well what'er you do, 
Build it straight and strong and true. 
Build it clean, and high, and broad. 
Build it for the eyes of God." 



So I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation sang, "God moves in a mysterious way." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Hyrum G. Smith, pre- 
siding patriarch of the Church. 

Tire conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m. Saturday, October 
8, 1927. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The conference continued on Saturday morning, 10 o'clock, Oc- 
tober 8, 1927. The congregation comfortably filled the large tabernacle. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Prayer is the soul's sincere 
desire." 

Invocation was offered by Elder David K. Udall, president of the 
Arizona temple. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I esteem very highly the privilege of attending this conference and 
of listening to the instructions and testimonies that we have heard. 
There is in my soul a sincere gratitude for my membership in the Church 
of Jesus Christ. As I came down this morning, observing the sunshine, 
the changing tints of the foliage, and the beauties of this valley that 
surround us, I felt that surely the great pioneer leader made no mistake 
when he announced to that little band of pilgrims who had crossed the 
trackless plains, "This is the place !" 

THE JOY OF THE WORK 

I desire to be blessed by the Lord, that the thoughts voiced by me 
may be profitable to you. We are a small part of a great congregation 
that belongs to our heavenly Father. All the children in the world, are 
his, and upon us has been laid the responsibility of delivering to them 
the truth, much of which has been in the world before, some of which 
has been lost until the gospel was restored again in this latter day. We 
have listened to these good men who preside over our missions, have 
partaken of the spirit of the mission field, and have rejoiced with them 
and with those who labor under them, that our heavenly Father has 
given to us in this latter-day the duty to perform of proclaiming his 
truth to the children of men. Perhaps it might appear to the outside 
observer that there is among the Latter-day Saints an unusual en- 
thusiasm. As one man recently said : "It is strange to me how joyfully 
you people carry your work forward. It matters not whether I speak 
to a youth or to a mature man, to a gardener or a policeman among 
your people, they are all happy and satisfied and confident that they 
possess the gospel of Jesus Christ." Everyone should possess the spirit 
of the work, a spirit of love, a spirit of kindness, a spirit of charity 
for the weaknesses and frailties of mankind, but with a pronounced 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



47 



desire that the truth may be made manifest, that those who err in their 
lives may be led to forsake their folly and turn to the Lord our God. 

SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD 

We believe absolutely in the admonition that was given by the 
Savior of the world when he said: 

"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all 
other things will be added." 

Therefore, we believe that if we can establish faith in the minds 
of the rising generation, if we can teach the truth in such a way that 
our Father's children will seek him and his influence first, that this 
world will begin to prepare for the Millennium, when there will be joy 
and peace and happiness, and when our heavenly Father will establish 
his kingdom, into which he has invited every child of his that has been 
born into the world. With that understanding in our hearts, and with 
that feeling in our souls, is it any wonder that there is enthusiasm in 
6ur worship, that we have a disposition to be anxious to divide these 
glorious truths with our neighbors? Is it to be wondered at, that when 
the time comes that our sons are called into the mission field, or we 
are asked to lay aside our duties and go out as servants of the living 
God, endued with power from on high, possessing authority that has 
been conferred in this latter-day, in order that we may divide with all 
people this wonderful truth that has made our lives so rich, and that is 
preparing us to be desirable companions for all his children wherever 
we may find them, that we respond willingly and gladly? 

OBEDIENCE AND THE SPIRIT OF UNSELFISH SERVICE NEEDED 

It is this spirit of unselfish service that is needed in the world. Re- 
pentance of sin is also greatly needed by mankind. It is necessary that 
there be obedience to law, not only to the laws of God, but obedience to 
the laws of the land should be stimulated in the minds of men, if we 
expect this earth upon which we live to be the kind of a home that he 
desires us to possess. Our ministry is one of love and forbearance, 
and we desire to do good to all, and to assist all to understand the 
plan of life and salvation that the Lord revealed in this latter day. The 
assurance that God lives is most desirable and that knowledge may be 
just as fixed in the lives of the humble man and the humble woman in the 
ranks as it is in the lives of those who preside over us. I am not , 
dependent upon the testimony of my brethren arid my sisters by whom 
I am surrounded, and for whom I have an affectionate regard. And 
this is the testimony that I desire to leave with you, I may if I will 
know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the Redeemer 
ot the world, and that he so loved the world that he gave his life in 
order that his gospel might be preached to all men. 

SACRIFICE AND LABORS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 

Joseph Smith, the prophet, who was the servant of Jesus Christ, 
our Lord, was given an understanding of the gospel that was taught by 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Redeemer, and in our day was inspired to perfect a church organi- 
zation that is recognized as the most perfect in the world. 

This youth was so sure of the revelation that he had received, and 
was so anxious that his Father's children, all of them, should know of 
the truth, that from the time he received the plates of the Book of Mor- 
mon from the angel Moroni he devoted his entire life to the organization 
of the Church and disseminating the truth. Those chosen to carry the 
work forward received the holy priesthood and were prepared to carry 
on when the prophet said : "I go like a lamb to the slaughter, but 
I have a conscience void of offense toward God and all men, and it 
will yet be said of me, 'he died in cold blood'." So he went to his doom 
as he understood it, but there was burning in his soul a knowledge such 
as Stephen had, such as the Redeemer had, that our heavenly Father 
was at the helm, that it was his work that was upon the earth, that it 
was his power that would eventually control, that this life was but a 
part of eternity. He was prepared to give up a part of his earth-life, 
if need be, in order that he might enjoy eternally the companionship 
that he so .sincerely loved, and the association of good .men and women 
who have and do dwell upon the earth, and will again dwell upon the 
earth when it becomes the celestial kingdom. This testimony the 
humblest individuals of this Church may have, and know just as they 
know that they live, that these things are true. 

THE GOSPEL THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION 

This gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation, 
as the Apostle Paul declared. It is the Redeemer's work. It is the 
only way whereby we may attain the highest exaltation that the Savior 
of mankind intended that those who followed him should enjoy. I do 
not say that egotistically, I say it with all charity for our Father's chil- 
dren who belong to other churches. I say it with love for his sons and 
daughters who do not understand, but he has commanded that we should 
say this thing. It is his will that people should know. In no uncertain 
tone is the gospel being proclaimed among the children of men, and the 
message of life and salvation is being offered, without money and-with- 
out price, to all our Father's children, in order that they may avail 
themselves of the knowledge that will prepare them for eternal life 
in his celestial kingdom. That is why there is rejoicing in the lives 
of those who keep the commandments of God. 

THE CAUSE OF HAPPINESS 

The happiest men and the happiest women that you know in the 
world are those who are conforming their lives to the teachings of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. They are those who have the assurance of 
eternallife; they are those who understand the purpose of our being \ 
they are those who realize that to seek first the kingdom of God and 
his righteousness, means for them all that men and women can enjoy 
in this life or in the life that is to come. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 49 



With happiness and with thanksgiving, there departs into the 
world from his Church a group of men and women whose lives are 
devoted to proclaiming the truth. In the neighborhood of two thousand 
are in the world today, paying their own expenses, going from door to 
door, teaching what our heavenly Father has said must be known by the 
children of men before this world can be transformed into the kingdom 
of our Lord. These are your sons and daughters. After them shall 
go others who will carry this message forward to the honor and glory 
of our heavenly Father. As I have traveled to and fro in the world 
bearing this message, my soul has been filled with joy, and my eyes 
have been dimmed with tears, when I have seen how perfectly men's lives 
may be transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have seen those 
who were discouraged, those who were in darkness, those who ques- 
tioned the purpose of their being, and when they have had taught to 
them the glorious truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, they have 
changed, they have learned to be happy, to be contented, to be satisfied, 
to be enthusiastic in believing and teaching the gospel that was pro- 
claimed by Jesus Christ when he dwelt upon this earth and traveled 
in Galilee. 

THE GOSPEL MISSION PROCLAIMED IN LOVE 

Brethren and sisters, the world does not understand that, but it 
is our mission to assist them to understand it, and it is not with egotism, 
it is not with arrogance, but with charity for all, with loving tenderness, 
that this message is sent forth. We do not say to the Presbyterians, 
to the Methodists, to the Baptists, to the Catholics, and those others 
who in their lives are striving to live the teachings of their churches, 
we do not say to them : "You must give up all that you have been 
, taught, you must turn away from the truth that has been deposited with 
you in order that you may come into the Church of Jesus Christ." But 
we say to them. "Keep all that you possess. Keep all the virtues, keep 
all the truth, keep all the goodness that has ever come into your lives, and 
then permit us to share with you the additional light that our heavenly 
Father, in his tender mercy, has bestowed upon the children of men in 
our day." That is our mission to our Father's children. It is a mission 
t of peace, of good will towards all men. It is an intense and enthusiastic 
desire to divide with all our Father's children the good things that he 
has so generously bestowed upon us ; and it is with the hope that they 
may understand, that we go upon our bended knees, day after day, and 
pray that their hearts may be touched, that the spirit of God may come 
into their souls, that they may understand the truth as it is given unto 
them, and thereby make preparation for the time to come when our 
heavenly Father will gather those who have sought him first and who 
have prepared themselves thereby to be the eternal companions of Jesus 
Christ our Lord. 

TESTIMONY AND GRATITUDE 

This, my brethren and sisters, is what brings joy into our hearts. 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That is why there is peace in your home and in mine. Therefore, this 
morning, as one of the humblest among you, I thank him with all my 
heart for the assurance that has come into my life, for the privileges that 
have been mine, for the associations that are so desirable, that I have 
been permitted to enjoy while I have lived here these few years upon the 
earth. And above all, I thank him for the knowledge that has been 
burned into my soul; I know that my heavenly Father lives, I know 
that Jesus Christ is the Savior of mankind, and that there is no other 
name under heaven whereby men and women may be exalted, but the 
name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. I do know that he came into the world 
in this latter day, that he bestowed divine authority upon a humble boy 
who was seeking the truth, and the result of that has been the organiza- 
tion of the Church with which we are identified ; and there is with it 
the power of God unto salvation to all those who believe. Knowing 
that as I know that I live, I bear you witness of it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

About the middle o>f September of this year I was taken by my 
son from San Pedro, California, to Hollywood. At that time I attended 
Grauman's Chinese theatre. They had printed on their program : "The 
. Glories of the Scriptures." The screen play was "The King of Kings." 
The prologue was enchanting and wonderful. This screen play has 
not yet been released. Thousands and tens of thousands of people have 
gone to Hollywood to this great theatre to witness this play, the "King 
of Kings." The cast O'f great actors — they tell me they are among the 
great actors — represented Jesus the Christ, Mary the Mother, the 
Twelve Apostles, Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Mary of Bethany, Caia- 
phas, the Pharisee, the Scribe, Pontius Pilate, the woman taken in 
adultery, satan, and hundreds of other characters as found in the story 
of Jesus. The characterization, costumes, life and surroundings must 
have been true to life. At times it was thrilling and pathetic. Many 
who were at all spiritual were brought to tears. It was the greatest 
sermon of Christ's life, sorrows and sufferings, ending with his cru- 
cifixion and resurrection, that could possibly be presented, and its effects 
1 will be everlasting. To my mind it would almost immortalize Cecil B. 
De Mille and others. 

The actors, so I am told, signed a pledge, a contract, binding upon 
them to live lives that would be fitting to the characters they repre- 
sented, for three years, for in doing otherwise' it would mar and destroy 
the effect and purpose of the picture. 

When I returned home I read the Life of Christ by Giovani 
Papini, to make clear my conception of men. I learned from this book 
this information : 

"What manner of men were the Apostles, chosen of Christ? 

"He chose them from among the Galileans; he chose them from 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



51 



among the poor ; simple men, but of divine simplicity, transcending all 
philosophies. He knew these men were rough, but had integrity ; were 
ignorant, but ardent, and that he could in the end mold them according 
to his desire and bring them up to his level." 

"These disciples lived with Christ and were fortunate to walk, 
to eat with him, to sleep in the same room, to look into his face, to 
touch his hand, to kiss him, to hear his words from his mouth." 

"We see them, hard of head and of heart, not able to understand 
the clearest parable of the Master ; often lacking in faith, in lotve, in 
brotherly affection, eager for pay; envying each other, impatient for 
the revenge which would repay them for their long wait ; intolerant of 
those who were not one with them. One of them denies him three 
times." They disputed among themselves to know who should have 
the chief place in the new kingdom. Jealous of their privileges, they de- 
nounced to Jesus one who was casting out devils in his name. Jesus 
said: "Forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle 
in my name that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against 
us is on our part." This is a hard saying; who can hear it? and they 
left Jesus. ' 

Peter, James and John are the only ones who accompany Jesus 
into the house of Jairus and on the Mount of Transfiguration and they 
are the ones whom he takes with him on the night of Gethsemane. But 
in spite O'f their long intimacy with the Master, they did not acquire 
sufficient faith and humility. 

At one time Jesus and some of his disciples started together to- 
wards Jerusalem. They were crossing Samaria and were badly re- 
ceived in a village. James and John said: "Lord, wilt thou that we 
command fire to come down from heaven and consume them." But 
he turned and rebuked them. It seemed in vain that they had heard 
the Sermon on the Mount. James and John wanted Jesus to grant 
them the right (one to sit on the right hand, and one on the left hand 
in his glory). Yet John was among the nearest and most loving of the 
diseiples. 

Jesus Christ trained, educated, and tried to mold, his disciples 
according to his desire to bring them up- to his level. To the Twelve 
much should be pardoned, because always they had faith in him, be- 
cause they tried to love him as he wished to be loved. I would like 
to have myself and everyone feel and realize that God, too, is molding 
his servants in this day and age of the world. The gospel has been re- 
stored upon the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith, with all of 
its gifts and blessings pertaining thereto, and I am a living witness, 
a Seventy and a preacher of righteousness who, standing before you 
without fear and , without doubt — for I have seen the power of God 
made manifest through the administration of those ordinances. So it 
was with these great apostles, and we love and cherish their memories. 
But what they needed was to be enlightened by the flame of the Holy 
Ghost for their transformation. Until the day of Pentecost they acted 
like natural men. They were then prepared to announce that the king- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



dom of heaven was at hand, to heal the sick and command men every- 
where to repent ; and they quoted the scriptures — as I have quoted- those 
passages of scripture in the South hundreds and hundreds of times, 
and they are being quoted all over the world by the elders who are 
preaching the gospel. 

"Behold I send the promise of my Father upon you ;" that same 
promise is upon us. "Tarry ye," said the Lord, "Tarry ye in the city of 
Jerusalem until ye be endowed with power from on high." I never 
place my hands upon an elder to set him apart that I do not think of 
that passage of scripture. It has been verified and fulfilled, fo<r elders 
have come back, young men of whom I have no remembrance, but 
they come back to the apostles and to those who set them apart and 
say: "Brother Kimball, you set me apart, and the promises you made 
have been realized." 

"And he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his 
hands and blessed them." Luke 24:49, 50. 

"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father 
will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things 
to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you." John 16 :26. 

"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you 
into all truth ; for he shall not speak of himself, 'but whatsoever he 
shall hear, that shall he speak ; and he will show you things to' come. 

"Nevertheless, it is expedient that I go away, for if I go not away, 
the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him 
unto you." 

After the crucifixion and death of their Master they go forth 
as witnesses to teach the truth and to speak without fear, and without 
hiding anything, and to cry out from the heights in order that all may 
hear it, in order that there may be no one to say on that day that he has 
not heard it. 

Now, brethren, I confess to you that I have been among this people 
for a considerable length of time, and have tried to fill my appoint- 
ments as best I could. I have traveled among the people from Canada 
to Mexico, but I have never in all my labors felt the thrill and the flame 
of the Holy Spirit like I did when I was on my mission. It has been 
strange to me that I have not been able to reach the hearts, to reach 
the humility, the childlike simplicity, the perfect faith in God that I 
enjoyed in the Southern states, as an ignorant elder, perhaps, and with 
very little information. Yet I traveled without purse or scrip absolutely, 
and I had such perfect confidence that I never doubted but that I 
would be cared for. Now, I want to say to you that a while back I 
was sick, two or three weeks, with what they call the ''flu." I inherited 
that disease ; I get it every little while. While I was there I wondered 
if I had exaggerated my experience in the South, so I hunted up my 
diaries which I had not read for forty years, and I discovered that 
I told the truth. The record is as correct as the record of the Bible, 
and I was astonished how God blessed me and how I enjoyed his spirit 
and the manifestations and testimonies that were given to me. Let me

call your attention to an incident. It happened away down in Alabama. 
That was at a time in the '90's when I presided over the Southern states 
mission. The elders had been ask'ed to assemble themselves together. 
They were laboring in that low, marshy, malarial district that was 
scarcely safe for a human to live in, and they came straggling" in, suf- 
fering with malaria, rather low-spirited, because they had been travel- 
ing without purse or scrip through that section of the country. We 
assembled to hold a conference. After the conference was over, two 
days, we were to hold a priesthood meeting. We had no place to meet 
in those days except in the woods, but I had instructed the elders to 
clean some place off in the woods, a circle, where we could meet to- 
gether and hold our priesthood meeting. On that occasion there was a 
young man whose mother was a remarkable woman, a Latter-day Saint. 
The father had left the Church years and years ago. He opposed the 
boy, "he stood out against him, he refused to assist him, but the mother's 
faith and the faith of the young man who was in that conference did not 
fail. I don't know what his trouble was, but one of his legs was as 
large as my body, and it looked like a great piece of raw meat. It 
looked like it would burst. The people there did the best they could 
for him. He had no physician. , We did not know what a physician was 
in the South, in my day. There may have been physicians there, but 
I never happened to meet any. So on this occasion I said to this elder : 
"Well, you will have to stay here with the people. You can't go up 
there." "Why," he said, "Brother Kimball, I have been dreaming about 
this, and I have been talking about it. It would ruin my whole mission 
unless I can be at that priesthood meeting." "Well," I said, "if yoy 
feel that way, two of the elders will carry you up there, one mile." We 
went there in order to get away, to a place where we would be secluded, 
and when we got into the woods in that little circle and sat down, as 
best we could, I 'looked those elders over. I was not very well myself, 
but I said: "Brethren, what are you preaching?" 

"We are preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ." 

"Are you telling these people that you have the power and author- 
ity, through faith, to heal the sick?" 

They said : "Yes." 

"Well, then, why don't you believe it?" 

This young man spoke up and he said : "I believe it !" He sat 
down on a stump and the elders gathered around him. He was 
anointed and I administered to him, and he was healed right in their 
presence. It was quite a shock ; and every other elder that was sick 
was administered to, and they were all healed. We went out of that 
priesthood meeting and the elders received their appointments, and 
there was a joy and a happiness that cannot be described. The people 
gathered around, and the elders before their departure, got down and 
they cried. Those elders, many of them, had never seen one another un- 
til they assembled in that conference, and "Such love," those people said, 
"we have never known." My brethren and sisters, I realize that 
we at home are carried away in many instances with material things.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is spiritual first, and then temporal. My experience of late has 
been such, unfortunately, that I have had to hark back to find testi- 
monies of the great healing power of God. 

I will tell i you a story and then I shall stop. I got a telephone mes- 
sage some time ago, I think a year ago, may be, that I had some rela- 
tives in the hospital. They wanted me to hurry up there and adminis- 
ter to them. They were two sisters. They were married, and they 
were not city people, and, by the way, their father and mother were 
good Latter-day Saints, and these young girls had been taught and 
they had been active, but they were not healed, so they came to the 
hospital. When I arrived I found one of them in one room, and she' 
had been operated upon, and getting along very nicely. The other 
sister jwanted me to bless her before she was operated upon. I asked 
her how much she was paying for her room. She told me. "And how 
much are you paying the doctor." 

"Three hundred dollars." 

"Well, haven't you got confidence in him? He is charging you 
enough. Why don't you trust him?" 

"Well," she said, "Uncle 'Golden, jl have been administered to, 
but I was not healed, and I felt forced to come to the doctor." 

I said, "I am a little jealous for God, and if I bless you, and 
you are healed, who is going to get the credit? If the doctor gets 
all the money and all the credit, and God heals you, I don't think 
that fair." 

So I blessed her as best I knew how, frnd I blessed the doctor. I 
made a full anointing and blessed the nurse, and asked God that 
his spirit might be there and the patient's life be spared. I realize that 
hospitals, physicians, and surgeons, do wonderful things, and that 
faith without works is dead. I want to bear testimony to you, and 
I know it, I don't think it, I don't imagine it: (I have seen God heal 
the sick. I know it isn't in me, but I know that where there is faith 
there is nothing impossible, and these young elders who are sent out 
now, it may not be wisdom to send them out as we went, but when 
we were in the South, God had to take care of us, whether, it was stormy 
or sunshine, as we had no choice. I know the Lord can take care of 
us and will take care of us if we have faith. 

I was in the South three years, presiding over the mission, under 
the greatest hardships ; and the greatest difficulties I have ever en- 
dured in all my life were experienced in the missionary field, yet I 
have had the greatest joy and the greatest peace and happiness. Dur- 
ing my three years of presidency there was only one elder who died. 
EHas S. Kimball presided over the mission for seven years, and he had 
seventeen hundred fifty elders under his presidency, and only two 
died. When the Spanish-American war was on, there were at Chicka- 
mauga Park, Tenn., forty thousand of the finest 5'oung men of Amer- 
ica, and they were looked after, and yet they died by the hundreds. 
Don't tell me that God can't take care of his servants if they will have 
faith. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



55 



I know this work is true. I pray God always to help me to sus- 
tain the work, to uphold the hands of the priesthood, and to overlook 
my weaknesses and help me to finish and complete my mission here 
upon the earth. I have no 1 fear of the hereafter. I am not afraid of 
God. I know God is a God of love, a Father who will look after you, 
if you will trust him. I sustain this work, and I sustain the brethren. 
I sustain all those who labor for God and his cause. All of which I 
humbly pray for, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



When President Grant announced the changes in the missionary 
field in his opening remarks yesterday. I whispered to Brother Mc- 
Murrin who sat next to me: "Surely he overlooked the change in the 
European mission in the appointment of Elder John A. Widtsoe to 
succeed President James E. Talmage in the presidency of that mis- 
sion." We were pleased, however, when the announcement was subse- 
quently made, and I have been thinking : "How abundantly has the 
Lord endowed Brother Widtsoe to become the successor to that other 
defender of the faith (who is now honorably released to return home) 



complish a good work in that great mission, which, however, is a mis- 
sion comprising many missions located in various parts of the eastern 
hemisphere, where a great many different foreign languages are spoken ; 
and in this particular Brother Widtsoe is especially fitted and equipped, 
it seems to me, for the great work unto which the Lord has called him. 

Not very many years ago I had the pleasure of attending the 
Canadian quarterly conferences in company with Elder Widtsoe. 
Previous to our conferences Dr. Widtsoe had been visiting the North- 
west delivering addresses on agriculture, irrigation, reclamation, dry- 
farming and kindred subjects, and there were people including many 
not of our faith and living in outlying districts who desired to hear him, 
for his fame as an agriculturist had gone before him. Accordingly a 
meeting was arranged and some of the visitors at the Alberta conference, 
including myself, were also in attendance. He gave a most excellent 
talk. I have never listened to one where I received so much infor- 
mation regarding the principles of agriculture. He stated that there 
were five essentials to successful farming : first, soil. There must be 
soil. Second, there must be air. Third, there must be seed. Fourth, 
there must be water, and fifth, there must be sunshine. He went on 
explaining how it was necessary to break up the soil, to pulverize it in 
order that the air might get in, that it might be thoroughly aerated, fairly 
filled with atmosphere. He went on to show how it was necessary that 
seed should be planted in the soil,' thus prepared. He continued to 
show that it was necessary that water stiould be applied if that seed is 
to grow and that the sun must shine upon it before it can yield a harvest. 
He made it much more complete than I would be able to do here; but

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



what surprised me most was that, at the close of his remarks, he said : 
"Now, before we dismiss this meeting I would like to hear from my com- 
panion, Mr. Wells, who is a practical farmer." 

Well, I thought that was rather a strange introduction to give 
to me, as I had never held a plow in my hand in all my life. I had no 
horny hands of toil and my muscles were soft and had not become 
hardened to that kind of work, but nevertheless I responded to the invi- 
tation, and as I did so it came to me that perhaps after all Dr. Widtsoe 
was right, and that I was indeed a practical farmer, but the soil that I 
I have been endeavoring to cultivate is the soil of the human heart. It 
is sometimes an unwieldy soil, and full of hardness. It needs to be 
broken up and harrowed ; it needs to be pulverized and softened before 
it is prepared to receive the seed. The seed that I have been planting 
has been the seed of faith. We do not call it farming ; we call it sowing 
ihe seeds of faith — faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, that men shall be- 
lieve that he is indeed the Son of God, who was chosen before the 
foundations of this earth were laid to create it and redeem it. For, let 
it be remembered, there had been a great council in Heaven, when the 
great plan of life and salvation had been proclaimed among the children 
of God before this world was, "When the morning stars sang together 
and all the sons of God shouted for joy ;" and, in order to carry out the 
Lord's plan, the question arose : "Whom shall I send ?" There was 
one like unto the Son of man who arose and said : "Here am I, send me. 
Thy will be done 'and the glory be thine forever." This was the first- 
born, even Jehovah, who became the Only Begotten of the Father, and 
was known as Jesus Christ in the flesh. I have been teaching men to 
have faith in him who came into this world, created and peopled 
it with the children of God, that they might have life in this world, this 
natural world where we should have the experience of an earth-life ; to 
have faith in him who not only created the world, but who should re- 
deem the world ; who should redeem mankind from the fall which was 
to ensue, thus giving us the opportunity to prove whether we, with a 
knowledge of good and evil and in the exercise of our free agency, would 
do all things whatsoever the Lord our God should command; to have 
faith in him by whose almighty power mankind should be redeemed 
from death and the grave. 

But there was another who arose invthat primeval council who re- 
jected that plan and led many away from God through his deception and 
insidious sophistries, and he said: "Here am I, send me. I will be thy 
son, and I will see that not one soul shall be lost and surely I will do it ; 
therefore give me thine honor." And God said, I will send the first ; 
and satan, for he it was who spake thus, became angry and was. cast out 
of heaven and with him fell one-third of the hosts of heaven. The one 
all important thing, then, is to teach men to have faith in Him whom 
God sent) and reject the other whom God cast out of heaven. The first 
was a plan of freedom wherein men should exercise their own volition ; 
the other was one of compulsion and eventual subjection to the power 
of evil. To teach this fundamental truth has been the good seed which 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



57 



I have always endeavored to plant in the hearts of men, in this oftimes 
imwieldly. sour and hardened, but withal most prolific "and fertile soil. 

But other seeds were constanly being planted in this receptive soil — 
evil seeds. That war begun in heaven is continued here on earth. The 
evil hand that led so many away from God in that primeval conflict, 
with all his evil followers, continues , here to lead mankind astray by 
planting evil seeds, the seeds of hate, of greed, of avarice and lust, and 
these grow, too, along with the good seed. These are the weeds, the 
thistles and the thorns, hence the good farmer will pull them out or 
cut them clown, lest they overrun the good and hinder its growth. This 
we call repentance from sin or casting the devils out. 

Then comes the need for water, another essential in successful 
farming. So we preach not only faith and repentance but also baptism 
by immersion for the remission of sins, for the extinction of all the 
evil effects of sin, that the hearts and souls of men may be washed 
clean in the blood of the Lamb of God, by being buried with him by 
baptism into his death, and coming forth from that watery grave in 
the likeness of his glorious resurrection. 

Now let in the sunshine of God's Holy Spirit. How can the garden 
grow in darkness? How can the trees blossom and produce their 
luscious fruit? Or how can the fields grow and ripen into golden 
fiarvests, unless the sun shall shine upon them ? How can we know or 
understand the things of God without the light of his Holy Spirit? 
And yet, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true 
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." Hence,- there is need to 
obtain the gift of the Holy Ghost which in the gospel of our Lord is 
bestowed upon repentant and baptized believers by the laying on of 
hands. 

These are the essentials in this practical farming which has engaged 
so many years of my life. There appear to be two kinds of farming 
and both are practical. How greatly and grandly do they resemble 
each other ! I think it was Goethe, the great German poet, who said : 
"Alles vergaengliche is pur ein Gleichniss," — all things temporal are but 
symbols of things eternal. 

And now, Brother Widtsoe, so well informed in the science of 
agriculture — the reclamation of the waste lands of the desert — has also 
had a still greater experience as an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ in 
the cultivation of human hearts, in planting the seeds of faith, not only 
by word of mouth, but also by his convincing pen in this still wider 
field of human welfare, by applying, in their spiritual form these same 
essentials of practical and successful farming. 

May the Lord bless him in his ministry abroad. And, as he shall 
travel in the various missions of Europe, may he be able to speak forth 
the words of eternal life to every nation, kindred, tongue and people 
wheresoever he shall come, even to the convincing of the honest in heart 
and in a language which .they can understand. This is my humble 
prayer and sincere wish for Brother Widtsoe, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. • 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California Mission 

I have rejoiced, my brethren and sisters, in the proceedings of 
this conference, £nd feel that we have had a truly wonderful time to- 
gether. I have enjoyed the testimonies and counsels of all who have 
spoken, from President Grant to my companion and fellow-laborer, 
President Rulon S. Wells. I would like to say that I know, by close 
association with President Wells, that he has been a successful farmer 
in the manner that he has indicated, in sowing the seeds of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Qirist in the hearts of the children of men. I joy- 
fully bear witness to the good that has come to me as an individual 
through my companionship with President Wells, both at home and 
abroad, and I thank God for his example, for his patience, for his 
excellent teachings, for the love he has manifested for his fellow men, 
and for the blessings that he has produced in my own soul by his 
teaching and by his kind and loving companionship. 

If I caught aright the suggestion made by the President of the 
Church yesterday, it was his desire that the mission presidents should 
give information concerning the mission intrusted to their care. You 
have all learned from the remarks of President Grant that some things 
a little out of the ordinary have taken place in the California mission. 
Three stakes have been organized in that mission. I suppose I can 
say in the mission, although in a sense they are entirely outside of 
the mission, for the presidencies of the stakes, and those who are under 
their direction, control and manage and direct the organizations 
that are within the stakes, are entirely independent of any mission 
authority, and yet there are missionary districts covering some of the 
same territory that the stakes cover. The Los Angeles missionary dis- 
trict covers the territory that is embraced in the Los Angeles and Holly- 
wood stakes. The San Francisco missionary district covers the identical 
territory now embraced in the San Francisco stake. I think there has 
never been just this kind of experience in missions before. It is true 
that stakes have been organized that have taken sections of missions, 
but the mission headquarters have not been maintained in the midst 
of those sections ; so that, in California we have what might be termed 
a double line of authority, the authority of the mission and the author- 
ity of the various stakes. 

I am happy to say that the utmost goodwill has been maintained 
between mission authority and stake authority. At the present time 
in the San Francisco stake, President MacDonald and his associates, 
and Bishop Newman of the San Francisco ward and his associates, and 
the Relief Society organizations in that section, are all banded together 
to improve the quarters in San Francisco that are occupied by the 
missionaries. We thank the Lord for such men as are in the San Fran- 
cisco stake presidency and other presidencies in California, and for 
their desire to honor and respect and build up the missionaries and 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



59 



give them opportunity to accomplish the work that belongs to them. 
I feel that that is just as it should be. The missionaries are sent forth 
by proper authority to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
they should be given in California, in every stake and in every ward, 
abundant opportunity to lift up their voices in proclamation of the 
truth, that they may magnify the callings whereunto they have been 
called. I am happy to say that this condition prevails. 

Then, outside of California the missionaries, under the direction 
of mission authority, have labored in the St. Joseph stake of Zion and 
in the Snowflake stake of Zion, and I think have been instrumental in 
accomplishing good in all of the stakes named. We have gone into 
those stakes by permission of stake authority, and have operated among 
the people under their jurisdiction, with their full approval and sanc- 
tion. The mission has turned over to those stakes of Zion possibly some 
thirty wards, numbering about eleven thousand souls, and with the 
organization of the stakes there has gone to the stakes about two hun- 
dred thousand dollars' worth of chapel property that had been built 
up under mission authority. In the organization of the San Francisco 
stake, ten splendid wards went into that organization. I am happy to 
say that since the stake was organized, we have been successful in 
organizing four new branches in other parts of the mission, two of 
them being in Sacramento, the capital of the state of California. In- 
stead of one branch in that city we now have three branches, and re- 
cently a branch has been organized in San Luis Obispo, the first Church 
branch ever' established in that city, and we have just recently organ- 
ized a branch of the Church in Compton, right in the heart of the Los 
Angeles stake ; and this has been done with the full sanction and ap- 
proval of the presidency of that stake. We hope that under mission 
authority men and women will be developed in the branches and in 
the auxiliary organizations who in a time to come will be instrumental 
for the advantage and welfare of that and other stakes of Zion that 
I have named. I am reminded also that we -have labored in the Mari- 
copa stake of Zion and have been given a most hearty welcome in 
that stake by President Price, who formerly was the bishop of the 
Phoenix ward. He has always given me to understand that when mis- 
sionary tours were being made in Arizona, that he would like the 
Phoenix ward to be numbered, temporarily at least, in the California 
mission. We have had some wonderful times in Phoenix, and we 
have rejoiced very greatly in the testimony of Bishop Price and others 
that the ministry of the missionaries in that section of the country has 
been Very greatly to the advantage of the work of the Lord in that stake. 

We have, at present, outside of the stakes of Zion, nearly fifty 
Relief Societies, seventy Sunday schools, thirty Young Men's Mutual 
Improvement associations, thirty Young Ladies' Mutual Improve- 
ment associations, and thirty Primary organizations. All of these 
organizations are established exactly in the same manner as they are 
organized in the stakes of Zion, and are officered in that manner. They 
conduct their services strictly in accordance with the lessons outlined 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by the General Boards, and that are in use in the stakes of Zipn. In 
our mission, branch presidents carry practically the same authority 
carried by the bishops in the stakes of Zion. They stand at the 
head, they receive the tithings of the people, they ordain, according 
to their judgment, young men to the Aaronic Priesthood. Usually, if 
men are to be ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood, before such 
ordination their names are referred to the mission president. 

We need more missionaries. I suppose it is impossible to get that 
into the minds of the men in authority, who are here in this congrega- 
tion. I mean not the men behind me, but you men down in the con- 
gregation who make recommendations to the presidency of the Church. 
.We have discovered a way of getting missionaries that could be adopted. 
It is to call stake presidents into the mission field. They sent Stephen 
L. Chipman to the California mission, and there seemed to come to 
Brother Chipman a great revelation concerning the necessity of mis- 
sionaries, and while he was" in the mission field he got more mission- 
aries from the Alpine stake of Zion than he has been able to obtain 
since he returned. One of our missionaries intimated that it was be- 
cause he had the missionary spirit upon him in the mission field, more 
than he had in the Alpine stake of Zion ; but if we could have other 
stake presidents sent into the California mission, who would do the 
same work that President Chipman did in obtaining missionaries, one 
of our great problems would be solved. 

I was impressed yesterday with the testimony of President Henry 
H. Rolapp. He told us that when he was called to preside over the 
Eastern states mission he had some question in his mind as to whether 
that would be a satisfactory way in which to spend his time, and yet 
he declared that a wonderful revelation had come to him regarding the 
joy of missionary work. Well, that comes to every missionary who 
faithfully meets the obligation that rests upon him. I would not like 
to be misunderstood, or to give offense to anybody, but I say deliber- 
ately that in the mission field I have listened to trembling boys and 
trembling girls bear witness concerning the truth of the gospel, when 
my own soul has been pierced just as greatly as in listening to the 
testimony of any man of authority who has ever saluted my ears with 
his testimony. I thank God for that condition. Young men and young 
women do make the discovery by the power of God that they are 
engaged in the work of God ; and I feel that when these weak vessels, 
for they feel that they are weak, can pierce and melt my own soul and 
bring tears of joy to my eyes with their testimonies, surely by the 
same spirit and by the same power they may reach the hearts of men 
who are not of our faith, and that the Almighty, by the weak things 
that he has called and sent forth to minister in his name, is actually 
accomplishing the work designed in the sending forth of these young 
men and young women who feel most intensely their own weakness. 
I thank God for their companionship. I am proud of them, I love them, 
I trust them, and I believe they love me. They gladly hearken to my 
counsel, and they carry out, generally speaking, without hesitation, and 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



61 



in great cheerfulness, the recommendations that are made to them. 

During this last month of September, we suggested to the mis- 
sionaries of California that in honor of the one hundredth anniversary 
of the delivery of the plates of the Book of Mormon to Joseph the 
prophet, they should make an extra effort to place the Book of Mor- 
mon. They responded wonderfully. We do not know just how many 
were placed, but we believe that in September alone we placed in 
the California mission three or four thousand copies of the Book of 
Mormon. 

I am glad to say that about twenty-six of our branches are housed 
in comfortable chapel buildings, which they own and control. This 
has been brought about by the liberality of the presidency of the 
Church, and it has given me wonderful satisfaction to tell the people 
in the California mission that every dollar of the tithing paid through- 
out the California mission has been expended in helping to house the 
branches of California in proper meeting places. When I say that 
of California it includes portions of the state of Nevada, and portions 
of the state of Arizona. We have built during the season just closing 
a comfortable little chapel in Fresno, California. We are roofing 
at the present time in Prescott, Arizona, a wonderful chapel, built to 
endure, you would think to look upon it, forever and ever, built out 
of blocks of granite. And the preliminary steps have .been taken for 
the erection of- a chapel in Binghampton, Arizona, and in Palo Alto, 
California. So, little by little we are obtaining better foothold, and 
I am happy to say that I feel in my soul that it is not a liability, in 
any sense of the word, in the California mission, to be known as a 
member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I believe, 
with many of our non-"Mormon" friends, that the announcement that 
an individual is a member of the Church is a distinct asset to him, 
and we are held, generally speaking, in high esteem by our non- 
"Mormon" friends in Nevada, in California and in x<\rizona. We feel 
that the purposes of God are advancing", and we know, thank God, that 
we are engaged in the Lord's service. May he help us to meet our 
obligations and magnify our callings, 1 humbly pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are honored with the presence of General Charles T. Summerall, 
Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and some of his associate 
officers. He is visiting Salt Lake on a tour of inspection. We will 
ask our organist to play a selection in honor of these guests, and then 
we will be honored by listening to the General. 

An organ solo was then rendered by Edward P. Kimball. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have very great pleasure in presenting General Summerall. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

GENERAL CHARLES F. SUMMERALL 

Chief of Staff, United States Army 

President Grant and friends : It is a very distinct honor to appear 
in this noble temple, the fame of which is known throughout civiliza- 
tion, and to look into the faces of the men and women who represent 
the sterling citizenship of this great state of Utah. While I am not 
a stranger to your people, this is the first opportunity afforded to 
bring to you, as a representative of the army of our country, a greeting 
and an expression of appreciation of what the people of your faith 
have done as patriotic citizens, throughout your history, in the service 
of our country. Many, many years ago, it was my privilege to number* 
among my friends and my comrades in arms, men who represented 
not only the high ideals of the faith of your Church, but the high ideals 
of officers and soldiers of the army of our country. 

Our nation is great, not because of any material development of 
the people, so much as by the lofty faith of the religious denominations 
throughout our great land. It is the religion of a people which ha/^ 
ever marked its civilization. One cannot traverse your state and sec 
its productive fields, its prosperous and happy homes, its attractive 
and rapidly growing cities, without realizing that there is a guiding 
hand and a great influence over the minds of its population. They 
have achieved great industrial development. Their educational system 
is second to none. This morning I was only a few minutes in your 
University, and yet I was profoundly impressed by the educational 
standards, under the dominant leadership of Dr. Thomas, which must 
make you indeed very proud. You are guiding the footsteps and the 
minds of the rising generation along the paths which you and those 
who preceded you have found to be essential to make a noble, a power- 
ful, a pious and a God-fearing people. 

I stand before you, therefore, with reverence 1 at your 'accomplish- 
ments, with admiration of your ideals, and with a sense of pride thai 
I, too, am with you a citizen of this great land. We share love of coun- 
try and the flag and patriotic loyalty with our fellow citizens wherever 
they may be found. It is a noble tribute to your faith and your con- 
victions that we find today so many who have laid aside the burdens 
of their daily lives to come together for religious devotion in order 
that they might make better, not only their own lives, but the state 
and the country in which they live. 

Let me thank you, indeed, from the bottom of my heart, for this 
privilege, and to hope that I may continue to enjoy the friendship of 
your people, and the support that we need from you in carrying out 
the great mission of making our country safe for us and for those 
who come after us. Thank you. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regard it as a great honor to have listened to the very splendid

compliments that have been paid our people. I rejoice in knowing 
that there are no people in all the United States of America who are 
really more patriotic than the Latter-day Saints, or more willing to 
perform every duty that devolves upon them, and where the members 
of our people have been in the army or the navy they have made a 
record second to none. , 

The congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 
Prayer was offered by Elder George Whitehead of the St. George 
temple. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. , 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting opened at 2 o'clock in the Tabernacle, October 8, 1927. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 
The congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 
Elder Franklin S. Richards offered the opening prayer. 
The congregation sang the hymn, "How great the wisdom and the 
love." 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

There is no situation that has arisen since the organization of this 
Church, neither will there be, in the future, that the Lord has not made 
ample provision to meet. No matter how complicated it may seem to 
be or how difficult, there is, ample provision made in the wisdom of 
the Lord to solve it. 

THREATENING DANGERS FORESEEN 

We read in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon 
the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments: 

"And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled which was 
written by the prophets." 

The Lord has seen fit to warn his sons and daughters, has antici- 
pated their danger and foreseen their needs, in ample time to save them. 
He has submitted not only the warning that there is danger ahead, but 
the means of escape have been provided and in ample time to save his 
children. So that I say the Lord knew the perils of this hour that were 
spoken of yesterday, the dangers that threaten the world, this country, 
and this present civilization. These things were known by the Lord 
when he laid the foundations of this work, and he prepared his work 
to be able to withstand all the storms that should beat upon it, and that 
it should stand as a shining light before the nations of the earth. He 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



endowed us not only with the responsibility of becoming the salt of the 
earth but with every facility to attain unto that distinction. 

In the 115th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord says 
to all the Church: 

THE GOSPEL, A KEY TO THE SOLUTION OF ALL PROBLEMS 

"Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may 
be a standard to the nations; 

"And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her 
stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from 
wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth." 

I say that the Lord has made ample provision that we may arise 
and shine. The obligation is upon us. There is coming a day when 
we shall see the fruits of the gospel as it has been lived in the lives of 
the Latter-day Saints, and discover that it has not only brought peace 
and happiness to them while they live, but made them a light to 
the nations, and their salvation. In keeping these simple gospel com- 
mandments, men and women are also fortified to stand when the storms 
do beat upon the children of men, and in them lies the key to the solution 
of all the problems that at present distress the world. 

DANGERS AHEAD 

I confess to you, my brethren and sisters, that I have felt in my 
own spirit that there is danger ahead, not only for the world but for 
the Church. I recognize that the powers of evil have been arrayed 
against this Church from the beginning. When the prophet's life was 
taken, that was but one item in the program of the adversary. The 
driving of the Latter-day Saints from their homes to this western coun- 
try was another ; and their long years of struggle to maintain their right 
to exist has been contested until that right, apparently, is conceded. 
And yet I can plainly see that the adversary of this work is not yet 
satisfied. I believe that the thing he has at heart is to realize his first 
great ambition ; namely, to have the privilege of ruling over the king- 
doms of this world. He has never lost sight of it, and when he met 
the Redeemer of the world and tempted him, while Jesus was among 
men in mortality, the great purpose of that temptation was manifest 
in the last effort when the kingdoms of the world passed in panoramic 
vision before the mind of Jesus. The tempter said, Are they not won- 
derful? Would you not love them? They are mine. Bow down and 
worship me, and you may have them on easy terms. He knew that this 
was the purpose for which Christ came into the world to die — to earn 
the right to become the King of kings and Lord of lords and rule over 
them. Satan's purpose was not to give the kingdoms of the world, but 
to overcome the elect and chosen Son of God. Jesus went to Calvary 
and paid the price and earned the right to rule over the kingdoms of the 
world. Putt the enemy was not satisfied, and he encompassed Christ 
and brought about his death, and planned the death of the apostles and 
the destruction of the Church. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 1 65 

ESTABLISHING THE WORK THAT SHALL NOT FAIL 

No wonder when the' boy Joseph Smith knelt in the grove that 
before the Father and the Son could appear unto him the powers of evil 
knew that this humble instrumentality was God's means of establishing 
once again the work that shall riot fail. He is vain enough to believe, 
the enemy of our souls, that he is yet to win the contest, for he has an 
ambition to become the king of this world, and has sought to frustrate 
every proposition that our Father has made permanently to establish 
here God's work. 

How grateful I am for the assurance that we have in the vision 
which the Lord gave to Daniel of old that in the last days, when our 
Father should set up his kingdom, it should not be overthrown nor left 
to another people; and yet that kingdom shall be buffeted, and has been 
buffeted. Nephi saw it. He saw its trials, saw its dangers, dangers 
that are past and dangers that are yet ahead of it; and yet out of it 
all, we cling with joy and gladness to the assurance that these are the 
last days, that this is the last time when God shall set his hand to ac- 
complish his work, and that it shall not fail no matter how the powers 
of evil may conspire against it. 

EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO BE TRIED 

Powers of evil are not through with their opposition, neither have 
they conceded to us the right of way, but are seeking to tempt the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, to turn away from the promises of the Lord, seeking to 
blind their eyes. The spirit of self indulgence that is rampant in the 
world, that leads to such lawlessness as was described here yesterday 
will naturally have its influence over the "Latter-day Saints. There 
will not be a man or woman in this Church, a boy or a girl, who shall not 
be tempted or tried. The adversary will lay individual siege against 
every man's faith and against every woman's faith, to seek to darken 
their spirits, and have them believe that they have perhaps been deluded 
in some of these great and wonderful things ; that the Lord is not sus- 
taining the establishment of this work, or that the Lord delayeth his 
coming, or, that after all it is only a matter of opinion. The love for 
things of this world will take possession of the hearts of men even in 
this Church and blind their eyes, for the desire for material things will 
darken their spirits. But the most damning thing that shall happen is 
the sin and transgression into which men and women will go, who, 
yielding to that spirit of self-indulgence, will not be able to keep the 
•commandments of God because of not observing the Word of Wisdom, 
and they will weaken themselves until they shall succumb to a greater 
and more terrible evil, the evil of immorality, which is the end of 
self-indulgence, which has brought about the destruction of men and 
nations. 

HOW TO GAIN STRENGTH TO RESIST 

Yet the Lord has fortified the Latter-day Saints in these simple 
gospel principles, if only we shall adhere to them, to enable us to stand 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



when the storms do blow, and when the dangers threaten. Men and 
women who keep the Word of Wisdom, observing to abstain from the 
things that the natural appetite of men may crave, shall develop a 
strength and power to resist greater temptations when they come. But 
whosoever has been unable to observe this law that is suited to the 
capacity of the weakest of the weak, may not be able to survive the 
clangers that shall come. 

A WARNING OF DA.NGER 

Now, I do not want to paint a dark picture, I simply want to lift 
my voice in warning as a watchman upon the towers of Zion, that there 
is danger ahead ; that the time of peace and prosperity of the people 
becomes their most perilous time, and has been' so in all the ages of the 
past. And yet with perfect confidence I look forward throughout those 
days of individual testing to a time to come when vindication will arise 
for those who are true and faithful under all circumstances and adhere 
to these gospel principles. It is not an idle boast. We have lived long 
enough to see the fruits of "Mormonism" in the lives of Latter-day 
Saints, and by their fruits they > shall be judged, and that is a just and 
righteous judgment. 

Behold how the application of the law of tithing has helped to 
solve a problem for the Latter-day Saints. It has brought them into 
the enjoyment of facilities and opportunities, not only in a religious, but 
in a social way. It has enabled the authorities of the Church to 
provide ways and means for the social welfare of people by the building 
of recreation halls, by the building of temples and the building .of 
tabernacles, by the provisions such as are not found in any other church. 
And this by reason of the fact that the great majority of the Latter-day 
Saints have observed the law of tithing. 

SOLVING THE CONFLICT B.ETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR 

That is only, however, an incident along the way, for all this is 
a training and preparation for other things that are to come. The 
eternal conflict that has been waged between capital and labor cannot 
be solved nor shall it be solved by all the legislation that men shall enact. 
When men become their brothers' keepers, when the love of God is in 
ihe hearts of men, and they are willing to pay their honest tithing they 
are making a step towards the establishment of an order that obtained 
once in the days of Enoch and shall obtain again when the Lord Jesus 
Christ comes to rule and reign. And there shall be no rich and no poor. 
The Lord's gospel plan is the true and only solution of that problem. 

GOVERNMENT'S STRENGTH LIES IN THE PEOPLE'S OBSERVANCE OF LAW 

I rejoice in every measure that is put forth to curtail the use of 
alcoholic beverages. I rejoice to know that at one time at least in the 
history of our own country we rose to the height that we were enabled 
to establish in the Constitution of the Cnited States a law that prohibits 
the use of liquor or strong drink which every intelligent man knows is 
positively an injury to the human body. Yet I grieve to see a spirit 



ELDER MEL VIN J. BALLARD 



67 



rampant in the hearts of men who ought to know better, to temporize 
with and alter this law. If we do recede from the high ground we took 
when this country made an attempt to free itself from the destructive 
influences of alcoholic beverages, we shall start on a downward program 
that is full of danger and destruction to the people of this country. 

So far as the Latter-day Saints are concerned, we rejoice in every 
measure that seeks to preserve us from these destructive influences, and 
yet I recognize that all the legislation that can be enacted will not charge 
the appetites of men or control their will. If it becomes necessary for 
us to use half the people of this country to police the other half, civiliza- 
tion will ,be in dire peril. The strength and power of the American 
government was in the willingness on the part of the great masses of 
the people to observe the constitutional law and honor and respect it. 
We have been changing year by year from that time until the present, 
and never before in the history of our government has there been such 
a police force in use in the nation, in the states, and in the counties 
and in the cities to attempt to maintain law and order. There must come 
an awakened respect for law and order or we shall reach the point where 
51% of the people shall be lawless, and then our interests will be in 
danger, our constitution, our privileges and our rights will be in im- 
minent jeopardy. 

CIVILIZATION RESTS UPON SELF-CONTROL OF PEOPLE 

I heard an eminent economist of our country, (I refer to Dr. 
Thomas Nixon Carver) deliver an address at the commencement exer- 
cises of the University of Utah a few years ago, wherein he discussed 
the subject of how much civilization can the world maintain. He 
undertook to prove, and I believe he was successful, that the present 
civilization can endure only because the majority of the people of this 
country can maintain the power of self-control ; that a nation or a people 
who have lost the power of self-control have lost all possibility of preserv- 
ing unto themselves and their children a civilization. There was pub- 
lished last year by Professor Wiggam, an interesting treatise upon that 
very subject. He draws attention to the fact that ours is not the only 
civilization that has reached a glorious eminence. He refers to Egypt 
in all its glory, to Greece, and to the civilizations that arose and 
flourished on this American continent, that perhaps in some -respects 
excelled our own civilization. And said he : 

"We need not feel that we are secure as the mountains, or that our 
present civilization shall stand and endure no matter what may come." 

DANGERS THAT THREATEN OUR CIVILIZATION 

He points out the dangers that threaten our civilization and asks 
the question whether or not we have reached the summit and shall begin 
to recede, and whether there is in humanity itself the power to preserve 
forever a civilization. He said that it is only a short step, as nations 
in the past have shown, back to the jungle ; that while there has always 
been an element, a few, that have contended for the maintenance of 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these high standards, they have been gradually absorbed and overcome, 
and the will of the majority has prevailed and darkness has come over the 
spirits of men again. As I read riis gloomy forecast I was filled with 
this hope and absolute conviction, that the Lord God Almighty knew 
the dangers and determined to preserve a civilization that shall withstand 
all the troubles of the future. But that civilization cannot be maintained 
by the wisdom of man. God alone can do it, and the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ alone is the path and the way and the means by which that 
civilization may be preserved. 

KIND WORDS FOR THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

This same author that 1 am referring to calls attention, in a treatise 
of that subject, to the strength and power of the "Mormon" Church. It 
is gratifying to me to know that while we ourselves know the plans 
and purposes of the Lord and have faith~in those plans, that men who 
are looking from the outside are also noticing the fruits of "Mormon- 
ism" in the lives of the people. And so it ought to be. We should be 
attracting the attention of the world. 

I remember that a few years ago Dr. Carver said from this ver\ 
place where I now stand, that if he were going to . search the world 
over to study the highest state of civilization being developed he would 
come to Utah and find it among the "Mormons." I discovered in 
Boston, during my recent visit there with President Rolapp, that Dr. 
Carver is just as freely speaking there of his findings among the 
"Mormons" as he did here. For he said, on his return in 1925 from 
teaching summer school in the Agricultural College, the philosophy 
of life involved in the "Mormon" Church is the most constructive thing 
he has seen in American life. He sees only a church which embraces 
the whole faith and has a tremendous value for the adherents, so well 
is it organized, so much is it the center of all community pleasure, so 
closely does it endeavor to establish heaven upon earth. 

Dr. Wiggam, in his observations, has the following to say in Next 
Age of Man : 

"There can be little question that in all ages religious appeal has had 
great influence upon the birthrate." 

He is calling attention to the fact that nation after nation is re- 
ceding in its birthrate, that decay is setting in and the end may be that 
nations will destroy themselves by their own suicide ; and in the solution 
of this question'he sees a ray of hope in what he calls the "Mormoh" 
plan : 

"As an illustration the 'Mormon' people of Utah, under the influence of 
their religious belief, have kept up a higher birthrate among their intellectual 
and professional classes than the people of any other state of the Union. Their 
theology teaches that every child that is born means that this act of human 
beings gives another soul its opportunity to pass from a lower state of exist- 
ence through the trial state of this bodily life to a higher state of spiritual 
evolution. Dr. Johnson, a professor in the University of Pittsburgh (I met 
this gentleman in the east. He was in one of our meetings in Pittsburgh) be- 
lieves that the 'Mormon' religion is the most eugenical religion in the world." 



ELDER MELVIN 1. BALLARD

ETERNITY OF THE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP 

In this time of trouble that is threatening not only the peace of the 
nation but its life, in the destruction of the home, the "Mormon" example 
is attracting" attention, wherein we plan to be united in companionship 
not only until death does us part, but for eternity, which is quite in con- 
trast to the spirit of the age that seeks for companionship marriage 
that may be dissolved at will, without the edict of the court. t Upon 
an enduring foundation we look forward to the perpetuation and the 
establishment of these unions throughout time and all "eternity. God 
never could have provided for the strength and endurance of this 
Church on a more solid basis than he did when he established in it 
the union of families for time that shalbendure throughout all the ages, 
and gave us the conception that the children who come to us are his 
sons and daughters, entitled as much as we are to the rights and priv- 
ileges of earth life, and that it is one step onward towards their glorious 
destiny. 

There has been inculcated into our hearts, therefore, by the example 
of our fathers and mothers, through the observance of the first great 
commandment of God to multiply and replenish the earth, the true 
conception of one of the chief purposes of life that cannot and must 
not be lost sight of by the Latter-day Saints, and through adhering to it 
we shall survive and shall not perish. 

THE KERNELS OF LIFE IN GOSPEL TEACHINGS 

So each simple gospel principle has in it the very kernel of life. 
We need no new revelation. All we need to do is to get a new con- 
ception, perhaps, of those simple gospel principles contained in these 
doctrins taught during this conference: The observance of the Fast 
day, thereby taking care of the poor of the Latter-day Saints, and also 
providing for a spiritual growth and development on the part of the 
membership. The adherence to these gospel principles shall bring hon- 
esty, for the man who pays an honest tithing is inculcating deep in his 
heart the elements of honesty such as no other practice or teaching can 
do. The old "Mormon" slogan that "a 'Mormon's' word is as good as 
his bond" should be the watchword of all Latter-day Saints if we are to 
seek to distinguish ourselves and establish integrity the like of which is 
not known elsewhere. 

I think as I said a moment ago, the Lord has overlooked nothing 
in enabling us to realize these great promises. He has selected the right 
people. They are the house of Israel, sons and daughtrs of Joseph. 

WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF JOSEPH 

I read, a few years ago, an article by an eminent author in one 
of our national magazines in which he discussed the question, "Are the 
Jews the chosen people of God"? He granted to them a claim to all 
the blessings that were pronounced upon their father Judah. "But 
when," said he, "they assume to be the inheritors of those blessings 
that were pronounced upon his brother Joseph, they are usurping that 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



which they have no right to." And he concluded his article with the 
statement that if somewhere in the world we could find the descendants 
of Joseph, the descendants of Ephraim, we would indeed find the 
chosen people of God. 

WE SHOULD THEREFORE RISE TO THE LORD'S EXPECTATIONS 

How we ought to rejoice in knowing that they are found and that 
we are «the children of Joseph. These are the chosen people (if God, 
and yet not in boast fulness, but as the natural inheritors of ulessings 
and privileges. We should arise to the Lord's expectations ; and through 
his providing we ought to become distinguished and unlike the world, 
a peculiar people. The Lord brought us to the right place, in the right 
part of the United States, where, with all its natural privileges and ad- 
vantages, there can be developed an unusual race of men. Every 
environment, every setting, every struggle through which this people 
have passed and the very nature of their employment, means that there 
is in these things the building of men and women who shall arise and 
shine. I am glad to know that we have the only plan, God's plan, that 
would make any people, I care not who they are, distinguished people — 
with inspired leaders, with a man to whom the revelations of God are 
given, to tell the people what to do next in the unfolding of this program. 
With such possibilities, nothing, overlooked on the part of the Lord, 
why shall we not arise and shine, that our light indeed may be a standard 
to the nations, that we may become the salt of the earth? The power 
is in this Church, to become a mighty people. 

God bless us that we shall treasure our heritage, that we shall 
recognize that we are to do an unusual thing. We are not .called to be 
imitators, we are called to be exemplars to the world, a light that shall 
shine until the day will come when from the east to the west, the 
north to the south, they will come, not to look upon our lands nor our 
fields nor our factories, but to learn of our ways that they may walk in 
our paths, and thereby find peace, preservation and salvation now and 
eternally. 

May God bless us to keep our .eye upon our glorious destiny and 
recognize that within our hands are the means of accomplishing such 
an end, and not be blind to our privileges. The Lord help us thus to 
see his wonderful providing and go forward towards that which is 
ours, through our faithfulness, and may God grant it, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

1 ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the Canadian Mission 

During the fifteen minutes allotted to me I am very anxious 
that the spiritual feast which we have thus far enjoyed shall be con- 
tinued. 

I recognize the practical value of the principal theme of this con- 
ference — law enforcement. The Dominion of Canada is a country of 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



71 



law enforcement. They have celebrated this year the Diamond Jubilee, 
or the Jubilee anniversary of confederation. They revere the fathers 
of federation as we revere the fathers of our Constitution. They are 
not unmindful of the comparison between the United States and Can- 
ada in the matter of law enforcement. My defense has been that the 
United States is great in potentialities, in practical statesmanship, in 
self-government and in good common sense, and that it is just a ques- 
tion of a little time when the laxity of law enforcement in the States 
will be remedied. There have grown up too many technical refine- 
ments in the administration of the criminal law, and those refinements 
and technicalities will have to be swept away without impairing the 
valuable system of judge-made laws that exists in the United States. 

Canada can give us an example of law and order upon the Sab- 
bath day. No newspaper is published nor even distributed on that 
day, that I have been able to learn of in my sojourn there. 

In speaking of the missionary work in Canada : We do not have 
the background that exists in many of the missions of the United 
States, the background of from five to eight thousand members to 
support the missionary work. The statistics of the Dominion give 
our church credit for having nearly twenty thousand members, about 
ten thousand of whom are located in the stakes of the Alberta Province. 
The other ten thousand I do not know just where fchey may be scat- 
tered. Certainly there are not more than one thousand of them in 
the mission over which I have the honor of presiding. We do feel 
the assistance of the few we have, scattered as they are among the 
millions of population there, in supporting the cause. We have young 
ladies newly converted to the Church who will, stand upon the street 
corners and with very fine courage give a reason for the faith and 
knowledge which they have. At one of our conferences we called 
forward two young converts, one from the Northwestern .states mis- 
sion and one from Montreal. Each of them gave a telling speech de- 
scribing their conversion and the great joy which had come to him 
as a member of the Church. 

We are building upon the work of all those who have gone be- 
fore — the work there of President Grant, and Elders George Albert 
Smith, Orson F f Whitney, and Joseph Fielding Smith, all of whom 
have made tours through that mission. We are building upon the work 
of President , Nephi Jensen, President Joseph Quinney, Jr., and 
the hundreds of elders and sisters who have served there during the 
past decade. We are finding very many encouraging symptoms. In 
going through the districts of the mission last, month I discovered a 
marked contrast between conditions existing now and those of three 
months before. Instead of the. conferences assembling in a private 
home, as was the case in the city of London, a city of some sixty-five 
thousand people, we had two or three times the number of people in 
attendance in a public hall, and some of them had arisen as early as 
5 :30 in the morning and traveled long distances to be in attendance 
at that conference. We have no meeting houses of our own there, but 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we have about reached a stage when it will be proper to have the stabil- 
izing influences which will come to the people by owning their own 
meeting houses. I am sure the Presidency will be just as generous 
with the Canadian mission as with any of the other missions. They 
have indicated that. They have given token of that in spending the 
large sums of money necessary to build the Cardston temple. 

.We have a very fine body of elders and sisters in that mission, 
although few in number. They are of the same quality as described 
by the brethren of the other missions. It will save much time for me 
to simply incorporate in my remarks here the same words of just 
praise that have been given the missionaries in each of the other mis- 
sions by their presidents during this conference. These elders and 
missionary sisters are of the same cloth, so to speak, that these other 
missionaries come from. They manifest good zeal, good spirituality 
in all they have encountered, and when they have made it a matter 
of fasting or of prayer, the end desired has been attained. That was 
the case in the matter of having the privilege to use a Young Men's 
Christian Association pool to baptize in. As they went back after 
their fasting and prayer, without any argument, they were accorded 
the privilege denied them by the same man shortly before their fasting 
and their prayer. 

We have experiences of interest, adventures upon every street 
corner where we hold meetings ; and we are holding many street 
meetings during the summer months. The period is very short during 
which it is practicable to hold such meetings in that cold climate. Next 
month, if not this, will surely terminate the holding of street meetings 
for the year. 

While upon an elevator in the Queen's Hotel, going to luncheon, 
by invitation of a member of the Rotary Club, I was introduced to 
"Jim Hughes," as they called him in Rotarian parlance, but no less 
a person than Dr. James L. Hughes of Toronto. He said to me in 
a voice loud enough to be heard by all those in the elevator, knowing 
that I was from Salt Lake City: 

"Are you a member of the 'Mormon' Church?" 

In a tone just as emphatic I declared that I was. I did not know 
what was coming, but he followed his question and the answer thereto 
by saying : 

"Mr. Hart, dp you know that I am the first man in Canada to 
do justice through the press to your people?" 

He had written a splendid article for the Canadian Magazine 
in the April number, 1904, under the caption, "My Misconceptiqns 
of the 'Mormon' People," or some such heading. He had visited the 
tabernacle. Plis interest in the subject started from an acquaintance 
with one individual, Sister Susa Young Gates. He told me that after 
his article was published a preacher said to him, "Dr. Hughes, I am 
ashamed of you for writing the article you did." And he said, "I re- 
torted to the minister, T should think you preachers would be ashamed 
after all the fibbing you have done and are doing against the 'Mormon' 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



73 



people. I'll tell you what I will do. We will get on the train and go 
to Salt Lake City, and if you can find a single misrepresentation in 
that article I will pay the expenses for both of us. But if you are 
unable to find a single thing in which I have misrepresented the case, 
then you pay the expenses. Now, come on, let us get on the train.' " 
The preacher would not accept the challenge. 

We need such information as that and such friends to remove 
prejudice. It is not an unusual thing to find people who at first will 
rave at the mention of the "Mormon" people ; they will decline to accept 
a tract, will refuse to hold a conversation with you, but by being a 
little patient with them so as to get our cause before them, they soon 
grow apologetic. It is a rather good sign when they are so intense in 
their feelings to begin with, because after we get the truth to them 
they are more friendly than they perhaps otherwise would be. 

The missionaries there are laboring hard. For example, one of ■ 
the elders purchased a second-hand car, and used it as a means of 
conveyance by day and a bedroom by night for himself and his com- 
panion. They presented the picture slides, giving archaeological and 
geological support to the Book of Mormon, to 2,500 people scattered 
through the eastern part of the Dominion. They traveled 3,725 miles 
and held fifty-seven meetings. 

We had a choice treat in meeting at the Memorial Cottage. We 
had the honor of warming our feet at the same hearth where the 
Prophet as a child had been warmed, whose destiny was to take part 
in the greatest single achievement of the nineteenth century, — the 
coming forth of the gospel and the restoration of the holy priesthood. 
The monument to Joseph Smith is N certainly a very beautiful creation. 
Those who had to do with it are to be congratulated. The one hun- 
dred tons of granite are certainly in very beautiful form. 

It is a matter of regret to me today that I could not attend the 
unveiling of the monument to our Salt Lake boys of the 145th Artil- 
lery. I stood the other evening viewing the Mormon Battalion monu- 
ment, and it seemed to me it was a beautiful creation, and I was im- 
pressed much as the poet Vachel Lindsay was impressed, as recorded 
by his traveling companion, who gave a description of the Canadian 
temple by electric light and moonlight. For an artistic treat one 
should visit the monument not only by day but also by night. 

We were thrilled at Cumorah in celebrating the centennial of the 
anniversary of the delivery of the golden plates. We had the honor 
to there meet President Grant and several of the mission presidents. 
Those who sang, those who prayed, and those who spoke did so 
in proper appreciation of the historic significance of that occasion. 
The missionaries, two hundred of them, some of whom had traveled 
a thousand miles to be in attendance, at the invitation of President 
Grant, were greatly impressed. I am sure they received a spiritual 
elevation that will richly repay them for the journey. They made that 
journey, many pf them, by the "missionary express," and they were 
not so modest as not to remember the scriptural passage, "Ask and 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ye shall receive." They were cheerfully driven by men who acknowl- 
edged that they were not in the habit of picking up people upon the 
highway, but it seemed to be different to them on this occasion. The 
elders have preached the gospel as they traveled, and have received 
the appreciation of people of distinction who have driven them for 
hundreds of miles. ■ • , 1 

We were thrilled. by holding the exercises in the Sacred Grove. 
I look forward to the time when that will be made a Mecca more than 
it is now. I anticipate that the desire to visit there will increase from 
year to year and that they will receive spiritual exhilaration, as they 
contemplate the glories and wonders of the great event that occurred 
there more than a hundred years ago. 

My time has expired. May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and help us to put into this work all it is entitled to receive, that 
• this glorious message may go forth to all the world, is my Prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

William Holdaway sang a sacred baritone solo : "Asleep in the deep." 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and Supervisor of the 
Bureau of Information 

My brethren and sisters: The Japanese gentleman present this 
morning on the stand with us, was Dr. Seiska Tada of the University 
of Tokio, Japan. He is at the head of all the raiyways of the govern- 
ment of Japan and this is his first visit to America. Doctor Tada is 
one of the very many distinguished men who have visited the Temple 
Block mission this year. There has grown up at this mission a wonder- 
ful center for the entertainment of tourists who come to Salt Lake 
City. 

Recently we had a party of German scientists who for three days 
kept coming to my office to talk on the subject of religion and science. 
One of these distinguished men was a relative of the great German 
historian and philosopher, Oswald Spengler, whose hook entitled 
The Decline of Civilisation in the West, is one of the out- 
standing works of history. It is considered by some to be the most 
scholarly work on history written since the days of the French philos- 
ophers of the eighteenth century. 

We had the pleasure of conducting a party of French actors through 
the grounds one day this Summer, and when we took them to the stage 
of the old Salt Lake Theatre and told them the story of the building of 
the great theatre in the wilderness, they were overcome by its beauty 
and idealism. We have working at the mission fourteen brethren and 
sisters who willingly give much of their time in coming to the Bureau 
of Information to conduct tourists through the grounds and buildings. 
They are very faithful, and are doing a very important work. 

We receive letters from all over- the world asking about Utah and 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



75 



the "Mormons," and while it sometimes requires weeks to answer them, 
information is sent as requested, and many of our letters have been 
printed in leading newspapers of the world. It is necessary that we 
missionaries become careful and comprehensive readers, for the ques- 
tions asked cover a wide field of knowledge on religion, science, and 
philosophy. 

During the months of June, July, and August we have averaged from 
eight to ten thousand people a week. The groups are cosmopolitan in 
nature. One day we had twenty-two states represented, and in another 
group there were thirteen nationalities represented. It is our object 
to welcome every tourist who comes here, and to make him feel that 
we are servants in God's house, and if there is anything we can do 
for him it is our desire to do it. 

During the past year we have had a missionary class consisting 
of the missionaries of the Temple Block. To give you an idea of the 
instruction the brethren and sisters receive, I quote to you one of the 
twenty letters that was placed in their hands to study : 

TO THE MISSIONARIES OF THE TEMPLE BLOCK MISSION 

Dear Brethren and Sisters : In conversing with a company of tourists on 
the Temple Block, try to understand the nature of the people with whom you 
speak. The spirit of crowds is often very much the same, and there are some 
dominant personalities who will lead the conversation. In conversing on the 
GOSPEL, remember that you can give your views freely if you will bring your 
hearers to you. There are always so many vital truths common to all people. 
Belief in God and the great work of Jesus Christ our Lord will find a happy 
response on the part of your hearers. If you speak about the beauties of the 
Holy Bible and the Bible as a work of history and religion, you will win the 
people to your side, and then is the time to explain something of the GOSPEL 
OF JESUS CHRIST. 

Le me give you an example of how I was able to interest a crowd not long 
ago. We were in a museum, and a woman read the words of Emerson inscribed 
on the wall: "MAN IS LORD OF HIS OWN ACTIONS." As she went to 
copy them, she asked how I interpreted their meaning. The crowd was interested,' 
and immediately I had the opportunity of explaining to her the vital principles 
of the ethics of the "Mormon" people. We have the right to chose between right 
and wrong, and the choosing of right becomes more powerful on our part, as 
we discern the spirit of the Gospel of Christ by our lives and our attitude towards 
the world and humanity. In fact, the thought of Eine r son opens up the whole 
theme of the gospel : Free Agency, Faith in God, the principles of the gospel by 
which we come to know the life that God would have us live. This was the way 
I interpreted Emerson's words, and the people listened. 

Another little folder we issued is entitled The Missionary's Re- 
sponsibility. 

THE MISSIONARY'S RESPONSIBILITY 

Any faith that lasts will teach righteousness toward man as a part of duty 
toward God. It was so in all the past and will be so in all time. Thousands of 
inscriptions exhumed in these modern times teach us this truth of the past 
and we have Christ's teachings and those of his followers to guide the present. 
In this particular mission field on Temple Square, we come in close contact with 
people from every nation, every creed, every race, every tongue. They come in 
a peculiar frame of mind — they are curious, open-minded, tolerant and pleasant 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and without fear of the petty worries and anxieties of every-day life. They are 
en a vacation, free and observant; critical and appreciative. For these reasons 
and many others I believe this mission to be the greatest in the world. When they 
leave us we want them to have the wish, the desire, the determination to know 
something of the truth we believe to be the everlasting and true Gospel. We wish 
to inspire them- with our ideals, our faith, concerning what we are and what we 
know we ought to be. That "Power that makes for righteousness" and "A 
Power not ourselves" is the basis of every reasonable faith and all durable hope. 
We wish to impress them with a knowledge of this Power as it has been brought 
to us and as it has brought our lives to their present stage of righteousness 
"toward man" ; and knowledge of what God is and what he has destined man to 
be. 

We always meet these tourists and talk to them with this one thought in 
mind : "Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you, do 
ye even so to them ; for this is the law and the prophets." To live this law means 
a careful study of yourself, as well as a careful study of the attitude, the dlind, 
and the feeling of the traveler, the tourist, the stranger, the brother who comes 
to you. We meet the learned and the simple alike. The gospel to them all 
should be intelligible, attractive, and convincing, remembering always that no 
truth is really important in our lives that cannot be simply stated. St. Paul 
expressed a fear for the Corinthians that lest, "as the serpent beguiled Eve, their 
minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." Robert Louis 
Stevenson said, "My duty to my neighbor is not to make him good but to make 
him happy if I can." Does not this state Christ's admonition in another form? 
This is simple and true. How do we like to be treated? Do we wish to express 
our views? To answer this imagination is absolutely necessary. We must for 
the time be the "other one." We must develop imagination or we are ignorant 
and dull. 

Loving God, loving one's neighbor as one's self, doing justice is what the 
Lord requires of us. -It comes to 'us through study, which is work; through 
prayer, through cultivation of imagination, and sympathy. 

We are very anxious that the spirit of reverence be increased in 
our hearts, for these buildings and grounds so that the tourists may 
know rather from a spiritual influence than by words, that we have 
sincere faith in Almighty God. We show the visitors this great Taber- 
nacle and our beautiful Temple. Marvelous buildings, they are.- The 
Latter-day Saints were never so happily inspired as when they erected 
these buildings. A house of God or Temple such as this is a "part of 
the great picture book of humanity." As I look over this vast congre- 
gation to-day, I am reminded of the words of the priest, Abul-Fazl, 
which appeared on the portal of his temple in Kashmir : 

"Oh „God, in every Temple, I see people who see Thee, 
And in every language I hear, they praise Thee." 

We are often asked what these buildings represent, and the answer 
naturally brings out the resourcefulness and courage of the founders of 
the State of Utah. But they signify something vital and far more im- 
portant than the average man appreciates. I want to say that these 
buildings express the conception of the all-loving Christ as the Redeemer 
of fallen humanity. This is the thought that inspired the building of 
them, and it has vitalized every bit of our creative work and ideals in 
our history. 

I was impressed this morning by what Doctor Tada said to me. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



77 



He was to have left the building at 10 :30 and when the hour came and 
I suggested that we go, Elder George Albert Smith was speaking, and 
Doctor Tada turned and said, "I beg your pardon, but let us wait 
until the gentleman who is speaking finishes his devotions to his God ; 
then we will go." 

The success in preaching the gospel of Christ lies in the method 
of approach. Impressions are lasting things, and if we can impress 
the people of the world with the spirit of our lives, It will go much 
further than words, "For he who walketh in the light has the truth, 
and the light shineth upon the paths of men." Much has been said at 
this conference concerning the ills of human society. The social order 
is in a furor and there are five principal ills afflicting humanity. They 
are the unprecedented challenge to law and authority ; hatred between 
man and man; the abnormal aversion of work; the excessive thirst 
for pleasure as the aim of life; and the gross materialism of the day 
which denies the reality of the spirit in life. 

I wish to add a larger element to this statement. Today there is a 
great misunderstanding as to the meaning of religion. The difficulty 
with the various Christian sects is that religion does not exist for the 
saving of the souls but for the preservation and welfare of society. If 
Christ our Lord taught anything it is the fact that "Pure religion and 
undefiled is for the saving of the souls of all men." The trend of 
modern sociology has resulted in a false conception of the word 
"religion." 

There are three distinct things needed in the world today as forces 
to spiritualize humanity. First, a revival and adherence to the Ten 
Commaffdments given to Moses on Mount Sinai ; the second is a re- 
newal of faith in God the eternal father, and his son Jesus Christ ; and 
the third a divine knowledge that in this day and age of the world 
the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has been restored by 
revelation. The priesthood, sacred in its gift, divine in its influence, 
and spritual in its character, has been given to man directly by the power 
of God. These are the three great truths that must be taught to the 
human race. 

The gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is a champion of 
the truth concerning the redeeming love of God, "and is the custodian 
of a particular and exclusive way in which the redeeming power reaches 
man." To have the right kind of belief in the plan of salvation is in- 
dispensable to right relations with God. We believe in the infinite 
power of the human mind ; we hold to the truth that man is divine, and 
his personal power and individuality live throughout the countless ages 
of eternity. 1 

I pray that we may grow in knowledge and in faith ; and that the 
divine love of God will lead us to people with his divine message. 
Amen. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I am very grateful to be present at this conference, as it has " 
been a year since I was present, not being able to attend the last gen- 
eral conference of the Church. , 

Just a year ago today (Oct. 8, 1926) I left Salt Lake City, in 
company with a group of missionaries, one of whom was our eldest 
son, who is now in Germany. At that time it was my privilege to visit 
the Northern States mission in company with President John H. Tay- 
lor. I enjoyed the spirit of missionary work manifested in the devo- 
tion of the young men and women who are in the field. 

I was very sympathetic in my feelings when the mission presidents 
were making their reports, and declaring to us the testimonies and 
blessings that come to the missionaries and to the presidents of mis- 
sions because of their faith and humility in the mission field. It is a 
sacred truth that the happiest time of our lives is while in the mission 
field, and in the faithful performance of our duty. 

It is true, however, that the Lord blesses his servants both in 
the mission field and at home, for I am a witness of the fact, and I 
wish to take this opportunity to thank both the Lord and my brothers 
and sisters for their kindness, for I know that it is through the kind- 
ness of the Lord and the faith of members of the Church that I have 
thus far been so greatly blessed. 

I am very grateful that the Lord has extended his mercy to 
me and given me a testimony of his work. I am very grateful for the 
privilege of doing what little I can in his service, because I feel that 
I am one of trie weakest of the weak, and that it is an important privi- 
lege to labor in his service. I am also very grateful for the privilege of 
standing here, in the sight of those who are members of the Church, 
to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in blessing the people, for I have 
seen his blessings manifest as I administer in the stakes of Zion, and 
to individuals. I know that the Lord has blessed this Church and the 
people and that not only has he magnified those who are called into 
service and leadership, but he has blessed the people in their homes, 
in their flocks and in their herds. He has blessed us far beyond our 
gratitude and acknowledgement of his kindness. He has extended his 
mercy to the sick and afflicted, to those who are tried and those who 
have been deprived of many of their privileges. 

I desire to bring to your attention one of the items that is so 
interesting in the Book of Mormon. We are told in III Nephi, 17:7-25 
(I will not take time to read it. I think I can tell it more briefly), that 
the Lord, when he visited his people on the American continent, ex- 
pressed his joy in meeting them and his heart was touched in kind- 
ness towards them. He blessed them, and we know that they received 
his blessings because they gathered around him in the spirit of appre- 
ciation and gratitude. After he had taught them pertaining to the 
Lord's Supper and had given them the emblems of his body and 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



79 



blood, which we call the sacrament, they further desired his blessings, 
and as they gathered around him they expressed their appreciation in 
fondness. 

He desired to further bless them, and so he said, in words to this ef- 
fect : Bring your sick and your blind, your lame and those who are af- 
flicted; bring them hither and they, too, shall receive a blessing. And so 
they did. I imagine I see them now, going from home to home or 
from place to place, tenderly and lovingly bringing their sick and 
afflicted, and their blind and those who had caused them great care 
and anxiety, and there, in the love of the Lord he extended his bless- 
ings to them and healed and restored them. Then he further directed 
them to their little children, that they, too, might receive a blessing. 
They were brought, and the people saw the angels of the Lord minis- 
tering to their children. 

This is only one example of how the Lord extended his kindness 
to, the people that once lived upon this continent. He has been just 
as kind to us. I have seen the' sick healed. I have seen the power 
and kindness of the Lord made manifest to his people. I have seen 
his blessings fulfilled upon little children. I have seen little children 
offer their prayers for the restoration of the sick and afflicted, and 
I have seen those prayers answered immediately ; so that I know that 
the Lord still loves us' and is still anxious to extend further mercies, 
if we will only hearken to the teachings and counsels that we have 
received in this conference, because the Lord in all his kindness, in all 
his anxiety to bless us, to heal our sick, to restore the blind, to com- 
fort those who are in distress, and to bless those who are healthy and 
well, is bound by law. It is a wonderful thing for us to have the 
laws of the gospel, which are the laws of Christ, given to us in our 
own language and in such plainness. 

, Now, my brethren and sisters, let me plead with you as members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, accounted to be 
the most blessed people in all the world because of the wonderful 
opportunities that have come to us, and because of the fact that we have 
the gospel, the law of Christ, for we have all the blessings and privi- 
leges that the Lord in his kindness has seen fit to grant unto us for 
our happiness and our progress. Therefore we should express a 
greater appreciation for our blessings by greater diligence in serving 
the Lord, and by further preparation for the blessings which are 
promised unto the faithful. 

I see in our midst a number of Lamanites, commonly called In- 
dians. I am very grateful that they have faith as well as we do. They 
are descendants of Manasseh, and we are of Ephraim. The Lord has 
blessed the sons of Joseph who were sold into Egypt, and I was much 
interested when Brother Pratt made his report relative to the great 
nation of the house of Manasseh, for they truly are the descendants 
of Joseph, but they are the descendants through Manasseh, while .we 
are the descendants through Ephraim. Now, there may be others 
of the house of Israel among us, but the great majority of people 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who love and enjoy the blessings of the Lord upon both North and 
South America, are the people of Joseph, and they are enjoying the 
„ blessings which were declared upon the head of Joseph and his sons 
Ephraim and Manasseh. So I desire to call your attention to the 
kindness of the Lord in blessing this land and the people who live upon 
it, both in North and South America. 

I pray that the Lord will continue to bless us and further extend 
his kindness to us, and magnify us in the eyes of all the world, that 
the purposes of the Lord may be brought about through our efforts 
to serve him and keep his commandments. I know that it is a good thing 
to hold up to the world our good deeds and to strive diligently to make 
our deeds better, and to cause that our light should shine before the 
world, and to honor the Lord and to glorify him. I therefore, desire 
to put to the front the best we have, and acknowledge the hand of 
the Lord for his kindness in blessing us in our homes and in our con- 
gregations, in our fields, in our flocks, and in all that we possess. I 
pray for a continuation of God's blessing upon the land of Joseph and 
the people who possess it, upon President Grant and all the leaders 
of the Church, all who bear the priesthood, all who are called to 
lead and to direct,- that we may further honor the Lord through obey- 
ing the teachings which he has given us in such simplicity and plain- 
ness, that we may be recipients of his kindness and mercy even unto 
the end. 

I pray for these blessings and leave them with the Church and 
with this congregation in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

INTRODUCING STAKE PRESIDENTS 

With the exception oi some of the brethren who have been ab- 
sent, all of the stake presidents have had the opportunity of offering 
a prayer in our general conference. There are still some thirty-three 
stake presidents who have not had the privilege, during the past five 
years, some of them during the past seven years, of saying anything 
in our general conferences. 

I would appreciate it if the stake presidents, when they cannot 
be at our conferences, would notify us of that fact, because it must be 
a little humiliating for me to call upon brethren to pray or to preach 
for a few moments and they not be here. There are many occasions 
when it is not possible for men to be at these general conferences, 
and I have been very glad to receive excuses from those who are 
not here. 

I am going to call upon some of the brethren to make five- or 
six-minute speeches. Of course, I do not know whether they are 
here -or not, but I am going to start with those who have been longest 
neglected. 



ELDER CLARENCE GARDNER

ELDER CLARENCE GARDNER 

r 

President of the Star Valley Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters : While I feel my weakness and inability 
in addressing you this afternoon, I desire to assure you that I appre- 
ciate my standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

As I look over this congregation I feel that indeed it 'should be 
a great strength to the Church in going from this conference, in carry- 
ing with one the spirit that has been manifest during these meetings. 
I .have enjoyed to the fullest extent everything said during this .con- 
. ference, the wonderful spirit that has been manifest by the brethren 
who have occupied this position. I greatly enjoyed the excellent re- 
marks yesterday by the brethren who have been called and chosen to 
go out into the various parts of the world to lead the work of the 
Lord in proclaiming his word to the nations of the earth. My heart 
is filled with gratitude unto the Lord that I have had the privilege of 
going into the world and bearing testimony that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith is indeed a prophet of the true and living God. 
I am grateful also that my son has just returned from a mission 
after having spent two years of his time in the Eastern states in rais,- 
ing his voice in defense of the truth. I also feel grateful that I 
now have a daughter who is in the Northwestern states mission labor- 
ing for the advancement of truth in that part of the Lord's vineyard. 
I am grateful beyond words that I have been called and chosen to 
labor in the ministry of the Lord in one of the stakes of Zion. I desire 
from the bottom of my heart to fill and magnify my calling in a way 
that will be acceptable unto our Father in heaven, and also those who 
preside in this Church. 

I feel that we are indeed a blessed people. I love my adopted 
state, the state of Wyoming. I was born in the state of Utah and 
moved to Wyoming. I want to tell you we have a splendid people there. 
Lor a number of years in our schools, and in our different gatherings, 
our children would sing of Utah, "Utah, the queen of the West," but 
today after years in that state our children have learned to sing "Wyo- 
ming, we love thee." And we do love Wyoming. We have a splendid 
people, and I find in my travels throughout that state that we are 
becoming established in every part of it. Branches are being organ- 
ized in all parts of Wyoming. Therefore, no matter where we go, 
whether it be Canada, on the north, or Mexico, on the south, or whether 
it be in these stakes and wards of Zion, we find the same testimony 
borne, we find the same spirit manifest in all parts of the United 
States. I am grateful for this, and it is a testimony unto me that we 
have the truth, that we hear the same teachings, no matter where we 
go. As we meet upon these grounds, and as we meet our brethren and 
sisters in this conference, whether or not we have met them before, 
as we take their hands we feel that same good spirit coming from them, 
v/hich to me is also a testimony that we are engaged in the work of 
the Lord. K

more conferences of the Church without being thus embarrassed. But 
I do appreciate the confidence of my presiding brethren. I appreciate 
the privilege of coming here and partaking of the spirit of this con- 
ference, and of mingling my testimony of the truth of this work with 
those who have spoken before me. 

The message that I would like to leave with you this afternoon 
is this: If, as brethren and sisters in the wards and stakes, you will 
avail yourselves of the opportunities that come to you to entertain 
the general authorities of the Church, and take them into your homes, 
I am sure you will never regret it. But on the contrary it will be the 
greatest influence in the lives of your children that can come to them. 
I speak as one who was reared in a home where the general authorities 
of the Church visited for thirty-five years. I believe that their asso- 
ciation, their example and their teachings in my father's home have 
done as much as any other influence to inculcate a love of the gospel 
in the hearts of his children, and I would like at this time to thank the 
general authorities for their wonderful influence in my life and the 
lives of my children and those whom I love. 

As has been stated in this conference by some of the previous 
speakers, the strength of the Church lies in the individual testimony 
of its members. We are not depending upon the testimony of the 
general authorities or upon the testimony of others, but each of us can, 
if- he will but live for it and study, gain for himself that testimony that 
will give .him a knowledge that this is the work of God in which we 
are engaged. It seems to me that we have some of the most beautiful 
principles in the gospel, and that the world should see them, and some 
of them have seen, as was quoted from Emerson, who said : 

"The vice of our theology is seen in the claim that the Bible is a closed book, 
and that the age of inspiration is past." 

This great thinker recognized what was the vice in their theology. 
Thank God we have, in our Church, inspiration, that we have books 
that have come to us, such as the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, which make clear the prin- 
ciples taught in the Bible, and to us the Bible is not a closed book, 
because we have with us the living oracles of God. 

It is my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that the work we 
are engaged in is true. May God help us to do our duty. I desire in 
closing to read a verse from the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in 
which he is appointed, in all diligence! 

■"He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns 
not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to 
stand. Even so. Amen." 

ELDER GEORGE A. LITTLE 

President of the Oquirrh Stake of Zion 

My dear brethren and sisters: This is not altogether>a surprise 
to me. However, I was very much surprised this afternoon, because

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I thought the time would be occupied by the other brethren who were 
called to the stand. | 

I am pleased and proud of this opportunity of standing before 
the Saints in this general conference. It has been my privilege to 
be called to preside over the Oquirrh stake which lies on the west side 
of this valley. It consists of five wards and about five thousand mem- 
bers. We are situated in the section where the Utah Copper and the 
American Smelting and Refining companies have their works. A 
large number of the members of our stake consists of men and women 
who are working for these companies. A great many transients come 
into our midst. One of the bishops, a short time ago, told me that 
there were 128 recommends sent out of his ward this year. We are 
receiving new people continually and others are moving out, and 
it is rather difficult for us to keep our organizations in working order, 
as we would like to have them. However, we have a faithful people, 
a class of people who are anxious to serve God and keep his com- 
mandments ; and even though men and women come into our com- 
munity and remain there only a few months, we find them to be good, 
faithful Latter-day Saints, and willing to do anything that God has 
asked them to do, or willing to do anything they are called upon to 
do by those presiding over them. We appreciate this. We appreciate 
the spirit that exists among the Latter-day Saints in our stake. 

What a wonderful privilege it is to be a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a . Church of development, 
it is a Church of privileges. 

When the brethren were reporting their missions today, it took 
me back to the time when I was called into the mission field, and I 
sometimes feel .that I would like to be called there again. What a 
wonderful thing it is to go out into the world and preach the gospel 
to the people, and bear testimony to them, and to know that the gospel 
is true when you are preaching it to the people. When I went to the 
doors of the people to carry my message to them, it was a reality 
to me. I knew as I know today that the gospel is true, and I knew 
that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God. I knew that God had 
called his servants out into the world to preach the gospel, and 1 
could not understand how it was that sometimes the people could not 
see and understand that our missionaries were really preaching the 
true principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, because of the strong 
testimony that they bore and the earnest desire they had to 
carry that message to the people, and the Spirit of the Lord that ac- 
companied th'em while they were doing so. The young men would 
leave their rooms with determined looks upon their faces and with 
an anxious desire to find someone who was seeking after truth. They 
would go from door to door and find some who would listen to them, 
but there were many who would reject them. 

1 am thankful that my father was a pioneer, and that I was born 
of goodly parents ; that mv mother was a pioneer. I am thankful 
that I have been born and reared in the Church of Jesus Christ of 



ELDER GEORGE A. LITTLE 



85 



Latter-day Saints, and that I was born under the covenant. I have 
a strong testimony that the gospel is true. I am thankful for the 
privilege of bearing my testimony to you this afternoon, and I pray 
that God may bless us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The time is far spent, there is little re- 
maining." _ ■ 

The closing prayer was pronounced by Elder Nathan Ricks, 
The conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, October 
9, 1927. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday Morning, 10 o'clock, October 9, 1927. 

The great tabernacle which had been comfortably filled by an ever- 
increasing number of people during the past meetings of this session of 
conference, was this morning filled in every space both in the galleries 
and imam hall, and hundreds were standing in the doors and aisles. 
The Assembly Hall, where an overflow meeting was held, was filled to 
capacity, and many were unable to gain admission to either building, 
and remained on the grounds or in their homes listening to the services 
by radio. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the choir and congre- 
gation would sing the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

Following this song, which was sung with enthusiastic spirit, the 
opening prayer was offered by Elder Edward J. Wood, President of 
the Alberta stake of zion. 

A duet and chorus by members of the Tabernacle Choir sang, "An 
angel from on high." 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

This is a glorious day for the Latter-day Saints. We live in a- 
glorious land ; for in spite of all the crime that is committed — and 
it is shameful that there is so much of it — this is the land of Zion 
spoken of by the prophets ; and this country, especially this inter- 
mountain country, this western country, is the place for Latter-day 
Saints. We are a God-blessed people. If you don't think this is a 
goodly land, and a blessed country, go down into Mexico, our neighbor 
on the south, or over to Europe ; go to Russia, to China or Japan, and 
you will return here and say this land, which the Lord in his mercy 
has given to us, is the best in all the world. 

PROGRESS OF THE WORK OF THE LORD 

We have heard during the sessions of this conference concerning 
the progress of the work of the Lord. I have been much encouraged and 
thrilled in my soul by the remarks that have been made, showing the 
evidences of the growth and development of this great latter-day work. 
We are commissioned to preach the gospel. Every elder of this Church 
has that mission. He should feel, as St. Paul expressed it, that "a 
dispensation of the gospel has been committed unto me, and woe unto 
me if I preach not the gospel." 

WE ARE ALL MISSIONARIES 

We are all missionaries in that sense, by the power and authority 
of the holy priesthood, and we ought to be filled with the spirit and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



determination /to extend this work and to build it up. From almost 
every part of the earth come calls for more and still more missionaries. 
We can't get enough to meet the demand. Then along with the spiritual 
side, the necessity for more preachers of righteousness, there is a 
growing demand also on the material side for more meeting houses, 
for means to extend the work. 

We say — and we prove it, too, by our works — that we do love this 
great latter-day work of the Lord. But do we do all that we should 
for it? The test of love, after all, is what will you do for the thing 
you love, the person you love, the institution you love, the country you 
love? How much will you do for it? , Will you give your life for it? 
Will you give up your means for it ? . To what extent will you help to 
build it up in a material way? This tabernacle, for example, was not 
built simply by preaching and praying. It was built by hard labor. It 
took material, it took work, it took means. 

BUILDING MEETING HOUSES 

We have heard from the president of the Church" down through 
the presidents of stakes and presidents of missions, of the wonderful 
development that has occurred in the building -of meeting houses in 
the Church. Let me just give you some figures. I will read first the 
expenditure for meeting house purposes in all the Church for the year 
1917. That is ten years ago and the people were doing well then, 
according to the means they had. The entire appropriation for meet- 
ing houses for that year, 1917, was one hundred sixty-eight thousand 
dollars. Now, in nine months of this year, just to the end of Septem- 
ber, the trustee-in-trust has paid out in appropriations for stake and 
ward meeting houses, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. For 
the same period last year, 1926, it was four hundred thousand dollars. 
So you see the amount appropriated for that activity alone, the building 
of meeting houses,' has been enormous. , . 

I hope the time will never come when there will not be a call for 
more meeting houses, because if such a time should come, there would 
be no more growth.' Since we expect to grow and expand and to keep 
on growing and expanding, there will necessarily be additional calls 
for more meeting houses and more elders to preach the gospel. 

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PAYMENT OF TITHING 

One other item : Comparing the tithing of 1926 with that of 1917, 
it shows an increase in nine years of about forty per cent only, whereas 
the appropriation for meeting houses increased in the same period be- 
tween four and five hundred per cent. I have not included the ap- 
propriations that have been made for meeting houses built in the mis- 
sions. That is additional. I will not take the time to go into the details 
of the figures, nor in the increase of Church population, etc; it would 
take too long. But the point is that all this requires means, and I am 
under covenant, and you are under covenant, to furnish the means to 
build up this Church. How? By tithes and offerings. 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



In the observance of this principle nearly every member of the 
Church can improve, can't we? How many hundreds are there, not 
thousands, but how many hundreds are there in the whole Church who 
pay strictly and exactly one- tenth of all their interest? The revelation 
says one-tenth of all your interest annually. How many of us do it? 
There are some, of course, but there are not many who cannot improve 
and perform more fully this duty in respect to this matter. 

The Lord commanded the law of tithing in ancient times. He 
has revealed it to us in this dispensation. You may read in Genesis 
that first of all, Abraham, Jacob's grandfather, paid tithes of all that 
he had to Melchizedek; and then Jacob, the father of the twelve tribes 
of Israel, made this covenant with the Lord : "Of all that thou shalt 
give me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee." In Leviticus 27 :32, the 
Lord says this concerning the tithe of the herd and of the flock, "the 
tenth shall be holy unto the Lord." Solomon, in Proverbs, 3rd chapter, 
9th verse, says : 

"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of thine 
increase. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out 
with new wine." 

In the last book of the Old Testament the Lord, speaking through 
the Prophet Malachi, reproved the Saints in that day. I don't think 
we need such a stern rebuke as he gave them, but these were his words : 

"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have 
we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. * * * Bring ye all the tithes into 
the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, 
saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and 
pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." 

THE LORD'S REQUIREMENT 

Here was a challenge to them to prove the Lord. That same chal- 
lenge is open to every Latter-day Saint today. 

"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy 
the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time 
in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. 

"And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land, 
saith the Lord of hosts." 

You can read the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
with respect to this principle of tithing, and that same thought occurs 
in it, namely, that if you will pay your tithing the very land shall be 
sanctified and shall be made holy. Let me take occasion to read a little 
of this revelation to the Prophet Joseph, given in July, 1838: 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put 
into the hands of the bishop of my Church in Zion. 

"And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people. 

"And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all 
their interest annually ; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever ior 
my holy priesthood, saith the Lord. 

"Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



89 



the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe 
this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you. 

"And I say unto you, If my people observe not this law, to keep it holy and 
by this law sanctify the land of Zidn unto me, that my statutes and my judgments 
may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it 
shall not be a land of Zion unto you. 

"And this shall be an ensample unto all the stakes of Zion." 

THE SAVIOR'S VIEW ON TITHING 

We have the commandment from the prophets of old, and here also 
is the command through the prophet of the last dispensation. I know 
it is contended by some people that the Savior in restoring the fulness 
of the gospel in his dispensation did not insist on the law of tithing, 
and that it was done away in the law of Moses, etc. Anyone who 
takes that position is entirely wrong, for here is the word of the Savior 
rimself, in the gospel according to St. Luke, 11:42: 

"But woe unto you, Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner 
of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God; these ought ye to Have 
done, and not to leave the other undone." 

In other words pay your tithing, ,of course, but don't go around 
boasting about it as you do. This ye ought to have done, said he, and 
the other ye ought not to have left uundone. So there is the positive 
injunction of the Savior of the world that the principle of tithing shall 
be observed. 

HAVE FAITH TO PROVE THE LORD 

My brethren and sisters, my testimony is that I could always get 
along better and be more prospered, more blessed and " certainly more 
satisfied in my heart and soul, at the end of the year, if I got along with 
90 per cent and gave the Lord his ten per cent. I have tried to do that ; ! 
not perfectly, not as I should, but I have done it well enough to prove 
the Lord. I accepted the challenge which he made through Malachi : 

"Try me and prove me herewith, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, 
and pour out j& blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." 

I have proved the truth of it in my own experience and to my own 
satisfaction. I know there are those who quibble about it and say: 
"Will 90 pounds of flour go as far as 100 pounds of flour? Will 
$90 go as far as $100? If you are spending a dollar a day, will not 
the one amount last 100 days and the other last only 90 days ?" 

Yes, mathematically you are correct, but, spiritually and counting 
faith in God and in his promises, you are all wrong. For "without faith 
it is impossible to please God." You may take as a sample a couple 
■ of men working— I have in mind two such men now. One spends all 
his means, and hasn't enough to pay tithes, he thinkjs. The other 
struggles along and pays his tithing. At the end of the year the one 
who has paid his tithing is better off somehow or other. He has had 
less sickness, less of what we call bad luck, and a better "break" as they 
phrase it, than the other man has had at the end of the year. 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

SANCTIFY THE LAND OF ZION KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS 

I bear witness before you, my brethren and sisters, that if we keep 
that law, the Lord, just as he has promised, will sanctify the very land, 
and it shall be the land of Zion to us. It is a land of Zion to the man 
who has paid his tithing honestly before God. He feels it in his soul. 
He feels that he is dwelling on a blessed, happy, prosperous land. He 
knows that he is keeping the commandment of the Lord. Do you not 
think the Lord, by his Spirit, will sanctify and bless the very land for 
us according to his promise? I know he will, I feel that way when 1 
come on this block. Time and again, especially if I am alone, my hat 
goes off in reverence as I step inside the wall. Why? Because I feel 
in my heart and in my soul that the very ground upon which I stand is 
holy, sacred unto the Lord. It has been blessed by the ppwer of the holy 
priesthood and it is sanctified, so that the spirit of reverence, the spirit 
of thankfulness to God comes over me, and off comes my hat, in 
token of that reverence. 

I know, too, that in our homes, with our farms, in our merchandis- 
ing and all that we have, if we keep this law, we will sanctify to the 
Lord the land upon which we dwell, the homes in which we live, and 
all that we engage in; and we will feel the influence of his spirit and 
know by the power of the living God that we are helping to build up 
his work, far more, of course, than we would if we fail to obey this 
commandment. 

HOW THE TITHING IS EXPENDED 

I repeat, means are called for as well as prayers. Prayers are 
necessary, preaching is necessary, but it takes work, it takes means to 
build up the kingdom of God. 

I have just given you enough figures to illustrate how the means 
are expended. I could give a great many mbre items. In closing, I 
just want to take occasion to say that the funds that you give to the 
Trustee-in-Trust of the Church are honestly and wisely expended with 
absolute integrity and sincerity of purpose, supplemented by the wisdom 
that the Lord gives. No man or set of men could expend them with 
greater care. I know that. I have known it for twenty years, for I 
have been in the Presiding Bishopric and with the President of the 
Church since that time. You can strust these men implicitly. They 
have not the first selfish thought for themselves with respect to any 
of the means. Every penny is as sacred as if it were held by any of 
your own family. You can depend upon that. President Grant is 
almost an exception among men in this regard. He almost leans over 
backwards in the strictness of his integrity and honesty. 

PROVE THE LORD IN THE PROPER SPIRIT 

Now I have taken all the time I should. The Lord bless Zion, bless 
latter-day Israel. May we as members of the Church resolve now once 
again in our hearts and souls that we will prove him, not in the way ■ 
of challenge, not in the way of saying : "Here, I am giving you some- 

/ 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. NIBLEY 



91 



thing, and I want a whole lot more in return." No, that kind of spirit 
itv paying tithes will not get you any blessing. The Lord loveth a 
cheerful giver — one who can go to the bishop and say : "Bishop, I 
feel all right. I want to help the Church. I am going to do all I can. 
Here is my tithing, my full tithing. I want to build up this work and 
be the means of helping it." If he goes in that spirit, thankful for 
what he has received, he will obtain the blessing. But let him not give 
something merely in the hope of getting more in return, for that spirit 
will not do at all. Let him give in this spirit : "Lord, thou hast blessed 
me. Here is thy portion. Of all that thou wilt give unto me, I will 
surely give a tenth unto thee." The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem : "The earth is the Lord's and the ful- 
ness thereof." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

MESSAGE OF THE WORD OF WISDOM 

I know of nothing wiser than the Word of Wisdom. I regard this 
great message from the Lord as being one of the most distinctive and 
one of the, most vital contributions coming to the world through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Like all great messages and documents it con- 
notes even more than it denotes. It is given in sufficient detail to 
obviate all ambigtiilty, and at the same time it is sufficiently general to 
have application to many phases of life and to all of those items which 
enter into clean living. It proceeds upon the assumption that the 
greatest thing, in life is living, and that the most indispensable thing, to 
good living is health — bodily, mental and spiritual. 

We cannot contemplate a good man who does not have respect 
for the sacred institution of his body. God has given to us in this 
dispensation a new conception of the body of man. It is something 
more than earth and the elements of earth. We believe that the spirit 
is the literal child of God, that it comes to earth in divine providence 
to take on mortality, that while here it is housed in a tabernacle, 
that that tabernacle itself is made through the beneficient provision 
of the Creator in his own likeness. In that conception no one may" 
defile the tabernacle, wherein dwells the spirit, without offering affront 
to God who gave it. He cannot pollute his body with poisonous or 
disintegrating substances without committing an offense against his 
God and his Creator. 

SENT BY WAY OF GREETING 

The Word of Wisdom has come to us in what seems to me the 
most excellent, the most pleasing manner possible to give a message. It 
came by way of greeting to the Saints, not by way of constraint — so 
it states — in which respect it has seemed to me to be comparable to the 
greatest messages which came from the Redeemer of the world when 
in the flesh he spoke to mankind. It rings with the same spirit as 
do the Beatitudes, wherein the Christ said, not by way of constraint, 
not in the thunder of commandment, but in that lovely spirit which 



* 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



characterized his ministry : "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they 
shall see God. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." 
So he gave to us this fundamental message of life and health and 
strength and purity, "as a' principle with promise." 

Is it less binding upon us ; does it constrain us the less, because 
the Lord has said that it is pleasing unto him that we should do; the 
things here enumerated and avoid the things here enjoined? 

SPIRIT AND BODY CLOSELY RELATED 

Within it comes to me the very genius of the philosophy of the 
gospel. Where is the man, impure in body and defiled, within whom 
may dwell the Spirit of the Most High? Is there not the closest of 
relation between the condition of our tabernacles and the spirits which . 
therein reside? I take it that one of our supreme messages to the whole 
world is the word which comes from this transcendent statement of the 
fundamentals of our very faith : Keep clean your bodies and undefiled, 
in order that you may serve God and work out your destiny in mortality. 

We have heard considerable during this conference relative to 
the. disorders of society and the great iniquity which prevails in the land. 
If it were possible to make a survey of all those who' have been quilty 
of infraction of the law, and who have perpetrated crimes against 
society,, we should not find that the perpetrators of these offenses were 
men and women who have had sacred regard for the tabernacle of their 
spirits and kept clean their bodies which God gave to them. 

The most serious, the direst consequences which follow an infrac- 
tion of the Word of Wisdom in my judgment, are spiritual, rather than 
physical; for while the body may be impaired, the spirit suffers most. 
When the boy begins to smoke he usually ceases to pray, and when he 
ceases to pray he loses contact not only with our Father in heaven 
and his uplifting influence, but he often becomes estranged from his 
family and the best people and is thrown into environment which fre- 
quently brings his downfall. 

TEACH PURITY AND CLEANLINESS OF LIFE 

So, my brethren and my sisters of theChurch, I charge you to go 
forth among the youth of Zion and give to them the lofty conception 
that we have of the bodies which God in his kindness has given to us. 
Do all that lies within your power to keep them from polluting these 
sacred institutions. Exhort them to preserve their purity for efficient 
service in the kingdom of our Father, for if they keep clean they will 
be fit instruments for the working out of the great purposes of our 
Lord. Let us devote our time and our energy, our preaching and our 
teaching, to the cleanliness of life that follows the keeping of the Word 
of Wisdom. I pray also that the message which comes from this great 
and remarkable statement given to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
may go beyond the confines of the Church into all corners of the 
earth, that men and women may understand that they are created in the 
image of God and have sacred obligation to preserve that image in all 
respects.

"We love God. As we love him we will do what he asks. He has 
asked us in the most kind and affectionate way to do these things for 
our own welfare, for our prosperity, for our spiritual growth and de- 
, velopment, for the preparation we need to make to carry forward 
his great work, to preach the gospel in its fulness, and to give to man- 
kind proper conceptions of life. Surely as we love him we will follow 
his admonition and yield to his kindly persuasion. I pray that his 
spirit may attend us in the keeping of our bodies pure and immaculate, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE. F. RICHARDS 

It is exceedingly gratifying to those who have responsibility for the 
- conduct of this great latter-day work to witness the large attendance at 
' this conference, this large Tabernacle being filled to overflowing, as 
well as the Assembly Hall, and great crowds of people on the grounds, 
perhaps thousands. And this, notwithstanding the fact that a great 
many people in their homes today are hearing the proceedings of the 
conference through their radio sets. 

SALVATION AN IMPORTANT QUESTION 

I have been edified and built up by what I have felt and heard 
during the sessions of this conference. My heart has been made to 
rejoice exceedingly. Every speaker has spoken upon some one or more 
phases of the gospel, and the gospel is given us that we might know 
what salvation is and how we may attain that boon and blessing. There 
is no other question of such great importance to mankind as that of 
salvation, of what it consists and how it may be attained. There is 
no other question that has engaged the attention of so many people 
as that of salvation, and perhaps there is no other question upon which 
there has been such a diversion of views and opinions. As I understand 
it, this is the cause of there being so many religious sects, creeds and 
denominations upon the earth today, and this fact is strange when we 
think that all these religionists have based their views and established 
their creeds and denominations upon a belief in the Bible, and its 
doctrines. 

WHY SO MANY CREEDS? 

It seems to call for an answer to the question: Why'is it so? 
And I am reminded of the sayings of the scripture that prophecy came 
not in olden time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as 
they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The contents of the Old and 
New testaments, then, are the things of God given to the children of 
men by the inspiration of the Hbly Ghost. The trouble with men 
today, and the cause of this spiritual darkness that is found everywhere 
throughout Christendom is that men lack that spirit, the power of the 
Holy Ghost, that was enjoyed by the prophets who wrote and spoke 
t:he things contained in that sacred book, the Bible. If we had the 
same spirit, the same measure of that spirit, we would understand as 
they understood, and we would all understand alike. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



REPENTANCE NECESSARY 

Why do we not get the Htjjy Spirit, the measure necessary to 
understand these things aright? The answer is that we have not taken 
the course that is indicated by the gospel, by the scriptures, to obtain it. 
A man must be born again in order to even see the Kingdom of God. 
He must be born of water and of the spirit, to receive the Holy Ghost 
in the measure that it was enjoyed by the prophets who gave us the 
word of the Lord contained in the holy scriptures. We must be born 
again, first of the water and then of the spirit, but before we can 
receive these ordinances and these great blessings, our faith in God 
must be such as will be approved of him, that will lead us to do the 
things that he would have us to do, as fast as, they are made known 
unto us. We must have that faith that will lead us to forsake evil 
and wrong-doing of every kind, tp repent of our sins, to right the 
wrongs which we have done, as far as it lies in our power, and to for- 
give our fellowmen who have trespassed against us, even as we desire 
to be forgiven. Then when we receive the ordinance of baptism by 
immersion, by one having authority, and have hands laid upon our 
heads for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, and confirmation to member- 
ship in the Church of Christ, our sins are washed away, the Holy Spirit 
comes upon' us, even the Holy Ghost, whose office it is, and his mission 
is to bear witness of the Father and of the Son, and of the truth of 
all things. 

OUR MISSION TO MAKE PLAIN THE WAY OF SALVATION 

Our mission as Latter-day Saints is to the world to make plain the 
way of life and salvation. With us what salvation is and how it may 
be obtained is no longer a question. That question has been solved. 
We know the way. God our Father, because of his love for us, desires 
above all other things that we shall have salvation in his kingcjpm, 
exaltation where he and his Son Jesus Christ dwell, and that we might 
have salvation he has made the provisions of the gospel, including the 
atonement wrought out by his Son Jesus Christ. He has also given 
us the organization of the Church. One might ask why all this religious 
activity in the Church, and all that we see of the auxiliary associations? 
It is necessary ; the salvation of man depends upon it. These children 
of Zion are to have their faith established, and they are to become so 
educated in the work that they in turn may be able to take responsibility 
and labor for the accomplishment of God's purposes. Why all this 
effort and this expenditure of means in the pre'aching of this gospel, 
as it is done by the Latter-day Saints? The answer is, the 
salvation of man depends upon it. Why the building of temples and 
the work that is accomplished therein at such tremendous effort and 
expense? The salvation of man depends upon it; and the salvation of 
man is the end in view that our Father in heaven has. All his works of 
which we have any account are but a means to that end, and it is 
because he loves us. The sacrifice made by the Savior — for he gave 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



95 



himself willingly as such — is the result of love for us, because we are 
the children of his father, because we are his brothers and his sisters. 
What a glorious truth, what a glorious principle, that we are born 
sons and daughters of God. That is why he loves us with a perfect 
love, because we are his sons and daughters. We ought to love him with 
all our hearts, with all our minds, and with all our souls, and serve 
h'im and keep his commandments, seeking to know his will concerning 
us and doing it at all hazards. 

TESTIMONY 

Brethren and sisters, I know that this is the work, of the Lord. I 
rejoice in the light that has come to us through the everlasting gospel. 
I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I am not afraid to 
bear this testimony. I never have been. It is my responsibility, and 
it gives me the greatest of pleasure to have the opportunity to testify 
of these great facts. I know just as well that Brigham Young, who 
succeeded the Prophet Joseph Smith in presiding over this Church, was 
inspired of God, that he held the place the Lord prepared for him, and 
that his work was acceptable unto the Lord. And so I know of each 
of the succeeding presidents of this Church. They were the mouth- 
pieces of God unto this people, inspired of the Lord for their work, and 
the work has grown and prospered ; and today he who stands at the 
head is an inspired man of God. We know him because he is mortal, 
and we see that which is mortal of him perhaps more apparent than 
that which is divine, but we who have association with him so closely 
bear witness to you as Latter-day Saints and to all the world, that 
Heber J. Grant has uppermost in his heart the desire to know what the 
will of our Father is concerning this great latter-day work and this 
people, and to do the thing that our Father would have him to do. 
He is inspired, has been and ever will be, and under his administration 
this work will go on and prosper. I know that this,work will triumph, 
that it is our Father's work, that he is at the helm. Men cannot ac- 
complish this. There is nothing that we can do without his help, but 
with his help, his purposes will be accomnlished, and his name will be 
glorified in the earth. 1 bear this testimony to you, brethren and sisters 
and friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus' Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

WE KNOW NO PARTY 

In time of war we know no party; all come to the defense of the 
country. In this hour, when Constitution and laws are being ridiculed, 
there ought to be no Democrats and no Republicans, no Prohibition- 
ists and no Socialists, but only the one great party — the party of those 
who stand for law and' order, for the Constitution of our country and 
the liberties for which we have paid so great a price. 

* Surely this, the greatest country in the world, is not bringing up 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a generation of young folks who carelessly, recklessly, and thought- 
lessly break the laws and trample the Constitution under foot, shouting 
in drunken laughter that this sacred document is "only a scrap of paper." 

Four things I desire to mention in the few moments' that I stand 
before you : First, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon ; secondly, 
a brief reference to the teachings of this book ; thirdly, the greatest 
problem that confronts the people of the United States at this moment — 
lawlessness and disrespect for law ; and fourthly, in a few words, I desire 
to make an appeal to you, here in the tops of these everlasting hills, to 
come to the defense of the Constitution of the United States. 

I. THE BOOK OF MORMON 

• 

My lifetime has been devoted to the study and the teaching of 
mathematics and engineering. I think I am not regarded as one given 
- to hysteria. I have asked many scientific men to offer a solution for 
Joseph Smith and the work that he accomplished. I have not found 
anyone able to give any other explanation than that which we give ; that 
is, that Joseph was directed in his work by divine Providence. One man 
might be deceived; but can you deceive three or four together? 

THE THREE WITNESSES 

"Be it known unto all nations * * * and people, unto whom this work 
shall come : That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus 
Christ, have seen .the plates which contain this record. * * * We know that 
these plates have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath 
declared it unto us. * * * And we also testify that we have seen the engrav- 
ings which are upon the plates. * * * And we declare with words of sober- 
ness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid 
before our eyes, that wc beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; 
* * * And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord 
commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to lie obedient unto 
the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things." 

THEY WERE NOT DECEIVED 

Let us consider that testimony. Is it not remarkable, odd, strange 
— something new in the world ? One man might be mistaken ; but can 
three or four ? Here are the Prophet and three witnesses. They say : > - 

"And we declare with words of soberness" — three sane men, mark 
you — "that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought 
and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the 
engravings thereon ; and it is marvelous in our eyes" — marvelous to me, 
marvelous to you, marvelous to all the world for an angel in these days 
to come down from heaven. 

"Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear 
record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we 
bear testimony of these things." 

In this skeptical age when the world doubts nearly everything, 
men might not be satisfied with the testimony of the Prophet himself 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



97 



and these three witnesses; so there are eight more, twelve in all, who 
bear also the same testimony : 

EIGHT MORE WITNESSES 

"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom 
this work shall come : That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, 
has shown unto us the plates * * * which have the appearance of gold.". 

Does anyone suppose that these witnesses were deceived in that 
respect? They say the plates had the appearance of gold. People may 
object: "All that glitters is not gold; the witnesses may have been in 
error." But their testimony is : "They have the appearance of gold ; 
and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did 
handle with onr hands." Can eight men be so deceived? Can they 
come along, one after another, and handle with their hands plates 
which have the appearance of gold and be deceived as to their reality? 

"we have seen and hefted" 

"As many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with 
our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appear- 
ance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with 
words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and 
hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has * * * the plates of 
which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto 
the world that which we have seen. And we lie not. God bearing witness of it." 

I want someone who thinks these testimonies are not true, 
to account for them. 

TESTIMONY OF THE SPIRIT - 

Those who were in the Assembly Hall this morning listened to 
the reading of the sixth chapter of Jacob in a silence as profound 
as I have ever observed in an audience. When you go to your 
homes, open that book. If you can read the sixth chapter of 
Jacob as it was read this morning, and can be impressed as was 
this audience, I believe that a light of heaven will shine into your 
souls, and bring to you the conviction which we call a testimony, 
that this is scripture. 

II. TEACHINGS OF THE BOOK 

A PERVERSE GENERATION 

From Helaman, 13th chapter — that odd number 13 — I shall 
read from the 38th verse, a few words spoken by Samuel the Lamanit^ 
prophet, as he stood upon the walls of the city of Zarahemla : 

"O ye wicked and ye perverse generations * * * how long- 
will ye choose darkness rather than light?" Does not that sound like 
scripture? — like the gospel of Jesus Christ? It seems to me that, gener- 
ation after generation, as Samuel explains, the human family "will 
choose darkness rather than light."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



CYCLES OF HISTORY 

Nations go around in a cycle. Out of poverty comes religion ; out of 
religion come character, honor, industry and dependability; the result 
is faith. Then come success, prosperity, riches — all the bright lights; 
but with these, temptation and that darkness spoken of by this 
prophet arise. Sin, iniquity, wickedness, follow this darkness, 
and thus again, the causes of poverty return. Within a few genera- 
tions, we begin with poverty, rise into riches and success, then 
go back to poverty. Speaking to the people in Zarahemla, Samuel 
says : "In the days of your poverty you shall cry unto the Lord, 
saying, O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us?" 
Then he continues : 

/ 

HOW TO BUILD MEN 

"But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day 
of your salvation * * * ye 'have sought all the days of your lives for that 
which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity." 

And does not the world, at this minute, seem to be seeking 
for happiness in doing iniquity? It is character, it is honesty, it 
is integrity, sincerity, dependability, that will bring stable suc- 
cess. This Church is struggling to bring up a generation of people 
having these qualities. The Relief Society conference, just adjourned, 
was struggling to learn what to do before and after children are born, 
to make them young men and young women with the qualities of Abra- 
ham Lincoln, upon whose life and character no limelight has yet been 
turned that is strong enough to find a flaw. 

A CALL FROM LINCOLN 

In a proclamation, March 30, 1863, Lincoln said : 

"We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven ; we have 
bedn preserved these many yfears in peace and prosperity; we have grown in 
numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have 
forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in 
peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly 
imagined, in the deceitfulness of our own hearts, that all these blessings were 
produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with 
unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of 
redeeming and preserving gra*e, too proud to pray to the God that made us. 
It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, and to 
confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness." 

INIQUITY BRINGS RUIN 

Can doing iniquity bring happiness? Iniquity is the absence of 
character, honesty, integrity, virtue, sincerity, genuineness and depend- 
ability. It is the want of rectitude and uprightness ; it is injustice, 
unrighteousness, and wickedness.' Some of its fundamentals are 
drunkenness, immorality, gambling, crookedness. When I speak 
against these, I am teaching not only the doctrine of my dwn Church, 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



99 



but that of every church, of every philosopher. Educators agree that 
these vices will bring ruin not only to individuals, but to nations and 
peoples. 

PROHIBITION AND PROSPERITY 

I shall here refer to only one of these types of evil — the use of 
intoxicating liquor. The United States is enjoying unprecedented 
prosperity. The savings of the country in 1926 were five times those 
of 1914. In that year the savings amounted to but $6.71 per capita, 
while in 1926 they were $33.00 per capita, an increase of 390 per cent. 

Many attribute this unprecedented prosperity to prohibition. The' 
late Wayne B. Wheeler has said that since the war we have had hun- 
dreds of thousands fewer arrests and jail commitments per annum for 
drunkenness ; that our drink-caused poverty has decreased 74 per cent, 
and that we have reached the lowest rate of pauperism that has been 
known in the United States. 

John G. Cooper of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers 
says that prohibition is making a capitalist out of the worker ; that 
when the saloon closed, the "Poor Man's Club" vanished, that it is being 
replaced by comfortable homes. He adds that labor is getting greater 
satisfaction out of an automobile and a decent home than it ever 
did out of the corner saloon. 

No less an authority than Herbert Hoover says that our prosperity 
is due to the elimination of industrial waste and to the advent of pro- 
hibition. When prohibition was adopted we had in the United States 
507 distilleries, which produced annually 288,000,000 gallons of dis- 
tilled spirits ; 130,000,000 of these were made' into whiskey. We were 
maintaining 1,300 breweries, which made annually two billion gallons 
of beer. There was a saloon in nearly every business block of our 
larger cities. 

HOW STANDS THE LAW ? 

Today, anyone who buys, drinks, gives, sells, or has in his pos- ' 
session intoxicating liquor is doing so contrary to the provisions of 
the Constitution and contrary to both federal and state laws. 

III. LAWLESSNESS AND DISRESPECT FOR LAW. 

The National Economic League which is composed of leading 
and influential men from all the States of our Union, has concluded 
that the greatest problem confronting our country today' is "lawless- . 
ness and disrespect for law," due, they believe, first to indifferent 
public sentiment on prohibition, and secondly, to lax enforcement of 
the law. 

Hoover says it is time for all good citizens to give attention to 
the following by-products of our prosperity : One, weakening of moral 
fiber ; two, loosening of family and home ties ; three, youthful crimi- 
nality ; four, easy breaking of the law by adults. 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"god give us men/" 

We need in official positions, more men like John Wanamaker. 
To the end of his days, this man, perhaps the world's greatest mer- 
chant, regarded as one of his most valuable possessions a notebook in 
which were recorded the names of those with whom he had taken the 
temperance pledge. 

When Postmaster General, he passed through the gay life of the 
Nation's capital without partaking of wine and without serving it 
upon his table. This unusual conduct brought censure and ridicule ; 
but this broad-minded citizen passed without flinching through this 
fire of criticism. 

Not infrequently young men were taken into his presence, while 
millionaires impatient for an audience with him paced his waiting 
rooms. When wealthy men expressed surprise at his neglect of them, 
he explained that those who came on spiritual or religious matters 
had come on the King's business, and that he always attended to the 
King's business first. 

THE DAY OF EFFICIENCY 

Not many years ago a lawyer would hardly think of standing 
before a jury without a few jolts of liquor behind his belt. It is no! 
long since it was the rule to close a business deal with a drink. But 
that day has passed. In this age of efficiency, no man can trust himself 
to do business if his mental machinery is impeded by liquor. Competi- 
tion is so keen that, other things being equal, he who drinks will fail. 

In all seriousness I ask if the United States, or the people thereof, 
have partially lost the old-fashioned virtues of honesty, sincerity, so- 
briety, virtue; and dependability. 

A PERILOUS TIME 

Is it a time to look with indifference upon leading citizens and 
young people whoiare breaking the law? 

In Salt Lake City recently a national officer in one of the social 
fraternities of the country said that all good citizens ought to be aroused 
to the seriousness of the situation. "Most of the young men who are in 
college today," he declared, "are drinking liquor." If so, what may we 
expect in years not far ahead? ' This subtle menace threatens the very 
foundations of our constitutional freedom. 

IV. APPEAL TO .CITIZENS 

I appeal to you as good citizens to go to the primaries, to do your 
duty at the polls, and elect to office men who are concerned with the 
wishes and hopes of the people, not heeding the bidding of men whose 
principal interest is money-making. 

THE HOUR HAS COME 

The hour has come when a call ought to be issued for citizens 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



101 



to stand with the Boy Scouts and pledge allegiance anew to the Flag 
of the United States and to the Republic for which it stands. 

A resolution of the judicial section of the American Bar Associa- 
tion explains that the United States has undertaken to suppress the 
age-long evils of the liquor traffic ; that when, for the gratification 
of appetite or for gain, lawyers, bankers, manufacturers, merchants, 
and social leaders disobey and scoff at the prohibition law, they are 
aiding the cause of anarchy, promoting mob violence, encouraging rob- 
bery, and increasing homicide. Is it not time for us to call out for 
those who can save our country from lawlessness and ruin ; time for us 
to exclaim with J. G. Holland, "God grve us men" ? Do not the times 
demand strong minds, great hearts, men whom the lust of office will 
not kill, whom the spoils of office cannot buy? 

THE PRICE OF LIBERTY 

American liberty has been purchased by the blood and lives of 
our ancestors. My own brother's son gave his life in the recent World 
War in defense of that liberty. The body of my own brother lies 
buried in the sacred soil of France, where he gave his life in the same 
cause. 

Have such lives been given in vain? Are we losing respect for 
the Constitution, that document which Gladstone has called "the great- 
est state document of all the Christian ages" ? Must voices be raised 
in the tops of these everlasting hills, calling to the people of the United 
States to come to the defense of the Constitution? Our forefathers, and 
our own loved ones have spent their lives for its principles. Are we 
unwilling to cast our votes for those who will honor it? 

t 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters: We have had a most glorious con- 
ference. I have enjoyed every moment of it up to this hour. The 
teachings of this conference have been equal to any that I have 
heretofore listened to. 

A LARGE PRIESTHOOD MEETING 

Last evening a great multitude of men bearing the holy Priesthood 
of God gathered in this tabernacle. It was a time of interest and in- 
struction, and perhaps as largely attended a priesthood meeting as 
we have ever had in the Church. Represented there were all the orders 
and degrees of the priesthood of God. The duties devolving upon the 
priesthood are quite well defined in the revelations of God. You will 
pardon me if I refer briefly this morning to the Council of the Twelve 
Apostles and the First Council of Seventy, since I am quite closely 
identified with these councils. As to whether the Council of the 
Twelve and the First Council of Seventy enjoy the spirit of their call- 
ing, you Latter-day Saints are perhaps well able to judge. They are 
.very close to you and you know them. 



102 ■ GENERAL CONFERENCE 

THE WORD OF THE LORD TO THE APOSTLES AND SEVENTY 

The word of the Lord to Joseph Smith the Prophet, respecting 
these councils, will perhaps be appropriate at this time. In section 
107 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says : 

"The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name 
of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to 
the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of 
the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews. 

"The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the 
Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all 
the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews ; 

"The twelve being sent out, holding the keys, to open the door by the procla- 
mation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and first unto the Gentiles and then unto 
the Jews." 

This is repeated in section 124, where the following language oc- 
curs. Remember, these sections disclose sacred revelations of God to 
Joseph Smith, his servant: 

The "Twelve hold the keys to open up the authority of my king- 
dom upon the four corners of the earth, and after that to send my 
word to every creature." 

And in respect to the First Council of Seventy, the "Quorum is 
instituted for traveling elders to bear record of my name in all the 
world, wherever the traveling high council, mine apostles, shall send 
them to prepare a way before my face." 

THE LABORS OF THESE COUNCILS 

You will remember that it is said that the Twelve is a Traveling 
Presiding High Council. Such is actually the case. They are not ex- 
pected to preside directly in the Church, but are also required to travel, 
and so that has fallen to the lot of these two councils since the Church 
was organized. They are constantly on the road, so to speak, going or 
coming, whether at home or abroad, going into the stakes of Zion, 
when at home, to regulate the affairs of the Church in the stakes, under 
the direction of the First Presidency ; to visit by rotation, some ninety- 
nine stakes of Zion. And you will perceive that it requires some time 
to get around and visit these stakes. At least ten, eleven oir twelve 
stake conferences are held weekly, and at most of the conferences mem- 
bers of the Twelve and the First Council of Seventy are represented. 
What are they there for? To preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, to 
organize and reorganize wards and stakes of Zion, and to set apart 
to the callings of the priesthood presidents of stakes, high councilors, 
etc. And, having accomplished this work at any one or all of these 
conferences, the apostles and the members of the first council of seventy 
return to report their work to the first presidency of the Church. And 
I may say that these brethren have very great pleasure and delight in 
the labor that is placed upon them. 

What about the nations ? Well, as the Twelve and the First Council 
are required to have a very considerable interest in the missions of 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 103 



the world, we have some twenty-seven missions, it is the particular 
duty of the Twelve, and so stated by the revelation, to open the door 
for the proclamation of the gospel to the nations, and perhaps also 
to teach the gospel, by first opening the door and then sending the 
word of the Lord to the nations. It gives me great pleasure to report 
here this morning that the Twelve have accomplished, in my judg- 
ment, a very great work in respect to this matter. The door for the 
proclamation of the gospel was opened up to America, our beloved 
country, by Joseph Smith the Prophet, and the keys to turn this door 
were also committed by Joseph Smith, the prophet, to members of the 
Council of the Twelve. 

The gospel was introduced into Great Britain in 1839 by Elder 
Heber C. Kimball, who was {hen one of the Council of the Twelve. 
He was accompanied by Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, and Joseph 
Fielding. They accomplished a great mission. The gospel was intro- 
duced into France in 1850 by Elder John Taylor of the Twelve ; and in 
Italy in 1850, by Elder Lorenzoi Snow ; in Scandinavia in 1850, by 
Elder Erastus Snow; in Japan in 1901 by President Heber J. Grant; 
in South America in 1925, by Elder Melvin J. Ballard, who was accom- 
panied by Elder Rulon S. Wells and Rey L. Pratt. 

The Pacific Islands mission was opened in - 1844 by Elder Noah 
Rogers and others. Elder Rogers was not of the Twelve. Elder David 
O. McKay and Elder Hugh J. Cannon visited the Pacific Islands mission 
in 1921. It was a complete and extended visit. They also went to 
Ch;na, and while Elder McKay was there in that distant land, he felt 
impressed to bless the land that the gospel might take root in the hearts 
of that people. 

■We are told in the revelation that the Twelve will not only take 
the gospel to the Gentiles, but also to the Jews. Perhaps the first 
step taken in this matter was the appointment, by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, of Orson Hyde of the Twelve, who was despatched to dedicate 
and consecrate the land of Palestine for the gathering of Judah's scat- 
tered remnant, and also the scattered remnants of Israel. You will under- 
stand, my brethren and sisters, that since that time there has been a pro- 
nounced movement on the part of the Jews of the world to gather to 
Palestine, undoubtedly influenced by the sacred prayer that was put upon 
the land of Palestine and by the Spirit of God, who is directing in all 
these matters. 

TESTIMONY 

I rejoice in the integrity, in the faithfulness, in the devotion of 
my brethren and associates of the Council of Twelve and the First 
Council of Seventy. I know these brethren intimately. I think I have 
been able to looik into their hearts, and to know how they feel. I know 
what they are doing. I believe that their labors are approved of the

We members of these two councils rejoice greatly in the spirit 
of the gospel and are pleased to labor under the directiota of the First

Presidency of the Church. We love one another ; we uphold one an- 
other in our faith. I believe, in fact, I think I may say that I know 
that the Council of the Twelve and the First Coluncil of Seventy see 
eye to eye. 

Of course, there are other councils in the Church, and there are 
a great many important callings. I might be pardoned in closing my 
remarks by quoting from Paul the Apostle, who is regarded as a very 
eminent authority on things pertaining to the work of God. He said : 

"The Church of God is founded upon apostles and prophets, Jesus 
Christ himself being the chief cornerstone." Now, the Apostle might 
very well have added — certainly he might have truthfully added — that 
the Church of God is founded, o!r built, upon the foundation of the 
apostles and prophets, of high" priests, of seventies, elders, and of priests, 
teachers and deacons, because it must be very apparent to the Latter- 
day Saints that, after all is said and done, the real meaning of the 
pronouncement of the apojstle was this : that the Church of God is 
built upon the foundation of the Holy Priesthood of God for that 
represents divine authority upon the earth. And it is by divine author- 
ity that the Church of God has been established and will be built up 
upon the earth. 

This is my testimony. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know it 
as fully and completely as I know that I live. I know that Joseph 
Smith was and is a true Prophet of God. Pie was a mighty man in 
Israel, and I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Awake, my Soul," by Evan Stephens. 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder J. Wesley Smith. 
The meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p". m. 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

In the Assembly Hall, 10 o'clock, Sunday Morning, October 9, 
1927, an overflow meeting was held. 

Elder David A. Smith, of the Presiding Bishopric, presided. 
, The music was rendered by the Ensign ward choir, Wallace 
Bennett, conductor, Alex Schreiner at the organ. 

The choir and congregation sang: "Come, O thou King of kings." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Axel A. Madsen, bishop 
of the Ensign ward. 

The choir sang the anthem : "Fierce raged the tempest." 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Liberty Stake 

'My brethren and sisters: It is perhaps known to many of 
you that the Liberty stake of Zion is located in the southeastern 
part of this city. This stake is about a mile and a half wide and 



ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 



105 



three miles long, so that it occupies very little territory. Resid- 
ing within the limits of. this stake there are approximately 25,000 
people, 15,000 of whom belong to [the Church. It is an easy mat- 
ter to walk from my house to any meeting house in the stake in 
twenty minutes and to make the journey over paved walks. In 
some sections of the stake, and I may say generally, the people 
are pretty well-to-do. They live in good homes, on an average 
better, I suppose, than the homes owned by the Latter-day Saints 
, in many other places. Many of them are professional men. Many 
of them are successful business men. And withal one must say 
with pride, the people are good people. We know that it requires 
the same faith to save a rich man that it does a poor man, and 
that no man can buy salvation with anything as cheap as money. 
It requires the same humility and the same obedience and the 
same diligence to save a rich man that it does a poor man. We 
have fine meeting houses in our stake, good choirs. Every oppor- 
tunity seems (to be within easy reach of the people, but I am sure 
our problems are just as serious and just as difficult as the prob- 
lems of the people who live in the remoter parts of the Church. 
It is a difficult thing to maintain in the Sacrament meetings the 
attendance that many of the wards on the outside maintain. I 
discover that it is a very difficult thing for a man who is prosperous, 
who is successful, who has gathered about him the things of the 
world, to exercise the same faith, the same humility, that he did 
in his humbler days, but nevertheless it is necessary. 

I came from the country. I grew up on the soil. I came to 
this city when I ;was a grown man. Of course, I can never forget 
my love for the plain people. My early contact with the people 
of the soil has left forever in my soul an appreciation of their 
worth and of the contribution which they make to the Church 
and to society. I love the people of the city. There are no more 
faithful people in the world than some of the Saints who live in - 
this city. I know hired girls who pay more tithing, I really be- 
lieve, than many prosperous farmers. V 

I have enjoyed this conference very greatly. I think the 
reference made by the President of the Church, to . the support 
that should be given to law and order, and the pride which this 
people should have in the great government of which they form a 
part, was very timely and fundamental. Whenever I am depressed 
with little things, my heart is inspired with two great thoughts 
that always cheer and comfort rne. In the first place, I am de- 
voutly grateful that I am an American. It is a proud thing to be 
an American. I firmly believe that the flag that waves over you 
and over me is the best flag that ever waved over any land or 
any people — made so by the heroism of the men who founded 
this Republic and who have maintained it. My heart was touched 
with the beautiful and dignified tribute which a distinguished visi- 
tor, General Summerall, paid to this people yesterday morning. I 



106 ' GENERAL CONFERENCE 

hope we deserve it, and I believe that we do. I am sure that 
"Mormonism" has in it the genius of the best civilization the 
world has ever seen. All good Latter-day Saints are good citizens. 
Poor citizenship is an evidence of poor affiliation with the Church. 
It cannot be otherwise. I am grateful for the government that 
shelters us, for the opportunity which it gives to its citizens. I love 
this land of ours. The Almighty in his infinite kindness has established 
our feet in the tops of the eternal hills and given us a place where the 
sun shines more days in the year than in any other place, where the 
skies are bluer and the water clearer. We ought to be good citizens, and 
we ought to stand firmly for the maintenance of the principles bred in 
the institutions which we love and cherish. 

And I am grateful, my brethren arid sisters, that I am a Latter- 
day Saint. I am not boasting, of course, of my devotion, but rejoic- 
ing in the thought that I belong to this people. We belong to a 
great Church. Every man and every woman who belongs to this 
Church is to be congratulated upon his opportunity, his opportuni- 
ties for growth, for development, for the establishment of his char- 
acter. The history of the past should inspire us, and the promises 
of the future should sustain us. It is a great thing to belong to 
this Church. 

Stress has been placed upon missionary work during this con- 
ference. In no sense would I minimize the importance of that 
work. I know that the ingenuity of men never devised such a 
marvelous educational agency as the missionary system of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is nothing like 
it in the world. Boys go to the ends of the earth and bring back 
all they see, and enjoy the advantages of education that comes 
from travel. Now, that is only one part of it. There is something 
about putting a young man on his own responsibility and com- 
pelling him to make the Almighty his friend that has a marvelous 
influence upon him. A young man came into my office and when 
I looked into his face, I said to him, "Where have you been?" He 
said, "I have been to New Zealand. I have traveled around the 
world." Then he told me what he had seen. In the conversation 
he said to me: "What is the greatest thing you ever saw?" I 
had the inspiration, I believe, to say to him, "The finest thing I 
ever saw in my life is a boy in whose eye the fire of the Holy 
Ghost burns, in whose face is reflected the presence and power of 
the spirit of Almighty God." Isn't it marvelous that mere boys, 
modest, trembling boys,, go away from home and come back in 
two or three years transformed into strong men? Have you ever 
seen anything that is quite comparable to that experience in help- 
ing a boy? I never have. It is wonderful. 

Now, this Church has just three great things to do : First, 
to preach the gospel to jevery nation, kindred, tongue and people, 
declaring with a loud voice that an angel has flown through the 
midst of heaven and has revealed again, to earth, the gospel of 



ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 



107 



Jesus Christ. We are trying to do that; we are doing it, feebly, 
perhaps, but doing pretty well. JSTow, the second is, to develop 
the individual members of the Church, to help them to grow into 
their best. And the third is to make a icommunity which will re- 
flect the spirit and power of the gospel. Now, my brethren and 
sisters, the great problem that always addresses itself to each 
of us is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in our daily contact. 
That is not so easy. I know men who' have gone on missions and 
preached with power the gospel of Jesus Christ, but who, when 
home, under the influence of prosperity and ease, have grown 
apathetic and indifferent and careless. You know it is an easy 
matter to face belching guns when the delirium of war is on, but 
many a man who is brave in battle falls down supinely under the 
monotony and routine of daily life. Our mission at home is to 
"carry on," so that when men come from far and see what we 
are doing and get in touch with us, they will discover that back 
of our conduct there is something sincere and genuine, something 
that carries over. That is the acid test. God expects to make 
of us a great people. I believe that we will become rich and pros- 
perous, if we ^re only big enough to stand it. If we only have 
that childlike faith that will enable us to practice the plain princi- 
ples of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we will succeed. We wear better 
clothes than our fathers wore ; we live in finer houses, eat finer 
food, but that is not fundamental. Have we a better quality of 
faith? Do we manifest that faith in more righteous behavior? That 
is the important thing. God bless you, my brethren and sisters, 
you men and women who come from afar to hear the word of 
the Lord, in whose honest souls a love of truth burns. You and all 
people of your kind are, after all, the salt of the earth, and your 
names will endure forever on the records of his Church. GoH 
help us all, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE R. MAYCOCK 

President of the Kolob Stake 

"It takes a heap of livin' in a house to make it home." I know 
that my good teacher, Brother Hinckley, did not mean that Liberty 
stake has better homes ; he meant that Liberty stake has better 
houses. I come from a stake so much larger than his that he does 
not really know that he has any troubles. Our stake is six miles 
wide and forty-five miles long, and we haven't any paved roads, 
and very few paved sidewalks. But we have wonderful people and 
a wonderful lot pf homes, homes wherein the Spirit of God dwells, 
where people are trying to keep the commandments of God and 
where we are endeavoring to draw near unto him. I appreciate 
Brother Hinckley, my brothers and sisters. I have loved him for 
a long, long while. There came into my life some of his teachings 
in 1897, in the Brigham Young Academy, that have stood out from 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



then until now. I am glad to follow him and the good things that 
he taught us in that class. I never have been, in another class, so 
filled with inspiration. I have never received teaching from an- 
other teacher that stood out in my life like the teachings of Bryant 
S. Hinckley, and so I love him and appreciate him and pray God's 
blessings upon him. 

I appreciate the privilege of laboring in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the responsibilities that have come unto me have 
helped me to appreciate more fully the blessings that have come ; 
because I believe that as we labor we learn to love ; because I 
believe that as we associate with our brethren and sisters and 
see their integrity and devotion and determination to keep the 
commandments of God, we more fully appreciate the gospel that 
has been given to us. We can see its fruits, we can see its bless- 
ings, and we cherish them more the more we work. 

I love this wonderful country of ours, and I am glad that our 
brethren have talked to us about keeping the laws of the land. 
I desire to read a few words from Abraham Lincoln on this subject : 

"Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher of his posterity 
swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the 
laws of the_ country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. Let reverence 
for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles 
on her lap; let it be taught in the schools, in seminaries, in colleges; let it be 
written in primers, in spelling books, and in almanacs ; let it be preached from 
the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in the courts of justice. 
And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old 
and the young, the rich and the pcor, the grave and the gay, of, all sects and 
tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars." 

My brothers and sisters, I wish we could get that into our 
souls and appreciate the fact that we should not only live the 
law ourselves but that we should sustain it by assisting others to 
live it. We have, to a certain extent, a responsibility in this regard, 
because we are American citizens. I have been in a position the 
last few years to know something about the enforcement of law, 
and I have seen some of the results that have come from people stepping 
over just a little. First we break some of the lesser laws, disregard 
some of the lesser things, and then our conscience is seared to 
the extent that we can disregard some of the greater ones. And 
in our disregarding those things we are setting examples to those 
with whom we associate. I wish that every mother in this great 
country of ours could say to her boy and to her girl, "I want 
you to live the laws of the land as your father lives them." But 
what would be the condition if - our mothers did that? We some- 
times are prone to try to cover up our actions, to try to break the 
law and not let anyone know it. But there is always someone to 
watch. There is that boy and that girl who are always seeing and 
always imitating what the older ones do. This summer we raised 
a little garden at the back of our house, and not so long ago I 
took the hand plow and went out and was pushing that plow in 



ELDER GEORGE R. MAY COCK 



109 



the garden. As I stepped in the loose soil after I had plowed it, I 
looked back and there was our babe, nearly four years old, fol- 
lowing-. I said, "What are you doing?" "Walking in your steps." 
My brethren and sisters, there came tears to my eyes. I said to 
myself, "Am I leading aright? Am I willing that my child should 
walk in my steps in all the things that I do?" If I can so live that 
I am willing that they should, if I can so live that my children can 
appreciate the gospel and appreciate the country in which we live, 
because they have walked in my steps, then I shall feel that my 
mission has been well filled. 

If is not only in the laws of our land but in the laws of our 
Church that we must keep the commandments, i You know the 
prophet said that there has been a law irrevocably decreed in heaven 
before the foundation of the world, upon which every blessing is 
predicated, and if we expect to receive the blessing, we must keep 
the law upon which it is predicated. Too many of us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, are trying to dead-head our way into heaven. Too 
many of us are expecting to be judged in that great judgment day 
by the things that we believe rather than by the things we do. The 
apostle of old said, "The devils also believe, and tremble." The 
Latter-day Saints believe the gospel. I have a friend who never 
did anything for the Church ; in fact, he scarcely knew that he 
belonged to the Church. He went away and someone attacked 
"Mormonism,""and he began to defend it, but he defended it not 
as the "Mormon" elders defend it, but with his fists. He believed 
the gospel, and when the time came that he had to defend it, he 
defended it the best he could. Will we be judgd by the things we 
believe ? If we must keep the commandments to receive the bless- 
ings, it is time that we begin to work." 

There are three great commandments revealed that will give 
to us, as Latter-day Saints, every blessing, I believe, that we could 
desire. The first thing, it seems to me, that we need — the very 
first thing that we need as Latter-day Saints, is the Spirit of God 
to attend us continually, and there is an ordinance given that if 
we would gather together on the Lord's day and partake of his 
sacrament and covenant to always remember him, we will always 
have his Spirit to be with us. I have sat in congregations of the 
Saints and have watched them partake of that sacram,ent, have 
seen them put out their hands — in fact, I believe I have done it 
myself on many occasions — with my mind just as far away from 
that ordinance as it was possible for it to be, not remembering him 
always, not remembering him even while I was partaking of the 
sacrament. I believe that we should keep that commandment. I 
believe that we should partake of the sacrament regularly and 'always 
remember him, in order that we may have his spirits to be with us. 

And then, after we have his spirit to be with us, we want next 
wisdom and knowledge and understanding; we want health and 
strength. And if we will read the eighty-ninth section of the Doctrine 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and Covenants, we can read there the comimandment by which we 
can receive these blessings — wisdom, knowledge, and understand- 
ing, and health and strength, and not only that, but we have been 
given the promise that the destroying angel shall pass by us, even 
as in the days of the children of Israel, and not destroy us. 

And after we have received those blessings, my brethren and 
sisters, if we turn to the fifty-ninth section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, we can read there the commandments by which all 
things else, it seems to me, that we may need will come unto us ; 
because we are told in that section (and with your permission I 
will read a few verses) : 

"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up' thy sacraments upon my holy 
day; 

"For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and 
to pay thy devotions unto the Most High ; 

"Nevertheless, thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days 
and at all times; 

"But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations 
and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and 
before the Lord. 

"On this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared 
with singleness of heart that thy fasting may he perfect], or, in other words, 
that thy joy may be full. 

"Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or, in other words, rejoicing and prayer. 

"And inasmuch as ye do these things, with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts 
and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad 
heart and a cheerful countenance — 

"Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, 
the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon 
the tree and walketh upon the earth ; 

"Yea, and the herb, .and the good things which come of the earth, whether for 
food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barnsj, or for orchards, or for gardens, 
'or for vineyards." 

All are ours, my brethren and sisters, by keeping the com- 
mandments of God. 

I bear you my testimony that we "are laboring in the cause 
of Christ, that we are in his Church, which is indeed the power of 
God unto salvation. Every fibre of my soul declares unto me 
that these things are true. My brothers and sisters, I pray that 
we may live to show to the world that, they are true, for our actions 
will show more than our words. May the blessings of God 
attend us in this conference and throughout our lives, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 

President of \the Grant Stake 

I sincerely trust, my dear brothers and sisters, that I shall enjoy 
the spirit of this conference, that the Lord will direct me in what I 



ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES- 



111 



shall say, that I shall enjoy your sympathy and good will, and that my 
efforts shall be the means of stimulating myself to better action and per- 
haps of helping those of you who are here. 

I appreciate the responsibility that comes to an elder in this 
Church when called upon to speak to the Latter-day Saints. I ap- 
preciate that we should undertake to believe in the principles that we 
advocate. I have observed in this conference, since its opening session 
Friday morning, that the theme generally has been that of law and 
its enforcement, all of which I feel to' endorse and feel to appreciate 
its importance. There are many laws that are given to the people of 
the city and nation which are given for a benefit and a blessing ; first, 
to teach us to respect the rights of others,' and secondly that in respect- 
ing the rights of others we may grow stronger ourselves. There are 
other principles that have been given not in the way of legislation by 
the authorities of the land, but laws and commandments given unto us 
by our heavenly Father. 

One of these principles, known as the Word of Wisdom, has been 
touched upon more or less during the conference. Being a profound 
advocate of this doctrine I have been impressed with its importance, 
and with your kind permission would like to consider some of its many 
phases. It really surprises us very much to observe that when we are 
subjected to an examination, that as to> our own strength, in the living 
and observance of this law of the Church, that we have many short- 
comings, and fail to measure up to the ideals and standards of a typical 
Latter-day Saint. 

One great authority has said that in the United States, during the 
year 1925, there were consumed sixty-nine billion ready-made cigarettes, 
which would mean that during that year every man, woman and child 
consumed 690 ready-made cigarettes — not counting the number of 
hand-made cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco. It would be unfair to say 
that this startling condition exists only in other states, for Utah, the 
land in which we live, has undoubtedly contributed its share. ' From 
the records that have been published it may be well for us to see as 
to what extent Utah has been a contributing factor in the consumption 
of some of these articles. During the year 1924 the residents of the 
State of Utah, including of course all classes, and not Latter-day Saints 
alone, actually threw away: 

For coffee $2,000,000 

For cigarettes 1,500,000 

For tea 1,500,000 

For tobacco 2,000,000 

. Total $7,000,000 

I have not given an estimate as to the amount of money involved 
in the purchase of liquor, because that perhaps would be beyond 
computation. 

I have taken this sum of $7,000,000 ; and have done a little figuring 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to see what we could accomplish if this sum of money were applied in 
legitimate channels for the development and growth and upbuilding 
of our communities, and this is what I observe. We could buy any one of 
the following things : ten million bushels of potatoes, seventy million 
loaves of bread, seventy million quarts of milk, 2,500,000 pairs of 
shoes, 100 million streetcar fares — in fact, this money, if applied, 
would ^ide the entire population of Salt Lake City, estimated at 140,000 
people, to work and return every day for one year. It would buy 
14,000 Ford automobiles. You could take a series of one-dollar bills, 
standing them up end to, end, and construct a fence reaching from Salt 
Lake City to Los Angeles. It would build 230 meeting houses, at an 
average cost of $30,000. Assuming that it would cost $5C0 per year 
to maintain and sustain each of the students in attendance at the fol- 
lowing schools for their living for the entire year, it would provide 
the education and living for the total enrollment of the student member- 
ship of the University of Utah, the Agricultural College at Logan, the 
L. D. S. College here in this city, the East High School, Salt Lake City, 
the West High School, Salt Lake City; the Brigham Young University 
at Provo, the Granite High School, and perhaps others. A total of 
14,000 students could be taught and educated for a whole year for this 
money. And further, let me state that if this money were used legiti- 
mately and honorably, it would pay the entire taxes for the State of 
Utah for the whole yeaf. It would take 2,000 people on a tour around 
the world extending over a period of three or four months, giving to 
each one the sum of $3,500 for expenses. 

It may be interesting for you to know that in the United States 
there was expended in the year 1923 for tobacco alone, the amazing 
sum of 900 million dollars, for liquor two billion, while for furniture 
which contributes to the happiness and joy of every home, there was 
expended but 375 million. As we think of this inconceivable amount 
of money that is expended for these non-essentials, is it not time for 
us to consider as to what extent we may be contributing to these 
abuses? As a means of giving us a better understanding as to ; how 
to enjoy wisdom in all of our daily undertakings, I feel that a proper 
understanding of this precious revelation is most vital to every Latter- 
day Saint family. 

In view of these alarming conditions might it not be well to ask 
ourselves the question, as to what we are doing to rectify the same? 
You will recall in the revelation given through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith on the Word of Wisdom, the declaration is made that these 
stimulants are not good for the human body. Are we exercising the 
proper restraint ourselves, and are efforts likewise applied in teaching 
our children, that the use of these beverages and narcotics can only 
work to their spiritual and physical detriment ? 

I feel to compliment and congratulate those who regard this principle 
as vital, and who undertake to observe this law. For those who are 
weak and apparently not able in and of their own strength to over- 
come, I earnestly pray that the Lord in his infinite mercy shall give 



ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 



113 



them that added strength that they may be successful in their righteous 
desires. 

I earnestly pray that the means, the talent and the ability that God 
has given us, will be at all times used in honorable and legitimate pur- 
suits. God help each of us to know our duty, and give us the strength 

always to properly apply it, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A solo, "How beautiful upon the mountains" was sung by Arvilla 
Allen. 

ELDER HENRY A, GARDNER 

President of the Palmyra Stake 

Realizing my limited knowledge and ability, I feel very 
keenly, my brothers and sisters, the responsibility that rests upon 
me at this moment, and I humbly desire that the prayer that was 
offered by our brother at the beginning may be made manifest 
in my behalf, that I may be able to say something to encourage 
you along the pathway of life. Like Paul of old, I am not ashamed 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for I realize and know that it is the 
power of God unto salvation. I have been taught the principles 
of "Mormonism" from my youth up and have been taught to 
honor and sustain those who are in authority over me, and as 
I com ; e to these conferences and gaze into the faces of the brethren 
who preside over this Church, I go home with a renewed deter- 
mination and desire to press on in this great latter-day work. It 
seems to me that there never was a time in the history of our 
Church when the Lord has fortified us with men to lead and 
guide us as he has at the present time. Coming yesterday morn- 
ing, as I read the Tribune and saw on the front page a picture 
of the First Presidency of the Church as they were taken just 
before' entering the tabernacle, I thought, what a wonderful 
team of men — well fitted and qualified for the great responsibility 
of leaders of this people ! With the other brethren, I thank God 
that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, for I realize that this is God's work. Though we may fall 
by the wayside, this work will go on, for it is God's. "Mormon- 
ism," so called, is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. To me it 
is the grandest, noblest, broadest religion in all the world, for 
it not only accepts the truth that we have, but accepts the truth, 
the virtues and the praiseworthy things that we find in men, in 
churches, and in associations wherever they may be found. We are 
told to seek after the things that are elevating, that are uplifting 
and praiseworthy. 

I come from the Palmyra stake, situated in the southern part 
of Utah county. We are there a common people. I thank God 
that I am ^mong the common people, for I realize that if we are 
humble and willing to let the Spirit of God work upon us and 



114 ' GENERAL CONFERENCE 

actuate our lives, we shall be fitted and prepared to enjoy our offices 
and callings as members of the Church. 

Much has been said during this conference relative to law and 
order. It seems to me that the Latter-day Saints have been taught 
from their youth that the Constitution of the United States, and 
that great document of human (rights, the Declaration of Independ- 
ence, were written by men inspired of our heavenly father. Mr. 
Babson said recently, "The United States of America at the 
present time 'is blessed with everything except religion." I feel 
that not only as a nation, but sometimes as a people, the thing 
we need most is a return to simple faith in God our Father. We 
need in our home-lives more of the Spirit of God to lead and 
guide us. We peed to have more family prayer. We need to pray 
in the spirit and meaning of the word. 

I remember a little poem I learned a number of years ago. It 
went something like this: 

I often say my prayers, 

But do I ever pray? 
And do the wishes of my heart 
Go with the words I say? • 

I may as well kneel down 

And worship gods of stone, 
As offer to the living God 

A prayer of words alone. 

Prayer without the faith 

The Lord will never hear, 
Nor will he to those Hps attend 

Whose prayers are not sincere. 

If we go back to the beginning of this Church, we find that 
the Prophet Joseph Smith went out to the lonely grove that he 
might offer up a simple, earnest prayer to his heavenly Father, 
desiring to know which of all the churches then existing upon 
the earth Jwas the true church of God ; for they were saying, "Lo, 
Christ is here," and "Lo, Christ is there." It was that simple, 
earnest prayer that reached the throne of glory, and God our 
Father condescended to come and visit him on the earth. What 
glorious news to the children of men, to know that God lives, 
has spoken again, and has revealed in this day and age his Son 
Jesus Christ unto the world. How thankful we as a people ought 
to be ! We ought to be willing, my brethren and sisters, to sing- 
the song with the full meaning of the word, "We thank thee, O 
God, for a prophet, to guide us in these latter days." And when 
we are thinking and speaking of this great Church of ours, I some- 
times wonder, my brothers and sisters, if there is not too large 
a difference between the prayer that we speak or utter and the 
lives we lead. Everywhere we go, up and down in this state and 
other states, we find the urgent need of the application of the ideals 
and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ which we believe and 



ELDER HENRY A. GARDNER

teach, more earnestly, adopted in our daily lives. We need the 
principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ preached not only from 
the pulpit but taught and preached by the example of the lives that 
we live. I want to tell you as a servant of God that I believe he 
is not pleased with us as a people unless we do our duty. He is 
willing, I believe, to draw near unto us if we will give him the 
opportunity, if we draw near unto him. Not everyone who saith 
unto him, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but 
he that doeth the will of the Father, which is in heaven. We talk 
about Latter-day Saints and our Church, and I grant you it is a 
wonderful Church, for me it is the /Church of God ; but , I some- 
times wonder, and I wondered this morning as Brother Daynes 
read to us some of the statistics regarding our own fair state — the 
tremendous amount of money expended for those things that the 
Lord tells us jn a simple way are detrimental to our health- -1 
wonder if we are really and truly living up to the principles that 
are taught to us? Do those statistics indicate to us that "Mormon- 
ism" is not functioning as it should function, that we have not the 
faith to live the gospel as we believe it? Or does it simply show, 
my brethren and sisters, that we are not able to reach the goal 
that is set for us? 

I hope and pray that we shall remember the counsel and 
advice given to us by the leaders of this Church, that we may 
be fitted and prepared for the great responsibility that rests upon 
us as members of this Church in carrying the great message of 
peace on earth and good will to the sorrowing hearts of mankind. 
Jesus Christ did for us the thing that we are not able to do for 
ourselves, and made it possible for us to have the glorious privi- 
lege and opportunity of worshiping God according to the dictates 
of our own conscience and carrying this great message to the sor- 
rowing world, that they too may enjoy the glorious principles of 
Salvation and life that we possess. Everywhere we go we find the 
urgent need of the principles of truth, honesty, and integrity that 
we believe in, to be practiced and applied in the lives of the people. 
We are told in the Book of Mormon that the people of this land 
shall prosper as long as they believe and obey the will of the God 
of the land — meaning that if we do not obey the principles of 
truth and righteousness, even this fair country of ours, the grand 
old United States, may see perilous times. 

I sometimes feel that unless we believe the principles of the 
gospel in our daily lives we may stumble by the wayside. Only 
recently I had a conversation with a brother who said to me, 
"Brother Gardner, that which I used to know, I do not believe 
now." And I said to him, "I wish that you would come back 
again, when I have a few moments, that we may have a heart-to- 
heart talk together." And, as he enumerated to me some of the 
things that had happened in his life — for I knew that at one time 
he was a faithful brother in the Church ; I had listened to him bear 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testimony of the divinity of this work, and had been inspired and 
touched by the sincere words that he had uttered — I found out that 
perhaps some time or other in his life he had been disappointed, had 
failed to reach some particular office, or that some brother in authority 
had failed to show him the proper recognition, or had hurt his feel- 
ings, and that because of such action he had become dark and gloomy 
and had drifted away from the Church. It seems to me that there can 
be no sadder picture painted than that of a man who has been instru- 
mental in instilling in others the principles of the gospel and in show- 
ing others the pathway of life, who has planted faith and determination 
in the souls of men and women to serve God and keep his command- 
ments, and at the closing days of his life comes and says to a young 
man whom he has inspired, "That which I used to know, I do not 
believe now." 

Oh, I want to tell you there is no greater joy in this world that 
can come to any man living than the joy of rendering service in the 
Church of God. Oftentimes I feel my weakness and am very humble 
in trying to go about to inspire and teach others to do their duty 
in this Church, but I want to acknowledge to you that I know this is 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. I feel it in every fiber of my soul that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living God. I feel, 
my brethren and sisters, that it is your responsibility and mine, in order 
that we may fulfil the great destiny that God our Father intended 
that we should. 

I do want to say to you, let us be watchmen upon the towers. Let 
us remember who we are. Let us remember that as fathers and moth- 
ers it is our responsibility to see that our children are taught, that we 
do have family prayer, tbat we do pray with earnestness and sincerity, 
that we may enjoy God's blessings, and that we may be watchmen for 
our children and our neighbors' children, that we may be indeed our 
brother's keeper. But above all, may we keep ourselves clean and un- 
spotted from the world, that the Spirit of Christ may be in our hearts 
and homes. For if we have a contented home, we are a contented peo- 
ple; and if we keep the commandments of God, we shall have joy in 
this world and in the world to come. 

May the Lord bless us with the power of appreciation, that we 
may have in our hearts a love for the truth. May we have a desire 
to acknowledge the hand of God in our many blessings, and be willing 
to bear testimony of the divinity of this work, not only abroad but 
to the rising generation. I want to tell you that there are hundreds 
and thousands, not only of the older brothers and sisters but of the 
younger brothers and sisters, who are hungering and thirsting for 
the Word of God. We need to teach them the simple truths of "Mor- 
monism." We need to implant in their hearts and lives a testimony 
not only of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith but of the 
divinity of Jesus the Christ, and that this is his work. May we be 
equal to the responsibility that rests upon us, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in having the privilege of 
meeting with you. 

Yesterday I appeared in the tabernacle in the uniform of an officer 
of the United States army, and many wondered why I should be 
about my official Church duties so* attired. In explanation, let me say 
that as a reserve officer of the United States army, I was under orders 
yesterday to go to the station and meet General Charles T. Summerall, 
Chief of Staff of the United States army. His program had been ar- 
ranged before he reached here, but in conference with the officers at 
Fort Douglas and the reserve officers in charge here, the suggestion was 
made that it might be interesting for the General to look upon a con- 
gregation of Latter-day Saints in conference session. Accordingly, 
we planned for it, with the permission of the Presidency of the Church, 
and yesterday morning as General Summerall arrived in the 'city an 
invitation was extended to him to attend and address the congrega- - 
tion. In order that he might do this, it was necessary to shorten his 
inspection tour at Fort Douglas and the University of Utah. Upon 
leaving the tabernacle, he expressed his appreciation for the privilege 
he had of sitting upon the stand and looking upon that vast congre- 
gation, and for the music, and for the privilege of saying a few words 
from the pulpit of that wonderful building. He left yesterday after- 
noon to continue his inspection tour of the army posts of the United 
States. One of the great outstanding features of his tour will be, I am 
sure, his visit with us. 

While mentioning this, perhaps it will be proper for me to say 
that after the World War, I was offered a commission and refused to 
' accept it, feeling that there was no further need of my serving in that 
capacity, knowing that my Church work was all I could possibly expect 
to do. Finally request was made of President Nibley, who at that 
time was Presiding Bishop. He authorized my enlistment. I was 
called before a board, and a commission with the rank of Major in the 
reserve corps was given to me. I have since been called to the Presidio 
of San Francisco and for two years have been a member of the Ninth 
Corps Area Conference Committee. This work I found to be very 
interesting, for it gave me an opportunity to study army life in all its 
phases. 

One little experience I had there may be interesting to you. As 
members of the Conference Committee, we were lined up waiting to take 
conveyances to go on a tour of inspection, when the officer in charge 
called my name and stated that I was to ride with the Commanding 
General. I hardly knew what to expect of it. I was almost the junior 
officer, and as I stepped out of line, my companion from Utah, who 
was standing near, and who is not a member of this Church, said: 
"Now, bishop, cut out that Church influence." I did not realize that 
it was Church influence for the moment. I was somewhat bewildered, 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but I had the privilege that day of riding with the Commanding General, 
stepping ahead of men who held higher offices ; men of greater service 
and experience. It was not until a few days later that I found out what 
this Church influence really consisted of, that it was not I who was being 
honored; it was you. It was your sons, your brothers, your fathers. 
And I, as your representative, was receiving the reward for your 
service and activity. 

As a member of that committee it was my privilege and duty to 
visit all departments of army work. It was my privilege to go into 
any office, of any department, of any officer, from the Chief of Staff 
down, to find, if possible, conditions that could be improved. In this 
work I discovered why I had been so honored. I found in all activities 
that Utah stands at the head. I found that the University of Utah as 
a R. O. T. C. school stands in the first rank. That our high schools— 
the Ogden, the East High and the West High, were outstanding in their 
work. I was proud of them. I found that in all our war work, when- 
ever we have been called into service, every demand made by the war 
department had been met, and met admirably. Then I fully realized 
that it was not I who was being honored, but you, this people. 

Last March I was called to attend a conference in Washington. 
With nearly three hundred men we stood out in front of the Interior 
building for the purpose of having a picture taken. I was standing 
about four rows back, where my rank required that I should be. My 
name was called, and I was requested to step down to the front. As 
I did so, all eyes were turned upon me, for they wondered what was 
going to happen and I wondered also. General Summerall, who ad- 
dressed us yesterday, was standing in front of that group. I was re- 
quested to take my place at his side. And there I stood while pictures 
of the group were taken. I realized this time that it was not I who 
was being honored. I have met with high ranking officers many times, 
I have been a dinner guest in the homes of many, I have had an oppor- 
tunity of finding out what these officers were doing, trying to do and 
hoping to do ; of knowing what they thought of you as a people and of 
you'r sons, and they do appreciate every helpful service. 

I am not a prophet, and I have no right to prophesy in the name 
of the living God, but, as his servant I am entitled to the inspiration 
of his Holy Spirit, and if I am faithful in keeping his commandments, 
I should understand the whisperings of that Spirit and know how to 
act and when to act. I remember before we got into the World War, 
(I had been called to render service for my country before that time), 
that on the way to a priesthood meeting held in this building, I men- 
tioned to my father, Joseph F. Smith, who was then president of this 
Church, that I thought something should be said to the men who were 
assembled as to how they should conduct themselves in case we should 
be called upon to defend and uphold the spirit of freedom and liberty. 
During that meeting, father turned to me and requested that I make 
trie statement I thought necessary. Briefly it was this, that (at that 



ELDER DAVID, A. SMITH 



119 



time) I could not see how we could possibly avoid getting into war, for 
the principles upon which our nation was founded obligated us to assist 
in the cause of peace and freedom. I was concerned for our boys, and 
I advised that they immediately fill up the organizations of our state 
troops, that they join the national guard, which afterward became the 
145th, that they get in, then, before final enlistments and drives should 
come. Nothing had been said of a draft at that time. And many of 
you bishops and presidents of stakes and fathers went home and, realiz- 
ing the situation, advised your boys to enlist in their local units, where 
they could have the companionship of one another, where they could 
have in a measure, that spirit under which they grew and developed, 
to be with them during their enlistment, and their war experience, if 
such experiences should come to them. And finally they were mobilized 
and ordered to the .Coast, and after a period of training were brought 
home and encamped at Fort Douglas. Then orders came to move on. 
For some days these boys were seen lined up at the Beehive House or 
Church offices, awaiting a blessing. Day after day it was my pleasure 
to be with my father as he gave blessings to those boys — your boys — 
going out to serve their country in a righteous cause. And in every 
case, as I recall, the blessing pronounced upon their head, gave them 
the promise that if they would keep themselves clean, obey the laws 
of the land, remember their God, say their prayers in faith and humility, 
and keep the commandments of the Lord, they would go and return 
uninjured. As I heard father pronounce those words time and again on 
those boys, and as I saw them leave, not knowing what minute they 
would be on their way, yet with joy in their souls because of the com- 
forting promise, I paused to wonder ! One day in the lull, I turned to 
father and asked, "What is there that impresses you to make this 
promise? When we read of the great slaughter and destruction on the 
other side, it seems to me the only possible thing that can cause your 
promise to come true will be the termination of the war before the boys 
get there." He answered : "I do not know whether they shall be 
called to go into battle or not, but this I do know, for the Lord has given 
me to understand and know; that promise is made to these young men 
through their faithfulness, and if they abide the commandments of 
God, they shall return." Well, the rest of the story you know. They 
served and met every requirement and returned home again to engage 
in their pursuits of life uninjured. 

I am reminded of them by General Surnmerall's having been here. 
Perhaps it is not just proper to mention these things at this time, but 
I do it because I want you to know that we as a people are looked upon 
by the men who are responsible for our country's defense, as being 
outstanding in our willingness to serve. May I mention one more 
incident which goes to show their feeling toward us. 

At the close of the conference I attended in Washington last March, 
General Cheathem, the presiding officer, stood up to give the closing 
address. He made this statement. "We have sin this body today, an

records and their plans, to know just what they are looking for in the 
future. I find they are men of high ideals, men untrammeled by the 
course of politics. Army officers receive their position through ap- 
pointment, upon -merit. They go on year after year, and, as in the 
priesthood, if I may make a comparison, though not for a moment 
do I think there is an equality between the two, but only a similarity, 
for purpose of comparison. We hold the Priesthood, and under that 
Priesthood we are blessed as we honor it. We grow in intelligence and 
power to serve as we serve. One of our brethren has said during this 
conference, one thing that we want in this Church is more thought to 
the gospel doctrine, to the teachings of God. Let me add to that, and 
more real service, which permits us to apply that gospel and doctrine 
through actually doing the things of God; for it is not alone through 
the study of the work that we are to gain salvation, but through doing 
the things of God which actually, require service. The army of the 
United States is built upon the same principle. Men develop as they 
serve and have ability to serve, and their knowledge enables them to 
go on, step by step. They are not there subject to any senator or 
politician. Unless because of misconduct, there is no power that can 
remove them other than the President of the United States, who is the 
Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the United States. That gives 
to them a freedom which enables them to speak from their heart that 
which they think. General Summerall, because of his position, is 
familiar with the record we have made as a people, which gave him 
foundation for the statement he made. As President Grant has said. 
_ "Thank the Lord he has said it, and thank the Lord he could truthfully 
say it." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I should not talk longer. I have 
not said what I intended to say. I wanted to say something about the 
Word of Wisdom and our missionary work. We have sitting over there 
in the tabernacle, 53 elders and nine lady missionaries. I wish you 
could have been with us last Wednesdav night. We had been in 
session since early morning and when the time for dismissal came, they 
were not ready to go. They were full of questions. They put question 
after question. And it was 8:30 p. m. before we finally dismissed our 
little meeting. And yet in that group called to be missionaries, only 
eleven out of the 53 elders had assisted in baptisms, not one has ever 
confirmed a person a member of the Church, five have assisted in 
administering to the sick, three have assisted in consecrating oil, five 
have not assisted in the blessing of the bread or the water. Speaking of 
service, these are just everv day things that should come to them at 
home and all of which will be required of them when they get into 
the missionfield. They are not at fault for not having had the privilege 
of performing these ordinances. We should see to it that these expe- 
riences come to them. This opportunity for service should come to 
them before thev go into the missionfield. Many of them come hce 
without a testimony of the gospel. Let me remind you. that a testimony 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the gospel comes only through work. President Young said that 
more men gain a testimony of this gospel while upon their feet than 
while upon their knees. We can pray from now to the end of our days, 
and prayer alone may not bring a testimony of this work. But through 
prayer and actual service, we do get a testimony. ' , 

Don't you know that every individual that comes into this world 
with the promise of the new and everlasting covenant, has embodied in 
his very soul a testimony of this gospel ? That testimony we may liken 
to the parable of the Savior regarding the sower ; some of the seed, when 
sown, falls upon stony ground, where it is picked up by the birds and 
devoured ; some in shallow soil, where it sprouts and grows for a little 
season and withers and dies ; spme in soil where it grows up with the 
weeds, and the weeds choke it and prevent its growth ; and some in 
•good soil, where it grows and develops and brings forth fruit in 
abundance. That is the condition of our boys and our girls, and it is 
our duty as Latter-day Saints, as men holding the Priesthood, as 
mothers and fathers in Israel, not to wait until our boys get into the 
missionfield before that seed is watered and cultivated and cared for, 
that it may grow into a testimony and into service. That should be 
developed at home. From the moment of birth, the home, the parents, 
are responsible. The bishops of the wards are responsible with the 
parents for providing a means for development for these young men. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I must not talk longer. I rejoice 
in this privilege I have of being with you. I pray God to bless you. I 
rejoice in the fact that I have fellowship with you in this Church! I 
take a pride in it. I have found that it is for me a condition of honor 
wherever I go ; for the people of the world are beginning to look upon 
your works, your faith, your lives, and your teachings as an example 
to be followed. To be one with you, to partake of these blessings, to 
partake of these privileges, is indeed a most wonderful opportunity, and 
I thank God for that blessing and that privilege. May his blessings 
continue with us. May we always be found serving in faith, that we 
may be entitled to his promised blessings, I pray; in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem : "A prayer of thanksgiving." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Don Carlos Young. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

At 2 o'clock p. m., October 9, 1927, a second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall. 

Elder John Wells, of the Presiding Bishopric, presided. 

The music and song were given by the Ensign ward choir, Wallace 
Bennett, conductor ; Tracy Y. Cannon at the organ. 

The choir sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation." 

The opening prayer was by Elder Charles B. Felt. 

An anthem, "Send out thy light," was sung by the choir.

- x . President of the iNebo Stake 

I certainly trust that the prayer offered shall be answered and 
fulfilled in my behalf. I feel a very weak instrument at this time in 
attempting to proclaim the gospel of bur Lord and Master to you, 
but nevertheless with Paul, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, because 
it is the power of God unto salvation" to all those who accept its 
principles and live them. If considerable time and care were taken in 
the preparation of a questionnaire, scattered very generally, and col- 
lected, and the results tabulated, and if the main question in that docu- 
ment were this, "What is the great aim of life?" I am sure that the 
answers compiled, and the meanings boiled down to their last stages, it 
would be something like this, especially to the non-members of the 
Church, that the great object of life is to have a rich, full, abundant 
life. The answer of the Latter-day Saints could possibly be something 
like this, "To be saved and exalted in God's kingdom is the prime aim 
and object of life." 

If we were to outline the plan whereby this aim could be ac- 
complished, I think it would well come under three heads or divisions : 
first, to develop right attitudes — proper ideals, if you please; second, 
to develop knowledge, or the intellect; and third, to develop proper 
habits or to do the will of God. 

With our first proposition, then, we must develop right attitudes 
or the proper ideals in life. We must know and teach our children to 
know that what we are to be, each day, each moment, each hour, we 
are becoming. And in the words of Thackeray, we must also know 
that "we sow an act, we reap a habit ; we sow a habit, we reap a 
character ; we sow a character, and we reap a destiny" in life. I some- 
times wonder if our attitude in life does not depend very much more 
upon faith than it does upon reason. Please do not misunderstand 
me ; as important as reason is in this life, and it is the power to reason 
that chiefly distinguishes man from the lower animals, yet there are 
too many people in the world today who- accept this doctrine alone 
and quit at the point that it discontinues. That, it seems to me, is 
one of the tragedies of life, to accept only reason. Accepting only that, 
I doubt if one can have the proper ideals or proper attitude toward life ; 
because faith begins largely where reason ends. Reason may be said 
to be finite, while faith has no limits. Think of a person who tried to 
live, who does live, only in the realm of reason, who has shut out from 
his existence the great field outside of the field of reason—faith. No 
■ Latter-day Saint could possibly stop with reason alone. I am sure that 
testimonies generally are not gained by reasoning them out. We go as 
far as we can by reason, and then we depend upon a higher source, and 
that higher source takes us into the realm of faith and makes possible 
the proper ideals and the proper attitudes of- life. 

Our second proposition : we must develop knowledge, the intellect. 
Herein comes the great battle against ignorance. Intelligence is the 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



glory of God. To know what a wonderful thing that is in life, to know, 
not to be driven by every wind of doctrine but at all times to be able to 
make decisions, to reach conclusions, through reason and through faith 
and thereby reach our second great aim to our salvation and exaltation 
in life. And I sometimes wonder if we take the time that we should, 
as true Latter-day Saints, to teach our children, in order that they may 
know. How many evenings, how many Sunday mornings, or Sunday 
afternoons, when the hours are long, do you call others about you, your 
children particularly? I am most interested at this moment in the chil- 
dren, in the young people of our Church, for next to creating a human 
soul, the divinest thing is to educate it aright. How many times do we 
call them around about us and teach them to pray? How many boys 
and girls can repeat from memory the Lord's prayer, the Beatitudes, 
the Articles of Faith, and can give a reason for the hope that is within 
them regarding each of these? How quickly they grasp them ! You would 
be surprised how they drink them in. And I sometimes think that as 
teachers of this Church, and as exponents of the great gospel of Christ, 
we overlook a valuable opportunity in teaching our boys and girls so 
that they will know, will have the power to decide in the hour of temp- 
tation. 

Our third proposition is that of developing right habits. This, the 
power to do, is the most important, I'm sure, of the three; because it 
is not a matter of what we say or what we know but what we do in life 
that is going to determine our happiness, our destiny, our salvation, 
and our exaltation. Would that somehow we had the power, that we 
knew the process, the formula, if you please, of transferring or working 
over that which we know so that it will be a guide to that which we do. 
I believe the nearest formula that we have, and which will insure the 
greatest success, is to start in life young, always to do the right and to 
keep in mind that that which we are to be, every moment, every hour, we 
are becoming. 

.And last, we must, in order to gain our aims and objectives in life, 
enrich the lives of others. How often others may be about us who 
would like to know the things that we know, who perhaps do not have 
the peace of mind that we possess regarding some of these eternal 
principles. And yet we are fearful that we might offend, or we are 
fearful that someone else could do it better, and as a result some of our 
near neighbors, some of our friends in life, go through without the 
proper perspective of this gospel. 

It was a joy in our stake, quite recently, to have a veryxievout Chris- 
tian man come back into the Church after an absence of 37 years. 
Through lack of understanding, largely through the lack of a kind 
word, a warm handclasp, a sympathetic and confidential chat, as others 
met him upon the corner,, he felt that the Saints, that the Church were 
against him. Let me implore you, my brothers and sisters, not to let 
any opportunities pass in life to enrich the lives of others, to make them 
conscious of the great purposes of life. As to how it may be accom- 
plished : first, by our attitudes, our proper ideals ; second, by the knowl- 



ELDER LEE R. TAYLOR 



125 



edge that we gain ; and last, by our habits or the things in life we do. 

In conclusion, let me read the words of one who has said something 
. that appeals to me very much. 

"One ship drives east and another drives west 
With the self-same winds that hlow. 
'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales 

That tell the way to go. 
Like the winds of the sea are the winds of Fate; 

We may joy along through life, 
But 'tis the set of the sail that decides the gale ; 
And not the calm or the strife." 

It is a pleasure, at this time, to tell you that I feel very deeply the 
truthfulness of this gospel, and I bear you this testimony, and I do it 
in humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. WHITE 

President of the Yellowstone Stake 

My brethren and sisters : I feel indeed humble in occupying this 
position, and most sincerely trust that the Spirit of the Lord may come 
to my aid. This is one position where one is solely dependent upon the 
Spirit of God, if he shall utter the things that are most profitable. I 
have been interested in the remarks of President Taylor in giving us 
the principal keys, motives, the attitude that should direct us in life. 
I was thinking about the words of the Lord to the children of Israel, 
"The Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself." 
Living in this age of the world there is ofttimes a. tendency among 
Latter-day Saints to try to be so much like those of other churches that 
there appears to be no means of determining whether they are Latter-day 
Saints or members of some other church, or of none at all. I think it is 
well that we try to impress the world and our associates that we are a 
distinct people — not that we hold ourselves as better than they, except 
as we may do better, but principally for the fact that we bear a message 
which no other people is in possession of. 

How may we obtain a testimony of the gospel? No doubt a number 
of those whp heard the teachings of Jesus doubted the divinity of his 
calling, and he read their thoughts and said, "My doctrine is not mine, 
but his- that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself ." We Latter- 
day Saints say to the people of the world, that if they will accept of the 
doctrines of "Mormonism," in faith and in the spirit of true repentance 
and humility, they, too, may obtain such a testimony. 

There are certain features or blessings that characterize faith and 
obedience to the gospel. The Savior in commissioning his disciples, 
before sending them out to preach, gave them promises that certain 
blessings should follow those who would obey. Among those promises 
were the gift of faith, and the gift of prophesy. My attention is now 
directed to some incidents that have been of peculiar interest to ! me 



I 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

coming from the Snake River valley. Many, many years ago, when most 
of the section now comprised in the Yellowstone stake was in its rough 
state, there was one section covered with large sagebrush lying level and 
beautiful. No water had yet been taken out of the river, and just a few 
people resided there, struggling against adverse conditions and almost 
discouraged because of the dryness of the soil. One of the brethren of 
.the Council of the Twelve was present with a little body of Saints in our 
stake. A brother remarked to him, as the visitor was being entertained 
at his home, "I have dug a hole here in the hope of getting water, but I 
suppose it is hopeless." The visiting brother, being inspired of the Lord, 
said to the brother, "Do not fill up the well ; you will yet have water in 
the well, and that within a short time." They had already gone through 
a few years of trial and had made similar attempts but without success. 
But within a year following that prophecy, water appeared in that well. 
Since that time everyone who desired it has obtained water. Water is 
plentiful. That section, then so barren and uninviting, is the paradise 
of the upper Snake river valley, the famed Egin bench. 

Another incident > comes to me. In 1909, when our stake was 
organized, two of the brethren, shortly after the selection of the presi- 
dency, and a few other stake officers, proceeded with the new presidency 
to different parts of the stake to set the wards in order. They went into 
one ward, which previous to that time had been a part of the Fremont 
stake. There was a vacancy in the bishopric, one counselor. These 
brethren made the visit to .select the other counselor. As they sat in the 
little ward chapel, with its pulpit in the west and the entrance at the east, 
they went over the matter, trying to determine upon the right man to fill 
the vacancy. But they could hardly find one who seemed, according to 
the judgment of the bishop, to be the right man. While they were yet 
discussing the matter, a brother opened the door to the east and called 
out across the room to one of the brethren sitting on the stand, "Brother, 
you are wanted on the outside." Our visiting brother beckoning to him 
said, "Brother come in, come in." Turning to the brethren behind, he 
said, "Brethren, there is your man." He had no knowledge of having 
ever seen that man before. Who told him that that was the man to fill 
the place in the bishopric ? What spirit told him that that man was even 
a member of the Church? The man was selected, and I am a living wit- 
ness to the fact that he served in that capacity faithfully and well for a 
number of years, even up to his death. • • 

I could enumerate a number of such incidents as proof of the ful- 
filment of the promise made by the Savior that these signs shall follow 
them that believe. ' 

I wish to support most heartily the remarks of President Taylor 
with reference to teaching in the home. I fear, brethren and sisters, 
that we arc not giving enough attention to the training of our children 
in the home. Too often parents thrust the entire responsibility of 
training their children upon the organizations of the Church, forgetting 
that at the hearthstone, where the family may assemble and have their 



ELDER JOHN H. WHITE 



127 



family prayer and devotion, is the place where the most important train- 
ing and the greatest impression may be given. 

Let me say further, that I sometimes feel that our people trust their 
children too much — not that we wish to lack faith in our children, but 
remember they are human. With the many temptations about us, some- 
times those children, and perhaps we as well, do things that are not 
always in keeping with the Spirit of the Lord., Sometimes some friend 
would feel to give us warning of dangers that beset our children, and we 
turn them aside and say, "I do not believe a word of it." I think it 
is well to give heed to any kind word that may come from our neighbor. 
I invite it ^rom our good neighbors. If they can help my wife and 
me by offering us a suggestion of how dangers may be avoided, with 
which our children are confronted, we will thank them for it. 

Another thing, brothers and sisters, that impresses me. I believe 
that the important factors that contribute vitally to the development 
of our children and to the advancement of the Lord's purposes is the 
education of our children in our Church schools where they may be 
prepared to go into the world as ministers of the word of God. We 
note that when they return home they seem to bring life and spirit into 
our wards. I hope, brothers and sisters, that we will look upon the 
privilege granted us of sending our sons and daughters abroad as a 
very important opportunity ; it means so much to the lives of these young 
people even aside from the great good they may do in carrying the truth 
to the people of the earth. 

I wish before closing, to bear you my humble testimony. I know 
the gospel which we have embraced is the gospel of Jesus Christ, that 
it possesses all the saving principles that will protect and preserve us, 
make us happy in life and prepare us for a future in the eternities. 

iMay the Lord give us faith. , May we always have the spirit of 
humility and a desire to do his will, I humbly pray, in Jesus' name. Amen.

ELDER WILLIAM R. PALMER 

President of the Parozvan Stake 

It is a bit disconcerting, I assure you, my brethren and sisters, to 
be called out of the congregation and asked to occupy a portion of the 
time of these meetings, at which the Saints have gathered from almost 
the ends of the earth to be fed the bread of life. I am tremendously 
impressed with the responsibility that rests upon the elder who presumes 
to occupy even a few brief minutes of this precious time, and I desire 
very much the support of your faith and prayers, to the end that the 
Lord will bless me with his Spirit, and draw from me those things which 
he would have you receive. I believe that it is quite as much the privilege 
of the congregation to receive the blessings of inspiration and to 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



receive it through the speaker as it is the privilege of the speaker to 
have that inspiration. 

I have been impressed with the strength and the growth everywhere 
evident in the Church. When we see the Saints gather at these great 
conferences, the young people mingling with the old, it is evidence suf- 
ficient that faith is not dead, but that the Church is growing in strength 
and in power and in influence. 

I was impressed this morning with the talks that were given by 
President Charles W. Nibley and by Elder Stephen L. Richards on 
- those two somewhat commonplace principles of our faith, tithing and 
the Word of Wisdom. They expounded those principles much better 
than I could ever hope to do, but in the few brief moments of the time ■ 
allotted to me ; I desire to hear my testimony to you of the blessings 
that accompany the living of those principles. I like to find some 
logical connection between the promises of the gospel and the expe- 
rience of my every-day life. I am not one of those who look for the 
mysterious, the mystic, and the miraculous. I like to read of the bless- 
ings, the promises, and their fulfilment, in the every-day affairs of my 
life and in every-day experiences. And it is in this light that I desire to 
interpret to you my understanding of these precious principles of truth. 

The Word of Wisdom is given to us as a principle with promise. 
The promises that we have in that great revelation are these, that we 
shall have strength of body, that we shall walk and not be weary, that 
, we shall run and not faint, that the destroying angel shall pass us by 
as the children of Israel and not slay us; and that there shall come to 
us through the observance of that principle, treasures of wisdom and of 
knowledge, yea even hidden treasures. Some time ago a brother came 
to me with a somewhat visionary and impractical proposition which he 
wanted me to support, and said to me that this had come to him as one 
of the hidden treasures of knowledge through the observance of the 
Word of Wisdom. Now, just what is the meaning of these promises? 
Does it mean that if I keep the Word of Wisdom, abstain from 
tea, coffee and tobacco and strong drink, that 1 can walk and 
never get weary, or that I can run all day and never get faint? I do 
not understand it so. I see this in it, it is a simple law of health. If 
I have been a violator of this law of health and then repent of that 
and keep the law of health, I will have an increased capacity to walk 
and not be weary, to run and not faint. In other words, my capacity, 
my physical strength, will be increased to me so that I can accomplish 
more in a day's work. And that is the realization of the blessing to me. 
And this promise of hidden treasures of knowledge — we know, brethren 
and sisters, and we knew it as a people, those who had faith in the word 
of the Lord, long before the scientific world knew it. But the scientific 
world knows it today, perhaps better than we know it, that tobacco 
and tea and coffee and strong drink does inhibit our mental processes, 
shuts down and restricts our capacity to reason, to analyze. Now, if I 
have been breaking the law and then 1 repent of it and keep the com- 



ELDER WILLIAM R. PALMER 129 



mandments of the Lord, my mind expands and there is opened to me a 
whole world of treasures of knowledge and of wisdom that before had 
been hidden from me. And so I see in the observance of this law. of 
the Lord an increase of wisdom or an increase of capacity to work and 
receive wisdom; because my mind can analyze and penetrate farther 
in its mental processes. 

Now that other promise of the Word of Wisdom, that the destroy- 
ing angel shall pass us by as the children of Israel and not slay us. 
Where is the fulfilment of that? You can read it in the statistics of 
the Church, the mortality rate among the Latter-day Saints is lower 
than even among the picked risks of the insurance companies of the 
world. Now, what is the meaning of those statistics? It means that 
the Lord is lengthening our days. We do not keep this law 100%. 
We are not as faithful in it as we should be. But just in proportion 
as we do keep it, just in proportion as we have been faithful in the 
observance of that law, the Lord has blessed us, and as a people our 
days are lengthened. 

And so with this principle of tithing. It also is a principle of 
promise, a promise of temporal blessings. "Prove me now herewith, 
saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, 
and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to re- 
ceive it." I have faith in that principle. Now, I know there are always 
those who say, "Here is this brother who does not live his religion, 
who seems to care nothing about his faith, and yet everything he 
touches seems to turn to gold ; and here is this other brother, who is 
as faithful as can be, but can hardly keep the wolf away from the door.". 
The thing that is wrong in that analysis seems to me to be that this is 
a principle given to a people, as well as a principle to individuals. There 
are always exceptions to the rule, and these are the exceptions to the 
rule. I do not regard this promise as a promise of great wealth to us. 
I do not ask the Lord to send me great wealth for the reason that I 
keep the law of tithing. I take it that his promise to me is that if I 
keep that law I shall have plenty, I shall not want. pVIaybe, if the Lord 
showered wealth upon me it would be a curse rather than a blessing. 

Now, brothers and sisters, if we have faith in that law and observe 
it and have the assurance in our souls that we will not want, is there 
any more to worry about ? We strive, scheme and work to build up a 
bank account, and to create a large estate of houses, lands, cattle 
and so on, just so that we may not want and that our loved ones who 
are dependent upon us may not come to want. Brothers and sisters, if 
we keep this law of the Lord, we shall not want. We are not as a 
people observing the law of tithing 100%. We are not, perhaps, keep- 
ing it 75% or 50%, but to some extent we are observing that law. 
And are we a blessed people? I look over this congregation, I have 
observed people on this square. We are a well fed people, a well clothed 
people, there is no evidence of want among us. The Lord has gener- 
ously fulfilled his promises to us. And it is my humble faith and 
testimony to you that if we keep these laws, the blessings that are 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



predicated upon them and that are promised ,to us will be ours. I bear 
you this testimony humbly and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH K. NICHOLES 

President of the St. George Stake 

My brethren and sisters: I have listened with great interest to 
these services, and to the other services which I have attended through- 
out this conference. 1 have had greater interest during the short time 
that I have occupied a leading position in our stake, for the reason that 
I desire to take home to our people the messages of the conferences 
which I attend. I have tried to analyze the message given by each 
speaker, with the hope that when I return I may take that home. 

I am more particularly interested, as President Taylor has said he 
is, in the young people of our stake; because I believe that the hope 
of Israel resides in them. And I believe, too, that if we can inspire 
these young people with a testimony of the gospel which we have 
espoused, that no greater good can come to them than through this 
source. I recognize that, in general, we have the motive powers of 
life — the great joys and pleasures of life, the sympathies of our lives, 
have their sources in our religious services. 

I believe that the opening services of this conference are more 
easily analyzed than the later services. I believe that I can appeal 
to the young people to recognize the necessity of law enforcement 
easier than I can give them the desire for a testimony, the kind of a 
testimony which men of long years of experience bear before our people. 

I have tried to analyze this problem of a testimony, and I agree 
that it is not an easy matter. There is not as much evidence of a 
reasoning character to appeal to as we might think. And yet the greatest 
things of life lie beneath the certainty of this testimony. I think this 
is also paralleled in the fact that the greatest forces in nature are those 
we are not able to measure. It is not easy to analyze the strength that 
is in men which we call personality. It is not easy to analyze the fact 
that the greatest joy in life comes through parenthood. And especially 
it seems to me that it would be difficult to have a young unmarried 
man or woman believe, in this day and age, that possibly the greatest 
joys in life do come through parenthood. And yet those who have 
become parents and who know this great source of joy and satisfaction 
will testify that this is the case. These are facts. In the midst of an 
economic drive like we live in today, and unknown in the world before, 
the fact might be against a testimony that the greatest joys in life 
come through the family. A great teacher in the University of Chicago, 
Dr. Cope, has said that the family is the sure way to walk the path of 
the cross. We who are parents can testify of the truthfulness of this. 

Now, it is not easy to analyze any fact, and obtain through the 
reasoning powers alone' the great force of a testimony of the divine 
authenticity of our religious doctrine, and yet those of us who have 



ELDER JOSEPH H. NICHOLES 



131 



had sufficient experience know that this is the case. After our services 
the other day when the missionary presidents spoke, I wondered if we 
could pass before us the essential doctrines of all the creeds in the 
world — and they would number hundreds — if we had the power to 
analyze the essential doctrines of all these creeds, and through our 
intellect determine which of all these things were right, whether we 
would not have great difficulty indeed. I believe, though, that the 
student, through the general processes of reasoning which are applied 
to him, in his daily life, through his training in high school, in the district 
school, and through his college days, would adopt that as the natural re- 
course, and he may challenge you and me, when we bear testimony that 
this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, to know the reasons upon which we base 
that assertion. This student might say, "Have you reviewed all the doc- 
trines in the world and know through this examination that yours are 
true ?" I would have to say that I have not. "Do you know through travel 
the world over that the gospel of Jesus Christ which we have espoused 
is true?" And with many I would have to say that I have not so traveled, 
but it is the testimony borne by the Spirit of the Lord that is all- 
essential. 

I had an experience once sitting before Brother Ballard, which 
gave to me one of the finest evidences of the divinity of this work 
that I know of. I heard him speak upon the redeeming power of Jesus, 
the redemption of his atoning blood. This subject to me had never 
been interesting, but in the light in which he placed it, it became so. 
Without much analysis he proceeded to testify, through a period of about 
one hour, of the divinity of Jesus, the fact that he had lived and died 
for us, and I saw men -and women on every side of me weep with joy and 
satisfaction, and I said to myself that if I ever knew anything, if. I 
knew that I lived, I knew that what this man said was true. 

Sometimes when I have been called upon to bless little children 
I have tried to question myself as to what was the most important' 
thing to present in a blessing upon the head of a child. As a father 
I would say that the most important thing in the world is faith, faith 
to believe, faith to see, faith to hope, faith to understand, faith to 
desire to do the right thing in the world, faith necessary to cause a 
man and a woman to serve each other. One of the finest things that 
I have learned in the Church is the continued sacrifice of men and 
women in this wonderful service, the great quantity of unpaid labor 
in this Church. I sometimes wonder how a man or woman can give 
so much time and effort to the common service of all the Saints. 

Brothers and sisters, I rejoice in this wonderful gospel of ours. 
The finest thing that has come into my life is an opportunity to serve. 
I rejoice because of the people that I live with, who make my life 
happy, who help me to see the joy in each day. I rejoice in the message 
of the gospel. I pray that we shall all learn more and more as we live. 
How wonderful it is to know that Jesus lives, that he is the Christ, 
the son of the living God, and that in him there is life and light and 
hope and wisdom and salvation and all that life holds near and dear 



132

unto us. May we rejoice in the privileges that we have to serve one 
another and the great Master of all, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

Elder J. Robert Smith sang a tenor solo : "I think when I read that 
sweet story of old." 

ELDER HEBER J. MEEKS 

President of the Kanab Stake 

I have been coming up to the general conferences of the Church 
for sixteen years. In that length of time I have missed only three 
conferences, and during all the conferences that L have attended I 
have been thrilled by the spirit and teachings of the brethren. During 
the sessions of this conference ,1 have been thrilled. My heart has 
been made to rejoice. I have seen many situations arise in the Church, 
but the Lord has provided a way by which every situation has been 
met. He has placed inspired men at the head of the Church, and he 
is wielding an unseen hand and power over this people. 

I rejoice that we have a progressive Church, an organization which 
provides for the service of all its members, that they may all find 
work to do and thereby enrich their own souls and help to enrich the 
souls of their brethren and sisters. It seems to me that without in- 
spiration it would be difficult to organize a church that would meet 
the needs and requirements of the present day. This Church was 
organized under the direction of a youth, but the foundations were 
laid so well and ,so deeply that it has provided not only for the present 
day but for the future, and we will find the Lord providing a means 
for this people to accomplish the work they have set their hands to 
do. I am grateful that I was born in the Church, that my father knew 
the Prophet Joseph. He has told me many times that the Prophet 
called at his house at Nanvoo only a few days before his martyrdom 
and said, "Brother Meeks, the Saints will yet go to the Rocky Moun- 
tains, and you will go with them," and told him many things that 
would transpire' after the Saints came to the mountains, and especially 
to my father and his family — all of which came true. After the 
Prophet's death, the Saints were in great distress of mind and anxiety 
regarding the future of the work, and my father testified that when the 
Saints were called together and Sidney Rigdon made claim to the 
guardianship of the Church and spoke in behalf of his claims for 
something like two hours to the assembled Saints, that he was there 
and heard him, and when President Young arose when Sidney was 
through, my father testified that Brigham Young spoke with the voice 
of Joseph Smith, that the mantle of Joseph fell upon him. He wit- 
nessed it, and he bore testimony to that truth. And it seems that it 
was burned into my soul to, honor and revere those two great men. 

Those who have succeeded have also been prophets of the living 
God and have been rightful successors to the Prophet Joseph and to 
Brigham Young. These brethren have each been given a period

of presidency. The Prophet's presidency has passed away, gone into 
eternity, and he is there giving an account of the years when 
he presided over the Church. President Young likewise has passed 
beyond. His administration has gone by, but he stands at the head 
of ' that time and will stand there throughout all eternity, and 
he must give an account of his stewardship, of his presidency. And 
their successors have been given their presidencies, just as every 
president of a stake and every bishop of a ward has been given a 
period of presidency. They must account for that not only here 
but in eternity; for we will be [associated with this great organization 
there, and the kindred spirits with whom we associated here will be 
associated with us there, and (if there have been 'differences, errors, 
creep in during our administrations, they must be corrected, and we 
must be responsible for the part that we play. Therefore, I feel the 
great responsibility that rests upon me in presiding over a stake of Zion. 

I am grateful, as I said before, for the organization that provides 
for the service of all its members, and in analyzing the teachings of 
this gospel and what it means, what priesthood means to us, it seems 
to me that it may be summed up in these words, "It is the pref ect plan 
of (service. " There can be no better plan devised for people to serve, 
both young and old, and the Lord has inspired this wonderful organiza- 
tion, and it bears the stamp of divinity and is recognized by those who 
study it. There is no human organization to compare with it. I 
appreciate the fact that it is the power of God unto salvation, not only 
spiritual salvation but temporal, and if we will observe the simple 
teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we will be saved, both spirit- 
ually and temporally. 

May we be given strength and power to withstand the temptations 
that come to us. May we be given strength and power to live the 
simple truths of the everlasting gospel, that we may grow in love, 
that we may grow in knowledge of the truth, and that we may have 
• the favor and the approval of our Father in heaven, I humbly ask, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

We have listened this afternoon to testimonies of the truth of the 
gospel, also to advise, counsel and instructions dealing with our 
temporal and spiritual affairs. We have appreciated the wonderful 
music rendered by the choir, appointed for this meeting. One of the 
soloists sang the hymn, "Suffer little children to come unto me." The 
remarkable incident of the blessing of children occurred in the little 
village of Ephron, in the district (of Perea, on the east side of the 
Jordan valley, just before the Master started his journey to Jerusalem 
to be crucified. 

The speakers at the tabernacle session have urged us to obey the 
laws of the country, to sustain the constitution, and to observe the Word 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of Wisdom and the law of tithing. Our faith has been strengthened 
by marvelous stories concerning the Book of Mormon and the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. One of the brethren speaking in the tabernacle quoted 
the statement of Jesus : 

"Cohie unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : 
and ye shall find rest unto your souls." 

This thought occurred to me : Were the Master here today 
thousands in this building could say : "Master, we have come to thee. 
We have listened to the call of thy servants. We have obeyed the 
gospel. Testimonies have been given us of its truth. The burden 
of doubt concerning you has left us. We have found rest for our souls." 
The gospel of Jesus Christ will give rest and contentment to any person 
who will obey and live it. 

THE SABBATH DAY 

I want to use the remainder of the time allotted to me to call to 
your attention one subject that has not been spoken on during this 
conference, and that is, the observance of the Sabbath, or the Lord's day. 
During the last few years many changes have occurred in the social 
life of the people, caused by the automobile, motion pictures and the 
great world war, which has had a detrimental effect on the observance 
of the Lord's day of rest. In addition to these conditions, a habit is 
growing to hold football and baseball games, Sunday concerts with or 
without pay, Sunday railroad excursions, etc., and places of amusement 
and resorts are open on the Lord's day, and even some places of busi- 
ness. 

LAW OF MOSES 

The great law giver, Moses, at one time gathered the Hebrews 
around Mount Sinai so that they could see the manifestations of the 
power of the Lord. At that time there was delivered to him that re- 
markable series of laws known as the Decalogue, or the Ten Com- 
mandments. The opening of this remarkable series of commandments 
says: "I am the Lord thy God which hath brought thee out of the 
land' of Egypt; out of the house of bondage," and among those ten 
commandments he gave these : 

"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work : 

"But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt 
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy 
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." 

Later the Lord re-stated this law to Moses, and he said : 

"Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you 
throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth 
sanctify you. * * * 

"Wherefore, the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath. It is a sign between 
ime and the children of Israel forever." 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



135 



To the credit of the Hebrew people they did observe the Sabbath. 
Even in their captivity and when in bondage to foreign nations they did 
their best to rest on the seventh day. Before the advent of the Messiah 
two great religious and political parties arose in Palestine. They added 
to the Sabbath day law many trifling and irritating restrictions. No 
Jewish army would attack on a Sabbath day ; no Jewish army would 
march on that day; the people were forbidden to bake or cook; to 
build a fire or to prepare food, etc., and they could only'walk a certain 
distance with a friend on that day. Some of their restrictions were 
rebuked several times by the Master and at one time he said: "The 
Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath." 

The Master was crucified on a Friday. He was hurriedly buried 
before the Sabbath day, which commenced on Friday at six o'clock. 
His body laid in the tomb until Sunday morning, the first day of the 
week, when he arose from the dead. On that day he was seen by several 
women, then by Peter, and then by Mary Magdalene. He accom- 
panied two of his friends to Emmaus and then appeared to his disciples 
and their friends in an upper room, and on the following first day of 
the week he again appeared to his disciples and others, and from that 
time on the Christian church observed the first day of the week as 
the Lord's day in remembrance of his resurrection. 

The Lord has definitely placed the responsibility of the Latter-day 
Saints concerning the day of rest. On the 7th day of August, 1831, he 
gave a revelation to the Prophet Joseph known to us as section 59, 
Doctrine and Covenants. The part of the section which I wish to call 
to your attention is as follows : 

"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy 
day. For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and 
to pay thy devotions unto the Most High. But remember that on this, the Lord's 
day, thou shalt 'of fer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, 
confessing thy sins unto thy brethren and before the Lord." 

President Brigham Young called the observance of the Lord's day 
to the attention of the Saints in his time, and these instructions can be 
found in the Discourses of Brigham Young, as follows : 

"All Latter-day Saints should observe the Sabbath by resting from all labor, 
except those who must be- detained to take care of children or perform some 
work of mercy. Now remember, those who go skating, buggy riding, or on 
excursions on the Sabbath day are weak in the faith and gradually, little by little, 
the spirit of their religion leaks out of their hearts and their affection. When 
I see a man gathering in his crops, or cattle, or making repairs on the Lord's 
day, I pount him weak in the faith. At least he has lost the spirit of his 
religion. We should devote our time as the Church requires it, on the Lord's 
day, for the express purpose of renewing our mental and physical powers and 
getting our spiritual food." 

The late President Joseph F. Smith was equally as emphatic on 
this subject as President Brigham Young, and in his writings contained 
in Gospel Doctrine, he has said : 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Men are not resting from their labors when they plow, plant, dig or do 
work of any kind. Men are not resting when they work around the house all 
day doing odd jobs. Men are not honoring the Lord when they go to places of 
amusement. Men are not honoring the Lord when they loiter around ice cream 
places, go to ball games and witness these games. It is a reflection on any 
Latter-day Saint community to patronize a ball game on the Lord's day." 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS AND THE SABBATH 

Not Latter-day Saint can feel in full fellowship with the Holy 
Spirit who uses the Lord's day for recreation and pleasure, who visits 
pleasure resorts, picture shows and theatres, who goes to baseball or 
football games, who goes on picnics, fishing or hunting trips, or on 
railway excursions on the Lord's day, or who uses that day in auto- 
mobile riding for pleasure. 

Experience has shown that those who remember the Lord's day 
and keep it holy are in harmony with the spirit of the gospel. The 
keeping of this law will affect our 'lives for good, and, if we 
disobey it it will affect our lives for evil. The Lord has designed 
this day so that we may rest from our labors, attend to our religious 
duties in a spirit of thankfulness and appreciation for the gospel, and 
obtain spiritual comfort and spiritual food. I am wondering if, in the 
rush and whirl of life, we are overlooking some of the fundamentals 
of the gospel. Are we making this, day a day of rest and devotion or 
a day of recreation and pleasure? I hope the Latter-day Saints will 
follow the word of the Lord given to us in these latter days and that 
we shall strictly observe the day of rest. 

I testify to you that "Mormonism," as it is called, is true. That 
it is the power of God unto salvation to the believer. It is a living 
force which will make us better every day we apply its truth and 
principles, and will take us back to the presence of our Father in heaven 
from whence we came. Amen. 

The choir sang, "The day is ended." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder David R. Lyon, of the 
Ensign stake. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing meeting of the 98th semi-annual conference of the 
Church opened in the Tabernacle on Sunday, October 9, 1927, at 2 
o'clock. The attendance was very large. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the choir and congre- 
gation would sing the hymn : "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

After the fervent and earnest singing by the great audience, the 
opening prayer was offered by Elder Edward H. Anderson. 

The Hymn, "I know that my Redeemer lives," was sung by the 
choir, Jessie Evans, soloist.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

HEARD BY RADIO 

We have received word from Elder David A. Broadbent of the 
Wasatch stake presidency, that the Heber tabernacle is filled with 
Saints who are getting perfect reception of the conference services. 

We have a telegram to the effect that there is a large gathering 
of listeners at Ephraim, who wish to express their appreciation of the 
KSL broadcast of the conference services. 

It is only fair to say that the interruption that occurred during 
the opening meeting of our conference, at which time the broadcast of 
baseball news came into our meeting, was by reason of the fact that 
the KSL radio service is rented by the hour, and our time expired at 
ten minutes after twelve o'clock. They, therefore, thought we had 
adjourned our meeting. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

I crave a double portion of the Spirit of the Lord while I stand 
before this magnificent audience of Latter-day Saints this afternoon. 

THANKS TO GOD 

I thank my heavenly Father for all his mercies in the past, and 
above all I thank him that I know that my Redeemer lives. I also thank 
him, at this time, for the wonderful care he has had over Sister Smoot. 
Over seven months ago I was directed by a man of science, a great 
doctor, that if I intended that she should be buried in Utah, I should 
at once arrange for the care of her body and make plans for leaving 
Washington within forty-eight hours. I have to acknowledge, not only 
to the Latter-day Saints, but to all the world, that it is not science that 
has kept her alive so long, but it has been the prayers of God's people, 
which have safeguarded her so far. God's will be done, not mine. 

THE INFLUENCE AND POWER OF GOD 

I have been more than pleased at this conference. It is so often 
said at the close of conference that it was the best conference that was 
ever held. I have never before attended one in all my life where I 
have felt the influence and power of Almighty God as I have at this 
conference. The Spirit of God has been with us, and no man, no 
matter what his belief may be, could stand before an audience of this 
character and listen to< what has been said and not admit in his heart 
that there is something in "Mormonism" which ino other religion on 
earth has. 

i 

THE CATHOLIC FATHER MISTAKEN 

On the 22nd day of September last I was thinking of an experi- 
ence that came to me forty-five years ago last July. I was then a 
young man of twenty years and was superintendent of the Provo Co- 
op. I decided that I would go to Leadville and Denver, with a view 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of opening up a market for the products of the farm that we handled 
in Utah county. I made that trip and was successful. On my return, 
coming over the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, we had scarcely 
left Denver until a gentleman approached me. He was a Catholic 
father, a splendid type of physical manhood, a well educated man, one 
whose appearance would attract the* attention of people anywhere. 
I had been conversing with one or two men. As I left them and took 
my seat he came and sat by me. Said he : 

"I understand that you live in Utah." 

"I do." 

"Are you a 'Mormon'?" 
"I am." 

He then began to discuss the question of "Mormonism," and 
among other things he said : "I tell you, young man, that no matter 
whether the Church has grown in years past or not, it will never live 
a hundred years." 

The reason assigned was that it was a fraud, that God did not 
reveal himself to man in these days; that the testimony of Joseph 
Smith was a falsehood upon its face; and an institution based upon a 
falsehood never lived a hundred years, 'and therefore "Mormonism" 
would not live that length of time.. 

The thought came to me as I have looked over these vast audiences 
gathered here in this general conference, of what has happened during 
the last forty five years, and O how mistaken that father was. 

AN ANSWER FROM THE BOOK OF MORMON 

There were a number of things that impressed me greatly in 
what he said. I suppose many of the people of Utah and particularly 
my neighbors knew that I had up to that time not taken much interest 
in Church work. I was wrapped up, body and soul, in commercial 
affairs. I had no testimony that this was God's work. And so when 
I got home the first thing I did was to tell my mother of this circum- 
stance. Among other things that he called to my attention was this, 
that there must be something wrong with the Church, with the organi- 
zation, with the people, because the whole world was in opposition to 
them, and therefore the Church could not be true. Of course he gave 
his reasons why the great Catholic church was the only church of God. 
I told my mother this, and in her quiet way she said : 

"I wish you would read the second chapter of II Nephi, in that 
wonderful book, the Book of Mormon, and I think it will answer the 
statements made by the father or anyone else as to opposition." 

I took occasion to read it, and I want to call your attention to it 
today. Not the whole of it, by any manner of means. I wish I had 
the time to do so, but I am going to content myself after reading just 
a few of the statements regarding opposition, by asking you all to read 
that chapter in the Book of Mormon. It is an account of Lehi ad- 
dressing his son Jacob, and in it Lehi says: 

"And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



139 



because of the rudeness of thy brethren. * * * 

"And he [speaking of God] shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain." 

And as to opposition Lehi says, in the eleventh verse of the chapter : 

"For it must needs be that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, 
my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, 
neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore 
all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore, if it should be one 
body it must needs remain as dead, having no life, neither death, nor corruption, 
nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility." 

NEED OF OPPOSITION IN ALL THINGS 

Lehi goes on to explain why there must be opposition in all things. 
When you stop to think about it, it is absolutely as God's servant, 
Lehi, predicted. If there were no opposition to business it would 
run to dry rot. And, brethren and sisters, if there were no opposition 
to the Church of Christ, it never would make the headway it is making. 
Its foundations never would be so strong as they are without the op- 
position it has encountered. Many of the hardships and evils that 
come to us, come as blessings in disguise. People wonder why weeds 
grow on the farm, why disease comes to the body, why the wicked 
among the peoples of the world, why evil exists upon every hand? 
Evil is a challenge to good. The fight is between evil and good, and 
God intends to have a people who know the difference between good 
and evil, and follow in the footsteps of the teachings of the Master. 
And nothing but good ever was uttered by him in mortal life. Why 
do we have the poor among us? Suppose we did not have any poor. 
I have always considered poverty a challenge, and it does challenge 
our sympathy and generosity, and do you know that that is a wonder- 
ful thing to broaden a man or woman? And I know of no other 
pleasure in all the world equal to that which comes to one whose 
generosity and kindness helps one of God's children. 

BELIEF IN REVELATION 

One of the things that the Catholic father complained most bit- 
terly about was that we claim to have had revelation in this day direct 
from God, and that Joseph Smith received revelations for the establish- 
ment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That I 
think, my brethren and sisters, is pretty well found to be one of the 
great criticisms of the Church. I know that in my own case, when 
there was an effort made to unseat me as a Senator of the United 
States, after all the testimony had been given and I think most every- 
one of my witnesses had testified to the effect that revelation was given 
to the founder of the Church, and I myself testified that I believed it 
with all my heart, Mr. Taylor, in summing up the arguments of the case 
to present to the Senators of the United States with a view to unseat 
me as being unworthy of a seat in that great body, made this statement : 

"Several hundred thousand sincere men and women have believed and now 
believe, as they believe in their own existence, that Joseph Smith, Junior, received 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



revelation direct from God, and if anyone ever believed that, we must believe 
that Senator Smoot believes it. Now a Senator of the United States might 
believe anything else in the world but that and not be ineligible to a seat in the 
body to which he belongs. He might believe in polygamy; he might believe that 
murder was commendable; he might deny the propriety as a rule of life of all 
the ten commandments; he might believe in the sacrifice of human life; he 
might believe in no God or in a thousand gods ; ■ he might be Jew or Gentile, 
Mohammedan or Buddhist, Atheist, or Pantheist ; he might believe that the world 
began last year and would end next year, but to believe in the kind of conviction 
that Reed Smoot possesses, that God speaks to him or anay speak to him is to 
admit by the inevitable logic of his conviction that there is a superior authority 
with whom here and now he may converse, and whose command he can no 
more refuse to obey than he can will himself not to think." 

My time has expired, but I want to tell you today that I haven't 
any more doubt in my mind than that I live that God did reveal him- 
self to Joseph Smith, that this Church is founded upon the great 
principle of revelation from God. He is the author, the one that we 
worship, the one into whose presence we hope in time to return and 
give a report of the stewardship that he granted to us, such that the 
Father would say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." 

God bless the people, God bless our country. Instill in the hearts 
of the American people a greater love, if possible, in the future than in 
the past, of the great Constitution of this land. I feel in my soul that 
the time will never come in all the history of the world, be it short 
or be it long, that this people will deny that the Constitution of the 
United States came from God himself through men raised up for the 
purpose of establishing it and building upon it the greatest nation on 
earth. God be with us, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I have been made very happy while listening to the remarks of 
the brethren who have spoken, for the nature of the testimonies and 
instruction has been very timely. 

A WARNING VOICE AGAINST EVIL 

It is pleasing to know that the Latter-day Saints are loyal, as a 
people, to the Government, to the Constitution, and that they observe 
the law. Moreover, it is well to have our attention called to the duties 
and responsibilities that are ours as members of the Church, and to 
have the warning voice raised, from time to time, against the evils 
that prevail in the world that we may be prepared to resist them. 

WE LIVE IN PERILOUS TIMES 

I take it for granted that every member of the Church sincerely 
believes that we are living in the last days, and that most of those 
who are not of us who profess to believe in the scriptures and in our 
Redeemer hold the same view. This being true, I think we will have 
to agree also that we are living in perilous times, for the prophets of 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 141 



old who had their vision opened so that they could see our times have 
spoken of these conditions. 

PROPHETS HAVE FOREWARNED THE PEOPLE 

Isaiah, Peter, Paul, and even the Savior himself, have spoken of 
these things. Paul when writing to Timothy of the last days had this 
to say: 

"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart 
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 

"Speaking lies in hypocrasy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats." 
And again he says: 

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy. 

"Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, 
despisers of those that are good, 

"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; 

"Having a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof." 

It appears that there is very little lacking, in this prophecy that 
might have been said of the evils of our times; and the Savior declared 
that the days before his second coming were to be like the days before 
the flood. The prophets who dwelt on this continent had the same 
knowledge revealed to them and have proclaimed it in the Book of 
Mormon: : 

"But behold," said Nephi, "in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles — ■ 
' yeai, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who 
shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even 
upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with inquity and 
all imanner of abominations — 

"And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, 
with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and 
with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire." — 2 Nephi 27:1-2. 
Then he adds this : 

"Woe unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught and revile 
against that which is good, and say that it is ;of no worth! For the day shall 
come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth ; and in 
that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish. 

"But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness 
and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts. * * * 

"For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must 
needs be stirred up to repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his ever- 
lasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish ; 

"For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, 
and stir them up to anger against that which is good. 

"And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that 
they will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and thus 
the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 

"And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell ; 
and he saith unto them : I am no devil, for there is none — and thus he whis- 
pereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence 
there is no deliverance."— 2 Nephi 28:16-22.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NEPHI SPOKE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR DAY 

I have read these Scriptures to show that these ancient prophets, 
who saw our times, have spoken, not particularly for the benefit of 
the people of their day, but for the benefit of the people living in the 
days of which these prophecies speak. The world now is in just that 
condition declared by Nephi and by Paul. The people are denying the 
Lord and his atonement and the resurrection of the dead, and they are 
declaring that there is no personal devil, who is Lucifer who was cast 
out of heaven for his rebellion. Nor are the Latter-day Saints alto- 
gether free from these evils and these false teachings that prevail so 
generally in the world. We must not think that these things do not 
apply to us, for unless we walk in paths of righteousness and in har- 
mony with the revelations from the Lord, we too will be under con- 
demnation. It is in Zion, according to this prophecy, that people are 
to feel the "carnal security," that all is well, and Nephi has spoken to 
us words of warning : 

"Therefore, woe be unto him that is at ease in Zion ! 
"Woe be unto him that crieth, All is well! 

"Yea, woe be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and 
denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost." 

Nephi further predicted that in these days there would be churches 
which are built up, not unto the Lord, and "they shall contend one with 
■another; and their priests shall contend one with another, and they 
shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth 
utterance. 

"And they deny the power of God, and the Holy One of Israel; and they 
say unto the people : Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept ; for behold there 
is no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he 
hath given his power unto men; 

"Behold, hearken ye unfo my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle 
wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God 
of miracles ; he hath done his work." 

Does it not appear that this prophet has truly depicted the con- 
ditions in the world today, both in the churches and generally among 
mankind ? 

MODERN CONDITIONS MAKE FOR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS 

It seems to me as I reflect upon these things that it is perhaps a 
little more difficult for a man to be righteous today than it has been 
in some other periods of the world's history. I think this because of 
modern conditions with all the temptations and evils that now confront 
us at every turn. If this is the case then Latter-day Saints should be 
just a little more prayerful, a little more diligent, and seek the Lord 
just a little more closely, that we might be kept free from all the evils 
that now prevail. The fact that we are baptized and have a standing 
in good fellowship in the Church will not insure for us our salvation. 
Evils may come upon us, for the Lord has said by way of warning. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 143 



"Therefore, let the Church take heed and pray always, lest they fall 
into temptation." 

Our Duties Pointed Out 

During the meetings of this conference some of our duties as 
members of the Church have been pointed ou{. It would be impossible 
in the limited time that is ours to mention all the duties and responsi- 
bilities which rest upon us, and the remarks we make have to be more 
or less of a general character. 

Our attention has been called very forcefully to the keeping of 
the law of tithing, and the observance of the Word of Wisdom. I 
would like to call attention in a general way to the fact that we have 
received many commandments, and it is our duty to keep them all. 
I wonder if we are all faithfully paying our tithing and observing the 
Word of Wisdom? I wonder if we are praying in our homes, if we are 
teaching our children in the spirit of prayer to approach our Father 
in heaven; if, in the family circle, we remember this obligation and 
are faithful to. this great commandment? For it is a great command- 
ment. I wish each would ask himself the question, "Am I seeking 
the Lord in secret chambers, and thanking him for the many blessings 
I receive ?" I wonder if we faithfully observe the Sabbath day to keep 
it holy? There are very few among the people generally in this land 
who do, and the Lord will not forget the breaking of this law. I 
wonder if we have forgotten the fast-day which has been set apart to 
be observed by the members of the Church? And if we remember the 
fast offerings for the poor ? There are so many things I cannot take 
time to mention all. 

We are to be judged according to< our works, and we have before 
us the law. If we fail to observe it, if we reject it. or prove ourselves 
unfaithful, we shall not receive the blessings, for the Lord has said 
it. We have the Gospel as it has been restored in its fulness and if 
we do not observe the commandments of the Lord we are without 
excuse, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required ; and 
he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater con- 
demnation." We should be most diligent in our observance of the 
fast meetings, the Sacrament meetings, and our Priesthood meetings. 
I regret to say that in many of the wards of the Church there is a 
falling off in the attendance at the Sacrament service, which is, in my 
judgment, the greatest and most important meeting in the Church. 
We cannot afford to fail in this important duty and in the other im- 
portant duties which are upon us. Our light is set upon a hill, which 
gives light to all the. world, and we should let it shine so that people 
can see our good works and glorify our Father in Heaven. 

I pray that all Latter-day Saints will prove themselves to be 
humble, faithful and willing to serve the Lord, keeping all his com- 
mandments as they come to us through those who have the right to 
speak. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang: "O awake, my slumbering minstrel."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

Two difficulties confront the ordinary speaker at a general confer- 
ence of the Church. One is to select a theme suitable to the occasion ; 
the other is to present that theme in some degree of completeness with- 
out overrunning the allotted time. 

I recognize, of course — we all do — the wisdom and the necessity for 
time limitations, where so many speakers are to be heard from ; and I 
try to conform to the regulation. But it is not the easiest thing in the 
world to lose one's self in a subject and keep an eye on the clock ; to talk 
about eternity and all the while be thinking about time — the time to close. 
"No man can serve two masters." 

This is my reason for using notes on some occasions. I can speak 
without them, and generally do, but cannot condense my thoughts so 
well when speaking impromptu, as when I have committed them, in part 
at least, to paper. 

THE WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE 

Knowing just what to say, on any occasion, is very important. 
Knowing how to say it, or having the power to say it in a way that ap- 
peals, is equally so. A machine in a big plant broke down, and an expert 
was called in to fix it. He gave two taps with his hammer, and the 
machine started. The bill was $250. The superintendent, as soon as he 
could get his breath, demanded an itemized statement. It came, and read 
as follows : "Tapping with hammer, $1.00 ; knowing where to tap, $249." 

It is just so with the speaker. He must know where to tap and even 
then must leave it to the Lord to do the tapping. Our Heavenly Father 
knows our needs, and he alone can supply them. He knows where to 
tap, and the speaker is the hammer that he taps with. The sledge-hammer 
blows struck during this Conference are samples of his handiwork. 
They ought to be sufficient to set any machine going — in the right 
direction. 

FIRST PRINCIPLES 

Daniel Webster, in his great reply to Senator Hayne upon the neces- 
sity for the preservation of the Union, counseled a return to first prin- 
ciples. Our own Brother Roberts, equally eloquent, gave similar advice 
at one of our recent general conferences. I find myself in much the same 
mood today. I desire to speak upon the first principles of the Gospel. 

One of our Articles of Faith reads as follows: 

"We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are : 
First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; Second, Repentance; Third, Baptism by 
Immersion for the remission of sins; Fourth, Laying on of Hands for the Gift 
of the Holy Ghost." 

I learned these principles in Sabbath school, when I was a boy, and 
they have served me all the days of my life. I took them with me when, 
as a youth of twenty-one, I went out into the world to preach the gospel. 
I found them as effectual in combating error, as did David the stone 



I 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 145 

and sling in his encounter with the Giant. I have never met the man or 
woman who could gainsay them. 

UNPROFITABLE QUESTIONS 

And our missionaries today can say the same, when they preach 
these principles in the power and demonstration of the Holy, Spirit, 
testifying to the Restoration of the Gospel, and letting alone such un- 
profitable questions as, Who wrote the Book of Genesis? Was Job a 
fictitious or an historical character? Does God save man or does man 
save himself? 

This Church was not established, nor are its missionaries sent forth 
to quibble and contend over these or any other questions. With a world's 
salvation trembling in the balance, it matters very little which was first — 
the chicken or the egg, or whether a house burns up or burns down. 

BRIGHAM YOUNG'S COUNSEL 

Fifty years ago, when I was a young missionary in the State of 
Ohio, I received a letter from President Brigham Young, containing 
these golden words : "Never condescend to argue with the wicked. The 
principles of the gospel are too sacred to be quarreled over. Bear your 
testimony in humility, and leave the result with the Lord." 

That is all we can do. This is God's work, not man's, and He is 
doing it in his own way, and using men and women as his instruments. 
No man can say, of any part of the Lord's work, "I did it." No flesh can 
glory in his presence. The missionary does his whole duty when he 
bears a faithful testimony by tongue or pen, by word and deed, and 
leaves the result with the Lord. 

CONTENTION AN EVIL 

Contention is "of the devil," the Lord says, and the time is so pre- 
cious and so short between Now and the End, that we need every minute 
of it to deliver our message, to cry repentance, and warn the world of 
divine judgments that will follow the rejection of the gospel. 

WHAT THE GOSPEL IS AND WHAT IT DOES 

The Gospel of Christ "is the power of God unto salvation." It is 
more than that — it is the power of God unto exaltation. It redeems, 
saves and glorifies all "who yield obedience to its requirements. It is 
the Pathway to Perfection, and was instituted as such by the wisdom of 
the Gods before, this world was formed, before man had fallen, before 
he had need of redemption and salvation. There is only one gospel, 
but there have been many gospel dispensations, and this is the greatest 
and the last. There never will be another upon this planet. It is the last 
time that God will so speak to man. But he will speak in other ways, 
by other tongues, and the world will have to listen : 



, OTHER TESTIMONIES 

"For after your testimony" — the Lord says to the Elders of Israel— 



146 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in 
the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground, and shall not be 
able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and 
the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the 
waves of the sea, heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts 
shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people; 

"And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a 
loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying, Prepare ye, prepare ye, 
O inhabitants of the earth ; for the judgment of our God is come : behold, 
and lo! the Brfdegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." (D. and C. 
88:89-92.) 

ETERNAL PRINCIPLES 

The Gospel's fundamental principles are eternal. They never were 
created. They are self-existent. Divine wisdom, recognizing certain 
laws and ordinances as essential to human uplift and advancement, 
placed them in the gospel plan and made them available and effectual 
unto man's redemption, salvation and eternal glory. 

And how were they made available and effectual to those high 
ends? Here we touch the question of whether God saves man or man 
saves himself. , 

A SINISTER SPIRIT 

A sinister spirit is creeping over this world — a spirit of arrogant 
self-assertion, a disposition to do away with God, to shut him. out from 
his own universe, to strip the Divine One of his divinity, deny his 
miraculous power, and regard him as nothing more than a superman, 
a good and wise Teacher who points out the Way in which men should 
walk — and that is about all. Even in the pulpit such things are said at 
times. In current literature divinity is below par. Any writer who 
makes a sensational assault upon religion, robbing Christ of his Christli- 
ness, finds a willing publisher and a ready sale. One who stands up 
stalwartly for God and Truth — his manuscript goes begging. 

NO MARKET VALUE 

Pure religion has no market value. It's the humbug that prospers. 
Ah religion is looked upon by many as old-fashioned fogyism, some- 
thing out of date, and it is deemed progressive and even heroic to get 
along without it. Dr. William B. Riley, in a recent address in this city, 
said : "The idea has been put forth in some of our secular institutions, 
that a person should make his own moral decisions, without regard to 
divine law." Heaven forbid that such a spirit, or anything like it, should 
ever invade the Church of Christ — the Church of the Latter-day Saints ! 
Says Riley again: "Make man believe that he is responsible only to 
himself, remove all belief of higher power, and it is certain that a state 
of anarchy will prevail." 

Let me now read to you a very splendid poem: 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 147 

INVICTUS 
By William Ernest Henley 

Out of the night that covers me, 

Black as the pit from Pole to Pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be, 

For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 

I have not winced nor cried aloud, 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 

My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 

Looms but the horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years 

Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how straight the gate, 
How charged with punishments the scroll, 

I am the master of my fate, 
I am the captain of my soul. 

We all admire courage, fortitude, and the power to patiently endure. 
We recognize such traits as essential to success, both in spiritual and 
in temporal pursuits. But these heroic qualities, admirable though they 
be, and desirable -withal, cannot lessen one jot or tittle the need for 
a Savior, to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. In this won- 
derfully virile and powerful poem, there is no recognition of any need 
for divine help. That, to me, is a defect. Of course, a man must know 
God before he can recognize him, and this poor man evidently did not 
know him. 

A BROKEN REED 

A reasonable amount of self-reliance is a good thing, is a pillar of 
strength in any human character. But when a man relies wholly upon 
himself and seeks no help from the divine Helper, he is leaning upon a 
broken reed, however mighty he may think himself. 

David was self-reliant when he met Goliath of Gath; but it was 
because he knew God was with him. "He will give you into my hands," 
said the shepherd boy. And it was his simple faith, his sublime trust, 
his absolute confidence in the Almighty, that overthrew the Giant — not 
merely a sling with a stone in it. 

"I am the captain of my soul," is true only to a very limited extent. 
Man is a free agent, with a will of his own, with the power to achieve, to 
succeed or fail. That much is true. But there is a Greater Captain of 
our souls, to whom we all owe allegiance, for He redeemed our souls 
from death, and they are his ; he purchased them with a price. Self- 
reliance is a good thing, if not carried too far. But self-assurance, self- 
sufficiency, self-conceit, is a bad thing. There is no such thing as abso- 
lute independence. We depend upon one another, and all are dependent 
upon God. 

FALL AND REDEMPTION 

Answering now the question : How are the principles of the gospel 



148 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



made available and effectual for man's salvation and exaltation? It is 
through the Fall and the Redemption. "Adam fell that men might be" — 
that a race of spirits might tabernacle in ithe flesh, and thus become 
souls, capable of endless increase, of eternal progression and exaltation. 
But the if all brought death — eternal death, which had to be overcome 
before these spirits, these souls, God's sons and daughters, could fulfil 
their heaven-decreed destiny and go on to perfection. 

Christ overcame death — conquered hell and the grave — died and 
rose again ; and because he lives we shall live also. He gained this 
great victory, not by slaughtering his enemies, but by forgiving them, 
by allowing his own blood to be shed for them and for all, thus paying 
a debt that no one else could pay. "Greater love than this hath no' man, 
that he will lay down his life for his friends." But here was One who 
laid down his life for his enemies as well as his friends. No mere man 
could do that. It required the love and the life of a God. 

THE DIVINE AGONY 

It took a Being capable of enduring pangs that no mere mortal 
could endure — pangs of the body and of the spirit, so terrible, so poig- 
nant, so far-reaching and fathomless that the finite mind stands aghast 
in contemplation of the infinite and awful mystery; pangs that caused 
him, "even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to 
bleed at every pore." 

And he "suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer, 
if they would repent." But if they would not repent, then they must 
suffer even as did he. (D. and C. 19:16-18.) 

"For behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of 
every living creature, both women and children, who belong to the 
family of Adam. 

"And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all 
men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day. 

"And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be bap- 
tized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, 
or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God. 

"And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be bap- 
tized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned : for the 
Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it." (2 Nephi 9:21-24. 
See also D. and C. 18:11, 12.) 

Can anyone read that, and believe that all Christ did was to point 
out the Way of Salvation and bid men walk therein ? What about the 
construction of the way ? There was no way till he made one. Walking 
in it, however difficult at times, is a mere bagatelle by comparison. 

MACHINERY AND THE POWER ' 

Adam's fall placed man on earth and made available for him the 
plan of salvation and exaltation. Without the fall, the spirit would have 
no body, and consequently no claim upon the resurrection. And it 
was Christ who brought about the resurrection. He is its Author. It 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



149 



was his death, his sacrificial offering, that gave vitality to the gospel 
plan and rendered effectual man's faith and works in his own behalf. 
Without the Atonement, to offset and nullify the fatal effects of the 
original transgression, all man's self-help would count for nothing, and 
the very iGospel itself would be mere machinery without the power. 

IN AND OUT OF THE PIT 

When Adam fell, it was as if the human race had fallen into a pit, 
from which they were powerless, by any act of their own, to emerge ; 
having no means whereby to climb up and out, and not even knowing 
how to climb. But a Friend, all-wise and all-powerful, comes to the 
mouth of the pit, compassionates its wretched inmates, and proposes 
to rescue them from their unhappy situation. He makes of his own life 
a ladder; lets it down into the pit and says: "Now climb!" They who 
climb, get out of the pit. They who refuse to climb, remain in the pit — 
and who is to blame but themselves? 

The Crucifixion on Calvary, the self-immolation of a God, is the 
Rock upon which the gospel rests — the Everlasting Gospel, the ladder 
unto life eternal. 

"Faith without works is dead." We work out our salvation. There 
is no question about that. But we work it out through Jesus Christ, and 
not independently of Him. We do not save ourselves. We but avail 
ourselves of the means of salvation provided by our Lord and Savior, 
the God who died that man might live.

ELDER DATUS E. HAMMOND 

President of the Pioneer Stake 

My brethren and sisters: I have enjoyed the privileges and the 
blessings of this conference, and I feel perhaps more than at any other 
time in my life that I have appreciated my membership in the Church, 
the blessings that come through it, and the wonderful associations that 
come with this privilege. My testimony has been increased, my desire 
to labor and do good have increased, and I have prayed that my 
heavenly Father would give me strength to be able to build up myself 
and to carry into my life some of the resolutions that I have made as 
a result of the inspiration of this conference.' I am very much con- 
cerned and interested in the welfare of the young people of this Church. 
I feel that our greatest strength should be given more particularly to 
them. I feel that our greatest concern is with them. Those who 
have grown old in years and in service, and have a testimony of the 
divinity of thfs work, can't be changed very much ; and, while we must 
labor with them, we are not nearly so much concerned as with the 



152 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

youth of Israel. Our young people in our auxiliary organizations, the 
youth of the Church in our Lesser priesthood work, gives our greatest 
anxiety. I have been grateful indeed that there has come such activity 
and such a program and such organization in the Lesser priesthood work 
to more carefully direct and teach and inspire the young men of the 
Church. As one associated in this work with the young people, and 
connected with the Mutual Improvement organizations, I have been 
greatly interested in the work for young boys. I have been happy in- 
deed that all of my time for a number of years past has been spent with 
them, with the Boy Scouts of America. 

May the Lord bless our young people. May all of us, who are 
responsible for their welfare, in all our organizations and priesthood 
quorums, give them all we have to direct their work, their thought and 
their actions. May our greatest desire and ambition be to instil in 
their hearts a testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged, and if they enjoy this testimony, we may feel assured as to 
their welfare and the outcome of their lives. May we thus be con- 
cerned, and have as an objective in every contact, in every activity 
and program the putting into the hearts of our young people an ap- 
preciation and a testimony of the divinity of this work, I sincerely 
pray, through Jesus Christ, Amen. , 

ELDER MILTON H. WELLING 

President of the Bear River Stake 

I have attended every one of the sessions of this conference. The 
conference began with the admonition of the Presidency of the Church, 
and those who followed in the early meetings, with warnings to the 
people of the Church against a spirit of lawlessness that seems to be 
abroad in the land today. I do not feel that it is my responsibility or 
my business to stand as a watchman upon the tower, so far as giving 
general direction to the thought and activity of the Church is con- 
cerned. When those warnings were given on Friday morning and 
Friday afternoon I thought of myself as being among the great multi- 
tude of people in this Church, and in the world, who were being warned, 
and as I thought of that I reflected upon the things that had occurred 
in my life which were useful to me, a help to me in receiving the warn- 
ings of my brethren who had addressed the conference. I thought of 
the time when, as a boy, I was taught to repeat the Sermon on the 
Mount, in connection with one of my brothers who is down here now 
somewhere among the bishops of this Church. We were taken into 
the meeting house and stood up on a bench. He would recite one verse 
and I would recite the next until we had finished it. We received 
from our father twenty-five cents between us, as I remember it, for 
learning Christ's Sermon on the Mount. I don't believe that any 
other money that I ever earned in the world was more useful to me 
than that. 

There is one verse in the Sermon on the Mount which was always 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING 



153 



useful to me. It is found near the end of the 6th chapter of St. Mat- 
thew. In that verse the Savior of the world spoke of the fact that we 
were to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all 
else would be added unto us. I want to testify, in the moments that 
I occupy this afternoon, that every good thing that has come into my 
life has come through following the admonition and the advice of the 
servants of God, and through seeking to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I have been inspired by the teachings of this conference, and my one 
hope is that I can go back home to my own people, hundreds of whom 
are not here this afternoon, but who are listening in to these services, 
and bear testimony to the inspiration of the Spirit of God which has 
directed his servants in this conference, and which is directing the 
Church of Christ. I know that the gospel of the Redeemer of the 
world is true,' and I pray God the eternal Father that that testimony, 
and a- disposition to bear it to the world, will remain with me forever, 
in the* name of Jesus .Christ, Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE H. ROMNEY 

President of the Fremont Stake 

I am deeply grateful, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord has 
so blessed me in this life that I am counted worthy to stand in this pul- 
pit and speak to the Latter-day Saints in general conference, but I am 
more grateful that he has blessed me with a testimony of the truthful- 
ness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which has been restored to us in 
these days, through Joseph Smith the Prophet and those who have 
followed him. I feel particularly grateful that my fathers heard the 
sound of the gospel and were thrilled by it, inspired by it, to come 
to Zion. I am glad for the privilege of being recognized as worthy 
of representing our people in Idaho. I shall be very glad to carry 
back to them, if the Lord will give me his Spirit, the messages of this 
conference. I have been thrilled by the inspiration that has come to 
us. I remarked, at the close of the first session of this conference, and 
the instructions of the brethren in regard to keeping sacred the laws 
of the land and of being true and faithful and full of integrity, that 
the statements made impressed me very much, and I believe that the 
instruction is needed to be given to the people in Idaho, the Latter-day 
Saints who live there as much as it is to the people throughout all the 
world. I believe that our brethren are inspired. One of the problems 
of my. life has been to understand how it is that the Lord can prompt 
the thinking of men and inspire them so that they can say his mind 
and will, so that they can give his words instead of giving the product 
of their own thinking. It became a question at one time in my life 
how to exercise faith, what attitude to take. What is the proper 
attitude that a person must be in, in order that he can be inspired, and 
that he can hear the voice of the Lord and speak his words to the 
people? 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I realized, as a boy, that it was necessary for one to receive some- 
thing by direct contact ; that is, for his mind to be guided in such a 
way that he was not speaking of himself. I afterwards learned through 
some of the experiences which I had that if a person will have perfect 
faith and trust and confidence in the Lord, that if he will believe with 
his whole heart that the Lord will guide and direct him in what he 
says, he is bound to go forth and do the best he can, and the Lord 
will see that he makes no mistake in judgment when he is acting in 
the performance of the duties of his calling. This is my faith and 
my confidence in the Lord, that he will guide and direct. I do not 
believe that the judgment of man or the wisdom of man is sufficient 
to perform the duties of the priesthood in this Church. I believe that 
it is not possible for men to know what is most needful for the people ; 
but I believe, my brethren and sisters, that if in humble prayer and 
thankfulness they approach the Lord, that he will guide them. I have 
perfect confidence that that has been the case in this conference. May 
the Lord bless us and help us to accept it in that spirit, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

CLOSING THOUGHTS 

I rejoice in the very splendid testimonies that we have heard 
during this conference, and in the advancement of the work of the 
Lord. I rejoice, as I look into the faces of this body of men who are 
here before me, the presidencies of stakes, the bishops of wards, the 
men who have dedicated their lives to God, all that they have, for the 
advancement of his kingdom ; men who are seeking first the Kingdom 
of God. I rejoice as I look at these sisters, on my left, who are as 
devoted as mortals can be, for the advancement of this work. When 
I think of our auxiliary organizations and the integrity and devotion 
of the men and women who preside over them, my heart goes out in 
gratitude and thanksgiving to God for such men and such women. 

BLESSINGS UPON THE PEOPLE 

I pray God's choicest blessings to attend each and all of you, 
that every blessing which your hearts can desire may be yours. I pray 
for all Zion, for God's people in every part of the world, at home and 
abroad, for every soul that is laboring for the salvation of the souls of 
men and women. I beseech God to' give to each and all of us who 
have partaken of the inspiration of this conference his Spirit, that we 
may be- representatives of him, to labor particularly among the youth 
of Zion, that they may not get into that broad way that leads to de- 
struction, but may the Lord help you and me and every soul having a 
testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged to so 
order our lives that we can bring the wayward back into that straight 
and narrow path that will lead them back into the presence of God 
and our Redeemer. I thank the Lord for the inspiration of his Spirit 
during this conference, and I leave my blessing upon all who are here

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



States; Chas. A. Callis, Southern States, and Benjamin Goddard, Bureau 
of Information, Temple Block, Salt Lake City. 

All available seats, and all spaces where people could stand, were 
occupied. Others were gathered in the Assembly Hall and Barratt 
Hall where overflow meetings were held. The services in the Taber- 
nacle were broadcast and sent by radio to the large crowds gathered 
'on the lawns on the Tabernacle grounds. 

President Grant announced that the choir and congregation would 
begin the services by singing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 
Following the singing, in which all took spirited part, the opening 
prayer was offered by Elder Hyrum G. Smith, presiding Patriarch 
of the Church. 

The choir and congregation sang:' "The morning breaks the 
shadows flee." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I think the hymn to which we have just listened is entitled to 
the place it occupies in our hymn book, namely, the first hymn — the 
place of honor. It was written by the late Apostle Parley P. Pratt : 

A FIRST PLACE POEM 

"The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 
Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled! 
The dawning of a brighter day, 
Majestic rises on the world. 

"The clouds of error disappear 
Before the rays of truth divine; 
The glory bursting from afar, 
Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 

"The Gentile fulness now comes in, 
And Israel's blessings are at hand; 
Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed of sin, 
Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

"Jehovah speaks; let earth give ear, 
And Gentile nations turn and live, 
His mighty arm is making bare, 
His cov'nant people to receive. 

"Angels from heaven and truth from earth, 
Have met, and both have record borne; 
Thus Zion's light is bursting forth, 
To cheer her children's glad return." 

I earnestly desire the faith and prayers of. this vast audience 
to assist me in that which I may say to you today. I sense the 
great responsibility of addressing so large an audience — for this 
building is filled to overflowing — and I desire that my remarks shall 
encourage and bless the Saints here assembled. 

A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT PENROSE 

Since we last convened in general conference one of the great 
and faithful laborers in the Church has departed this life — the late 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

President Charles W. Penrose. Perhaps no man in all Israel has 
written more in defense of the people than Charles W. Penrose, and 
I believe that the literature from his pen has been more widely dis- 
tributed than the writings of any other of our leading men. He 
spent nearly twenty years of his life as a missionary in his native 
land. As I announced at his funeral, during the last nine months 
that I presided over the European mission we distributed about 
eight million pages of the writings of Charles W. Penrose. I have 
been thrilled by his discourses from this stand, from my childhood 
days until the time of his last public address. He was inspired in 
his utterances, and he had the capacity and the ability to make 
plain the principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as per- 
fectly as any of our speakers that I have ever heard. We also re- 
joice from time to time in listening to the inspired hymns that he 
has written. We moUrn his loss, but we rejoice in the wonderful 
record of labor and service that he made in the spread of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ at home and abroad. 

WILLIAM JENNINGS, bryan's visit to salt lake city 

At one of our general conferences some years ago we were 
honored with the presence of Senator Owen from Oklahoma and 
Honorable William Jennings Bryan. These gentlemen remained 
until after the conference session, when an informal organ recital 
was given in their honor. Perhaps a hundred or a hundred and 
fifty people were present and following the recital, requests came 
from different parts of the small audience that Senator Owen and 
Mr. Bryan make some remarks. They did so, and from the press 
reports of the occasion we read the following: 

HIS ESTIMATE OF "MORMONISM" 

"Mr Bryan said the truths he had heard expounded there that day he 
should endeavor to carry with him throughout life, and he believed that 
through him many people might hear the truth concerning 'Mormonism,' 
for he would endeavor to give an exposition of what he had heard in plain 
truth to the people with whom he associated. Mr. Bryan said he had been 
undecided about coming to Salt Lake. He had been asked to speak in Los 
Angeles Monday, but he had obeyed a whim almost and had come to Salt 
Lake. He did not know why, but now he said he believed it was providen- 
tial. At any rate he said he had heard truths uttered that impressed him 
deeply, and he knows that he is better equipped to perform his work in the 
world for having heard 'Mormonism' expounded. Particularly was he im- 
pressed, Mr. Bryan said, with the 'Mormon' belief in the personality of 
God. It is a beautiful belief, he said, and one by which the world might 
profit. He referred to the application of the gospel in the lives of the 
'Mormon' people, and said such principles applied to the problems of the 
world would in very deed solve the difficulties with which the world is beset. 

He referred to the single standard of morality, as expounded by one of 
the speakers, and said that in very truth that is a principle that might well 
be applied to the lives of all men." 

HIS LAST SPEECH SHOWS HIS PERFECT FAITH IN GOD 

The publishing house of Revell & Co. have published a book 
containing the last address of William Jennings Bryan, which ad-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



dress was prepared for the celebrated evolution case in Tennessee, 
but was never delivered. I have had the privilege of reading and re- 
reading the book. It shows that he had perfect faith in God our 
heavenly Father and in my judgment it is a very strong defense of 
the divinity of Christ and of the Godhood of our Father in heaven. 

I had the pleasure of visiting with Mr. Bryan, after his remarks 
following our conference, and he said that he was expected to de- 
liver three speeches in California before leaving, but that he be- 
lieved the world at large would get more benefit from what he had 
learned in our conference than the people would have received had 
he remained in California and delivered those three speeches. He 
promised to send me a little pamphlet containing his ideas about 
God. After reading it I remember saying to my family that Wil- 
liam Jennings Bryan ought to be a Latter-day Saint, because many 
of his views were in perfect harmony with our faith. Every Latter- 
day Saint upon the face of the earth believes in the individuality and 
personality of God our Father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ. A 
man who does not so believe has no right to be called a Latter-day 
Saint. Every Latter-day Saint believes absolutely that God con- 
versed with Joseph Smith, and introduced to him the Lord Jesus 
Christ as his well-beloved Son. 

PRESIDENT GRANT PRESENT AT HISTORICAL EVENTS 

During the past six months I have had the privilege of visiting 
in California and meeting with the Saints there. I had the pleasure 
of being present at the official opening of Zion's National Park in 
southern Utah, and of attending the general conference in June of 
the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement associa- 
tion, and also the Primary association. That great celebration of 
the fiftieth anniversary of the organization of the Young Men's 
Mutual Improvement association was one of the grandest that 
we have ever had. It was a marvelous outpouring of the youth of 
Israel upon the streets of this, the central city of Zion. The parade 
was an honor to the Mutual Improvement association and a credit 
to the Church. I believe that special credit for that parade was due 
to the insistence of Junius F. Wells, the man called originally by 
Brigham Young to organize the Young Men's Mutual Improvement 
association. For the very splendid and orderly way in which it 
was conducted, credit is due to Governor Mabey and to each and 
every one of those on the committees. Credit is also due to the 
various people who took part in speaking, singing, or giving ora- 
tions or the various contests, musical and otherwise, at the con- 
ference. My heart was filled with gratitude and thanksgiving to 
know that we have today one hundred thousand young men and 
young women in these Improvement associations interested in 
laboring with zeal and energy for the advancement of the work of 
God. 

I had the pleasure of being present at a celebration in connec-

tion with the great dam that is to be erected at American Falls, 
where millions of money will be expended and a vast empire re- 
deemed through utilizing the waters of the Snake River. It was 
also a pleasure later to attend the Burley stake conference. Satur- 
day evening I held a meeting at Oakley at which thirty odd per 
cent of the people of Cassia stake were in attendance. I first visited 
that section of the country forty-four years ago this fall, when it 
was only a branch of the Grantsville ward of the Tooele stake of 
Zion, numbering perhaps a hundred and fifty to two hundred and 
fifty Latter-day Saints. There are now in that section of the coun- 
try a number of stakes of Zion, among them the Twin Falls stake. 
The city of Twin Falls has over eight thousand inhabitants. None 
of our people were located there at that time, but I rejoice in the 
wonderful growth of our people and others in redeeming that sec- 
tion of the country. 

I was requested to go to Pocatello and dedicate an amusement 
hall — a fine large building. I thought back to the time when I first 
went there and met with just a handful of Latter-day Saints in a 
little rented hall, and when I contemplated the fact that there are 
now six organized wards of the Church at Pocatello, and thought 
of the wonderful growth of Latter-day Saints in that section, I re- 
joiced in the material and spiritual advancement of the people there. 

VISITS MANY SCENIC WONDERS 

I was requested to send a speaker to hold a meeting at the 
West entrance of the Yellowstone National Park the Sunday even- 
ing that I was at Pocatello. I made several efforts to secure a 
speaker to go there, but all those to whom I applied were engaged. 
So I decided to drive from Pocatello myself Sunday afternoon, and 
attend the meeting at West Yellowstone. The next day and the day 
following I had the privilege of going through the Yellowstone 
Park, and then driving down to Driggs, where I held a meeting 
Tuesday night. Yellowstone Park can be reached from here in a 
night's ride on the train and the scenery there is among the grand- 
est in all the world. 

Upon my return home Thursday I found an invitation from 
my son-in-law to climb Timpanogos the following Saturday, which 
I did. From the top of that mountain, the view of Wasatch, Utah, 
and Salt Lake counties, the cities therein, and other sections of the 
country in the distance, is one of the grandest that my eyes have 
ever beheld. 

The following Sunday night I left for the scenic wonders of 
southern Utah, reaching Cedar Monday morning with President 
Ivins and wife, Sister Grant and my niece. We visited Cedar 
Breaks and Zion canyon, and the next day going to the Grand 
Canyon, or at least to the V. T. ranch in the Kaibab forest. We 
saw between two hundred and three hundred deer that afternoon 
as we were traveling to this ranch. The next day we visited Point 
Sublime and saw the Colorado river and that wonderful gorge in 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



which you could drop about one hundred Grand Canyons of the 
Yellowstone. It is twelve miles wide and one mile deep as com- 
pared with the gorge thirteen hundred feet deep and two' thousand 
feet wide at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. It is a sight 
that beggars all description. It is a marvel ; it is a wonder ! We 
drove that afternoon to Kanab and in the evening held a meeting 
with the Saints. I rejoice in the fine meeting house that they have 
erected there. 

The next day we visited Bryce Canyon, and I was more 
charmed wjth it than the first time I visited this, one of the scenic 
wonders of the world. The next morning, Friday, September 11, 
I parted with Brother Ivins ; he returned to Salt Lake by way of 
Fish Lake, and I returned to Cedar City via Cedar Breaks and was 
present in the afternoon at the opening of the bridge over Ash 
Creek, which connects with the Black Ridge. I had the privilege of 
traveling over the road fifty-nine years ago, when the wagon in 
which I was riding jumped from one black rock to another, seldom 
finding any ground to light upon. On that old route which was 
selected by the pioneers who first went into St. George there is 
now, over the Black Ridge, one of the finest dirt roads that I have 
ever had the privilege of motoring over. It is a real delight to 
travel upon it. The bridge over Ash Creek is certainly a very 
creditable structure indeed. 

In my travels (in Europe) from Scandinavia on the north to 
Italy, on the south, and from Canada on the north to Mexico on the 
south, in Hawaii and in Japan, I have witnessed many wonderful 
scenes ; but if they were rolled in together they do not compare 
with the Yellowstone and these wonderful sights in southern 
Utah — Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks, Zion Canyon and the scenic 
points from the north rim of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. 

THE GREAT MISSION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Saturday and Sunday following the opening of the bridge over 
Ash Creek I attended the Parowan stake conference and enjoyed 
visiting there with the Saints and taking part in one of the con- 
ferences. 

I rejoice in the wonderful growth in all the stakes of Zion from 
Canada on the north to Mexico on the south, and in the increase of 
interest and faith on the part of the Sa'ints throughout the world. 
I rejoice that there is a cry for more missionaries, from all parts 
of the world. The one great mission of the Latter-day Saints at 
home and abroad is to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
to preach the individuality and personality of God and of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, to preach the restoration again to the earth of the 
plan of life and salvation. There is nothing that qualifies a man so 
much for preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as to study 
the revelations that the Lord has seen fit -to give us in our day. In 
them he says: 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not 
hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. * * * 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. * * * 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; 
and though the heavens and earth pass away, my word will not pass away, 
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my 
servants, it is the same. * * * 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve 
him with all your heart, might, mind and strength; that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day. * * * 

"And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit 
which leadeth to do good — yea to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge 
righteously; and this is my Spirit. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, 
which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy. * * * 

"Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God 
shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he 
that hath eternal life is rich. * * * 

""Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be 
done unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much 
good in this generation. * * * 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in 
their sickle to reap. * * * 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light 
of the world. * * * 

"Say nothing but repentance unto this generation. Keep my command- 
ments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my command- 
ments, and you shall be blessed." 

A CENTRAL THOUGHT APPLYING TO US 

This last revelation from which I have read was given to Hy- 
rum Smith, the brother of the Prophet Joseph. He was martyred 
with Joseph Smith, as you all know, in Carthage jail. 

I wish to emphasize one passage in this revelation : 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have 
thrust in their sickle to reap." 

So that it applies to you, to me and to all the Latter-day 
Saints. The central thought in this revelation is that we are to keep 
the commandments of God. It is reiterated in this one revelation 
some three or four or five times, that the duty was upon Hyrum 
Smith to keep the commandments of God and to preach the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

The previous revelation from which I quoted was given to the 
father of the prophet. I will repeat the words of that part of it, as 
I did before, and I wish to emphasize it with all my heart: 

"Behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the 
children of men." (As I look at this marvelous audience and think 
of the people on the outside, who are hearing what I say, as well 
as the audiences in Barratt Hall and the Assembly Hall, surely I 
can say that this revelation, given to the father of the prophet and 
the patriarch, has been literally fulfilled.) 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye

serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye 
may stand blameless before God at the last day." 

r 

WORTH OF SOULS GREAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD 

I am well aware of the fact that it is tiresome to any audience 
to listen to a speaker when most of his time is occupied in reading; 
but when I contemplate the fact that my words uttered here today 
will be published in The Deseret News, which goes into the homes 
of the Latter-day Saints from Canada on the north to Mexico on 
the south ; when I realize that what I am saying here is to be pub- 
lished in a conference pamphlet, copies of which will be sent to 
the missionaries all over the world, then I am far more anxious to 
have the words of the Lord and the Savior of the world published 
in this address than to make remarks myself. I desire therefore to 
read what the Savior said : 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; 

"For, behold, the Lord, your Redeemer, suffered death in the flesh; 
wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and 
come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men 
unto him, on conditions of repentance. 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repent- 
ance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great 
shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! 

"And now, if your joy shall be great with one soul that you have 
brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your 
joy if you should bring many souls unto me! 

"Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation. 

"Ask the Father in my name, in faith believing, that you shall receive, 
and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are 
expedient unto the children of men. 

"And if you have not faith, hope, and charity, you can do nothing." 

This quotation is from the 18th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. 

TESTIMONIES OF RETURNED MISSIONARIES 

It fell to my lot two weeks ago today to sit upon the stand in 
the Assembly Hall and listen to the testimonies of five young men 
who had just returned from missions, and then listen to the testi- 
mony of James H. Moyle, the father of one of those young men. 
My heart was thrilled with the testimony they bore, and their 
undoubting knowledge that God lives, that Jesus Christ, the Re- 
deemer of the world, the Savior of mankind, that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of the true and living God, and that the gospel, commonly 
called "Mormonism" by the world, is in very deed the plan of life 
and salvation again restored to the earth. 

A TESTIMONY OF THE DIVINITY OF THIS WORK 

I rejoice in the absolute knowledge which I possess, of the truth 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



as contained in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is 
known among us as "The Vision." I have been thrilled with the 
testimony there borne by the Prophet Joseph Smith, as I have 
repeated it itme and time again ; and if it were repeated every day of 
my life, as I supplicate God from day to day, it would do me no 
harm : 

"This is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens 
bore record unto us — ■ 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to. be crucified for the world 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness; 

"That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into 
his power and made by him; 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except 
those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed 
him." (Thank God they are few and far between.) 

"And now, after many testimonies which have been given to him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the 
voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father. 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto 
God." | \ ; 

When preaching to those not of our faith, in different parts of 
the world, I read, whenever I have the opportunity, the articles 
promulgated by Joseph Smith known as the 13 Articles of Faith of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I rejoice in read- 
ing them and in testifying to those who know not the truth that in 
very deed those articles have been vindicated ; that we believe in 
God the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and I testify 
to the world that we know that they live, because they appeared 
to Joseph ; that we believe men must be called of God, and we know 
that they have been called of God in our day, because the apostles 
of the Lord Jesus Christ ordained Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
dery. We believe that men should receive the Holy Ghost, and we 
testify to all the world that they have received it in this Church. 
I rejoice that all the gifts and graces, that were enjoyed in ancient 
days — the speaking in tongues, the interpretation of tongues, the 
healing of the sick, and kindred gifts as enumerated in the Articles 
of Faith, are enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints all over the world, 
wherever this gospel has gone. I rejoice in the wonderful faith and 
knowledge of the Latter-day Saints regarding the divinity of this 
work. I am thankful beyond expression that wherever this gospel 
has gone, in answer to humble, faithful prayers, God has given to 
individuals all over the world a knowledge of themselves concern- 
ing the divinity of this work. What kind of men and women should 
we be, as Latter-day Saints, in view of this wonderful knowledge 
that we possess, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God? We should be the most honest, the 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



most virtuous, the most charitable-minded, the best people upon 
the face of the earth. 

That God may help us to live up to the knowledge we possess, 
that we may grow in the light and knowledge and testimony of the 
gospel, and that our lives shall be a bright and shining testimony 
of the divinity of this work in which we are engaged is my prayer, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

MISSIONARY CALLS 

President Heber J. Grant made the following additional re- 
marks at the close of his opening speech, concerning missionaries, 
and missionary calls decided upon : 

OPENING OF SOUTH AMERICAN MISSION 

One announcement I intended to make, which undoubtedly all 
of you have seen in the paper, is that Elders Melvin J Ballard, 
Rulon S. Wells and Rey L. Pratt, have been called to go to South 
America and open a mission there. 

APPEAL FOR ONE MAN FROM EACH WARD FOR MISSION IN THE 
UNITED STATES 

In addition to opening a mission in South America, as the 
President of the Church and the Apostles, we desire to make an 
appeal to the Latter-day Saints throughout the Church, from Can- 
ada on the north to Mexico on the south, that a special effort be 
made to secure in every ward, from among men of mature years 
and sound judgment, who have had experience in the preaching of 
the gospel, one missionary, and where possible more than one, who 
is financially able to go forth and labor in the mission fields of the 
United States, Canada or Mexico for at least six months, at his 
own expense, both going and returning. 

MEN OF MEANS AND EXPERIENCE WANTED 

Since there are a thousand wards in the Church, this would 
mean a thousand or more men of experience to perform this labor. 
We feel that men who have been prospered and blessed should be 
ready and willing to respond to such a call. We know more than a 
thousand, more than two thousand, have been so blessed. Many of 
them may have come to this land without a dollar. Some may have 
borrowed the money to come here. The parents of some of them 
were perhaps assisted by what was known as the Perpetual Emigra- 
tion Fund. Many of these men are now worth twenty-five thou- 
sand, fifty thousand, one hundred thousand, and some more than 
one hundred thousand dollars. We ask, in view of the wonderful 
material blessings which God has bestowed upon them, that they be 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

and proclaim this gospel, and if they can stay longer, all well and 
good. 

Many of them have gone on trips, time and again, for three and 
four months, for pleasure only, and spent large sums of their money. 
Now we want during the coming year to have the greatest of all 
the great missions that the Church has ever had, given to the peo- 
ple of the world by one or two thousand men who have been thus 
wonderfully blessed financially — men of experience, ability and 
testimony. We believe, in view of the wonderful harvests that will 
be of such great benefit to the people in all sections of the country 
where the Saints are located, that we are not asking too much when 
we, as the Pre'sidency and Apostles of the Church, make this great 
appeal for missionary service. 

The choir and Hyrum Christensen, and Alvina Ridges, grand 
daughter of Joseph Ridges, builder of the Tabernacle organ, sang 
the hymn, 'An angel from on high," after the hymn had been announced 
and read in full by President Heber J. Grant. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

Sensing very deeply this great responsibility, I approach it in 
humility and with a desire in my heart that I may be assisted by 
your faith and by the Spirit of the Lord. 

ENDORSEMENT OF THE MISSIONARY CALL 

I wish to endorse most heartily the remarks of our president. 
He has given an outline of the .great work in which we are engaged 
— the "marvelous work and a wonder" which the Lord said, 
through the prophets in olden times, that he would bring to pass in 
the latter days. 

I believe it will be an easy matter for the Latter-day Saints to 
comply with the president's request to send out an additional 1,000 
missionaries to the United States and Canada and probably some 
to Mexico, to labor for six months, or longer, if the missionaries 
feel that they would like to remain longer, and many of them will, 
no doubt. I believe it will be the greatest missionary effort that 
has been put forth in the history of the Church, and no man can 
foresee the great good that will be accomplished thereby. Some of 
the wards, many of them indeed, can easily spare two or three ma- 
ture, competent, capable men who have had experience, and who 
will not only be willing, but glad to go. We may therefore have 
considerably more than one from each ward, in which event there 
will be more than 1,000 missionaries. 

MATERIAL PROSPERITY AND BLESSINGS 

I rejoice very much in the growth and development of this 
great work. I am thankful to the Lord for the privilege of assist- 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE' 



ready and willing to respond to the call of the Bishops of their 
wards and the Presidents of their stakes to go out for six months 
ing in it. I have been thankful for that high privilege all the days 
of my life, and I have tried in my weak way to assist wherever I 
have been called. 

President Grant has referred to the wonderful productivity of 
the soil during the past season. We have never experienced any- 
thing like it in our history. The earth is fairly teeming with riches, 
in its products of every kind, and they are bringing fair prices. 
May I turn from the very splendid spiritual talk that the president 
has delivered, to the material things for a few moments. "Mor- 
monism" comprises both the temporal and spiritual ; they go hand 
in hand, but the spiritual is first. If for a few moments, therefore, 
I talk about temporal things, I hope you will pardon me and that 
that advice and counsel may not be lost. 

CAUTION TO THE PEOPLE TO WISELY CARE FOR THEIR WEALTH 

What are we going to do with these great blessings of the earth 
that the Lord has given and is giving us this season? I was told 
only a week or two ago that down at Delta, and over in the Vernal 
country also, where they were threshing alfalfa seed, in fact, wher- 
ever it was known that a farmer had a little surplus money, certain 
individuals were swarming like vultures, seeking to present every 
sort of scheme imaginable to try to separate that farmer from his 
money. They were going to make him rich "quick." All he had to 
do was to invest his little surplus in some scheme which this glib 
talker could portray in glowing terms, and it would make him rich. 
The talker did not know how to make himself rich — of course not 
— but he was going to make the farmer rich. 

TAKE COUNSEL BEFORE YOU INVEST IN PRESENTED SCHEMES 

I have had some experience with this class of people, and with 
such schemes. I have been fooled myself more than once, though 
once ought to be enough for any man. I have tried mines, and I 
have tried oil — not the flow that Andy Gump pictures, but oil 
spouting from the ground, assuring riches quickly; and I have been 
fooled in every one of them. It is my advice, my counsel to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that you "pass up" the people that come 
with these get-rich-quick schemes. Otherwise you will be de- 
ceived ; and you will be disappointed ; you will lose your money. 
If you have surplus means to invest^and I hope you will have, 
consult the president of the stake, consult the bishop of the ward, 
consult your banker. Usually the banker in a community is a safe 
man to consult in respect to investments. There are plenty of safe 
and sane investments that may be made on which you can be abso- 
lutely sure and certain to receive a fair return. So my advice, my 
counsel is to turn away from men who are trying to make you rich 
over night. It cant' be done. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY

THE SOUND COUNSEL OF BRIGHAM YOUNG APPLIES TODAY 

President Young used to counsel the Saints in his day to invest 
in something that they knew about, such as land, cattle, sheep and 
the like. "Make your investments," he said, "in something you 
know about, and keep out of mining." The time, he said, had not 
come to develop mining. Mining, of course, is a legitimate busi- 
ness, we cannot do without the minerals and the precious metals. 
The world could not get along 1 without copper, lead, zinc, tin and 
other minerals ; even silver and gold are needed also. President 
Young's counsel at that time was, as you may read in his sermons : 
"You, brethren and sisters, who will stay here at home and attend 
to your farms, look after what you have, I promise you that you 
will be richer and better off than if you go away hunting mines." 

Brethren and sisters, that counsel is just as sound today, to the 
Latter-day Saints, as it was the day President Young gave it. It is 
good sense yet. Let me say here that "Mormonism" is good sound 
sense. I know of investments that have been made in coal mines 
which have not turned out very satisfactory. Some fellow comes 
along, and he has a coal mine prospect. If you will only invest your 
money in a coal mine you are sure to get rich quickly. 

. Well, people invested up in Cache valley and in southern Utah. 
What is the result? Hundreds of thousands of dollars were frit- 
tered away and lost in that way. That is not good judgment, nor 
does it show good sense. And this is not only the case in coal 
mines; we have communications come to the president's office 
sometimes about "dream" mines. Some brother or sister has 
dreamed about a mine located in a certain place, and it is a sure 
thing, because it has been "revealed." Well, now, don't take any 
stock in such "revelations," they will not "pan out." You will only 
be disappointed. Save' your means and use them wisely. If we 
have means, and we owe any debts, our first duty is to pay our 
debts. If we owe a mortgage, for goodness sake wipe out the 
mortgage before we buy a new car. It is fine to have a new car, 
and I rejoice to see the many thousands that are parked in the 
streets around this block. Every street seems filled with automo- 
biles. I am glad you have them, but don't buy any new cars while 
there is a mortgage on the home or on the farm. 

CULTIVATE THE SPIRIT OF THRIFT AND SAVING 

Try to economize, try to save. We have almost lost the spirit 
of thrift and saving. We hardly know what it is. Our children 
run wild to picture shows. It is only 25 cents to attend a picture 
show, and there are only four or five children, and they only go 
three or four or five times a week, and the money is gone, frit- 
tered away. What good has been done with it? "Well," one says, 
"do you want the children to be shut up and not have any amuse- 
ment?" No, people will have amusement; children need it; but we 
are going to extremes foolishly, spending money in excess of our 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



means. We do not save; we have lost the old-time spirit of New 
England thrift or of Scotch thrift. We don't know what it means. 

REMEMBER YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE LORD 

Then there is another debt that we will owe this fall, not to 
our neighbors, but to the Lord, who has given us this wonderful 
harvest. Will we remember and pay our tithes and our offerings 
to him, to help build up this work? If you could see the stack of 
applications for the building of meeting houses all over the world, 
you would realize that we will never get more than is needed. 
There will always be more applications, I believe, as this work 
grows and extends, than there will be means in hand to fill them. 
We cannot do better with our tithes than build good church edi- 
fices for the Saints to worship in, places where our young people 
may meet, instead of running here and there, wasting our money. 

COUNSEL TO THE YOUNG TO MARRY 

When boys and girls arrive at the age of manhood and woman- 
hood they should be counseled to marry, to settle down and raise 
families. That is the very purpose of our being here. We are sent 
to this earth to pass through this stage of experience, to bring to 
pass the work of the Lord, and to make it possible for the spirits 
that are waiting to come and tabernacle in the flesh, to have the 
opportunity. So it is much better for the young people to get mar- 
ried and settle down rather than to be running hither and yon, 
spending their means, not knowing how to save, or how to curtail 
expenses. But today the tendency is, not only here but all through 
the country, to put off marriage. "We haven't means enough," they 
say ; "we haven't saved enough." Well, a good young man and a 
good young woman, working together, can save money anywhere 
and any time, if they will only make up their minds to do it. All it 
needs is work, application and saving. Just five words spell pros- 
perity, success and happiness — five words only — and they are these : 
"Spend less than you get." 

SACRIFICE FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH 

Brethren and sisters, shall we not sacrifice for this work? Are 
we losing the spirit of sacrifice that existed in the Church in years 
gone by? Are we forgetting what our fathers and mothers did, and 
the sacrifices they made? Are we not willing to respond to the call 
of the president and to work in the spirit of sacrifice for the glory 
of the Lord and the credit of his Church, that it may be built up 
and made glorious? Let us make this place the best there is in 
the world, as I believe it is now, in point of citizenship. A com- 
munity of this kind, without a single beggar of our membership on 
the street, is the best I know of. A community of this size, with 
as low a death rate and as high a birth rate (although not high 
enough), is a community that I don't know the like of anywhere 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 15 



in the world. So the Lord is working through us and is making us 
a little better; but we are forgetting, I fear, that spirit of sacrifice 
with which our fathers and mothers built up this country and 
passed through all the struggles and trials incident thereto. I hope 
we will try to impress that spirit upon our own minds and upon 
the minds of our children. 

WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE LORD'S WORK 

The Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and may he bless 
Zion. The Lord will comfort Zion, and will establish his kingdom. 
He is doing it. It is not the presidency and apostles, the seventy 
and bishopric, the presidents of stakes and the bishops of wards 
who are doing this great work, let me tell you. They are faithful 
servants, willing to be used, willing to help, willing to devote their 
lives to the upbuilding of the kingdom ; but it is the Lord God Al- 
mighty who is building up this work, caring for it and leading it; 
and his power of leadership is just as strong in it today, through 
the president of the- Church, as it ever was in the history of the 
Church. The Lord Almighty lives. He is the only true and living 
God, and we believe in him, and in Jesus Christ whom he has sent. 
May that faith in him and in his Son and in the Holy Ghost be in- 
creased in our hearts, and may we turn our hearts and minds to 
him and say: "Lord, take me and use me. I will devote myself 
and my energies to the upbuilding of thy cause and kingdom in the 
earth." I humbly pray that we may be endowed with this spirit, 
and I ask this blessing and all blessings upon this Church, upon 
this people, and upon this nation as well, and those who administer 
its affairs, as well as upon all the nations of the earth, where right- 
eousness is sought, where the people desire peace on earth and 
good will towards men. I ask blessings upon all, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, this is a tremendous gathering of 
Latter-day Saints. I trust that by the aid of the radio my_ voice 
will reach you. 

WHO CAN DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL 

In times past, and perhaps to some extent up to the present 
time, criticism has been offered against the leaders of the Church 
for being engaged in business affairs. It is said, by some people, 
perhaps even by some who are in the Church, that the General 
Authorities of the Church ought to be devoted entirely and wholly 
to spiritual affairs, and not be engaged in temporal affairs, or in 
business. I think the stand is taken through a misunderstanding. 
I am of opinion that, if the leaders of the Church should withdraw 
entirely from business affairs, the purposes of the Lord con- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



cerning Zion would fail. I grant you, brethren and sisters, that the 
spiritual takes the precedence. It is of greater consequence than 
material or temporal things, but who among us has the wisdom to 
draw the line between the spiritual and the temporal, and to say 
where the spiritual ends and the temporal begins? I am sure that 
I haven't that wisdom, and really I don't think it can be done. 

JOSEPH, THE PROPHET, THOUGH SPIRITUAL, HAD MUCH TO DO WITH 

THE TEMPORAL 

About a hundred years ago the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was organized, and in those early days, a leader 
was needed who had eminent spiritual talents and ability. It was 
necessary that that man should be in constant communication 
with the heavens, and should have the gift and power of revelation, 
that by this spirit he might declare the will of God to his people. 
He would necessarily occupy a parallel position to that which was 
held by the Apostle Peter when the Lord said to Peter that he 
would give unto him the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, that 
whatsoever he should bind upon the earth should be bound in 
heaven, and that whatsoever he should loose upon the earth should 
be loosed in heaven. Such was the spirit and power and gift that 
rested upon Joseph Smith. The Lord said to him in a great revela- 
tion, Sec. 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth 
shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name 
and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; 
and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the 
heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in 
heaven. 

"And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whom- 
soever you curse I will curse." 

And so, in this manner, the keys to the kingdom of heaven 
were delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Shall we say that he 
was spiritually minded? Yea, verily, for he had to do largely 
with spiritual things. The Lord said to him that his strength was 
not in temporal things, but in that which was spiritual. Neverthe- 
less — and this is a thing I want to emphasize at this point — never- 
theless the Prophet Joseph Smith had to do with temporal things. 
He with his associates founded the city of Kirtland ; he founded the 
city of Nauvoo, which was sometimes called "Nauvoo the Beauti- 
ful." Truly it was a beautiful city, and surely it was a modern city. 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was a member of the first city council 
of Nauvoo. When the Nauvoo Legion was organized Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, was elected Lieutenant General, which position 
he held until his death. He had occasion many times to counsel 
the people in temporal things, as well as to deliver to them the 
great spiritual commandments of God. Where can you find a 
separation there? Where is the line between the temporal and the 
spiritual?

BRIGHAM YOUNG WAS GIFTED IN BOTH SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL THINGS 

When Brigham Young was called to lead the Latter-day Saints 
out of bondage, out from Missouri, out and away from Illinois, and 
away from Nauvoo the Beautiful ; to lead that people into the 
■ wilderness, it was needful, I apprehend, that he should be endowed 
with high spiritual attainments, that he could counsel the people 
for the welfare of their very souls. It was needful also, surely it 
was needful, that he should have a practical view of life, that he 
should have some knowledge of temporal things and temporal con- 
ditions, and such was the case. Let me tell you, brethren and 
sisters, as Joseph Smith the Prophet was the man of the hour in 
his day, surely Brigham Young was the man of the hour in his 
time — a man of destiny, who led the people across the plains under 
the direction and inspiration of the Spirit of God. Brigham Young 
was a great leader of men. He brought them into these mountain 
vales, and here it was that he, with his associates, founded a great 
commonwealth. Cities and towns sprang up and were laid out in 
a spirit of wisdom and_ most excellent judgment. Look at Salt 
Lake City, with its wide streets, and noble shade trees, with ample 
room for turning around and getting through. Great foresight 
and wisdom were exhibited in the founding of Salt Lake City, 
Ogden and Logan on the north, Provo on the south, and other 
cities and towns. It was under the direction of Brigham Young 
that this intermountain region was pioneered and colonized. He 
had superior temporal gifts and superior spiritual gifts. Brigham 
Young was one of the first to recognize the advantage of coopera- 
tion. But he was not the first in this great latter-day movement. 
Joseph Smith the Prophet was the first, because he gave the people, 
by the gift of revelation, the principle of the United Order, which 
is a very high and advanced form of cooperation. Cooperation you 
might say is the lesser law. The United Order is the higher law. 
The Lord declared in unmistakable language that if we would be- 
come one in heavenly things we must also become one in earthly 
things, but when that will be I do not know. Cooperation is a 
step in that direction. President Brigham Young and his associ- 
ates, the apostles and others, preached that doctrine both loud and 
long. All the day long and all the night long for years, the people 
were advised to come together and combine, and cooperate in their 
business affairs, in handling temporal matters, building grist mills, 
building woolen mills, in manufacturing sugar, in establishing a 
life insurance company, banking and in carrying on the mercantile 
business. This they have done. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF CO-OPERATION APPLIES TO BOTH RELIGION 
AND BUSINESS 

It will be conceded, I think, by those who are familiar with 
present conditions in Zion, that the business of these enterprises 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and institutions has been wisely administered, and the tremendous 
strength and power exerted- by them are due mainly to the prin- 
ciple of cooperation. The principle of cooperation enables us to live 
rapidly and accomplish much in short periods of time. It might 
be illustrated in this way. One hundred men can accomplish 
as much in one day as one man can accomplish in one hundred days. 

The cooperative principle applies as logically to farming and 
fruit raising as it does to banking and the mercantile business, or 
the manufacture of sugar, or the insurance business. 

Dixie on the south has long been regarded as a somewhat 
desert country, dry and unproductive. Brethren and sisters, that 
is a fallacy. 

CO-OPERATION IN FARMING VS. INDIVIDUAL EFFORT 

At a priesthood meeting in St. George the other day, at which 
I was in attendance, several brethren, notably bishops, gave their 
experience regarding the matter of fruit raising in such places as 
Hurricane, LaVerkin, Santa Clara and St. George. By actual test 
on their part it was found that one acre of a hundred Delicious apple 
trees would produce four hundred bushels, which if sold at $1.90 
per bushel would bring $760. — that one acre of Jonathan apple trees 
would yield fourteen hundred twenty-eight bushels, which if sold 
at $1 per bushel would bring $1,480. That an acre of apricot trees 
would bring $1,093. That an acre of 100 trees of French prunes, 
dried, would produce a value of $2,048. That an acre of 160 pear 
trees would produce a value of $1,012. That one acre of grape vines 
would produce a value of $556. Remember these figures were 
taken from actual tests. With wise and intensive cultivation it 
can be done. What is needed in Dixie as in other places in Utah, 
and other parts of Zion, is a united effort among the farmers and 
fruit growers, a careful grading of fruit, and the establishment of 
packing houses at convenient places by the fruit growers where 
they could bring their fruit, and from which places it could be 
shipped in carload lots to the market. In this matter cooperation 
means success — individual efforts often lead to failure, or partial 
failure. 

The Lord bless you and prosper you, brethren and sisters, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang: "Watching over Israel." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Henry H. Rolapp, of the 
Church auditing committee. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p: m. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W . IVINS 



19 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock p. m., President Heber J. Grant stated that the choir 
and congregation would sing, as the opening hymn: "The Spirit of 
God like a fire is burning." 

After the song, Elder George Ray Maycock, president of the 
Kolob stake, offered prayer. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

It is a source of gratification, my brethren and sisters, that 
another opportunity is afforded us of assembling in general confer- 
ence under the favorable circumstances which exist. 

I stand before you this afternoon with great trepidation, facing 
this large congregation of people, and pray that I may have your 
support, and the support of our Father in Heaven, during the few 
moments which I expect to occupy. 

THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY VS. THE WISDOM OF MAN 

As a basis for the remarks which I desire to make I will read 
briefly from the second general epistle of the Apostle Peter to the 
Church. He had been bearing testimony to the divinity of the 
mission of the Redeemer of the World, had recounted the many evi- 
dences of his divinity to which the people were witnesses, and con- 
cluded with these words : 

"We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well 
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day 
dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first, that no 
prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 

"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy 
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 

The spirit of prophecy, my brethren and sisters, to which the 
scripture I have read refers, is the word of the Lord which comes to 
the Church, through the agencies he has provided. 

It must always continue with the Church if one purposes of 
the Father, as they apply to his chidlren, here upon earth, are to 
be accomplished, for without the word of prophecy, which is the 
word of the Lord, expressed through those whom he has appointed, 
and who have been sustained by the voice of the people who make 
up the membership of the Church, we are left to depend upon the 
wisdom of man, and if we are to judge the future by the past, the 
time will never come when the-wisdom of man alone will be suf- 
ficient to lead us on to the ultimate ideal of the perfect life, to 
which we aspire. 

At the afternoon meeting, on Tuesday, if we follow our usual 
mode of procedure, the names of the men who have been designated 
to direct the affairs of the Church at the present time, will be pre- 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sented to you, and you will vote to sustain them as prophets, seers, 
and revelators. 

I sometimes wonder if the keys of authority which belong to 
the office and calling of one who occupies this exalted position in 
the Church, is fully understood by the people. 

CHARACTER AND DUTY OF PROPHETS, SEERS AND REVELATORS 

A careful study of the etymology of the word and of the lives, 
works and character of the prophets of old makes clear the fact 
that a prophet was, and is, one called to act as God's messenger. 
He is to teach men the character of God, and define and make 
known to the people, his will. He is to denounce sin, and declare 
the punishment of trangression. He is to be above all else a 
preacher of righteousness, and when the people depart from the 
path which he has marked out for them to follow, is to call them 
back to the true faith. He is an interpreter of the scripture, and 
declares its meaning and application. When future events are to 
be declared he predicts them, but his direct, and most important 
calling is to be a forth-teller, or director of present policy, rather 
than a foreteller of that which is to come. 

There is but little difference between the calling of a prophet 
and that of a seer, or revelator. Saul, who had been sent by his 
father on an errand which appeared to be impossible of accomplish- 
ment, said to the servant who accompanied him, let us return ; but 
the servant, knowing that Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, was in 
the city where they chanced to be, replied : Let us go thither. 
Peradventure he can show us the way in which we are to go, and 
here we are told that before-time in Israel, when a man went to 
inquire of God, thus he spake : "Come and let us go to the seer, for 
he that is now called a prophet, was before time called a seer." 

The scripture also tells us that when King David was up in the 
morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David's 
seer, instructing him to deliver a certain message to the king. 

It will thus be seen that the words prophet and seer are used 
inter-changeably, and have practically the same meaning. In the 
revelations which have been given for the direction of the Church, 
in the present dispensation, the Lord says : 

"The duty of the president of the high priesthood is to preside over 
the whole Church, and to be like unto Moses, Yea, to be a seer, a revelator, 
a translator and prophet, having all the gifts of God, which he bestows 
upon the head of the Church." 

I have made these introductory remarks, my brethren and 
sisters, in the hope that you may better understand the calling and 
responsibility which develops upon these men whom you sustain 
as the presiding authorities of the Church, to be prophets, seers and 
revelators to it. 

As I have defined the calling and responsibility of a prophet, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 21 



you are my witnesses that these men who are before you today 
are discharging the responsibility which has been placed upon them. 
They are expounding the scriptures, calling men to repentance from 
sin and transgression, and pointing out the way which, if you walk 
in it, will lead you back into the presence of our Heavenly Father, 
and Jesus Christ, his Only Begotten Son. 

OUR PERILOUS TIMES NEED THE DIRECTING POWER OF PROPHECY 

I believe that you, my brethren and sisters, and you my friends 
who may be present, who are not members of the Church, but are 
interested in and carefully studying existing conditions in the world, 
will agree with me in the conclusion which I have reached, that if 
there has ever been a time when the spirit of prophecy has been 
needed to compose and harmonize the conflicting forces which are 
warring one against the other, when the word of the Lord is neces- 
sary in order that these questions, which are shaking the very 
foundations upon which our religious, social and political structures 
are builded may be settled, it is the day in which we live. 

In some localities the social laws which have from the begin- 
ning of time, as we count it, given protection to the family relation, 
and made possible the development of the world to its present social 
condition and civlization, are entirely ignored, while in others they 
are perilously near chaos. 

The world war, instead of bringing the allied nations closer to- 
gether, as we had hoped that it might, threatens, because of the 
financial complications which have arisen, to drive us farther apart, 
while in the school of religion conflicting opinions threaten to bring 
chaos to existing theories regarding our relationship to God, and 
the present and future state of man, as it applies to eternal life. 

Already the people are assembling in two hostile camps, one 
calling itself fundamentalists, the other modernists, one professing 
to base its conclusions on the truths brought out by modern 
scientific research, the other on the Word of the Lord, as it has 
come down to us in sacred writ, regardless of its harmony, or lack 
of harmony with modern thought, or the onward march of scientific 
investigation. 

It is not a new controversy, but one which has characterized 
every gospel dispensation which has existed from the beginning to 
the present. 

Men highly educated, and trained in certain fields of scientific 
research, with but limited knowledge of the great plan of human 
redemption, provided by the Lord for the blessing of his children, 
proceed to point out certain obscure passages which may be found 
in the Bible, and which may have no bearing at all on the relation- 
ship of man to his Maker, thus seeking to bring the entire book to 
ridicule, and destroy faith in it as a divine revelation from God. 

On the other hand men knowing little of the great truths which 
have come to the world through the investigations of men, denounce 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



all modern thought, sometimes even when it is demonstrated truth, 
if it does not appear to harmonize with their interpretation of the 
written word of the Lord. 

The controversy, it appears to me, is one which might be more 
readily composed if the parties to it better understood both sides of 
the question under discussion, and were governed by a spirit of 
tolerance and reason, rather than one of dogmatism. 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNDAMENTALIST AND MODERNIST 

What is the difference between a fundamentalist and a modern- 
ist? If asked this question I would answer somewhat as follows: 
A fundamentalist is one who believes in the teachings and customs 
of the past, as they have come down to us by means of the written 
word contained in sacred writ, or secular history, preferring, where 
the ideas and teachings of today conflict with the past, and where- 
definite evidence is lacking to establish one or the other theory to 
accept the old, rather than the more modern interpretation. 

The modernist prefers, and accepts, the customs, philosophy 
and thought of the present in preference to that of the remote past. 

The fact that a person may profess to be a fundamentalist is 
no evidence that he is either right or wrong, and the same rule may 
be applied to the modernist. Fundamentalism is that upon which 
a system or structure is builded. 

In the first century after the ministry of the Redeemer of the 
world many conflicting opinions prevailed upon the subject of re- 
ligion. Numerous churches were established, each professing to be 
followers of ;Christ, while differing greatly in creed. Paganism 
and idolatry were almost universal except among the Hebrew 
people, and even among them some were converted to the various 
systems which prevailed. 

In the confusion which ensued, Mohammed, a descendant of 
Abraham, through his son, Ishmael, seeing the danger which threat- 
ened, arose and declared that there was but one God, the God of his 
father, Abraham, and called his people away from the worship of 
idols, to the worship of a living but invisible God. To the present 
day this doctrine remains the fundamental faith of Islam. 

Buddha established a great system of religion on the theory 
that the spirit of man is eternal, that it may come to earth and 
tabernacle in the flesh at different periods of probation, perhaps 
more than once in the body of a man, perhaps in the body of an 
animal, if the man has proven to be unworthy, until in time it may 
go into the presence of God, or Nirvana. This is funadmental to 
the faith of the followers of Buddha. Thus we see that the Moham- 
medan and Budhist, while greatly differing in creed, are both 
fundamentalists, but that is no evidence that either is right or 
wrong. 

The same may be said in truth of the modernist. Looking back

over the history of the past it is plain that man cannot with safety 
ignore the lessons which it teaches, for truth, no matter when re- 
vealed, remains the same, and that great truths have been made 
known to man in the remote past cannot be denied. 

Neither can we ignore the truths which have come to the world 
as a result of scientific research in the dispensation in which we 
live. The sure anchor, then, upon which we are safe in building 
our structure, is demonstrated truth, whether it be the truth of the 
remote past, or the living present. Thus we become both funda- 
mentalists and modernists, with our feet firmly planted on solid 
ground. 

WHENCE CAME MAN, AND WHITHER GOETH HE? 

The question most discussed in the present controversy is that 
phase which deals with the origin and destiny of man. Whence 
came man, and whither goeth he? 

Without reference to the many theories which have existed 
upon this question, and which still exist, I desire to refer briefly to 
the one which is today greatly disturbing the minds of the people. 
Was man created by the decree of God, our Father, and placed upon 
the earth in his present form, or is he the creature of some natural 
process of development, which has in the course of the aeons which 
have passed brought him to where he is ? 

. The suggestion of Darwin, the great scientist, that man, by a pro- 
cess of natural selection and gradual development, may have evolved 
from a lower order of animal life to what he now is, although he did 
not declare this a fact, but only a theory, has resulted in much discussion, 
and too often in bitter controversy. 

Closely allied to the Darwinian theory, but still quite different 
is the theory of evolution, which is being so widely discussed, and I 
sometimes think so generally misunderstood today. 

Evolution is the process of evolving, or becoming developed. 
An unfolding or growth, from a latent state, or from a pre-arranged 
plan. 

WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH ON THIS QUESTION ? 

Naturally many, many people are asking, "What is the attitude 
of the Church on this important question, as it applies to the ex- 
istence of man?" Let me answer briefly. 

The foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints rests upon faith in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son, 
Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost 

We believe that God is an existent, living personality, and that 
man was created in his image. "In the image of God created he 
him, male and female created he them." 

We believe that Jesus Christ was, and is the Son of God, the 
Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, immaculately conceived 
and born of the Virgin Mary. That through the atonement wrought 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



out by him all men are redeemed from the penalty of death, pro- 
nounced upon our father Adam, through the resurrection from the 
grave, which he made possible, and that by obedience to the divine 
principles of right living which he taught, mankind may be re- 
deemed from personal sin, and brought back into the presence of 
the Father, to enjoy the fellowship and association of the Son. 

We believe that the Holy Ghost is the agency through which 
the will of the Father is communciated to his children, here upon 
earth. That it takes of the things of the Father, and manifests them 
unto man. It bears record of the Father and the Son, is our comfort 
in sorrow and distress, our strength in weakness, and our guide 
when in doubt. It is the Spirit of the Lord, the light which light- 
eth everything that cometh into the world, and with which all men 
are endowed in a greater or less degree. It is the spirit of knowl- 
edge, by which man became a responsible agent, knowing good 
from evil, thus becoming answerable for the deeds done while 
here in probation, an account of which all men must render when 
they stand before the bar of God to be judged according to their 
works. 

These doctrines are as old as the revealed will of the Lord to 
the inhabitants of the earth. It is, always has been, and will con- 
tinue to be the doctrine of the Church. From it the Church has 
never receded, it never can recede ; it is fundamental, and our faith 
in it makes us fundamentalists. 

Unlike the sectarian Christian denominations of the world, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes and teaches, 
that birth into this life is not the beginning of the existence of man, 
nor is death the end of it, but that the spirits of all men existed in 
a pre-mortal state, before coming to this earth to be clothed upon 
with mortality. That after death they return to the spirit world to 
await the resurrection, when they will come forth from the grave, 
with glorified, immortal bodies, to receive the glory and exaltation 
to which their works while in mortality entitle them. 

We believe that the earth is constantly undergoing changes 
which will eventually restore it to its paradisiacal glory, and make 
it a fit abode for glorified man. 

We believe all thatGod has revealed, all that he does now re- 
veal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and import- 
ant things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. 

If, then, to have our faces constantly toward the future, if to 
be forward looking, forward moving men and women, if to believe 
that great stores of knowledge, hidden treasures of knowledge, are 
yet to be revealed by men who have the spirit of the pioneer, which 
impels them to reach out into new and unknown fields of endeavor, 
whether it be in science, sociology, or exploration, if this, I say, is 
modernism, and if these changes which have come, and which are to 
come in the future, through the exercise of the intelligence of man, 
which is the intelligence of God, and which is based upon demon- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



25 



strated truth, and not theory, is evolution, then are we evolutionists. 

If, however, to be in harmony with modern thought we must 
renounce our faith in a living, personal God, the Creator of heaven 
and earth, not only the earth upon which we dwell, but the universe 
of which we form so small a part, that he holds dominion over it, 
shapes the destiny of its inhabitants, and controls the laws by which 
it is governed ; if we are to deny the knowledge which has come to 
us by direct revelation from heaven that Jesus Christ is the only 
begotten of the Father ; if we are to deny the truth which has been 
revealed which teaches that man was created in the image of God, 
was so in the beginning and will always remain so, while he goes 
on in intelligent development forever; if to be in harmony we are 
to renounce a single doctrine of revealed truth which has come to 
us, we unhesitatingly separate ourselves from modern thought and 
theory, and confidently await the time when revealed truth, whether 
it be the result of scientific research or the revealed word of the 
Lord, will vindicate our faith in his word, which through his mercy 
has come to us in this, the greatest of all dispensations of the 
world's history. 

The earth and all that is upon it, the sea and all that is in it 
did not come into existence by chance. Man is not the accidental 
product of chance. We admit the changes which have come, and 
believe that others of mighty import are before us, but in it all the 
Church sees not a thing of chance, but a definite plan, being shaped 
and moulded by a master mind, for the accomplishment of a divine 
purpose. 

THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD TO US CONCLUSIVE PROOF 

Time will not permit a presentation of the many evidences 
which exist in support of this doctrine of the pre-existence and 
future destiny of man. I ask your indulgence, however, while I 
refer to a few of the outstanding facts in relation to it. 

The life, ministry and teachings of the Redeemer of the World 
are sufficient, alone, definitely to settle the existing controversy. 
We know that there are those who do not regard the written word, 
as it is contained in the scripture as satisfactory proof, but to us it 
should be conclusive. 

We concede to all men the right to believe as they choose, but 
to members of the Church we appeal to remain steadfast in their 
faith in the revealed word of the Lord. 

There is one thing which characterizes his word which has al- 
ways appealed to me. It never comes to us as an hypothesis, but 
always as a definite fact. In the beginning God created the heaven 
and the earth. And God said let us make man in our image, after 
our likeness. So God created man in his own image, in the image 
of God created he him, male and female created he them. 

There is nothing hypothetical in this, nothing which admits 
of various interpretations, if we are to define words in their real 
meaning. It is a definite abstract statement of fact. The exact 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



process by which this was accomplished we do not know, nor is it 
essential that we know it, the fact is sufficient, and it will never be 
disproved by scientific research or otherwise, because it is the truth. 

THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF JESUS CHRIST THE LOGICAL OUTCOME 

That Christ lived in mortality is admitted by all people who 
are familiar with the history of his time, whether they are be- 
lievers or not. That he was condemned and cruicifed on Calvary 
is not denied, and that after his crucifixion and resurrection from 
the dead he appeared to his disciples, and to many of the Saints 
with his glorified body is testified to by those who saw and com- 
muned with him. 

Christ frequently declared that he was with the Father before 
he came to earth, and took upon him mortality, and that he re- 
turned to the Father after his work among men had been accom- 
plished. That he revealed himself to the people of the world be- 
fore his earthly existence, is plainly declared in the scripture, as the 
following will show. 

Soon after the confusion of tongues, at the time of the building 
of the Tower of Babel, Jared, a prophet of the Lord, led a colony 
of people from the old world to the new. The brother of this man 
Jared had gone out to plead with the Lord in behalf of his people, 
when the word of the Lord came to him, as follows : 

"Believest thou the words which I shall speak? And he answered: 
Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of 
truth, and canst not lie. 

"And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed himself 
unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed 
from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence: Therefore 
I show myself unto you. 

"Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world 
te redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. In me shall all mankind 
have light, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and 
they shall become my sons and daughters. Seest thou that ye are created 
after my own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning 
after mine own image. Behold, this body which ye now see is the body of 
my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as 
I appear to thee to be in the spirit, will I appear unto men in the fle'sh." 

At a later date Samuel, a Lamanite, prophesied to the Nephites 
that Christ would be born at a certain date, and would appear to the 
people of this continent, and that he was the Redeemer of the 
World. Unbelievers, as has always been the case, were bitterly 
opposed to this doctrine, and declaring that the date fixed by Sam- 
uel had passed, set a day when all who professed faith in his teach- 
ings should be put to death. In this crisis Nephi cried unto the 
Lord in behalf of those who were believers, with the following re- 
sult : 

"And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord, and behold 
the voice of the Lord came unto him saying: 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



27 



"Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for, behold, the time is at 
hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come 
I into the world, to show unto the world; that I will fulfil all that which 
I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets. 

"Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made 
known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to 
do the will both of the Father and the Son. And behold the time is at 
hand, and this night shall the sign be given." 

It was the voice of Christ, the Redeemer of the world, pro- 
claiming to man in mortality his coming and the following day the 
babe of Bethlehem was born. 

What evidence, my brethren and sisters, do we require more 
conclusive than this, of the ante-mortal existence of the Redeemer 
of the world? 

MAN ALONE ENDOWED WITH REASON 

Of all created things man alone is endowed with reason, which 
is the glory and intelligence of God. Of man alone the Creator has 
said : The man has become as one of us, knowing good and evil. 

BY REASON'S EXERCISE MAN GOES FORWARD 

It is by the exercise and application of this endowment that 
man goes forward, and will continue to go forward, forever. By 
the application of the intelligence of man, which is the intelligence 
of God, conditions are changed, and may become either better or 
worse. Remove the application of this intelligence and we have 
no knowledge of anything in nature which has gone forward, but 
we do know that the highest degree of perfection reached by man 
in development, when bereft of it, may rapidly retrograde, whether 
it applies to things of nature, individuals, communities or nations, 
and even where the intelligence of man has been applied to its full- 
est extent, but without the sure word of prophecy, without the sup- 
porting power of the Creator, our Father and God, chaos has re- 
sulted and it will continue to result, for it is the eternal decree of 
God that man whom he has placed here upon earth, shall recognize 
him, otherwise he cannot go on in eternal progression. 

"in the beginning, god" 

My knowledge of geology, which is limited, was obtained 
through study of that subject from books written by J. Dorman 
Steele whose works on science were probably more generally used 
in my school days than any other. In conclusion I wish to read 
briefly from his Fourteen Weeks in Geology, the following : 

"We have traced in the dim light of the past the history of our earth 
and its inhabitants. Everywhere we have found a divine hand shaping and 
moulding to accomplish a divine ideal. Was man created by God's fiat, or 
by some intermediate process of secondary causes? Alas for the impotence 
of science, and the scope of our finite intelligence. Primeval man shows 
no sign of development from the higher tribes of animals. No fossil yet 
found is a link between him and the monkey. -No ape ever made any im- 
provement on the condition in- which he was born. Man, on the other

hand never stays where he starts, he continually progresses. In the be- 
ginning God. We can add nothing to the old Hebrew declaration. The 
study of science ought never to lead one estray from this great fundamental 
thought. God has assuredly never written anything in nature contradictory 
of himself. Science and religion are alike his offspring, both will ultimately 
vindicate him and his attributes. Forgetting then the rancor and bitterness 
of the past in the joy of newly found truth, they will clasp hand and to- 
gether cast the crowns of their triumphs, the triumphs of science and 
Christianity, at the feet of their common author, and God will be pro- 
claimed Lord of all." 

LISTEN TO THE WORD OF GOD. NO TRUTH 1 WILL CONTRADICT IT 

My brethren and sisters, may these fundamental truths remain 
fixed in your minds, let nothing lead you away from them. Listen 
to the word of prophecy, as it comes to you through these men who 
sit before you this afternoon and I promise that you will never be 
led astray. No development of science will ever contradict the 
revealed word of the Lord, which has come to us. For the moment 
theories may appear to be in conflict with his revealed word, but 
demonstrated truth will always be in harmony with it, for he is the 
author of all truth. 

That his blessing may continue with us, and his protecting arm 
be over us, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo : "How beautiful upon the mountains," was sung 
by Louise Watson. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I believe I fully sense the importance of this occasion and the 
value of the time that is passing for this great congregation. Of 
myself I have little to say, except to announce my belief in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. During the two sessions of this conference 
my soul has been enriched by the truths that have been announced 
by those who have addressed us, and the music that seems almost 
divine. I have had the privilege of grasping the hands of dozens of 
my brethren and sisters who live in remote places, and who have 
left their homes and their own affairs, and have paid their expenses 
to come here to meet in this great conference. I am sure that when 
it is concluded the feeling will abound in the heart of each — 
that it has been well worth while. 

AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT 

President Ivins touched upon a subject, and I regret that he 
did not take more time to enlarge upon it, as I know he is capable 
of doing, to our blessing. He reminded me of a statement made 
only a short time ago with reference to what has been going on in 
Tennessee, where some of the brightest minds of this world were 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



29 



in conflict — those who adhere to the plain teachings' of the Old- 
Testament and the New, and those who accept none of these 
teachings as divine. During the catechisation of an important wit- 
ness reference was made to the first two chapters of Genesis, where- 
in it is stated that the heavens and the earth were created. And 
each day something was accomplished until the seventh day. After 
discovering by reading the same that all the various animals and 
the shrubs and vegetation had been created, the witness was asked : 
"Do you believe this?" And he announced that he did. Then he 
was asked : "What then is meant by this, and do you believe it : 
'And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; 
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had 
made'"? 

'And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it : because 
that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and 
made.' " And then he read this : 

"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they 
were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 

"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb 
of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon 
the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground." 

He said : "What does this mean? and do you believe it? Here 
we have the heavens and the earth, and man created in the image 
of God, male and female, and after the seventh day we find — after 
the completion of it — the statement that there was not rain upon 
the earth and there was not man to till the ground. 

"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face 
of the ground. 

"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed 
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." 

The witness could not explain, but he affirmed his profound 
belief in the statement contained therein. 

TWO CREATIONS REFERRED TO 

Now to this vast audience I could ask that question without 
hesitation, with the assurance that most of you would say, Why, 
there were two creations referred to. In the first place God created 
all these things. He formed the earth that was without form and 
void. He caused light to appear, he caused the waters to take their 
place, and the dry land to appear. He created spiritually, 
everything that dwells upon the earth; and after he had 
done that, the statement is made that there was not yet man to till 
the earth. Man in his spiritual condition was not prepared to till 
the earth, and so God formed his body for him. He prepared his 
physical being, and then the spirit that had been prepared before 
was placed in that body and he became a living soul. It seems to 
me that a splendid opportunity was lost to say to all the world, read 
the first and second chapters of Genesis carefully, and, to a very 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



large degree it will settle any doubt that may be in your mind as 
to the possibility of the various forms of life gravitating from one to 
the other, because we are told, "every tree and every seed bearing 
fruit after its kind." 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS 

And then the Latter-day Saints have another witness, and I 
am minded to read to you, just briefly, the testimony of something 
that the world has not yet received, but which, to my mind, is the 
truth as contained upon papyrus, and I will read the heading of 
this : 

"A translation of some ancient records, that have fallen into 
our hands, from the catacombs of Egypt ; the writings of Abraham 
while he was in Egypt, called the Book of Abraham, written by his 
own hand, upon papyrus." The Latter-day Saints accept the state- 
ment at face value, as contained in the first and second chapters 
of Genesis. Yea, we believe the Bible, all the Bible, to be the word 
of God, as far as it is translated correctly, and in addition we find 
in this translation that has been given to us from papyrus, by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith this statement by Abraham : 

PRE-EXISTENT SPIRITS 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many 
of the noble and great ones; 

"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood 
among those that were spirits," 

Let us keep that in mind: "For he stood among those that were 
spirits." 

Not the physical tabernacles that we now possess. 

"And he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, 
thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born. 

"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, 
and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell; 

"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; 

"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they 
who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom 
with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second 
estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. 

"And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like 
unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and 
said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first. 

"And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate, and, at that 
day, many followed after him." 

Of course there is a great similarity between this and the Old 
Testament. 

THE CREATION OF LIGHT 
"Then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



31 



beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens 
and the earth. 

"And the earth, after it was formed, was empty and desolate, because 
they had not formed anything but the earth; and darkness reigned upon 
the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the face 
of the waters. 

"And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; and there was light. 
"And they (the Gods) comprehended the light, for it was bright; and 
they divided the light, or caused it to be divided, from the darkness. 

THE CREATIVE PERIODS 

Then I will skip several passages: 

"And the Gods called the expanse, Heaven. And it came to pass that it 
was from evening until morning that they called night; and it came to pass 
that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and this was 
the second time that they called night and day." 

Note the phraseology. Whether it was a period of twenty-four 
hours or whether it was a period of hundreds of years was not ex- 
plained, but it was a period of time. And this record that is given 
as the words of Abraham, having been revealed to him by his 
heavenly Father, specifies it as a time. And so after each creation 
it is referred to as a first time, a second time, a third time, and 
so on. 

"And the Gods ordered, saying: Let the waters under the heaven be 
gathered together unto one place, and let the earth come up dry; and it was 
so as they ordered; 

"And the Gods pronounced the dry land, earth; and the gathering to- 
gether of the waters, pronounced they, great waters; and the Cods saw that 
they were obeyed. 

"And the Gods said: Let us prepare the earth to bring forth grass." 

THE EARTH PREPARED TO BRING FORTH GRASS 

Mind you, they were to prepare the earth to bring forth grass. 

"The herb yielding seed; the fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind, 
whose seed in itself yieldeth its own likeness upon the earth; and it was so, 
even as they ordered. 

"And the Gods organized the earth to bring forth grass from its own 
seed, and the herb to bring forth herb from its own seed, yielding seed after 
his kind; and the earth to bring forth the tree from its own seed, yielding 
fruit, whose seed could only bring forth the same in itself, after his kind; 
and the Gods saw that they were obeyed. 

"And it came to pass that they numbered the days; from the evening 
until the morning they called night; and it came to pass, from the morning 
until the evening they called day; and it was the third time." 

THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 

We will now pass over a few paragraphs, telling of the prepara- 
tion for bringing forth whales, winged fowl, creeping things, etc., 
then we read : 

"And the Gods prepared the earth to bring forth the living creature 
after his kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their 
kind; and it was so, as they had said. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And the Gods organized the earth to bring forth the beasts after their 
kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the 
earth after its kind; and the Gods saw they would obey. 

"And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go 
down and form man in our image, after our likeness; and we will give them 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth 
upon the earth. 

"So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the 
image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them. 

"And the Gods said: We will bless them. And the Gods said: We will 
cause them to be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue 
't, and to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the 
air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 

"And the Gods said: Behold, we. will give them every herb bearing 
seed that shall come upon the face of all the earth, and every tree which 
shall have fruit upon it; yea, the fruit of the tree yielding seed to them we 
will give it; it shall be for their meat." 

Again I will pass over a few passages : 

"And the Gods came down and formed these the generations of the 
heavens and of the earth, when they were formed in the day that the Gods 
formed the earth and the heavens, 

"According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of 
the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it 
grew; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they 
counseled to do them, and had not formed a man to till the ground. 

"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face 
of the ground. 

"And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his 
spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his 
nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. 

"And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and there they put 
the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed." 

That is another testimony to me of the origin of the species. 
It is to me the simplest explanation of the preparation of this earth 
for the habitation of animal and vegetable life that has ever been 
prepared. It has been my privilege to read the theories and to 
listen to the solutions of this problem by some of the wisest men 
of the world, but wherein they have differed from this plain state- 
ment of facts, as revealed by our Father in heaven to his servants, 
who were his mouthpieces to the children of men, the arguments 
of my Father's sons, my brethren if you will, whom I love, every 
• one of them has been feeble indeed, to bear to my mind a compre- 
hension of the origin of man. 

THE TESTIMONY OF MODERN REVELATION 

Then we come again to the story contained in the Book of 
Mormon, which adds also to the testimony we have of where we 
came from. Then we have the testimony of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in our day, who has supplemented these things by revela- 
tions, that to me are beautiful explanations of the purposes of God 
toward his children, and his preparation of their peace and happi- 
ness throughout the ages of eternity.

A SURE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN 

I am grateful that in the midst of the confusion of our Father's 
children there has been given to the members of this great organ- 
ization a sure knowledge of the origin of man, that we came from 
the spirit world where our spirits were begotten by our Father in 
heaven, that he formed our first parents from the dust of the earth, 
and that their spirits were placed in their bodies, and that man 
came, not as some have believed, not as some have preferred to be- 
lieve, from some of the lower walks of life, but our ancestors were 
those beings who lived in the courts of heaven. We came not from 
some menial order of life, but our ancestor is God our heavenly- 
Father. I am grateful that we are not laboring under a handicap 
such as I feel that some men are who feel that they have grown up 
and evolved from some unknown condition ; but, on the contrary, 
standing as we do, facing the problems of life, believing as we do 
that we were first created in the image of God, that he is the 
Father of our spirits, and that he created this earth for us that we 
might dwell hereon, under his wise counsel and direction, we may 
be happy, to rejoice in life and to prepare ourselves to go back into 
his presence, to live forever, when our life here upon this earth has 
been terminated. 

NO DOUBT ABOUT OUR ANCESTRY 

These are some of the things that have come into my mind 
during this conference, and -I stand here, my brethren and sisters, 
again to say to you : grateful am I that there is no doubt in my mind 
as to our ancestry, and I believe, as I believe that I live, that if we 
will keep the commandments of God, as they have been handed 
down to us through his prophets from age to age, if we will avail 
ourselves of this glorious truth as it has been promulgated among 
the children of men, our lives upon this earth will be filled with joy 
and satisfaction and assurance, and in the end there will come to us 
the joy of eternal life and eternal companionship with those we 
love throughout the ages of eternity. 

OUR MISSION 

This is a part of your mission, ye men of Israel, to evidence by 
your lives, to teach by word of mouth, this truth, as also the other 
truths that are essential for men and women to dwell in the celes- 
tial kingdom of our heavenly Father. Gathered together as we are 
today under the roof of this building that has been dedicated to 
the worship of the Lord our God, how grateful we ought to be that 
there has been removed from us the doubt that exists in the minds 
of so many of our Father's splendid sons and daughters, that there 
has come to us that abiding assurance that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, that he is our elder brother, and that if we are faithful, 
in his own due time he will cleanse and purify this earth on which 
we dwell, and it will be celestialized, and those who have prepared 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



themselves for the celestial kingdom will have the joy of dwelling 
hereon, to be directed, to be counseled, to be taught, and advised by 
the Lord of lords and King of kings, throughout the ages of eter- 
nity. What a wonderful promise, my brethren and sisters, has been 
given to the children of men, and oh, how I pray that there may 
come into the souls of the thousands and millions of God's children 
a knowledge of the purpose of their being, that they may prepare, 
while there is yet time before their final summons, for the time when we 
will be classified and placed in whatever kingdom ; we have earned the 
right to dwell in, when we go to the other side. 

That the Lord may add his blessings, that the joy that comes 
from knowing the gospel of Jesus Christ may spread throughout the 
earth, that the truth that is necessary for the salvation of men may 
be disseminated by those bearing divine authority, that by and by 
when our Father shall gather his jewels, when the Lamb's book of 
life shall be opened that we, with those we love and all our Father's 
children wherever they may be, may be found enrolled there is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

My dear Brethren and Sisters : In using this form of address 
I do so not without thought or feeling, for to me the Latter-day 
Saints are dear. I love the faithful members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I sympathize with and pity those 
who are not faithful. 

I am glad to be associated with you in conference, my brethren 
and sisters, and as a member of the Church I am glad to share 
with you whatever of ignominy may rest upon us as a people be- 
cause of our religion, and being unpopular with the world. I am 
not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for I know that it is the power 
of God unto salvation to all those who will faithfully obey the 
same. 

THE SAINTS HAVE THE COURAGE OF THEIR CONVICTIONS 

There are, without doubt, people listening in on their radio 
sets to the proceedings of this conference, who would be ashamed 
perhaps to be seen in our midst worshiping with us, and yet they 
have an inward conviction that we are right in our worship, and 
that this is indeed the true gospel of the Master. The Latter-day 
Saints are not of that character, they have not only a firm convic- 
tion but a true and abiding testimony of the truth, and they have 
the courage of their convictions. 

I have no doubt that there are many others listening in who 
are interested in the doctrines which we teach, but who, because 
of what it would cost to be a consistent member of this Church, 
are manifesting no interest among us. The Latter-day Saints are 
not of that class, either — they have embraced the Gospel as the 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



35 



straight gate and the narrow way that leadeth to everlasting life. 
They have accepted it as a gospel of sacrifice and self abnegation 
from beginning to end, and they realize that in order to be worthy 
disciples of the Master they must be willing to give of their sub- 
stance in any amount that may be required, even to all that they 
possess if necessary, for the building up of the kingdom of God on 
the earth and the establishment of his kingdom. They understand 
that they must have it in their hearts to lay down their lives for 
the truth, if need be, and that none who is not thus willing is ap- 
proved of the Lord. There are, of course, individuals among us 
who become lukewarm and indifferent. This fact we greatly regret 
and we are striving to bring all to a unity of the faith and to faith- 
fulness in serving the Lord. 

THE DANGER OF LOSING SALVATION 

There are various causes that keep men and women outside the 
Church, who have investigated far enough to be assured that we 
teach the true scriptural doctrine. I would that they had the cour- 
age of the Latter-day Saints. I feel that all such are in serious 
danger, their salvation is in jeopardy. Jesus Christ, the Savior and 
Redeemer of mankind is also Mediator with the Father for us, and 
he has said that if we are ashamed of him, he will be ashamed of 
us before the Father. Men and women who are ashamed of the 
work of God and the followers of Jesus Christ I fear, will be re- 
garded by Him as being of this class. 

THE STANDARD OF WORTHINESS 

I rejoice in my association with the Latter-day Saints. I be- 
lieve that I love God, I hope and pray that I do, so as to meet every 
requirement that he has made upon me. I hope and pray con- 
stantly that my faith and testimony in the life, the existence and 
the mission of Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world may not be 
wanting. As often as I partake of the sacrament as emblems of 
his body and blood, I ask myself the question, "Am I ready, am I 
willing, if it should be required at my hands, to give my life for 
him and for this cause?" And if I am not thus ready and willing 
I have yet much to learn and to do, for I must reach that standard 
if I would be accounted worthy of an exaltation with him in our 
Father's kingdom. If I did not love the Latter-day Saints I should 
consider myself unworthy of the position which I occupy. I ought 
to so love this people that I would rejoice with them in their suc- 
cesses and sorrow with. them in their misfortunes. I think that is 
a good standard for all of us. If I do not love my brother, I fear 
my love of God and of Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of the 
world is wanting, and I do know that salvation is the thing above 
all other things that I desire and that we all should desire. And I 
know equally well that we cannot hope to obtain the goal of salva- 
tion and exaltation unless we do believe in Jesus Christ as the Son 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of God, not merely as a great teacher, but we must accept him as 
the Savior and the Redeemer of mankind. No man can be saved 
without this faith in Jesus Christ. That means that many men and 
women are going to be. greatly disappointed in the end when they 
learn the whole truth. 

AN INDIVIDUAL TESTIMONY 

I am thankful to my Father in heaven that he has made it easy 
for me to believe on him as the God of this world and the Creator 
of the heavens and the earth and the laws by which they are gov- 
erned, the very eternal Father of the spirits of all men ; I have no 
doubts, every fiber of my being responds to that testimony and 
declaration. I am equally thankful that I have no doubts with re- 
gard to his Son Jesus Christ and his mission. I do know by the 
witness of the Holy Spirit, whose mission it is to reveal unto us 
the things of God, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Re- 
deemer of the world, the very Messiah. I thank the Lord that I 
have believed and that I have received the witness, and that I am 
without doubt with regard to these things. As a special witness of 
the Lord unto the people, not the Latter-day Saints alone/but unto 
this whole world, I bear my testimony, which I know I will have 
to meet hereafter, that I do know that God lives and that Jesus is 
the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that I do know this is his 
work, and that there must be faith in Jesus Christ, and obedience 
unto the laws and ordinances of his gospel, if we would obtain 
eternal life. These things we have accepted, and it is our desire 
and we are making effort to live up to the perfect law of Christ, the 
law of the gospel, which is a law of liberty. But we are mortal, 
we confess our sins daily before God, and before one another, still 
we have hope, notwithstanding our weaknesses, that we will endure 
in the faith, and that by persistent striving and with the help of the 
Lord, we will ultimately overcome evil and gain eternal life, and 
we can afford to be merciful and charitable to those who are less 
fortunate than are we. 

OUR ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES ETERNAL 

To those who are on the outside I would like to say this, that 
while members of this Church are mortal, and have weaknesses, 
and do err and do things that are not commendable, the principles 
which we have accepted are eternal, they are true and exalting, and 
we should be able to differentiate between the lives, actions and 
words of men, and the religion which they have received and which 
in their weakness they are trying to live. Now, I admonish you 
to repent of your sins and come and join us and be better men and 
women, if you can, than we are, and we will not be jealous or 
envious, we will love you the more. 

God bless you all, members of the Church and non-members 
alike, our Father's children, may those who are in spiritual dark- 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

ness, be brought to see the light. May they be given courage to 
act according to the light and understanding they may receive, 
that all who would, may eventually be saved and exalted in the 
kingdom of God, I earnestly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

SYMPATHY EXTENDED TO THOSE WHO MOURN 

Since our last Conference, President Peter M. Hansen, of the 
Bear River stake, has passed away, also Brothers Arthur A. Pax- 
man, Edgar A. Hunsaker and Hans C. Sorenson, Bishops of Wash- 
ington, Mesa, and Mount Carmel wards, respectively. 

The fine singing today reminds me of the fact that our organ- 
ist, the late John J. McClellan, has also passed away. 

We extend our heartfelt sympathy to those who have been 
called upon, through the death of their loved ones, to be separated 
from them. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Great is Jehovah, the Lord," Jessie 
Williams singing the solo parts. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Harry L. Payne, presi- 
dent of the St. Joseph stake, Arizona. 

Conference adjourned until Monday morning, 10 o'clock, October 
5, 1925. 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday Morning, October 4. 1 

Elder Rey L. Pratt, of the First Council of Seventy and President 
of the Mexican mission, presided. 

The music was furnished by a double quartet from the Thirty-first 
ward, Salt Lake City, Elder George H. Durham, conductor; Elder 
Tracy Y. Cannon at the organ. 

The congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Harrison E. Jenkins, of Salt Lake 

City. 

The congregation sang, "Come, let us anew." 

ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 

Formerly President of the Swiss-German Mission 

My beloved brothers and sisters, I feel very humble and weak 
this morning in standing before this great congregation of Latter- 
day Saints, and I trust that the words uttered in the prayer may 
be realized. 

I am very thankful to my heavenly Father for the knowledge 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and testimony that I have of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There 
never has been a doubt in my mind from my earliest infancy of 
the divinity of this work in which we are engaged. I take this 
book, the Bible, from cover to cover, as an inspired word, inspired 
of the Lord, and I have been taught all my life to believe it. Not- 
withstanding all that may be said by the scientists, I never have 
discovered anything in my life in the Word of the Lord that is 
not a part of all true science. I believe it with all my soul; I be- 
lieve it is the science of all truth, and if we have the Spirit of the 
Lord with us when we read this book, we will be able to know be- 
yond all question of doubt that it is the Word of God. 

I was a little surprised, this morning, in reading the morning 
paper, to see my name announced as one of the speakers in this 
conference, this morning. 

I have just recently returned from a business and pleasure 
trip throughout Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and I also 
went over into British Columbia. In all the years of my life I do 
not believe that I ever saw the country so prosperous as it is at 
the present time. I never saw such crops of wheat throughout 
the northwest, such crops of alfalfa, of beets, and fruit as I have 
seen during my travels the last few weeks. And I was thinking 
that we all should feel that the Lord is mindful of this people. He 
has blessed the earth for our sakes, for our good ; for we are all his 
people, all his children — we may not all see alike, but at the same 
time we are all the children of the Father — and he pours out his 
blessings upon us. And when he does that, he does it for the pur- 
pose that we will use these blessings to accomplish good. I hope 
that this will be a warning to our people that they should be mind- 
ful of these blessings and take care of the things that the Lord is 
blessing us with. I appreciate, beyond my power to say, the bless- 
ings that have come to me. I enjoy them and I appreciate them, 
and I want to show my appreciation by serving the Lord and keep- 
ing his commandments. And the only way I can do it, is by being 
mindful of the Lord's goodness to me, and doing my full duty in 
keeping his commandments and obeying his laws. What a wonder- 
ful thing it would be today if all the people this year should remem- 
ber the Lord, not forget him at this time of prosperity ! It is easy 
to remember him when we are in distress, in famine. Remember 
the Lord in the day of plenty. Remember that he has opened the 
windows of heaven and has poured his blessings upon us. Now, 
let us be good stewards and take care of what the Lord has given 
us, and pay our tithes and our offerings, and the Lord will con- 
tinue to bless us. 

Since coming into the room I have thought of this passage of 
scripture, which I am going to read to vou. I believe in all the 
principles of the gospel. We have been preaching them now for 
practically one hundred years: faith, repentance, and baptism, and 
many of us — perhaps all of us present today — have rendered obedi- 



I 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 39 

ence to the first principles of the gospel. I remember so well that 
beautiful, matchless sermon of the Master's, the Sermon on the 
Mount. After he had concluded that sermon he spoke to the Saints 
as follows : 

"Judge not, that ye be not judged. 

"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what 
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. 

"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but 
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 

"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of 
thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 

"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and 
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." 

I think of this for myself very often. I would like to judge my 
brethren and sisters righteously and justly. I think that we are 
too often prone to judge harshly. O, it is a beautiful thing to be 
kind and charitable and judge righteously in all affairs pertaining 
to our everyday lives. This gospel of faith, repentance, and bap- 
tism to me does not end when we have been born again, but it goes 
on throughout our daily lives, and what we build here, we will in- 
habit; what we sow here, we will reap, just as surely as the Lord 
lives. And we cannot deceive the Lord, because the Lord is just 
and will mete out unto us justice in the fullest measure, and I be- 
lieve, my brethren and sisters, that we should be careful in judging 
one another not too rashly and too quickly. Be careful and wise in 
your judgments. 

"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you." 

I believe those words with all my heart; I think they are all 
true. And I do not believe that I can sit down in my home and 
pray and ask the Lord to help me, and then, if I go out on to the 
road in my daily life in business, that I can deceive the Lord, if I 
am not honest and just with my fellowmen, do not pay my tithes 
and offerings, and am not honest in my daily labors. I believe that 
a true Latter-day Saint is true in every respect, and lives up to his 
professions in every respect. That is the doctrine of the Master, 
that we shall practice and live up to the principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, that the world may see our good works, judge us by 
them, and glorify our Father in heaven. 

"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and 
to him that knocketh it shall be opened." 

How are you going to knock? "Seek and ye shall find." My 
brothers and sisters, the Lord is not going to give us anything that 
we do not work for. We can sit here and prav for a thing, but 
faith without works is dead, and in all avocations of life, in my 
daily business, in my daily work, I commend myself every morn- 
ing to the Lord. And O, how thankful I am for the teachings of 
my dear old mother ! I can remember very well when I was a little 
boy, when my mother called her family about her knee and we 
prayed. We did not pray to an unknown God but to our heavenly 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Father. And I can testify to you that our heavenly Father hears 
and answers prayers. I know that just as well as I know that I am 
living, and I know that he will answer the prayers of all his faith- 
ful and humble servants who seek him honestly and diligently. 

"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give 
him a stone? 

"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? 

"If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your chil- 
dren, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good 
things to them that ask him?" 

Ask him in faith and he will bless you. He often blesses us, 
I think, more than we are worthy of. He is kinder to us than we 
are in many instances to our neighbors, to our brothers and sisters. 

"Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, 
do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." 

I believe in that, I believe in every word of it. I never would 
ask a man to do a thing for me that I would not do for him. I was 
president of the Swiss-German mission in 1903. For about six 
years and a half I presided over that mission, but I always had this 
in mind that I would never send a man to do a thing in the mission 
field that I would not do and did not do myself. I believe in that 
principle, I believe in justice, and whatever I ask a man to do I am 
willing and feel that we should all be willing to do ourselves. That 
was the teaching of the Master. 

"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the 
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; 

"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto 
life, and few there be that find it." 

I was thinking of this scripture during my last travels. I was 
in the city of Portland, I was in the city of Seattle, and a great many 
of the large centers, and the first thing I looked for was the "Mor- 
mon" Church, the Church which claims to be the only true Church 
upon the earth, and I believe that absolutely, but in those large 
cities I had to hunt around as if for a needle in a haystack to find 
our people. I found them in Portland, but not in Seattle. I could 
not find them in many other places. No doubt they were there. 
I was there only a short time. But in visiting among those people 
I could see their condition — not that I condemn or blame them ; 
they are living up to what they know, to what they understand 
perhaps to be right — but O, what a power it would be if the gospel 
of Jesus Christ could be made known to those people. In the city 
of Seattle I felt as if I would like to stand up on some high hill 
and proclaim the gospel to the people of Seattle. I believe they are 
a good people and are ready for the gospel, and it will be given 
them. 

"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but 
inwardly they are ravening wolves. 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLlP 



41 



''Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth not forth good fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither Can a corrupt tree 
bring forth good fruit. 

"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast 
into the fire. 

"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 

"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall ehter ihto the 
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in 
heaven." 

Now, my message to you, by brethren and sisters, is to do the 
will of our Father which is in heaven, and you will find in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ restored in our day, the true and unadulter- 
ated gospel of Jesus Christ. I have no apologies to offer for the 
gospel restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I know, and have always known, and bear testimony to you 
that I know, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that he was 
the instrument in the hands of the Lord in establishing his Church 
here upon the earth. And I want to testify to you that I know be- 
yond all question of doubt that all those prophets who have suc- 
ceeded the Prophet Joseph Smith have been prophets, seers, and 
revelators, called and inspired of the Lord. And the man who 
stands at the head of this Church today, I want to bear witness to 
you, holds the keys ; and when God has a message for this people, 
I promise you that that message will come through the proper 
channel. God bless you. Amen. 

A double mixed quartet, consisting of Elders George H. 
Durham, John T Siech, Sisters Ada Thompson, Aurora Hiatt, Jennie 
Thompson, Mrs. George H. Durham, and Elder Harrison E. Jenkins 
and June Sharp, sang, "The sermon on the mount." 

ELDER ABEL JOHN EVANS 

Of the Presidency of the Alpine Stake 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I presume an apology is due 
from me for coming into the meeting late. I have been a subscriber 
to the Deseret News, and a reader of it for fifty years, but the 
notice that was published there escaped my attention and for that 
reason I was called from the congregation in the large Tabernacle 
by President Grant this morning, and I rejoice exceedingly this 
morning that I have been counted worthy to occupy a few moments 
of your time in this conference. I feel great diffidence in arising to 
address you, for I have long since learned that no elder of this 
Church can interest the Latter-day Saints except he be guided by 
the divine influence of our Father,^ and therefore I beseech of you 
an interest in your faith and prayers for a short time. 

I rejoice in this great Latter-day work, and bear witness to the 
remarks made by Elder Ballif that I heard after coming into the 
building. That great apostle of the Gentiles, Paul, in writing to the 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Corinthians, made this remarkable statement: "Eye hath not seen 
nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, the 
things God hath laid up in store for those who love him." And then 
let me add that "those who love him will keep his commandments." 
I sometimes fancy that perhaps we are not as appreciative of our 
membership in this Church as we ought to be, for when we remem- 
ber that no person can occupy a position of trust in this Church 
without first becoming a member thereof, and that all these bless- 
ings and these wonderful experiences that we are permitted to enjoy 
and by reason Of participation, in which our souls become en- 
larged, our vision extends, and we are better able to appreciate and 
see the handiwork of our Father. We realize that all these matters 
grow out of our membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I can say for one that I have been in the Church 
all my life, and at no time, during that entire period, have I been 
better satisfied, had more assurance, or ever felt in my mind more 
determination to continue to the end than I do this day. I thank 
God for that. It has been my privilege to traverse land and sea to 
the old world to preach the gospel, and I have sought in my humble 
way to explain the principles of our doctrine. I have borne my 
testimony in private homes, upon the street corners, and in assem- 
blages of people in halls, bearing witness of the divinity of the 
restoration of the gospel anew — not a new gospel but the old gospel 
introduced and ushered into the world while we have been per- 
mitted to live in it. O, what a wonderful thing it is, and when we 
contemplate all the great multitude and millions of people extant 
upon the earth, we realize that but few in comparison have had their 
hearts touched and their souls lit up so that they have received a 
witness of the divinity of this great latter-day work. When I con- 
template the condition of my own father and mother; and when I 
refer to that, it is not from a selfish standpoint, because many of 
your grandfathers and grandmothers were under the same condi- 
tion — my father belonged to no church, he took very great delight 
in going and putting ministers to rout. He was a great reader of 
the Scriptures and could put them all to rout by the Scriptures 
themselves. When he heard a man by the name of Hanshaw had 
come to preach the gospel, he and his father went there for the very 
purpose of exploding the things that he would put forth. When he 
heard that witness, though in broken sentences, and with a stam- 
mering tongue, bearing witness that the Lord had revealed anew, 
that the Lord had come himself and brought his Son and introduced 
him to that boy, in answer to prayer, that he was to restore that 
lost gospel that had been obliterated from the earth for so many 
years, it touched his soul, and not a word came from his lips. And 
when they were going away, my grandfather said to him, "Abel, 
how is it you did not pitch into this man?" He said, "Father, that 
man has the truth, and I shall not be found fighting against God." 
And I think, as I understand it, that he was the second man bap-

tized in Wales. He devoted ten years of the best of his life from 
the time he was 25 years old to 35 years old in preaching that 
gospel in his native land. He then came out here to Utah, under 
trying circumstances, and endured the common hardships incident 
to pioneer life in Utah, and then was called from the Great Taber- 
nacle without previous notice and sent back to his native land, and 
after a year and a half of service, laid down his bones in that land 
for the gospel's sake. 

My mother, a girl of twenty years of age, never met my father 
until they were on the sea. She left the home of her father and 
mother, who were dear and good people, because her heart had 
been touched with that divine message, and went out into a world 
among strangers, knowing not where she was going, except that 
the voice had called and she had heeded it, "Come out of Babylon ; 
the great Babylon is falling." When I think of these things, I won- 
der sometimes, my brothers and sisters, if we have been as true to 
them, if we have been as faithful to the trust and heritage com- 
mitted to our keeping as we should be, when they endured what 
they did in these trials and circumstances ! 

So I rejoice in this great latter-day work, and my mind reverted 
back to a passage of scripture when Brother Ballif was reading this 
great Sermon on the Mount, considered and accepted as among the 
greatest sermons ever delivered to humanity. The closing part of 
it came to my mind : When ye read these things, if you accept them 
not you will be as a man that built his house upon the sand, and 
when the winds blew and the rains descended and the floods came 
and beat upon that house, it fell, because it was builded upon the 
sand ; but those who hear these words of mine and do them, I 
will liken unto a man that built his house upon the rock, and 
when the winds blew and the rains descended and the floods came 
and beat upon that house, it fell not. Why? Because it was built 
upon a rock. I want to bear witness to this congregation here this 
morning that this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
builded upon the rock. And when the winds blow, as they have 
blown in the past, when the rains descend, as they have descended 
in the past, when floods come, as they have in the past, it will not 
fall, because it is founded upon a rock. All the persecution, driv- 
ings, scourges that have been put upon this people have left them 
standing firm, and unmoved from their mooring, because God is 
at the helm. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we should rejoice in this work. 
If there is one principle that has sunk into my soul and over which 
I rejoice, as much as any that has come into my life, it is because 
I am sure beyond the question of a doubt that men and women will 
be rewarded according to the deeds done in the body. If that is 
true, it should be an incentive to you and me, in every walk in 
life, to see to it that we shall give to the world, to our friends, to 
our Church, to our God, the best there is in us. That is the way 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it appeals to me. We might deceive our bishop, brethren and 
sisters, we may deceive his counselors, we may deceive our neigh- 
bors, but let me assure you that you cannot deceive God. The Lord 
has told us that we should* pay one-tenth of our interest annually 
into his storehouse, that the means may be provided for the Church 
that it may be carried on properly in conformity with the plan he 
has instituted to carry out his work. I wonder if we are doing it. 
If we are, then we are justified; if we are not doing it, we are not, 
for it is a most gracious and just law, the most equitable perhaps 
ever instituted in the world. If a man only earns $100 a year he is 
only required to pay $10; if he earns a thousand dollars, $100; 
$10,000, then a thousand. It is equitable, it is distributed properly 
and justly. And O, what a blessing it is that this system has come 
into our midst, that the Lord has revealed it anew in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, the law that was carried out anciently. You re- 
member what the Lord charged his people with when he said, "This 
whole people have robbed me." If they were robbing God then, if 
we are doing the same thing now, we are robbing him now. Do 
you want to rob him, my brethren and sisters? I take it that you 
don't. But sometimes we lack just a little faith. 

It seems now that the world is moving mighty rapidly; we 
must have automobiles, we must go to places of resort, we must 
dress in fine linen. That seems to be the rule, but I want to tell 
you and warn you now that there must be a curtailing in these 
things, that our hearts may turn to God and his purposes and his 
work in the world ; for we are the salt of the earth, and don't forget 
it, and on us rests the responsibility of preaching this gospel to the 
nations of the earth, that all people may be warned to repent and 
come unto the Lord. That is our mission. And then in addition to 
that we are expected to gather in the genealogy of our ancestry, 
that we may be bound back to father Adam, for they without us 
cannot be made perfect, nor we without them. This is our responsi- 
bility. Will we discharge it? Each one must answer for himself? 

May God help us to do it, my brethren and sisters, to see the 
light and then walk in it, for I bear witness that this is the work of 
the Lord. Joseph Smith was divinely called by the Father, and I 
have not any more doubt that the Father and Son appeared to 
Joseph Smith and that the Father instructed the Savior, and the 
Savior delivered the message to Joseph Smith, than I would have, 
had I heard it, because God has borne witness to me. You remem- 
ber in the case of Thomas, when the Savior was resurrected and 
Thomas would not believe, unless he could see the prints and 
thrust his hand into the wound, this is what the Savior said wheu 
Thomas did see him, "Come hither, Thomas, and put your fingers 
in the prints, thrust your hand into the wound." Then he said, 
"Blessed art thou, Thomas, for thou hast seen and believed ; but 
more blessed are those who have believed and not seen" — because 
of the witness and the divine impression of the Holy Ghost.

May God help us to do these things, my brethren and sisters, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ADAM S. BENNION 

Superintendent of Church Schools 

My dear brethren and sisters, I sincerely trust that the time I 
may occupy may be occupied under the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord. This is the first time that it has come to me to address 
a congregation in General Conference. I have sat through these 
conferences now for six years with a sort of safety, a safety akin to 
the security of the man who refused to take out any insurance be- 
cause, he said, he had never died yet. And then, as a thunderbolt 
out of the sky comes the call from the tabernacle to come over here 
to join with you. I trust that I may catch the spirit of this gather- 
ing, that the spirit which has prompted both Brother Ballif and 
Brother Evans may be mine, to join with you in the spirit of that 
wonderful sermon, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst 
after righteousness, for they shall be filled." I would that we might 
so hunger and thirst this hour and not be disappointed. 

My testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ grows with the 
years. It is stronger as I gain more experience. I am more grate- 
ful every day that I live that I belong to this Church. I find such 
evidence of its truth and its divinity that I am proud, though proud 
in humility, for my membership in it; and, like the brethren who 
have preceded me, I have been a member in it all of my life. I was 
born into it and therefore cannot claim the distinction that attaches 
to conversion, but the longer I am in it the more grateful I am for 
my membership. Very many times of late I have been running 
through my consciousness to discover the reasons for that grati- 
tude. The subject is altogether too big to be launched here in its 
entirety ; I find evidences at every turn, but there have been run- 
ning through my mind of late thoughts which go back to Califor- 
nia. As a matter of fact, they center in an experience that I had 
down in the University of California. The men on the faculty of 
the University of California used to make the observation fre- 
quently that in view of the fact that I had come from Utah perhaps 
I knew something about the Mormons, and when I said, yes, I was 
from Utah, and made the second revelation to them that I was also 
a Mormon, without an exception, when they heard that word they 
used to exclaim, "O — , O, you are a Mormon !" It has been ex- 
claimed so many times that it began to get into the center of my in- 
terest. Just last summer, as we climbed up Timpanogos, a visiting 
teacher, who was giving work in the Alpine summer school, took 
occasion to make an observation with reference to God and his con- 
cept of Him, and as he explained that his idea of God, of course, 
was an intangible sort of being, not a being at all, for that matter — 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a great universal force — he looked up and caught the expression, I 
suppose, on my face, and said, "O, I suppose I should not have 
said that to you, because you are a Mormon." As I thought of 
those "O's" so many times I decided that I would work out a 
little answer, and so now, when any of my friends say, "O, you are 
a Mormon?" I say, "O, yes, I am." And I am going to leave you, 
if I may enjoy the spirit of this gathering, a few of the O's which 
go into my little scheme of answer. 

I take it we have gathered this morning that we may think 
through anew the gospel plan, in order that we may build up our 
own testimonies. For want of a better scheme, I would like to 
hang a few ideas about this little scheme which I call the O's of 
Mormonism. 

The first O that makes me grateful for my membership in this 
Church is the O of Origin. A noted writer, who has produced one 
of the outstanding books in religious education in this country, says 
that he is not very much concerned about origins, that the origin 
of a church does not bother him ; he does not ask, "How did it get 
started?" but his test of a religion or church is, "What will it do for 
its members?" I grant you — and I hope to say something about 
that before I am through — I grant you that what a church does for 
its people really is a great test of a religion, but I am not prepared 
to go the full limit and sav that origins do not make any difference. 
I find that is not true ; this is a day of origins. I have been reading 
and rereading again that book by Dr. Wiggam, "The New Deca- 
logue of Science," and the whole foundation is a foundation of 
origins. He says that men and women become what they become 
essentially because of their birthright ; given a noble family, in all 
probability out of that parenthood you will have worthy children ; 
given inferior parenthood, and the chances are you will have in- 
ferior children ; it is all largely a matter of origins. He opens one 
of the chapters in that book with the famous declaration that this 
has become a wonderful country very largely because it had its 
origin in a foundation of wonderful people. He pays them the 
tribute to say that they shot Indians through the porthole with one 
eye but that they taught the Bible to their children with the other ; 
they lived on parched corn, it is true, but they preserved their 
parched learning, which centered in their idea of God. And Amer- 
ica has been builded as a great commonwealth because America had 
a great origin. Wherever I turn, I find that origins count tremend- 
ously. I have just had the good fortune to enjoy this same trip that 
Brother Ballif has described, and along the way I have been struck 
with the thought that along with other wonders, the water supply 
throughout the Northwest is a very great source of satisfaction. 
Their water supply is pure, because its origin is right. It arises in 
the mountains. Very many cities in this great country of ours have 
the problem of a water supply, because they lack that origin. It is 



ELDER ADAM S. BENNION 



47 



hard to improve upon the water that nature gives us. Origin ! we 
could spend the hour on origins. No breeder of animals but knows 
that he will produce the kind of stock that he breeds to. He knows 
that at every turn he will get in kind, and the kind of stock he 
raises will be determined by the origin of the stock. No man ever 
chooses a wife but he is tremendously impressed with the import- 
ance of origins. I cannot conceive of a man's going forward to say, 
"I have come to that time when I want a helpmate ; I do not care 
at all about origins; I will just find an available girl, and quite apart 
from her family history and all else I will choose her." I have dis- 
covered that men of discernment choose out of worthy families. I 
am grateful to the comment of a brother-in-law who gave this 
humorous but tremendously helpful hint — I wish I had the genius 
to pass it on to the boys — he said, if he could give advice to boys he 
would tell them when they came to pick a helpmate, to find a 
worthy mother, and take any one of the daughters they could get. 
He was impressed that there is a tremendous force in origins. And 
yet some of our good friends would say that in this most vital of 
concerns in life, religion, the thing that binds us here and here- 
after, which links up between time and eternity, it does not matter 
what the origin may be. I am glad to belong to a church that 
claims as its origin a revelation out of heaven announcing the voice 
of God Himself and His Son to declare His prophet, as was declared 
unto those of old. And that is the kind of origin I want my Church 
to claim. All Latter-day Saints may be grateful this morning that 
we belong to a church that has its origin in that divine pronounce- 
ment. The pronouncement was followed by others and with an 
ushering in of the power of the Priesthood and the giving of the 
keys of this last dispensation. Mormonism rises or falls upon that 
tremendous platform, that in its origin it goes back to God the 
Father and the Son. We could spend the morning on origins. I 
am simply throwing out a few hints for your more mature think- 
ing, when you shall have left this conference. 

Much has been said in the writings of this Church about our 
wonderful second O. I want to say only a word about it. The 
second O is the O of Organization. It was said a number of years 
ago that the two most perfect organizations in the world were the 
German army and the Mormon Church, and as I have said to my 
friends rather jocularly of late, "We knew what has happened to 
the German army ; I presume we have a pretty clear claim to the 
title." But I do not say it boastfully. This Church has a wonder- 
ful organization. It. is possible for a message to go forth from the 
President of this Church to all the stakes of Zion, out through the 
wards, and within a week there can be aroused the membership of 
more than half a million, to any word that shall be proclaimed. It 
was the pronouncement during all the time of the war, during the 
campaign of enlistment, in the raising of funds and supplies, that 
it was marvelous how this Church could respond. 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But I am not interested in that aspect of organization so much 
as I am in another. Not one of your speakers here this morning had 
announcement other than he may have picked up through the 
paper, and I suspect all of us were alike in not having yet read 
that issue, many of us being out at an early meeting long before this 
one was called. There are speaking at the sessions of this confer- 
ence men who have had no previous notification. That lies within 
the genius of our organization. It is a very wholesome thing. I 
sometimes wish it might be extended. Nobody can be feeling abso- 
lutely safe today, because it may be his good privilege to occupy 
this same position. Going back to that same California experi- 
ence : I took a good friend of mind down to our service at Oak- 
land, and when the service was over he inquired, "Is that the kind 
of service you have regularly?" I said, "In general, that is the 
plan." 

"Will that man speak next Sunday?" and I said, "No, he won't 
speak next Sunday." 

"Who will?" v 
"I don't know." 

"Well, who will sneak the next Sunday?" 
"I don't know." 

"Do you mean to tell me that you have men speak there who 
are not regularly appointed to do so?" I said, "Yes, that is the 
scheme." 

Then he made the observation — and I think he had not been 
particularly struck by what he had heard that evening — "Don't you 
think you would get better sermons if you had one man deliver 
them all and if you would let him prepare them carefully?" 

I said, "I have just one observation to make in answer to that : 
I presume you might get a more finished product, but I will ask 
you which would make the stronger church — to leave all the ser- 
mons to one man and let him prepare them carefully, or to have a 
church membership any man in which knows that on Sunday he 
may be called to fill that responsibility? I will leave it with you 
as a question, which will build greater strength on the part of the 
members of our Church, your plan or ours?" 

He said nothing, but the next day he came over to my desk and 
said, "I have been thinking over your question ever since you asked 
it last night, and you win ; yours will build a strength which cannot 
be built in the other plan." That is the genius of this organization. 
I am delighted when I think that there is no caste or class or family 
control in this organization. Nobody knows who shall be called 
next to responsibilities in wards, stakes, or general positions. The 
membership in this Church has in its own being the potentiality of 
its own leadership. Let me put it the other way, the strength of 
a democracy lies in the fact that its leadership is always inherent ; 
given great numbers, you have the chance for great leadership. It 
can come up from within. I say the second great O in this Church 



ELDER ADAM S. BENNION 



49 



is the O of Organization, and I am mighty happy in my member- 
ship in that organization. 

But, let me run on, because I should like to expose you for a 
minute or two to two other O's that you may think about them. The 
third O grows out of the second. It is very much like the second, 
except that it is a double-headed one. I have said very many times,' 
that it is as if it were a double link in a chain ; the two segments 
always go together. I know of no way of separating them, and I 
should not want to if I could. One of the very great things that 
attaches to this organization lies in the fact that that organization 
presumes obligation on the part of all of the membership of this 
Church. And then I am struck with the companion thought — a 
man never encounters an Obligation in his life but he finds in it his 
Opportunity. Up in the northwest recently a young man was called 
into a bishopric, and under the suddenness of that call he felt de- 
pressed. He said* "I doubt that I shall ever be able to respond 
under this obligation." It occurred to me that the obligation that 
was placed upon him as a new bishop in this Church was the oppor- 
tunity that opened the door to a great life for him. And at every 
turn in this Church I find that these two third O's go together. I 
call them the O's of Obligation-Opportunity. Nobody ever joined 
this Church because he anticipated having an easy time. I cannot 
imagine any one's coming into membership in this Church feeling 
that he was thereby opening the door of an easy access. The gospel 
of Jesus Christ, as taught by the Latter-day Saints, presumes obli- 
gation, and with it opportunity. From the time a boy is a deacon he 
is called to fill responsible positions, and from then on up until his 
declining years, he finds an office that is imposing obligation upon 
him. He is asked, and so are the women in this Church, to respond 
to calls, and no man living fully to his duty is free from obligation. 

There came into my office only within the last two weeks, a 
young man who had been called to go upon a mission to a foreign 
land. He came out of a familv that had not been well to do, and 
which had no funds to see him through the call. He had been work- 
ing for two years to lay by a little sum to go to college, and there 
had come the call to go on a mission. He said, "It is the biggest 
obligation that has ever come my way, and I am wondering just 
what I ought to do. I have a mind to go through college. I would 
like to complete my training. I have saved enough. Should I go 
on a mission? I would like your judgment." 

In the face of that obligation, calling for the expenditure of all 
that he had saved during two hard years of labor, that boy was 
willing to lay his all upon the altar. I am happv to announce to this 
congregation that he has left for his mission and will have spent all 
of his savings under that obligation before he returns, but I prom- 
ised him that that obligation will be an opportunity greater than he 
could get in any college in all the world. I say it as a school man, 
and I am as satisfied as I stand "here that there will come out of 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that obligation and his rising to it a blessing which will cause him 
to pronounce it not an obligation but a tremendous opportunity. 
And the Church at every turn offers them to you and to me. 

I see that I have run to within the margin of my time. I should 
like just to leave you with the fourth O of this little scheme, in 
order that you may run it through to your satisfaction. I must 
advert to the man I quoted in the beginning. After all, the test of 
a religion does lie in the kind of men and women it helps to make ; 
so that my last O, of necessity, is the O of Outcome, or Output, if 
you prefer it. I am very happy to have my Church judged by the 
kind of men and women it produces. I have said it many times, 
and I like to repeat it, it is a tremendous challenge : if I could not 
discuss the gospel with friends, I would ask them just to do two 
things : let them find a representative group of young men and 
women who have been taught the gospel and have formed their 
habits of life under its inspiration ; let them see that group of boys 
and girls as one side of the picture; and then let them find as 
they could in this audience this morning, men and women, silvered 
with years, who have spent their lives in the gospel, who have sub- 
scribed to its principles, who have loved and lived it ; and I am will- 
ing to leave those two groups as my evidence to the world that this 
gospel is the power of God unto salvation. 

I am happy, as I stand here, to know that this Church has pro- 
duced clean men and women. When our young men went up to 
Camp Lewis, through which place I have had the privilege to go 
within the last two weeks, fifteen hundred of them reported for ex- 
amination, and out of fifteen hundred only three gave any evidence 
whatever of social disease. I am proud to know that Utah ranked 
with three other states in this Union, the cleanest states morally 
that sent boys to the front. I am willing to be judged by the fruit 
of the tree. I am glad to know that we have one of the highest 
birth rates in the world today, 33 to the thousand. A high birth rate 
almost always carries with it a high death rate. Though we have a 
birth rate of 33, our death rate is only 7 to the thousand, one of the 
lowest in the world. I read that with pride when I read that 
Frances' death rate is 17 to the thousand, with an infant mortality 
of 96 to the thousand — almost one in 10 born to die within the first 
years of its career. I am glad to know that we lead Europe. I 
have quoted France — 17 to the thousand ; England follows, as I re- 
call, with 11.6. Our death rate, in spite of our high birth rate, is 
only 7 to the thousand. We have a divorce record of which any 
people in the world could be proud. We have been charged with 
immorality, with a lack of standard of virtue, and yet I am glad to 
proclaim to the world that with all of our membership, numbering 
beyond a half million, there have been within the past year only 
256 cases of divorce. I only regret them, but they constitute the 
barest fraction of a per cent of our total population. That kind of 
record cannot be held up to the world by a people whose lives have 



ELDER ADAM S. BENNION 



51 



not been based upon sound principles. I am happy to testify that 
judged by its fruit, the gospel of Jesus Christ has produced worthy 
men and women. 

I -just find in that a tremendous challenge to all of us. I wish 
we had the power so to live that men and women seeing us could 
come, as they have come on hundreds of occasions, to marvel at 
this work. May I close with the thought that was given me in 
California as I met people there who had been converted to our 
Church. I took occasion to ask them what it was that brought 
them into the Church. First of all, thev said, they became inter- 
ested in this gospel, because of the young men and young women 
who proclaimed its message. "Any church that will produce that 
type of men and women is a good enough church for me." God 
bless us with the strength to live this gospel, that wherever we go 
men and women will say of us that as members of that Church we 
are an Outcome that does honor to the Church. 

And so, my brethren and sisters, when my friends exclaim, "O, 
you are from Utah?" or "O, you are a 'Mormon'?" I say, ''O, yes, 
thank God that I am." And O that he would give us the power to 
live/to all of its possibilities, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

Assistant Church Historian 

I have been greatly interested in the remarks already made at 
this overflow meeting, and one thing that impressed me in the be- 
ginning was the singing of "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear." I also became very much interested in one of those O's that 
Brother Bennion spoke of — the Origin of Mormonism. 

It has been my privilege during the past two months to visit 
some of the so-called waste places of Zion, and adding these places 
to the list of those I have previously visited, I am now able to say 
that I am more or less acquainted with nearly all the places that 
have become sacred to the Latter-day Saints because of their con- 
nection with the early days of this Church. 

It was a pleasant task for me to visit Sharon, Windsor county, 
Vermont, where the Prophet Joseph Smith was born, and to then 
'follow in his wake to the western part of the State of New York 
and there to enter that sacred grove (a remnant of an extensive 
forest), where the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith 
and gave him certain instructions about not joining the sects of the 
day, but to wait for further revelation. I also visited the old Smith 
residence, or the very spot where the angel Moroni appeared to 
Joseph Smith on that memorable night between the 21st and 22d 
of September, 1825, and then followed the young Prophet, as it 
were, to the hill Cumorah, where I have stood a number of times 
looking at the place where the angel Moroni showed the Prophet 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Joseph where the plates containing an account of the old in- 
habitants of this land, were hidden, from which plates Joseph after- 
wards translated the Book of Mormon. 

Then on my last visit I had occasion to go down to the Susque- 
hanna River in Pennsylvania to visit old Harmony where the 
Prophet Joseph, after he had been driven by mobs from his parents' 
home, translated the Book of Mormon. The work of translation 
was done in the States of Pennsylvania and New York, but mostly 
in that part of the township of Harmony, which is now included in 
Oakland, Susquehanna county, Pennsylvania. I also had the privi- 
lege of visiting the place, or the vicinity, where John the Baptist 
appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on the 15th day of 
May, 1829, and ordained them to the holy Aaronic Priesthood, and 
again, to visit the vicinity where the Melchesidec Priesthood was 
restored and where the voice of Peter, James and John was heard 
in the wilderness on the banks of the Susquehanna River between 
Harmony, Pennsylvania, and Colesville, Broome county, New York. 

It was indeed a blessed privilege to me to stand upon these 
holy places, for such they are classed with me. I have also been 
permitted to enter the Kirtland Temple in the State of Ohio, and 
to stand in the very pulpit where the Savior himself appeared on 
the 3rd of April, 1836, and spoke to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
dery, telling them that he had accepted of the temple which had 
been built to his name by the Saints in the days of their poverty. 
It was in the same pulpit and on the same occasion that Moses 
appeared and restored the keys for the gathering of Israel from 
the lands of the north, the isles of the sea and from other places 
to which Israel was driven thousands of years ago. The giving of 
these keys to men in mortality meant the fulfillment of prophesy 
to the effect that God who scattered Israel will gather them again 
in the last days. The congregation of Saints in this building and 
the thousands and thousands of people congregated upon this 
Temple Block today, attending this General Conference of the 
Church, are here as a result of those keys given by Moses in the 
Kirtland temple on that memorable 3rd of April. On the same day, 
Elijah the prophet, who was taken up to heaven without tasting 
death, appeared to Joseph Smith and gave unto him the keys for 
turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of 
the children to their fathers. And as a result of the restoration of 
these keys we witness today the work going on in the Temple for 
the salvation of not only ourselves but for our ancestors who have 
passed away without a knowledge of the true plan of salvation. It 
has brought love into our hearts for our progenitors and we hope 
the children after us will do their duty in continuing this great 
vicarious work. 

The visits to the earth of these holy beings and the restora- 
tion of the keys of the Priesthood is the origin of "Mormonism," the 
beginning of it. It is a known fact that water never rises above its

source. All our mountain streams rise high up in the mountains 
and hills and they continue to run down grade, forming streams 
and rivers ; thus a creek or river does not rise above its source. So 
with "Mormonism" ; it must be traced to its source. The origin of 
Mormonism is revelation from heaven. God has spoken from his 
heavenly abode and restored unto the earth the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, with its Priesthood and authority. Based on such a begin- 
ning, we can boldly say that the doctrines taught by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are true and stand out in great 
contrast with doctrines taught by men. Joseph Smith was not per- 
mitted to "join the sects of the day because the preachers of these 
sects taught for doctrines the commandments of men ; they honored 
God with their lips, while their hearts wer-e far away from him; 
they had a form of goldiness, but denied the power thereof. But 
the Gospel which the Latter-day Saints advocate and which has 
brought such grand and glorious results is different. It has also 
brought into the world some of the best men and women that can 
be found anywhere on God's footstool. These indeed are the fruits 
of Mormonism, or the restored Gospel of Christ. If it had not been 
for the divine origin of Mormonism, and the truths revealed to us 
from heaven — not by the cunning craftiness of men but revealed by 
God himself — our success as a Church would have been altogether 
different. Christ himself revealed to the inhabitants of the earth in 
our day his own religion, and that is why we claim that we possess 
Christ's Christianity — not a German- Christianity, not an American 
Christianity, not an English or Dutch Christianity, but Christ's own 
Christianity, which in its nature is today similar to the doctrines 
advocated by the Savior in that grand and glorious Sermon on 
the Mount referred to by a former speaker. 

During my late sojourn in the East it was my privilege to 
travel over the Pioneer trial. I passed over it the first time fifty- 
nine years ago, as a little white-haired Danish boy traveling with 
ox teams, and to follow the same trail now and to see Chimney 
Rock and many other important and interesting points of interest 
made by heart rejoice and reminded me of the days of my youth. 
I was pleased to think that I, who in 1866, walked all the way from 
the Missouri River to Salt Lake City as a lad, now had the oppor- 
tunity to go over the same trail in an automobile as one of the 
Church historians, for the purpose of locating that trail so accu- 
rately that our children and all generations to come may know what 
is meant by the old "Mormon Trail," and to a certain extent be 
made to understand how their fathers and mothers, grandfathers 
and grandmothers, made sacrifices for the Gospel's sake. Many of 
these weary pilgrims rest in unknown graves. There is scarcely 
a mile between Nauvoo, Illinois, and Salt Lake City, Utah, which 
would not have been marked by graves of the Latter-day Saints 
who fell as martyrs by the wayside, if a knowledge of their resting 
places had been preserved.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



There have been several classes of martyrs in this Church. 
Those who have been put to death violently by mobs number about 
fifty, and those who have died in the missionary field, like Brother 
Abel Evans' father, number about four hundred ; these of the latter 
class sacrificed their lives while traveling in the different mission- 
ary fields preaching the gospel. And then more numerous than 
any other class of martyrs are those hundreds — yes, thousands — 
who died on the journey from Nauvoo to the west or later as emi- 
grants from Europe died on the voyage across the ocean, on the 
passage up the Mississippi and Missouri rivers ,and on the plains 
while trying to reach the homes of the Latter-day Saints in the 
Rocky mountains. 

I visited Nauvoo^beautiful Nauvoo as it once was — with its 
old "Mormon" cemetery. It made me think of Palestine which 
once was a land flowing with milk and honey, figuratively speaking, 
but the people in that country transgressed the laws, changed the 
ordinances, and broke the everlasting covenant, and brought the 
whole country under a curse. Thus, when I visited Palestine, many 
years ago, I could scarcely see anything interesting there except 
reminders of the good old times that once were but are no more. 
The curse of the Almighty has rested upon that land ever since 
the day of Isaiah, of which its present barrenness amply testifies, 
though some changes for the better may have taken place of late 
years since General Allenby of the British forces took possession of 
the country. 

When I saw Nauvoo, once a beautiful city, with a great temple 
costing a million dollars — a city that covered almost the whole of 
the peninsular on which it was built, I felt sad to witness its desola- 
tion. Between New Orleans and the twin cities (St. Paul and 
Minneapolis) there is not a more beautiful place for the location 
of a city than Nauvoo. But what is Nauvoo today? A wilderness! 
I crossed the great Mississippi river, from Montrose to Nauvoo 
(which in years gone by had been crossed by so many of our 
people). I wanted to see Nauvoo once more, though I had seen it 
before ; but on this, my last visit, I took occasion to visit certain 
places in and around Nauvoo that I never visited before. On my 
first approach to it, I wondered where the city was, for I wandered 
through the weed-covered streets, one after another, and only here 
and there saw a human habitation surrounded by weeds. On the 
banks of the river, where one of the old stone houses stood as early 
as 1839, I encountered thousands of vicious birds which swarmed 
around my head apparently with evil intent. And besides these 
there were millions and millions of flies — "Mormon" flies, they call 
them — though I think the "Mormons" had nothing to do with origi- 
nating them. The people from the surrounding country do not like 
to visit Nauvoo for fear of being eaten up by flies, ravens and other 
vicious birds which circle around the visitor where there was once 
a high grade of civilization. Nauvoo, the Beautiful, is now a little

insignificant village. I came to the conclusion that a curse had 
indeed rested upon the place ever since the Saints were driven from 
there by wicked, bloodthirsty mobs in the memorable year of 1846. 
Some of the best houses in Nauvoo today are those erected by our 
people eighty years ago, among them the old residences of Brigham 
Young, Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt, Orson 
Pratt, Edward Hunter, and a score of others. Only a few houses 
of any consequence have been erected since that time. The beauti- 
ful Nauvoo temple is no more ; not one stone is left upon another 
of that grand structure in which so many of the faithful Saints 
received their blessings before starting for the mountains. 

The "Jack 'Mormons'," who succeeded the Saints in Nauvoo 
came into possession of the city for almost nothing. The Icarians, 
a French community, came next and tried to turn the temple into 
an academy, but did not succeed. They split up almost entirely 
as an organized community while endeavoring to make Nauvoo 
their home. Then finally came a German population, the present 
inhabitants of Nauvoo. Germans are good pioneers, usually, and 
have made good in the United States ; they are generally classed 
among the best settlers and most industrious citizens who have 
come across the Atlantic to America, but even they cannot flourish 
in Nauvoo. The blood of the prophets which was shed there, and 
many others of the Saints who were mobbed and killed by their 
enemies is crying from the earth against their murderers and plun- 
derers. The Lord was vexed because of these evil deeds and has 
caused a blight to rest heavily upon the country. The same thing 
is true, more or less, of Far West, the country around Haun's Mill, 
and the Crooked river country, in Missouri, where the Latter-day 
Saints Once lived and prospered. 

In following the Pioneer trail from Nauvoo on the Mississippi 
river I visited Sugar Creek, where a number of women gave birth 
to children prematurely through being exposed to the inclemencies 
of the weather. Richardson's Point, where a number of our people 
lie buried. Chariton River, so well known to our people who 
crossed the plains in 1846 and following years, and Garden Grove, 
founded by the Saints in 1846, where many of our people lie buried 
in a "cow yard." This made my heart bleed. At Mt. Pisgah, Iowa, a 
monument has been, erected marking the graves of some 250 of our 
martyrs, who fell by the wayside through being driven away from 
Nauvoo in the dead of winter, these, exiles suffering as only few 
people have suffered in this western land. 

Continuing my journey I crossed the Missouri river to old 
Florence, or Winter-Quarters, Nebraska and there visited the old 
"Mormon" graveyard. What did I find there? A lonely spot where 
some six hundred Latter-day Saints lie buried under the sod — men, 
women and children, who could not stand the hardships of the 
journey any longer. Some of these martyrs were exiles from Nau- 
voo, while others had come up the Mississippi and Missouri rivers

from the European countries. They took sick and died with cholera 
and other diseases, brought about by over exertion and privitations, 
and their bones are resting in the cemetery at Florence to this day, 
waiting for that glorious resurrection which awaits God's faithful 
sons and daughters. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, the origin and foundation of 
"Mormonism" is of such a nature that we can safely build upon it. 
Let us then be true to our God and to the gospel of Christ, true to 
our parents, to the pioneers of Utah and to the faithful Saints who 
died by the wayside. Let us ever remember that the origin of 
"Mormonism" is revelation from God, and that it is not a temporary 
organization, but rather what the late Patriarch John R. Murdock 
of Beaver, once said, when he referred to "Mormonism" as "the 
greatest thing a-going." Let us be true to our fathers' God and to 
every truth that we have espoused, and let us realize that we have 
within our reach the obtaining of a testimony, if we do not already 
possess it, to the effect that God is the founder of this work, that 
it is organized in the right way, and that it is expected of us to 
become the salt of the earth and to be a light and an example to all 
the world. Christ, addressing his disciples on the Mount said, "Ye 
are the light of the world * * * Neither do men light a candle and 
put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto 
all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that 
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is 
in heaven." This passage of scripture is also applicable to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. May God bless you, one and all; may we be true to 
our God, who is our fathers' God, true to our religion which is true 
Christianity, and true to every obligation which we have taken upon 
ourselves, and may we also teach our children to walk in the paths 
of righteousness, I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may be able 
to crowd into the brief ten minutes left, some few of the thoughts 
that have been in my mind this morning. I have listened very at- 
tentively to all that has been said, and bear witness to its truthful- 
ness. I have been charmed by the beautiful singing of this session 
and particularly by this last rendition, and truly, my brethren and 
sisters, we might marvel and exclaim, "What manner of man was 
this that has wrought so much in the world and that we believe is 
to do so much in the future in shaping the destinies and bringing 
about the well-being and the salvation of our Father's children, even 
all that have ever lived upon this earth!" My thoughts have cen- 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

tered upon him and his great mission and the great faith that we 
should have in him. I will read to you from our Articles of Faith : 
"We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may 
be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. 
We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel 
are : first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. ..." I will leave you, 
my brethren and sisters, to follow out the quotations and read what 
the others are, but I wish to dwell particularly this morning upon 
our belief that underlying all in this Church stands first and fore- 
most faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It has been the 
moving power to all action -in all ages of the world. 

I would like to read to you here what Paul says in regard to 
faith: 

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things 
not seen. 

"For by it the elders obtained a good report. 

"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the 
word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which 
do appear. 

"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, 
by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his 
gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 

"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was 
not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he 
had this testimony, that he pleased Qod. 

"But without faith, it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to 
God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that dili- 
. gently seek him." 

I commend to your perusal, my brethren and sisters, Hebrews 
11 ; that shows to us to be a fact what I have asserted, that all the 
great and mighty works of the prophets and apostles and the great 
men of old were guided and were wrought by faith. By faith they 
knew of a surety their status before God, they were able to serve 
him, they were able to keep his commandments. By faith Daniel 
was able to live in harmony with the teachings of his Israelitish 
parentage even in Babylon and become a mighty factor in shaping 
the destinies of that great nation and of his own people. And 
Moses was guided by faith. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all 
the old worthies were guided by faith, and they did all they did by 
faith. It was by faith that Moses smote the Red Sea and its waters 
rolled back and the Children of Israel passed through dry-shod. It 
was by faith that they were not consumed by famine in the desert, 
but God sent them daily that which was necessary to sustain them 
and see them through their years of pilgrimage. 

Brethren and sisters, in this day reference has been made to 
the origin of this Church and its accomplishments and its priva- 
tions and sufferings and persecutions that have been heaped upon 
it. What has been the underlying factor to all this that has been 
done in this dispensation in which we live ? By faith Joseph Smith, 
a mere boy, was able to bring down to earth the revelations of 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Almighty God for the redemption of his people, for the establish- 
ment of righteousness. By faith he saw the Father and he saw the 
Son, and he learned and has proclaimed to the world that we are in 
very deed in the image of our Maker. By faith he learned his status 
before the Lord and received further revelation through the angel 
Moroni. By faith he learned of all the restoration that was to be 
and was the instrument by which it was consummated in the earth. 
By faith he found the record of the ancient people who inhabited 
this land, and by faith he translated it and brought forth a new wit- 
ness for God in this day and age in which we live. By faith he was 
able to establish the Church and perfect this wonderful organiza- 
tion of which has been spoken today. And by faith it has continued 
on down to the very moment of time in which we live. By faith 
he and his people were able to withstand the trials and persecu- 
tions heaped upon them, for they saw, over and above and beyond, 
Christ; and they knew ihe was a reality. They had faith in him as 
the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, through whom should 
be consummated the salvation of men here upon the earth. It was 
faith that made it possible for Joseph Smith to turn back and go to 
his certain martyrdom — for he knew where he was going; he said 
he was going like a lamb to the slaughter. But by faith he went 
and sealed his testimony with his blood. 

Bringing it down to the present day, my brethren and sisters, it 
is faith that is taking your boys into the world today to proclaim 
this same truth to the untold millions of our Father's children who 
are yet in darkness. It is by faith that the fathers and mothers 
sustain them with means to pursue their labors in the world. 

I marvel, my brethren and sisters, when we contemplate what 
a wonderful thing this faith is. The point I want to get to is this. 
We are living in a day and age and hour when all the powers of 
the adversary are combining to destroy faith in the hearts of men. 
Within the churches and without the churches, every device and 
every means that can be brought to bear is being brought to bear 
to destroy faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ, and from the pulpits 
of the world men who profess to be Christian ministers are doubt- 
ing and boohooing the belief that Jesus Christ was in very deed the 
Son of God. They are endeavoring by all means to discredit his 
origin as the Son of our Almighty Father. And faith is being at- 
tacked from every standpoint — by immortality, by dishonesty, by 
unchastity — the young people, one after another, are coming to a 
point in many instances where they are face to face with the issue, 
"Is there anything in this or not?" And their faith is being assailed, 
their faith is being attacked. 

There were some O's referred to here today, and the last par- 
ticularly struck my attention, "Opportunity and obligation" that 
rests upon us today in Israel. O my brethren and sisters, let us by 
every means within our power kindle, if needs be, and if it is there, 
keep alive, the faith of our young men and women. Do not let it 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



59 



be destroyed ; do not let it be overcome by any sort of teaching 
which may be going around today. Have in your family circles 
prayer daily together, that they may witness the exercise of faith 
in prayer, that the blessings of the Lord may be upon your house- 
holds. Teach your children the simple principles of the gospel as 
they have been received through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
for in nothing else is there safety in the world today. O my 
brethren and sisters, what the steering gear is to the automobile 
today, is faith in the life of young men and women. We are going 
at a headlong pitch. And did it ever occur to you what happens 
to an automobile when the steering gear is broken or defective and 
ceases to operate? Always, with that irresponsible speed with 
which the machine flies, it goes on to certain destruction. Did any 
of you, my brethren and sisters, ever lie in a trough of the sea, in a 
little vessel, with both rudder and sail gone? I have, for six hours, 
when the waves were slopping over everywhere. And I have 
thought that what the rudder or sail was to that little vessel — that 
would have saved us, and did ultimately when we got them into 
operation — so would be faith in Jesus Christ in the life of every 
young man. Did any young man, boy of yours or otherwise, ever 
come to you and show you with the look in his eye and the anguish 
in his soul, when he came asking, "Is there anything to this or not?" 
and you saw that somebody in some insidious, dastardly way had 
trifled with, and partly destroyed the faith in that young man's 
life? If you ever did, my brethren, you saw an object of pity, an 
object of sorrow, and it has been my good fortune and good pleas- 
ure to assist to kindle again and keep alive the faith in many young 
men, that has seemed to have been lost. And in many of them their 
faith has been attacked in associations here at home. I have been 
through sorrows in my life; I have laid parents, brothers and 
sisters and children away, and only God knows how I have loved 
them ! I wonder sometimes if I love more intently than some peo- 
ple. It seems that my love for them makes me suffer, and the more 
I suffer the more I love them. I would rather they would all go 
and I could lay them away, with faith in God, than to have one of 
them become the richest man or the greatest ruler or the greatest in- 
tellectual man but without faith ; for without faith he is without 
anchor, and without faith he has nothing to keep him in the path 
of duty, that makes for happiness, not only in the great hereafter, 
but makes for happiness and well-being here in this life in which 
we live. So that now then, when faith is being attacked in all sects 
and denominations and through all the schools, through the teach- 
ings of dubious science, science that after all is only a theory ; hold 
to the faith that our fathers have cherished, I say, hold to the faith 
in Jesus Christ that is the foundation rock upon which we can 
surely build for a salvation in our Father's kingdom! The Lord 
help you to do so, the Lord bless the youth of Zion and keep them 
in the faith of their fathers, and keep us all, that we may work out

our salvation in his presence, is my humble prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 
Benediction, Elder Arthur F. Barnes, of Salt Lake City. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, Sunday 
afternoon, at 2 o'clock, October 4. Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, of 
the First Council of Seventy and President of the California mission, 
presided. 

The singing was directed by Professor George H. Durham of the 
L. D. S. University, Salt Lake City. Elder Frank W. Asper, officiated 
as organist. 

The male chorus of the L. D. S. University sang, "God bless our 
mountain home," after which the chorus and congregation sang, "We 
thank thee, O God, for a prophet." , 

Prayer was offered by Elder William C. Parkinson, former presi- 
dent of Hyrum stake. 

The L. D. S. University mixed chorus sang, "Still, still, with thee, 
my God." 

ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD 

President of the Logan Temple 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, this afternoon 
in being asked to address you in this gathering. I sincerely ask 
that you may give me your faith and prayers, that I may enjoy the 
Spirit of the Lord while attempting to address you. 

One of our Articles of Faith reads, "We believe all that God 
has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and we believe that he 
will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the 
Kingdom of God." This principle of continued revelation is one of 
the prominent characteristics of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. It is distinctive, for while there are many good 
Christian people in the world who put great confidence and faith 
in the Scriptures, as they have been given to us in the Bible, yet 
a large proportion of them deny that God has communicated with 
his people since the days of the Saints of which the Bible speaks, 
and believe that there are none now who receive revelations from 
God the eternal Father, but that revelation has ceased and that we 
have all that is sufficient for our guidance in life contained in the 
Scriptures as they are bound in this volume called the Holy Bible. 
Is it any wonder, my brethren and sisters, that those who reject 
continued revelation should find among the many honest Christian 
people in the world such differing views concerning God and his 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD 



61 



will concerning us ? As we study the condition of Christian people 
today and note the differing views as expressed by their leading 
men, men who claim to be the teachers of the word of God to the 
people, noting the contention that exists, the widely varying views 
regarding God and his will, is it any wonder, I say, when they by 
their own free will and choice deny that God can speak to them 
today and that he has authorized servants to speak in the name of 
God and give his word concerning these things of which I have 
spoken ? 

Wherever the spirit of revelation exists there will be harmony, 
peace, and contentment, but where there is no revelation from God 
and where people will not accept revelation from God, you will find 
discord, discontent, and contention. One of the peculiar things 
that has been manifested in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, from the beginning up to the present time, has been 
the unanimity in which the people find themselves. It is seldom 
that you find anyone contending concerning the doctrine of the 
Church. It is seldom that you find anyone who is disobedient to 
the authority of the Church. The people are noted as being a united 
people. In fact, a great many people outside of the Church have 
rather felt to find fault with the "Mormon" people, as they call 
them, because of the unity that exists among them. They com- 
plained for the reason that the people were always willing to follow 
their leaders and to do as they were told. Rather a strange indict- 
ment to be brought against the people of God ! And what is the 
secret of the unity of the people, my brothers and sisters? It is that 
they are actuated by the spirit of revelation, through its President 
and those who are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, but 
the membership of the Church is entitled to revelation also. The 
members as individual members are not entitled to revelation for 
the Church as an organized body, but the same spirit of revelation 
may be enjoyed by them for their own use, for their own blessing, 
and for their own support. Every man who stands at the head of 
a household in the Church of Jesus Christ is entitled to revelation 
for that family: — not for somebody else's family. Every member of 
the Church is entitled to revelation for his or her guidance, though 
not for the guidance of any one else. Every bishop is entitled to 
revelation for the direction of the affairs of the ward over which he 
presides, and so forth ; every person according to his position ; but 
there is not a member of the Church who is not entitled to the 
principle of revelation, and upon that principle does the strength 
of this Church stand, and so long as we continue to live in such a 
way as to receive revelation, my brethren and sisters, there never 
will be discord or disunity, because if was upon this very principle 
that the Lord founded his Church. 

Let a man stand up here before you and teach a false doctrine, 
something that is not true, something that is in opposition to the 
revealed word of God, and there is not one in the congregation but 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



may detect it, if he or she is in possession of the Spirit of God, and 
the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of revelation. Occa- 
sionally someone will say something — not very often ; very seldom 
have I heard any one from the stand speak anything that was not 
perfectly orthodox, but occasionally there has been something a 
little of what we might call a little off-color, and immediately you 
would see everybody pretty nearly in the congregation looking 
toward one another. They can detect it in a moment. Why? Be- 
cause they have the spirit of revelation and they can detect error, 
and they cannot be deceived in doctrine. 

Now, how may we have this spirit of revelation, my brethren 
and sisters? We may have it as a right by the possession of the 
Holy Ghost. And how may we receive the Holy Ghost? By first 
having faith in God and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the gospel of 
the Lord as he has revealed it unto us : repentance of our sins, 
being baptized in water for the remission of sins, and receiving the 
laying on of hands by one having authority for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. And this Holy Ghost is the power and the means by which 
we may have constant revelation. 

There are some people, indeed there are a great many, in the 
world, who will not accept anything as a truth except it can be dem- 
onstrated to them through the five senses. It has to be proved to 
them by the wisdom and the skill of men, and if that cannot be 
done, they reject it. We are taught in the Scriptures that no man 
can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost. Is it 
any wonder that we find the condition existing in the world today, 
when they will not accept the plan of salvation as laid down by the 
Savior himself ? On the day of Pentecost, when Peter, preaching 
to the vast throngs, declared unto them the gospel, and the condi- 
tion in which the people found themselves at that time, convicted 
them in their hearts and they cried out, "Men and brethren, what 
shall we do to be saved?" They were told directly what they should 
do. They all believed or they would not have been convicted in 
their hearts, but as the next thing, "Repent of your sins, and be bap- 
tized for the remission of sins," and then they would receive the 
Holy Ghost. It is essential, my brethren and my sisters, that we 
shall have the Holy Ghost as our companion in order that we 
shall not be deceived and misdirected and that we may always know 
the truth from error. A thorough Latter-day Saint does not require 
some truth that God has revealed to be demonstrated by the skill 
and wisdom of men. He does not have to have it proved ; he knows 
it. And how does he know it? By the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Upon one occasion Jesus, in talking to those around him, said, 
"Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?" "O, some say this 
and some say that; some say that you are John the Baptist risen 
from the dead, or one of the old prophets come again." "But who 
say ye that I am?" What was the answer? "Thou art Christ, the 
Son of the living God." There was no hesitancy in that answer ; it 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD 



63 



was positive and to the point. "Thou art Christ, the Son of the 
living God," said Peter, in answering. "Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but 
my Father who is in heaven. And I say unto thee, That thou art 
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. ' r Now, you know 
there has been a great deal of contention as to what was meant by 
that. There is a large body that believes that it meant that the 
church was built upon Peter, but that was not it at all. It was 
that spirit of revelation that came from God to Peter, that made 
him say without any hesitancy, "Thou art Christ, the son of the 
living God." That is the rock upon which the Church is built. It is 
upon that assurance, that testimony, that witness, that spirit of 
revelation that comes from God directly to the individual. And 
that is the rock upon which this Church is built, my brethren and 
sisters, and I want to say to you that the testimonies of our brethren 
and sisters that are given in our fast meetings give evidence of the 
truthfulness of that statement, for the reason that that testimony, 
though it comes not through the teachings and wisdom and knowl- 
edge of men nor the scientific learning of the world, comes unadul- 
terated as the mind and will of God to the conviction of the person 
bearing testimony, and they rise up and say, "I know that this is 
the work of God, that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, and 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God." Now, that is a knowl- 
edge that never can be transferred from one man to another by 
that man's wisdom or knowledge; it can only come as the knowl- 
edge came to Peter, that Jesus Christ was the Son of God. 

We have as a people absolutely no fear of any discovery of 
scientific men. Men, under the inspiration of God, are beginning 
to find out little by little something that God has known for ages, 
but God may and does reveal truths that men have not vet under- 
stood. And simply because we or men cannot understand them is 
no justification why they should be rejected. Latter-day Saints 
under the spirit of revelation, may know whether Jesus Christ is 
verily the Son of God or not. No man can prove it that I know of 
by any of his learning or anything that he has found out. Unless 
we have faith in God, we cannot please him. Without faith it is 
impossible to please God. We must exercise faith, and the prin- 
ciple of faith, in and of itself, is a thing that is difficult for some 
men who have been scientifically trained; because they have been 
taught to accept nothing as a truth except it can be demonstrated 
by the wisdom and learning and skill of men. Above all of this, 
my brethren and sisters, is that blessing, that gift, that is one of the 
fundamental doctrines of the Church, the reception of the Holy 
Ghost that comes through obedience to the laws and the ordinances 
of the gospel ; and as long as the Latter-day Saints shall be in pos- 
session of that gift, we need have no fear as to what the outcome of 
this Church shall be. And when men in the world, who claim to 
be Christians, will honestly accept of the gospel of our Lord and 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Savior Jesus Christ and submit to the ordinances of the gospel that 
the Lord himself has prescribed, they, too, may receive the Holy 
Ghost and then they may know and will know of the doctrine, 
whether it is true or not — and not until then. There have been 
some men, and probably women, converted, or at least becoming 
members of the Church simply because of the logic there was in it, 
because of the splendid evidences that are manifested by the people 
in their lives and in their homes. Some are attracted to it because 
of the wonderful government that exists in the Church, or because 
of its teachings regarding things pertaining to every-day life, be- 
cause of the law of health that is taught by the Church, and for 
other reasons, all good. But the only reason, and the only thing 
that will keep any man or woman in the Church of Jesus Christ is 
to be in possession of the Spirit of God or the Holy Ghost, through 
obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. 

May the Lord help us, my brethren and sisters, to remain 
humble and faithful and true, and not be disturbed by what this 
man may say or what that man may say, or what this man may 
deny or what he may reject. Let us not want to prove that what 
God has said is true by comparing it with that which has been dis- 
covered by men. That is getting the cart before the horse. But 
let us have faith in God that what he has said is true, so that we 
can be able to say that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, and 
that he did shed his blood that all might come back unto our Father 
in heaven, that we do know that this work is true and that Joseph 
Smith was a' prophet of God, not because of any reasoning or any 
proofs that men by their wisdom and judgment may give us, but 
because the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, bears witness to us in 
our souls that it is true, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ford Leonard, then sang a selection. 

ELDER JOHN P. LILLYWHITE 

Recently President of the Netherlands Mission 

I am very happy to be associated with you here this afternoon 
and to be in attendance at this conference. I feel tremendously 
the responsibility resting upon one who is called to occupy this 
position, to bear testimony of the truth and to give evidence ofc 
the faith that we have in the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I rejoice 
in the gospel and in the many blessings that I have received 
through the same and pray God that the few words that I may 
utter this afternoon may be directed through his Spirit to the good 
of all those gathered here. 

The throngs that have come into the buildings on these 
grounds today and that are on the outside bear witness to me of 



ELDER JOHN P. LILLY WHITE 



65 



faith of the Latter-day Saints in the divine mission of the boy who 
knelt in the grove in Palmyra. I say these multitudes stand as a 
powerful witness and a beautiful tribute to "the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah," the man who spoke with God our eternal 
Father and with his son Jesus Christ in holy vision. The brethren 
and sisters who have come from near and far to be present during 
the sessions of this conference have come with a faith in the 
divinity of "Mormonism," a faith in the divine mission of the Son 
of God and the Prophet Joseph Smith. Otherwise you and I prob- 
ably would not have come here to Salt Lake and been in attend- 
ance at these meetings. Our presence here is an evidence and a 
witness unto the world that the labors and the lives and the faith 
of the early leaders of this Church and the Saints, that faith that 
impelled them to make the march across the parching plains and 
over these rugged mountains into these valleys, that subdued the 
wilderness and made the desert as it were to blossom as a rose, has 
not been in vain ; that they did not live in vain, but that their ex- 
ample, their faith has come down to us ; and we witness to them 
and to all the world by our presence on these occasions that we 
are determined to carry on the work which they began, until the 
last son and daughter of God redeemable has been redeemed. The 
gospel of Jesus Christ is beautiful in every detail to the man and 
the woman who is willing to live it and keep the commandments 
that God has given us. There is no peace nor comfort nor cheer 
nor gladness that can come unto the souls of men from any other 
source, so great as that experienced through the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. To have a witness, a testimony of the truth, to know that 
God lives, to know that Jesus Christ was indeed his Son, and to 
know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, called to open the 
work of this last dispensation, is greater, more glorious, than to be 
in possession of all the riches and wealth of the world. 

This gospel, this marvelous work and a wonder, that the Lord 
said was about to come to pass, is exemplified and fulfilled in the 
thousands who come here to receive the word of God from his 
living oracles in the Church today. The Master, on one occasion 
when he was preaching to the Jews and many of them had be- 
lieved in his words and accepted the truth by reason of the miracles 
which he performed among them, said to those who believed in 
him, "If ye continue in my word, ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall make you free." And the Jews wondered what he 
meant, and said, "We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bond- 
age to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?" Then 
the Master answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever 
committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not 
in the house forever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son there- 
fore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." That is the 
message to the world today. This gospel message that is carried 
to the nations by the elders of this Church is to the believing of the 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world, those who profess to believe in the word of God. After it 
is explained to them and they accept it, they are told in the words 
of the Master, if they continue in this work, the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, faithfully keeping his commandments, observing the laws 
and ordinances, they shall know for themselves if the doctrine be 
true. Yea, "you shall know the truth," is the promise, "and the 
truth will make you free." And that is the freedom that the Latter- 
day Saints enjoy today. It is not the freedom of riches, of wealth, 
it is the freedom of the truth, knowing that God lives, that Jesus 
Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, knowing that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, has made them free, free in 
the expression of the hope and the faith that they have in their 
existence here and hereafter. It is that freedom that is expressed 
in the lives of the missionaries, the young boys that are sent into 
the nations. They are not very far advanced in the gospel, not 
with a great knowledge of the principles of life and salvation, yet 
by their living, by the truth of the message which they are sent to 
bear to the nations, by abiding in the Word of God, they have 
learned the truth, and the truth has made them free, and they 
stand up in the meetings or on the street corners, whenever an 
opportunity presents itself, and declare unto the world that God 
lives, a personal being, that Jesus lives, a personal being, each 
separate one from the other, yet united in the things of God per- 
taining to the salvation of the children of men. They declare that 
they know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that the 
gospel called "Mormonism" is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the plan 
of life and salvation, given to the children of men. 

The world cannot bear that testimony. Then men and the 
women who have not accepted the word of God and who do not 
abide in the word of God cannot bear that testimony and say that 
Jesus is the Christ, with knowledge and with conviction. That be- 
longs to the men and the women who have followed him in the 
path of the regeneration, who have been born anew in the kingdom 
of God and have received the Holy Ghost to lead them unto all 
truth, to make things known unto them, the things of God and the 
vital things of life; for that is the mission of the Holy Ghost. And 
as we were told this afternoon by President Shepherd, every man 
and every woman born into this Church through the waters of 
baptism has conferred upon them the gift of the Holy Ghost by 
men who are in authority to administer this ordinance ; and if they 
are faithful, if their repentance has been genuine and sincere and 
they seek God in the humility of their hearts, they have a right to 
the gift of the Holy Ghost ; and that gift is knowledge, intelligence, 
revelation ; for he will take of the Father and of the Son and give it 
unto you, leading you unto all truth. That was the promise of the 
Master. So we are right when we say, if we know it, and feel it, 
and have received the gift of revelation, we know that God lives and 
that Jesus Christ is indeed his Son, the Redeemer of the world. 



ELDER JOHN P. LILLY WHITE

I was thinking, during the remarks of President Grant this 
morning and of President Shepherd this afternoon, how many 
people are there in the world not of the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints who would stand up and say, if the Master appeared unto 
them or if he came and presented the question as he did to Peter, 
unto the apostles, "Who do men say that I am?" — how many would 
declare as Peter declared, "Thou art Jesus Christ, the Son of the 
living God"? I tell you, there are not many in the world who be- 
lieve in that doctrine. There are not many men and women out- 
side of the Latter-day Saints who will declare with conviction that 
they know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. They doubt it. 
Many of the men who are called to preach the doctrine of the 
Master deny his divinity and attribute to him another origin aside 
from his heavenly siredom. The Latter-day Saints, one and all, 
the thousands that gather upon such occasions as this, if the ques- 
tion were put to them and they were asked if they knew and could 
declare "with conviction that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living 
God, that our eternal Father in heaven, indeed, is his Father, and 
that he was born of the virgin Mary — every man and woman al- 
most without exception would answer in the affirmative that they 
know it, because they have received the truth and have abided in 
the truth, and the truth has made them free. 

So I glory in the gospel of the Master, its message to. the 
world. This message is to every nation, kindred, tongue, and peo- 
ple, that they must repent and turn to the Lord, keeping his com- 
mandments, obeying his laws, if they will have peace and escape 
the judgments which God has decreed shall be poured out upon 
those who forget God and forsake his ways. I pray that we shall 
ever be humble and prayerful, seeking constantly the guidance of 
the Spirit of the Lord in all our undertakings, in our everyday life, 
that our acts will be circumspect, that our lives will be clean before 
God and man, that the lives we live will speak more eloquently of 
the gospel which we have embraced than any words that we have 
power to utter. That this may be our desire, I pray through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 

Assistant Church Historian 

I feel keenly, my brethren and sisters, the position that I am 
called to occupy, and most humbly ask for an interest in your 
faith and prayers, that the few words that I may speak this after- 
noon may be spoken under the influence of the Holy Spirit. I am 
proud that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I am proud of my father and my mother and the teach- 
ings that they have given me in my youth, and I do hope and trust 
that these teachings, which I know to be true, may always be 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



uppermost in my life, because I realize that by obedience unto 
them I shall gain eternal life. 

When Brother Shepherd spoke to us concerning the faith of 
our fathers, I was proud, too, my brethren and sisters, that my 
' grandparents on my mother's side were pioneers in this valley, that 
they came here in 1849, and helped to subdue the wilderness, that 
they were among the early settlers of Lehi and helped to build that 
place; that later my grandfather was one of those who helped to 
build up Sanpete County and became the president of the Sanpete 
Stake of Zion. I rejoice that my father was a pioneer of this state, 
that he came in the early days and helped to build up this won- 
derful commonwealth. I rejoice in the faith that he always ex- 
hibited, in the Church of Jesus Christ, of the knowledge that he had 
that this Church taught the gospel, which is the power of God unto 
salvation. I rejoice, too, in the faith that my mother has always 
exhibited, with other mothers in the Church, in sacrificing the as- 
sociation of her husband, the pleasure and friendship of her 
sons, by helping them go upon missions whenever they have 
been called by the Lord, our God. It is a sweet memory to me that 
faith has been planted in my heart by my parents for I realize that 
men and women grow old and cannot be with us forever. Our 
fathers and our mothers cannot always be here to guide us, but 
the truth, the gospel, that Brother Lillywhite has mentioned can 
be our guide, can make us free, and obedience to it will lead us 
back into the presence of our Father in heaven. 

The mothers of this Church, in the early days, sacrificed greatly 
for the advancement of this Church and of God's work. Many a 
time when the leaders of the Church have been called upon to go 
forth in the world to present the gospel of life and salvation unto 
the nations, these mothers have been left behind sick and with 
little children, some of them even in bed with a newly born babe, 
my own mother being one of these ; but they never said not to go, 
when their husbands were called to go forth for the work of the 
Lord. Men went forth in the early days preaching the gospel of 
Jesus Christ without purse and without scrip, working their way 
by their own hands from Nauvoo to New York, or to whatever 
field they were called to labor, chopping wood, in fact, doing any- 
thing they could, to get a few cents on the way to pay their fare. 
They never. hesitated when God called them. They never said no, 
it mattered not what the circumstances were, under which they 
were placed. I do not believe that that faith is dead, I believe that 
today the faith of the Latter-day Saints is still that of sacrifice, 
that they will give of their time, that they will go forth and do God's 
bidding. I appeal to the young men and the young women here 
this afternoon to do what they are asked by the bishops of their 
wards. You cannot expect to gain a reward unless you do the thing 
that is required of you. You never saw a steam engine run with- 
out steam; luke-warm water will not turn the wheels. Neither 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 69 

/ 

will luke-warmness in the Church of God bring to you that joy, that 
happiness that is ours if we will work. We must love the work of 
God. 

The story is told of the great violinist, Ole Bull, that he loved 
his violin so well that he took it to bed with him, always had it with 
him. That love was repaid when he became one of the great 
masters of that instrument. So our love for the gospel of Jesus 
Christ should be taken with us always, that whenever we are called 
we are ready to do and ready to go ; that we may be masters of the 
inclinations and passions that are in us as individuals, that we may 
control them and go forth, clean, sweet and pure, into the world to 
preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is not a missionary who 
goes out into the world but that the prayers of his mother and his 
father ascend to God that he may go forth in humility, be clean 
and keep himself unspotted from the sins of the world. The Lord 
has instituted a way for you and for me to keep ourselves clean, 
and that way is going to our Sacrament meetings, going to the 
house of God, partaking of the Sacrament, remembering Jesus 
Christ, who atoned for us that we might come back into his pres- 
ence. Go there faithfully and listen to the words of the men of God 
who are sent to give unto us the bread of life. If we do that we 
are prepared to meet the world, to meet sin, to know it and over- 
come it. 

This gospel which we have obeyed is the power of God unto 
salvation ; there is no doubt of that in my mind. I have often 
heard President McMurrin, in bearing his testimony to the people 
in the Tabernacle and in other places, say that he knows that the 
gospel is the power of God unto salvation ; I have that same testi- 
mony and I believe that every missionary who has been out in the 
world, who returns home and strives to do. the will of the Lord, 
will retain the wonderful blessings that are given to him in the 
testimony that he receives that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that this Church has in it the power of God unto salvation, 
this gospel that we believe and teach. 

We all look forward, the whole world I might say, to the com- 
ing again of Jesus Christ upon the earth. We look forward to that 
time when he shall rule and reign, and if he should come while we 
are living, my brethren and sisters, are we going to be prepared to 
meet him? 1 It is a question I ask myself, "Am I ready, so that I 
would be prepared to meet him, if he came?" We ought to take 
inventory of ourselves, especially we younger boys and girls in the 
Church of God, and find out if we are living according to his com- 
mandments. If not, we should then turn our lives in that straight 
and narrow way that will lead us unto God; for he is merciful, 
loves his children, and has given unto us that wonderful principle 
of repentance; that we may turn away from our sins, turn away 
from our evil ways, and gain, through the Lord's mercy a forgive- 
ness of our sins. True it is, that we must have first obeyed the 



. 70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

* 

ordinance of baptism for the remission of sins, by one having 
authority to perform that ordinance, in order that we may get into 
the kingdom of God. But the Lord loves his children, and has 
given us also, the principle of repentance, that we may turn unto 
him again, as he wants us all to come back. 

Brethren and sisters, the Lord could shake this world and 
bring you and me upon our knees mighty quick, if he desired our 
return to him in that way. But he does not. He loves us and 
wants us to have our own free agency; he has given this to us. 
Even before we came here he gave us our freedom of choice. We 
chose in heaven whether we would serve him or follow the one 
who would not obey God's commandments. So we have that free 
agency now. We may choose good or evil. God wants us to choose 
the good, because we are his children, and he desires that we may 
be saved in his kingdom. For that reason he has given us these 
laws and commandments known as the gospel which is the plan 
of life and salvation. Whenever God has had a message to deliver 
to the people of this earth he has always sent his prophets before 
him. When the cities of the plains were to be destroyed he sent 
his servants to preach unto them and call them to repentance. So 
in these days in which we live, God has again sent the gospel 
message forth as a warning unto all the world before the end shall 
come. There is a way and only one way of going back into his pres- 
ence, and that way, we testify to the world in all soberness, as 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ, has been opened by our 
• Father in heaven, through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, 
that boy who was called in his youth and who remained true to his 
testimony that he did see God and Jesus Christ, and that the Father 
spoke unto him, saying, "This is my beloved Son, hear him." The 
most glorious vision, I believe, that has ever been given in the his- 
tory of man is this vision of the Almighty God and his Son Jesus 
Christ shov/ing themselves to this boy, Joseph Smith. 

Later angels came unto him and brought the authority of the 
holy Priesthood of God ; because, my brethren and sisters, we know, 
if we will stop and think for one minute, that unless we have the 
proper authority, nothing can be done and be valid, whether it be 
in civil law or religious law. The Lord understood this and sent, 
to this Prophet, angels bearing the holy Priesthood of God. John 
the Baptist came on the 15th day of May in 1829, bringing the 
Aaronic Priesthood and bestowing it upon Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, giving unto them the right to baptize in the name of God 
for the remission of sins, giving unto them the keys of the pre- 
paratory gospel, also the right of visitation of angels. Some few 
weeks later, we do not know the exact date, Peter, James and John 
did come and give unto them the Melchizedek Priesthood, the 
power of God to act in his name in all the ordinances of life and 
salvation. In the Historian's Office we have, in the handwriting of 
Oliver Cowdery, the statement telling the story of John the Bap- 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 



71 



tist's coming, of \his ordaining them, and of Joseph and Oliver bap- 
tizing each other in turn after they had received the Aaronic Priest- 
hood ; and in his writing he states that Peter, James and John did 
come and confer upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood. There is 
the evidence, if. we need it, that the words of this man, this prophet 
whom we love and revere, are true. Other angels came bringing 
the keys of the different gospel dispensations — because this is the 
gospel dispensation of the fullness of times, in which all others 
shall be gathered together in one and shall be returned unto God 
by his Son in completeness. In order to do that there must be 
other keys given. Some of these keys were given on the third day 
of April, 1836, just one week after the dedication of the Kirtland 
temple, which dedication was witnessed by the people there that 
God approved of that temple. Even people of the city came and 
wondered what was going on at the dedication of this temple. 

On the third day of April, 1836, Oliver Cowdery and the 
Prophet Joseph Smith went into the temple to pray. As was their 
custom, when they needed light, whenever they wanted informa- 
tion, they went to God and asked him for it. They went into the 
temple on this day, and kneeling before the altar were asking God 
certain things pertaining to this kingdom, when a most glorious 
vision came unto them, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, appeared 
standing, as it were, upon a breastwork of gold directly over the 
altar, and he spoke unto them with a voice sounding as the rushing 
of great waters, saying: 

"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; 
I am your advocate with the Father. 

"Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; there- 
fore, lift up your heads and rejoice. 

"Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my 
people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name. 

"For behold I have accepted this house and my name shall be here; and 
I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house." 

A wonderful statement from the Redeemer of the world. After 
that glorious vision had passed then came Moses the prophet of 
God, holding the keys of the gathering of all the Tribes of Israel, 
and he gave those keys to these two men. After that vision had 
closed, then came Elias, a prophet who lived, we are told, in the 
days of Abraham. Then, when that vision had closed, came the 
marvelous vision of Elijah, the prophet of God, of whom Malachi 
spoke, saying, that he should come before the great and the dread- 
ful day of the Lord, who came giving unto these two men the keys 
of the sealing power, the keys of sealing the living and also the 
dead. 

It is a wonderful thing, that the Priesthood of God, and all its 
keys, have been restored to these two men and handed down, my 
brethren and sisters, by ordination according to the call and direc- 
tion of our Father in heaven. My testimony is to you that every 
man, Brigham Young, and all those who have succeeded Joseph 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Smith, have received, by the laying on of hands of those in author- 
ity, these keys, and that President Grant has them today — every 
key necessary to turn the lock that will open the door into the 
celestial kingdom of God, if we will but obey and keep the teachings 
of this man who was called of God directly by revelation unto the 
apostleship, and, I believe firmly, by revelation placed at the head 
of this Church, and I know holds the keys of this Priesthood. Oh, 
how we ought to rejoice, as young men and young women, that we 
may grow up under such a wonderful influence and realize by the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, who testifies of the Father and the Son, 
that these things are true. 

In all soberness I leave with you my humble testimony that I 
do know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith 
was and is a prophet of the living God, and that all the keys neces- 
sary for life and salvation are in this Church.. May it be our happy 
lot, my brethren and sisters, to gain eternal life, God's greatest 
blessing to man, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus, our Re- 
deemer. Amen. 

The L. D. S. University ladies' trio, composed of Sisters Nellie 
Priestley, Zella Benson, and Nellie Durham, sang, "Trust in God."

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 

President of Alberta Stake and Canadian Temple 

President of Alberta Stake and of the Canadian Temple 
I feel that the time remaining belongs to Brother McMurrin. 
I am sorry we cannot give him longer ; we all like to hear Presi- 
dent McMurrin bear his testimony and preach the gospel, which 
he has done ever since I can remember. 

Like the rest of you, I always feel it my duty to respond when- 
ever called upon. I have listened with interest to the testimony of 
the elders and the beautiful music rendered, and I rejoice also this 
morning in hearing the presiding authorities, as far as they spoke in 
the Tabernacle, especially when we were told by the First Presi- 
dency that each ward should furnish one missionary to go on a 
short-term mission — brethren with past experience. 

I come from Canada, as was mentioned by Brother McMurrin, 
the land of the north. I bring you glad tidings from some of the 
lost" Ten Tribes, and we are pleased to report everything in very 
good condition we think, in our three stakes in Canada ; and also 
that the temple work is progressing very favorably. We find the 
person who goes to the temple most regularly is the one who goes 
to the Sacramental meetings and pays his tithing more regularly 
than anybody else. So my advice is that we always take a little 
time to go to the temple and work for the dead as well as the living. 
As always, I was delighted to be in the company of Brother Shep- 
herd ; I have felt for years the spirit of temple work. 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 



Speaking of the missionary movement, I feel keenly the value 
of temple work and missionary work this afternoon. I do not be- 
lieve for a minute that the Church built the temple in the Hawaiian 
Islands only for the benefit of a few of the Sandwich Islanders. I 
have been on the Islands three times, also to the Samoan and Navi- 
gator Islands, and I love that people very much. I have heard 
President Smith say .he did not think that Utah and Idaho, or any 
of the North American colonies, or stakes, would ever be the per- 
manent dwelling place of the Polynesian Islanders. I know how he 
felt. When I heard that Brother Ballard was appointed to open up 
the South American mission, with Brother Rey L. Pratt of the 
Mexican mission, and President Rulon S. Wells, I thought then of 
the many times that I heard President Smith say we have got to 
do something for the benefit of the Polynesian Islanders, to prepare 
them for the future, without assisting them or encouraging them to 
emigrate to Utah. When I heard of the building of the temple, 
this is what I thought: I think I see the stopping place for the 
Polynesian Islanders, a place to prepare them for some future work. 
But just as soon as I heard of Brother Ballard's being called to 
Buenos Ayres, South America, I thought, there is my hope. I be- 
lieve firmly that the great hope and faith of the Latter-day Saints 
regarding the home of the ancient inhabitants of North and South 
America, the Lamanites and Nephites, will receive blessings on the 
Sandwich Islands, prepare the Samoan, the Maori, the Tahitian, 
the Hawaiian, and the Tongan in that temple to get ready for the 
opening up and the preaching of the gospel to their own country- 
men in South America. It is just a delightful thought to me to feel 
that way. 

In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord 
says : 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their in- 
iquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be 
revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them." 

In 1916 I was called to make my third trip to the Islands. The 
company, my old acquaintances and others were leaving Salt Lake. 
President Smith told me to be here at a certain time, that we might 
leave San Francisco on a certain boat. But I am a Canadian- 
British subject, although born in Salt Lake, and they never knew it. 
I did not tell them. Let me tell you what happened, through the 
power of faith and prayer. There are a good many young people 
here, and though I do not like to mention myself, I want, above 
all things, that the young people, our boys and girls, our future mis- 
sionaries, shall believe firmly in prayer. I was to leave at a cer- 
tain time. I had sent to Ottawa, the Washington of Canada, for 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



my passport, and it had not arrived in Cardston in time. We were 
fourteen miles north of the international boundary line. What 
should I do? The First Presidency requested that I be here at a 
certain time to report, to leave San Francisco at a certain time. 
Well, I told the Lord. Of course he knew it, but I always think, 
like any other father; he enjoys being told. If your children ever 
get anything they long for, they do not get it, generally, by asking 
just once or twice to show their parents they want it. It is not 
what we want but what we need. Our heavenly Father is willing 
to grant us, I believe, what we most need. I told the Lord I did 
not have my passport and I was to leave at a certain time. The 
Spirit said, just get ready and go. I did. I went to the boundary 
line, met the emigration officer, and he said, "How do you do, Mr. 
Wood? Where are you going?" "I am going to Salt Lake." 
"Where is your passport?" "I haven't any? "Why didn't you get 
it?" I said, "Ottawa did not get it here in time." He said, "All 
right, when you get it, send it to me." I came to Salt Lake. The 
passport was to be in Salt Lake by the time I was to leave, giving 
three days grace between the time I got here and the time I left. 
The first day it didn't come. I waited until the morning of the third 
day to be set apart. I did not tell President Smith or any of the 
presiding brethren that I did not have a passport. I was afraid 
they would say, "You had better wait and go on some other 
steamer." President Smith, when he set me apart, said, "Brother 
Wood, you will go with this company." When he said that a thrill 
went through my whole being. I did not have my passport. How 
could I go with the company? He said, "You will go with the 
company ; you will perform the mission for which you are sent, 
and .you will return in safety." So we got ready. They all thought 
I had my passport the same as the others. We arrived in San 
Francisco, where I would have to present my passport to get my 
ticket, and then again on the steamer. We went to get our tickets. 
The emigration officer was very busy. He said to me, "Mr. Wood, 
you are in charge of this little company ?" "Yes." "Sit down here 
and give me some assistance." I sat down and helped him take the 
passports from all the other passengers. We did not get through 
that day. Tomorrow came. We met early in the morning. "Mr. 
Wood, you were here yesterday. All right. You are a British sub- 
ject? Go right on board. Thank you very much. I have your 
passport." I thonght, "You haven't, but it is all right." 

I went on board the steamer . Two days out from San Fran- 
cisco the purser said, "Mr. Wood, better come in and give me your 
passport with those of the rest of the company." All right, I said. 
We went into the purser's office, got talking about the gospel, when 
he said, "Well, if all you have said is true, you do not need a pass- 
port to go to preach to the nations of the earth." He never asked 
me for it. I read him what I read to you. 

I thought then, I am on the steamer,' but it may be harder to 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD

get off at Samoa., where I was to land. Out of about four hundred 
passengers there would be only fifteen or twenty for Samoa. "What 
will I do to get off?" So I prayed with the company that was going 
to the Samoan Islands, just a few of the elders. I told the Lord we 
had gotten by the Canadian officials and the United States officer 
at San Francisco, "and now comes the most severe test of all, the 
immigration officer on the Samoan Islands, where there are only 
a few, nothing to take up his time." When the steamer came up to 
the wharf there were the natives with whom I had been acquainted 
years before, when four of us were pioneers, and then later the 
same good old faithful Latter-day Saints. One of our elders had a 
Samoan band, one of the finest bands in the Islands, which came 
to meet me, and here I was: I could not get off. Could not? I 
knew if they learned I did not have a passport I would either be de- 
ported or taken on to Australia. Samoa is 2,100 miles south of 
Honolulu, Australia is 2,000 miles away from Samoa. I would have 
to be taken to Australia if I could not present my passport, and here 
were the natives trying to reach my hand, delighted to think I had 
come back the third time to visit them again, and some were crying, 
so overcome with joy, as their love is very great indeed for the 
elders from Zion. They will give all they have to help a missionary. 
They were making way, so that I could come down and shake hands 
and rub noses with them. Wouldn't it be a disappointment if I 
could not get off ! So I told the Lord, "You have said, 'My mes- 
sengers will go to the four corners of the earth ;' here I am, no pass- 
port ; help me now." Well, we lined up. Here was one immigra- 
tion officer and there was another, and a lot of people in front of 
me. I did not know whether to come first, last, or where. So when 
we got right up to within the last man, the other immigration offi- 
cer said to the man he was examining, "You are an anarchist." The 
man with me jumped up and went oyer and sat down and they had 
a few moments talk, and I was praying. After he got through he 
was very much irritated, very much out of patience. He said, "Mr. 
Wood, I have your passport ; thanks very much ; go right on." 

Brothers and sisters, I know it pays to pray. Young folks, at- 
tend to vour Sacramental meetings, go to the temple, perform work 
for the living and the dead. God bless all Israel, wherever they 
may be, is my humble prayer and testimony in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California Mission 

It is almost time, my brothers and sisters, to bring this meet- 
ing to a close. I suppose there may have been some wonder in the 
minds of some of the people, especially those who heard the an- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



nouncement made in the morning session by President Heber J. 
Grant, regarding Dr. George H. Brimhall, who was named as one 
of the brethren who would speak in this meeting this afternoon. 
Dr. Brimhall had made a promise to attend the funeral services of 
a friend in Provo, and for that reason was excused from being in 
attendance at this meeting. 

I have very greatly rejoiced in the testimonies that have been 
borne by our brethren. I have had the thought in my mind, what a 
wonderful blessing it is to be associated with the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints when all of these marvelous things that 
have been spoken of have taken place, and the Lord our God, in his 
mercy and kindness and in keeping with the promises that he made 
to holy prophets in ancient times, has revealed anew the ever- 
lasting gospel and sent from his presence holy beings to clothe 
mortal men with power and authority to legally teach the things 
of the kingdom of heaven, and to legally administer sacred and holy 
ordinances that are essential to the salvation of the children of men. 
We should be a most grateful people. No other people are pos- 
sessed of such blessings as we enjoy. 

I hope that the testimony that has been borne, in relation to 
the virtue and power of prayer, may find lodgment in the hearts of 
the people, that not only young men and women may believe in 
this power, but that older men and women also may have the same 
belief, that they may understand and realize that God, our eternal 
Father, is a living, intelligent being, and that by means known only 
to him he is able to hear our humble petitions, and he has the power 
to bless us with the blessings that will be for our advantage. And 
I know that the Lord our God is hearing the prayers of his people. 
I sometimes think of what advertising would be done by some of 
the so-called healers in the state of California under like circum- 
stances ; for we have "healers" there, men and women who profess, 
through the power of prayer, to heal the sick, and they tell some 
very remarkable stories in relation to the healing that oftimes 
follows their ministry. And sometimes Latter-day Saints are dis- 
turbed because of hearing that somebody has received a blessing 
through prayer. I often think of the statement made to me by 
President Charles W. Penrose, when discussing this angle of the 
question, that there were healings taking place, and his answer 
was, "Well, what of it?" I was a little startled for the moment, 
but the more I have given thought to that answer the more sensible 
it appears to me. What of it? 

No healings that take place among the inhabitants of the earth, 
no matter who may be healed, take from us today the authority 
that was given by the sending of holy angels, that that authority 
might be conferred upon men. We have healings, marvelous heal- 
ings, from time to time, in the state of California. It might sur 
prise people, because generally when people think of California thev 
think of pleasure, not of religion, not of prayer ; and yet we have 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



77 



praying men and praying women in California, Latter-day Saints, 
who believe in the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
the power and virtue of the authority that has been restored. One 
of those men is Bishop Thomas, who formerly lived in Idaho Falls. 
He went as a patriarch, at the call of a sister who was afflicted, not 
long ago, and she commenced to tell him that she was going to one 
of the "healers," a woman that has attracted great attention in the 
city of Los Angeles, and she wanted a patriarchal blessing before 
she visited this woman. The patriarch did not feel like giving her 
a blessing, just at that time, but he taught her the doctrines of the 
gospel, told her of the promises that had been made by the Lord 
our God through the holy Priesthood, that if any were sick they 
were to call for the elders of the Chuch and anoint with oil, and 
the prayer of faith should save the sick. This woman had been 
bedridden for four years, but she commenced to grasp the import- 
ance of the teachings that were given her, and then she sought a 
blessing, in the way appointed of the Lord, at the hands of Bishop 
Thomas, she was blessed by the authority of the Priesthood, and 
the next morning, before Bishop Thomas left his home, there was a 
rap at his door, and when he opened the door the husband of this 
woman was standing there and said, "Come out, come out, and meet 
my wife ; she can walk." The woman that had not walked for four 
years was healed by the power of God. How such a thing would 
be heralded, if it had been brought about by one of these so-called 
"divine healers" ! It is not heralded so much in the Church of Jesus 
Christ. Those are incidents in connection with the Lords' work 
that are transpiring all the time, and they are treasured in the 
minds of the people but are never advertised to the world for gain. 

I myself not long ago went to the Los Angeles county hospital, 
and I looked upon a girl who, in my own judgment was dying, and 
the doctors said she was dying. They had telegraphed to Salt Lake 
City for her father and mother to come. The father works over 
here in the Bishop's building. And at the girl's request, as she 
gasped out word by word with what seemed to be her dying 
breath, for the healing ordinance, we administered to her, and when 
I left her, to go to the railway station a mile or two away, I thought, 
I wonder if that father and mother coming in on the train within a 
few minutes will be in time to see their beloved daughter alive. 
When we returned, the dying girl had been healed by the power of 
God — not raised up to health and strength instantaneously, but that 
dying power that had seized upon her had been banished away, 
that look of death was gone, and she was able to converse with 
father and mother and she also was healed by divine power in an- 
swer to prayer. 

I rejoice in this authority that God has restored to men upon 
the earth. I know its value, I know its truth. I thank God that 
the ears of my own parents were saluted with this gospel message 
in their native land, and that in the mysterious providences of God 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and by his power and by the operation of his Spirit, they were 
brought to understand and believe the message of the gospel, and 
that because of their faith and their belief and their travels from 
afar, they gave me birth in the land of Zion. I rejoice in it. I praise 
the name of God for my birthplace here, in this choice land, and I 
believe, with all my heart, that this is a choice land. I believe that 
when President Brigham Young made the announcement, as he 
looked over this valley, "This is the place," that he made a declara- 
tion of greater importance than he himself comprehended. And as 
time has gone on and development has taken place, we have 
learned something of the richness of the soil here in this barren 
American "desert" — no richer soil upon the face of the whole earth. 
We have learned something of the richness of these mountains, 
teeming with their precious wealth — mountains of iron and moun- 
tains of coal, and mountains of copper and many other precious 
minerals. We are just beginning to learn something of the marvel- 
ous scenery of this country, and people are being attracted to our 
beloved Utah. 

We are preparing a stereopticon lecture to deliver to the people 
in the California mission, and we will probably have the hardihood 
to give that lecture the title, "Utah, the Wonderland of America." 
Some such title is necessary to carry over to the minds of people the 
thought that we have in our own minds that this is a choice, a 
marvelous, a wonderful section. We purpose to show the scenic 
beauties of Zion Canyon and other wonders. We ought to praise 
God that through his mercy and by his power and the inspiration 
of his Spirit the feet of our fathers were planted here, and we ought 
to believe that "This is the place." 

God help us to so believe, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder F. F. Hintze, former 
president of the Turkish mission. 

THIRD OVERFLOW MEETING 

A third overflow meeting was held in Barratt Hall at 10:30 
a. m., Sunday, October 4. 

Elder John M. Knight, president of the Western States mis- 
sion, was in charge. 

The music was furnished by the Tenth ward choir under the 
direction of Norman Martin. 

The congregation sang, "Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah." 

Elder Charles S. Martin offered the invocation. 

The choir sang, "In our Redeemer's name." 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED

ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

President io/ the North Central States Mission 

The Lord has been very good to the children of men ever since 
man's advent upon the earth. In the very beginning the Lord sent 
an angel to Adam and gave his instructions concerning the plan of 
redemption. He later talked to Noah and Moses and Isaiah and 
Jeremiah and gave them instructions to give the people with refer- 
ence to their conduct in the earth. Last of all he sent his Son Jesus 
Christ into the world not only to give the plan of redemption but 
to give us an example of a perfect life. 

The children of men from the very beginning have shown a 
disposition to disregard the teachings that the Lord has given 
them. They stoned the prophets and imprisoned those who be- 
lieved in them, and when Christ, the Master, the Son of God, 
made his appearance they rebuked him as they had the prophets 
who preceded him and put him to an open death. But not until he 
had established his work among men and commissioned his apostles 
to go forth and make proclamation of the messages which he had 
entrusted them with. Every one of these apostles suffered an ig- 
nominous death. Not one of them was allowed to die in his own 
home surrounded by his family and friends. The same blood- 
thirsty desires which put Jesus Christ, the Master, to death were 
still lingering in the souls of men and they were not content as 
long as there remained an apostle or prophet in the earth. Not 
only the leaders, but the followers themselves were hounded and 
prosecuted and put to death, until there was not a representative of 
the Lord Jesus Christ left among men. The Bible came to be the 
only surviving witness that Jesus was the Christ, and the time 
finally came in the history of the world when even the Bible and 
its teachings were confused, and men who professed to be teachers 
of the doctrine of Christ began to doubt the divinity of his mission, 
and when this time arrived infidelity and unbelief began to spread 
more abundantly in the earth. 

The Lord saw fit in his wisdom and mercy to the children of 
men to bring forth another witness to substantiate the teachings 
of the holy Bible, for unknown to the world there was another 
witness which the Lord in his own due time was to bring forth, 
which was to testify that Jesus was the Christ and bear witness of 
his work which had been instituted on the western continent, for in 
the lonely Hill of Cumorah for fourteen hundred years this mute 
witness had been waiting the command of God when it should 
come forth to bear witness in connection with the Bible that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the plan of redemption which 
he instituted was the same today that it had been in all ages of the 
world. When this witness came out the whole world declared 
against it, that it was not divine, but the Lord gave evidence to a 
few or his servants by the power of the Holy Ghost that this record 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was true, and since the world was in such a deplorable condition 
spiritually, this witness came forth at a very opportune time. 

Joseph Smith, who was the instrument in the hands of God in 
introducing the Book of Mormon, had received while yet in his boy- 
hood, one of the most glorious and wonderful visions ever given to 
mortal man. He had looked into the face of the Lord and his Son 
Jesus Christ, and had heard from them their message in unmistak- 
able words that the world was wrong, that they had changed the 
ordinances and broken the everlasting covenants, and that the Lord 
had seen fit not only to bring forth this witness of which we have 
spoken, but to reveal to the Prophet Joseph Smith the gospel in 
its fullness with all its primitive power and its beauty, with every 
officer, doctrine, and ordinance which had been promulgated by 
Christ and his apostles, again revealed to the earth with the power 
of the holy Priesthood to officiate in these ordinances for the re- 
demption and exaltation of God's children. 

It is the mission of the Latter-day Saints to make proclamation 
to the world of the things that the Lord has done in our day and 
generation, for the Lord desires that we should make known to the 
world that he has spoken and raised up an ensign unto the nations, 
and that his servants were to go forth with all the earnestness, 
power and zeal of their souls, to declare to the people of this genera- 
tion that the Book of Mormon is a divine witness and that it bears 
record that Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, visited the Amer- 
ican continent after his cricifixion and resurrection, and estab- 
lished among the residents of the. western world the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ ; and that he effected his organization among 
them with apostles, prophets pastors and teachers just as he had 
done among the Jews. 

As missionaries and elders of the Church, we are bearing wit- 
ness of these things to the inhabitants of the earth, and declaring to 
them with all the sincerity and seriousness of our souls that these 
things are true. 

Many people believe that "Mormonism" doesn't bring anything 
of importance to the inhabitants of the earth, but those of us who 
have become acquainted with its teachings, are convinced more and 
more that we stand in the same relationship to the world that the 
Apostle Paul occupied when he went on to Mars Hill and saw the 
inscription "To the unknown God" and said to the people on that 
occasion : "You are altogether too superstitious, for whom you 
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you." The elders and mis- 
sionaries of this Church are in the world to tell the people of this 
generation that they are altogether too superstitious and that they 
have an unknown God whom they are ignorantly worshiping, and 
him we are declaring unto this generation, for be it remembered 
that the angel whom John saw fly through the midst of heaven 
was carrying the Everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell 
on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue and 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 



people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, 
for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made 
heaven, and earth, and the sea and the fountains of water. 

The God of heaven who made the seas and the fountains of 
water was a personal God that we are declaring unto the inhabi- 
tants of the earth, a personal God who speaks to man, not two 
thousand years ago, but now, and we are bearing witness with all 
the power of our souls that God has raised up a prophet in this day 
and age who has the power and the authority to say to this genera- 
tion, "Thus saith the Lord." Not two thousands years ago, but 
today to this particular generation, this is our message. This is our 
witness and we rejoice before the Lord that we are privileged to 
engage in his ministry to prune the vineyard for the last time, pre- 
paratory for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

President of the Northwestern, States Mission 

Dear Brethren and Sisters : It is a great pleasure to know that 
the great congregations which fill the buildings provided for our annual 
and semi-annual conferences, are being supplied with the necessary 
spiritual food to enable them to live their lives as our heavenly Father 
desires. 

The world needs the gospel of Jesus Christ, because of the almost 
hopeless condition of human spiritual thought. The world lacks the 
idealism the gospel furnishes, in that it does not know the objects of 
earthly life. If 'men knew their destiny, the object of their creation, 
and God's purposes concerning them, they would not drift to the 
extremes of folly and crime which are everywhere so apparent. The 
"Mormon" people are blessed with knowledge of what God intends in 
giving us mortality. Men flounder in the mazes of human understand- 
ing attempting to solve the problems of life from "human basis" of 
understanding. To attempt to explain why we are here from purely 
human sources of information is impossible, and unless we include God 
and what he has taught us, through the revelations of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, it is impossible for us to comprehend life or its possibilities. 

The theology of the world has involved men in such a maze of 
incomprehensibility that no consistent conclusions are possible. Many 
cannot reconcile the teachings of Christianity, either with the scripture 
or with common-sense, because of the inconsistency of its professed 
teachers. 

It is a great thing to have the assurance that we had a place and 
being with our Father before we came to earth ; to know that we had 
a spirit life and companionship and understanding, and that our experi- 
ences and attainments opened for us the possibilities and experiences we 
are enjoying in mortality; to know that through the birth into mortality 
and the uniting of the spirit and the body we can attain to what God 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



has destined respecting our future; that through the acceptance and 
faithfulness to the gospel we can reach higher stages of development 
and that eternal progress lies before us, if we shall comply with what 
the Almighty has taught and demands of us in the observance of the 
principles of revealed religion. If men could be convinced of the pos- 
sibilities of eternal development and progress, and that attainment is not 
limited to mortality, there would be a greater striving among men to 
lead better lives, to accomplish more good, to attain to higher develop- 
ment, than they are now striving for, through a lack of the knowledge 
of the gospel. 

Men of the world do not appreciate the truth because they do not 
know it. If they knew that every wrong done had to be righted ; if 
they knew that every obligation contracted had to be discharged; if 
they knew that they would be literally judged according to their records, 
there would be much greater care exercised in their conduct in life. The 
Latter-day Saints, through the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
know what life means. How they may eternally progress; how they 
may acquire an ever-widening field of intelligence until in time they 
shall possess capability to assume positions of power, that are now incon- 
ceivable to them. If men knew their chosen lines of endeavor, that 
they could eternally continue to progress, it would furnish them an 
incentive to labor in intelligent righteousness. Philosophers and scien- 
tists, if they knew that their work could be extended into the eternities, 
and they become masters of information that would give them incon- 
ceivable power, they would accept the gospel and would live it right- 
eously and rigorously because of their great desire for progressive 
development. It is given us to know these things and we, therefore, 
are a highly blessed people. 

Compared with the idealism of "Mormonism," there is nothing in 
literature or science that reaches the wonderful possibilities of that which 
God has supplied in giving us a knowledge of the truth. Men can 
only be brought to a comprehension of these marvelous truths by accept- 
ing the gospel of Jesus Christ. How necessary it is, then, that through 
diligent preparation, we should fit ourselves to make adequate appeal to 
men of high intellectual understanding. For that reason we encourage 
in our community the highest standards of education, and it is for that 
reason that, as missionaries, we are continually striving ior higher 
and higher planes of intellectual as well as spiritual power. Men are 
saved only as fast as they get knowledge, which means that they can only 
have that to which they are entitled, and as we develop or educate our 
bodies through observance of the laws of life, so will those bodies be 
prepared to go into the degree of power and glory that we have edu- 
cated or developed ourselves to fill. There is no limit to human achieve- 
ment, so it follows that there will be none to eternal achievement. 

God help us to understand, my brethren and sisters, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A girls' chorus sang: "Lift thine eyes." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

ELDER CHAS. A. CALLIS 

President of the South'ern States Mission 

I pray that I may be led by the Spirit of the Lord in the re- 
marks that I shall make so that they may be edifying and faith 
promoting. The fatness of the fields in these peaceful vales, the 
abundant crops with which God has blessed the people, ought to fill 
our hearts to overflowing with gratitude to the Giver of every good 
and precious gift. 

As I have looked over these fruitful fields I have thought of 
the words of the Savior in which he described the growth of the 
crops, leading up to the harvest. The Master says : "For the earth 
bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first, the blade ; then the ear, after 
that the full corn in the ear." (Mark 4:28.) Truly we are rejoicing 
in the "full corn in the ear." 

Faith, sacrifice and obedience must precede blessings. We are 
told in the Book of Mormon that we receive no reward until after 
the trial of our faith. This great lesson the Savior teaches in John 
12:24. He says: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of 
wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone ; but if it die, it 
bringeth forth much fruit." 

If the farmers had been content to let their golden corn and 
wheat remain securely stored in the granaries there would not have 
been these bounteous crops to sustain life. The husbandmen with 
faith and sacrifice took the wheat, corn and other seeds, planted 
them in the ground, watched for the blade, cultivated it when it ap- 
peared, until it developed into the "full corn in the ear." God gives 
the increase. ! 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown 
great in service and sacrifice. This Church will always be a mis- 
sionary church, and its glorious work will be performed in a spirit 
of service and sacrifice. Sacrifice will bring forth the blessings of 
heaven. 

The Lord, of course, in the verse which I have quoted was 
foreshadowing his own death and the eternal blessings his atone- 
ment and resurrection would place within the reach of mankind. 
Because he lives, we also shall live. Though he was rich, yet for 
our sakes he became poor, and we, through his poverty, as the 
Apostle Paul says, have become eternally rich. The fruits of the 
death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ are holy and glorious. 

We should not accept the blessings of God, the harvests of the 
fields, as a matter of course. They are gifts from the Creator. In 
the Doctrine and Covenants, Sections 59:21, we read, "And in noth- 
ing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, 
save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his 
commandments." The Lord is willing for us to enjoy the good 
things of this life in moderation and wisdom ; provided we receive

them "from the hand of the Lord with a thankful heart in all 
things." 

Even in affliction it is well to acknowledge his hand. "Before 
I was afflicted," the Psalmist David said, "I went astray ; but now 
have I kept thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted ; 
that I might learn thy statutes. The law of thy mouth is better 
unto me than thousands of gold and silver." (Psalms 119:67, 71, 
72.) 

Sins unrepented of bring a penalty ; for God will bring every 
work into judgment. An ancient prophet said: "Rejoice, O young 
man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy 
youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine 
eyes : but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee 
into judgment." (Eccl. 11 :9.) They who sow their wild oats shall 
reap a harvest of trouble. "For whatsoever a man soweth that 
shall he also reap." He that soweth the wind shall reap the whirl- 
wind. 

Forgiveness, like repentance, is not always obtained for the 
asking. Sins cannot go unpunished. Repentance, without the of- 
fender making all the restitution that it is in the power of his hand 
to make, is as dead as faith without works. 

We are told in holy writ that Satan provoked David to number 
Israel. It was the "time that kings go out to battle." God was 
displeased. He sent his prophet to David. "So Gad came to David 
and said unto him. Thus saith the Lord, choose thee, either three 
years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, 
* * * or else three days the sword of the Lord, even pestilence 
in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the 
coasts of Israel. * * * And David said unto Gad, I am in a 
great strait ; let me fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for very 
great are his mercies ; but let me not fall into the hand of man. So 
the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel." (I Chronicles 21.) Let us 
take these lessons to heart for they were written for our admoni- 
tion. Before the day of trouble comes let us make the Lord of 
hosts our friend. Don't wait until judgments come before repent- 
ing. Now is the time to repent. 

A great deal of the South has been afflicted with a severe 
drouth this summer. Fields "are desolate and bare. Brimming 
rivers have dwindled to small streams. The governor of Georgia 
issued a proclamation to the people of that state in which he called 
on them to "humble themselves, acknowledge their sins, and make 
supplication for relief from present distressing conditions." Simi- 
lar proclamations were issued by the governors of South Carolina 
and Virginia. It would not be long before the beautiful southland 
would be transformed into a land of desolation if the heavens did 
not give showers to satisfy the thirsty soil. 

The Lord, in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 101, says of 
those people who in the days of prosperity were slow to hearken 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALL1S

unto him : "In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my 
counsel ; but in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after 
me. 

The mission of the Church is to fill the earth with the knowl- 
edge of the Lord. We are divinely commissioned to perform this 
mission. In the doing of this duty there is peace and joy that 
passeth all understanding. The Lord is with us. Without him 
we are nothing. We know and testify that Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 

I pray that we will keep foremost in our lives and affections 
our mission on earth, and that our precious testimony will fill our 
souls, our whole beings, with a constant, broad and a glowing light, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

President of the W estern States Mission 

The splendid discourses delivered this morning have been a 
real inspiration to me. I hope they have made a deep impression 
upon your souls. We need the gospel of repentance preached at 
home as well as abroad. I believe the home to be the place where 
our children should be taught the things they should know with 
respect to virtue, honesty, temperance, truthfulness, etc. I fear 
there is a false modesty existing between many fathers and their 
sons, likewise between mothers and daughters, and our young 
people often get the wrong impressions of life from their associates 
instead of being told the things they ought to know by their 
parents. 

I appreciate the splendid auxiliary organizations we have in 
the Church, and the wonderful influence they are having upon the 
lives of our young men and women in creating within them faith 
in God and inspiring them with a testimony of the gospel and the 
divine mission of Jesus Christ. All these things are fine, but 
parents, too, have a great responsibility. 

I have faith in the youth of Zion, I believe in them. No finer 
or cleaner men and women can be found anywhere than those who 
come into the mission field. I count it a blessed privilege to be as- 
sociated with them. Without exception they are developing into 
splendid representatives of the Church capable of giving a reason 
for the hope that is within them. 

While the religious world is being split wide open over the 
most fundamental doctrines of Christian faith, while churches are 
divided and pastors forced to resign because of their modernistic 
views, and the intellectuals are ridiculing religion, calling it super- 
stition, good enough to hold the ignorant in check, our mission- 
aries are going right ahead preaching the gospel of repentance, and 
contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints. There is no 
schism, no controversy, no difference of opinion with respect to the 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



saving ordinances of the gospel, to be found in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am frequently asked why we do not 
center our efforts on the heathen in Africa, and other foreign coun- 
tries, rather than here in Christian America! Some feel we have 
no right to proselyte among members of other churches. My 
answer has been that our message is to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people, and is as much needed in this country as any- 
where in the world. We have a message for all people if they will 
but receive it. We have no apology to offer for our presence in the 
world. God has again spoken from the heavens and established 
his work in the earth; we are his representatives and the gospel we 
preach is the power of God unto salvation. 

In the World's Work for Feb., 1924, W. P. Merrill makes this 
statement : 

"It is time we were facing the question: What right has a denomina- 
tion to exist? It is plain truth that no organization of men or women has 
a right to call itself a Christian church which is not built on Christ's line. 
* * * * If Christ did not found the Church and lay down its lines, it has no 
divine authority. If he did, then to change those lines to alter conditions, 
to demand what he did not demand, to insist on that which he ignored is 
indefensible." 

We are glad to face the question, because we are built upon 
Christ's lines. He is the author of our faith, the founder of our 
Church, and is the chief corner stone upon which it is built. We are 
demanding only that which he demanded : implicit obedience to the 
ordinances of the gospel, and we teach that every doctrine and prin • 
ciple advocated and taught by Christ and his apostles is part of the 
great plan of salvation. We affirm that we have divine authority to 
teach the gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof. We 
declare that holy angels have been sent from the very presence of 
the Christ to restore the holy Priesthood, and to commission men 
with authority to organize the Church of Jesus Christ upon the 
earth. We identify the angels, Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, 
James, John, Moses, Elias, Elijah; we state when they came, where 
they came to, and what they said and did. We affirm that we have 
the same kind of an organization that existed in the primitive 
Church, with apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, 
elders, seventies, high priests, bishops, priests, teachers, and dea- 
cons ; that they are in the work for the perfecting of the Saints, the 
work of the ministry and the edifying of the body of Christ, and that 
they will continue in the Church until there is unity of faith in the 
world. We invite the most searching investigation of our claims, 
and go so far as to declare if men and women will make that in- 
vestigation, with a sincere desire to know the truth, God will mani- 
fest it unto them by the power of his Spirit. Furthermore, we are 
making no compromise ; we are not altering conditions or changing 
gospel ordinances. 

Recently I was in Grand Island, Nebraska. A convention of 
one of the great Protestant churches, for that district, was in ses- 
sion. Baptism was being discussed. One of those present said, 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



87 



"Baptism when properly administered, is a beautiful and inspira- 
tional sight, that is why we are reluctant about giving it up." Think 
of it! Not because it is a commandment from God, not because it 
is the door into the fold of Christ, not because it is the only ordi- 
nance through which we may receive a remission of sins, not be- 
cause it is an outward sign of an inward grace, the answering of a 
good conscience toward God, but because it is a beautiful and in- 
spirational sight. Such trifling with sacred things can have but 
one effect ; the destroying of faith in religion as a means of salva- 
tion. I am grateful to belong to a Church which states its position 
in very definite, concrete terms upon all these matters that are so 
vital to the Christian faith. 

I testify to you that I know God lives, that Jesus Christ is the 
very Son of God, and the Redeemer of the world, that Joseph Smith 
was and is a Prophet of the living God ; that what is known to the 
world today as "Mormonism" is the gospel of Christ; which is the 
power of God unto salvation. I pray that we may have a broad 
vision of our responsibilities, that we may give loyal and willing 
service to the cause which is so dear to our hearts, that we may 
all be saved in our Fathers' kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

At the close the choir sang, "Hosannah." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder F. F. Hintze. 

FOURTH OVERFLOW MEETING 

A fourth overflow meeting was held in Barratt Hall, Sunday, 
October 4, at 2 o'clock p. m. 

Elder David A. Smith of the Presiding Bishopric presided. 

Music was furnished by the Tenth ward choir under the direc- 
tion of Norman Martin. 

The choir sang, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

Elder John L. Anderson, of the Granite Stake Y. M. M. I. A., 
offered the opening prayer. 

The choir sang, "Rouse, ye mortals." 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I desire, my brothers and sisters, that my remarks may be 
directed by the Spirit of God, and that I may be led to say that 
which the Lord would have me say here today. I have enjoyed 
the spirit of this conference very much and was much impressed 
with the remarks of President Grant in his sermon this morning, 
and was led to conclude that it is always safe to refer to the word

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Lord in preaching the gospel. It is more necessary than it 
has ever been, it appears to me, that the Latter-day Saints should 
familiarize themselves with the revelations of God to his people 
in this day, when doubt and theory are everywhere present, leading 
so many of the children of men away from God. 

Solomon said, "Where there is no vision, the people perish" 
(Proverbs 29:18), and had it not been for revelation from our 
Father in heaven to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the entire world 
would be perishing in unbelief, and the correct form of worship 
would not be known in the earth, neither would there be the cer- 
tain knowledge that God lives. Thousands of our young people 
throughout the land today are being taught the Darwinian theory, 
and many of them are accepting it as a fact, and not as a theory, 
which it is. The Latter-day Saints believe in the evolution tend- 
ing to progress, but not according to the theory that is being so 
prominently placed before the young people of our country in the 
schools of today. 

There is a- lack of faith in God among the children of men, and 
men are trying in their own wisdom to account for the creation of 
the world and the creation of the human family. How much better 
it is to believe in the gospel of Christ, our Lord, as recorded in the 
Bible, in the Book of Mormon, in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
in the Pearl of Great Price. Light and peace and joy come through 
the study of the holy scriptures. To believe that we are the chil- 
dren of God, and that we are made in his image, is elevating and 
inspiring, while to believe that we have descended from some lower 
form of life has no such result. All people take a natural pride in 
feeling that they have been born of goodly parents, that they come 
through an honorable line of ancestry. Associated with that, to 
feel and to know that God is truly our Father, and that we are made 
in his image, brings true happiness. But were it not for the fact 
that God revealed himself to the Prophet Joseph Smith in this 
dispensation, a true knowledge of God could not be found in the 
earth. If the men who are moulding the lives of our young people 
throughout this great land would give more time to the study of the 
holy scriptures, they would gain more true knowledge of the origin 
and purpose of life than they ever will gain from the study of rocks 
and fossils, and the minds of our young people would receive an 
inspiration that would lead them to live better lives. The Honor- 
able William Jennings Bryan said that men should be more in- 
terested in the "Rock of Ages than in the ages of rocks," and I 
heartily agree with him. 

No man can obtain a knowledge that God lives, that he made 
man in his image, and that he has revealed himself in this dispensa- 
tion to men in the earth, except he places himself in a condition to 
receive the impression of the holy Spirit of God, which leads to 
him ; and no man can find God except he walks in the paths which 
God, our heavenly Father, has ordained. 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



89 



Joseph Smith testified to the world that he had seen God the 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ, and that they are tangible beings, 
for he saw with his own eyes that he was made in their image. He 
bore testimony to the world that an angel of God delivered unto 
him the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, 
and that the truths contained in that book were given unto him to 
be distributed in all the world, as a witness that the God of heaven 
has truly revealed himself to men in this dispensation. We have 
also the testimony of the three witnesses to the Book of Mormon, 
that an angel of God appeared to them, and brought and laid before 
their eyes the plates from which the Book of Mormon was trans- 
lated. In addition to that, eight witnesses saw the plates, and they 
also bore testimony of the fact to the world. Is not the testimony 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith and these eleven witnesses worthy 
of consideration ? Is it not more reasonable for us to conclude that 
it is true than it is for us to believe in the unproven theories of men 
who have tried to solve the problem of life in their own way and 
have failed? 

In my judgment it is wrong to teach the youth of this great 
nation such theories as would lead them to conclude that we are 
not truly the children of God, made in his image, as men have 
testified who have seen God, both in this generation and in the 
generations of the past. Is it not more reasonable to believe that 
God made man in his image than it is to believe that we have come 
up from the lower forms of life ? Is it not more reasonable to be- 
lieve that this world was made by Jesus Christ our Lord, under the 
direction of God the eternal Father, and that Jesus made the world 
before he was tabernacled in a body of flesh and bones, as the 
Scriptures testify? Is it not reasonable to believe that God fore- 
ordained prophets, as we read in Jeremiah, first chapter, and that 
we were in an ante-mortal state able to act and to perform works 
. under the direction of our eternal Father — the Father of our spirits 
— who gave us bodies in the beginning, and that our parentage goes 
back to that eternal Sire who governs and controls the destinies of 
men, according to their obedience to law? 

I prefer to believe the things that God has revealed to me, by 
the power of the Holy Ghost, rather than to believe the theories of 
men who have not that witness. I prefer to believe that God our 
Father did not leave his sons and daughters here on the earth with- 
out a true witness that he is our Father, and that we have been 
given this earthly existence, with its duties and experiences, to 
prove ourselves whether we are worthy to be exalted and glorified 
with his faithful sons and daughters or whether we are not, for if we 
prove ourselves worthy we can return unto him, and if we do not 
prove ourselves worthy we cannot return unto him. 

I never saw Joseph Smith, nor any of the eleven witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon ; but I have received a witness from God, 
through the power of the Holy Ghost, that our heavenly Father and 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his Son Jesus Christ did appear to the Prophet Joseph, that the men 
who have testified concerning the Book of Mormon have told the 
truth, and that the work we are engaged in is truly the work of God. 
Through this witness I know that I am his son, and that he is my 
eternal Father, and that neither my body nor any part of it has 
come from any other form of life than the life that now produces 
humankind. Our Father's decrees are unalterable, and so are his 
plans concerning the destiny of the human family. Men may seek 
by every means conceivable to disprove the truth as God has re- 
vealed it to his servants in ancient as well as in modern times ; but 
the time will come, and I bear witness of it, that they will be 
weighed in the balance and found wanting. May we cherish the 
truth, as God has revealed it again in these latter days, for the salva- 
tion of the children of men, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I appreciate the privilege of meeting with you good people in 
the conference meeting, at Barratt Hall. I am sure that there is 
always a desire in our hearts to learn of the gospel and to partake 
of the good spirit that always prevails in our conference meetings. 

A few days ago, a young lady asked my why it was that there 
were so many young people who did not have a testimony of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. In our conversation I told her that I be- 
lieved it was because the young people were not giving the atten- 
tion to these matters in the same degree that they were giving their 
attention to other things. I am of the opinion that there is a senti- 
ment among some of our young people that a testimony of the gos- 
pel will come to them in some peculiar way, and that all they have 
to do is to sit around and wait for it. Others expect the testimony 
to be theirs, irrespective of the lives they live, or the attention they 
give to the observance of the laws and commandment of the Lord. 
However, we as a people know that no one can receive a testimony 
of the gospel without searching for it, and observing the conditions 
upon which a knowledge is founded. 

We do not apply the same principles of reasoning to our relig- 
ious experience as we do to other affairs of life. The student would 
not expect to go into school and acquire a knowledge of the subject 
under consideration without considrable study and application. For 
example, a student who is studying chemistry would not think of 
combining two acids and getting the proper result if the combina- 
tion were not the correct combination. But sometimes in religious 
affairs he feels that there is no obligation on his part to apply the 
truths he has received in religious lines as he applies the truths 
that have been found out by investigation along other lines. 

A testimony of the gospej can only come to people who are 
willing to apply themselves in first learning the gospel, and the 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



91 



things necessary to be done and then observing and putting into 
practice these principles. As in the example of chemistry the result 
comes after a time when the proper combination is made, so it is 
with the gospel, the desired result cannot be obtained except by the 
proper application of the truths involved. 

We occasionally have people who come into our Church with 
an idea that something very remarkable is going to happen to them 
in the way of manifestations or miracles that will be an outward 
demonstration to them of the truthfulness of the gospel, confirming 
without question this thing that they have believed to be right. 
I remember a young man who had investigated the principles of 
the gospel and done some research work. He had been in the 
war and had been injured so that it was necessary for him to use 
crutches. While he had investigated in a fair way, still he contin- 
ually had doubts and questions about some of the principles. These 
doubts kept him rather undecided as to whether it was right or 
wrong. However, eventually he decided that the principles were 
true, and felt that he had received a sufficient testimony, so that he 
applied for baptism. On coming up out of the water, I am con- 
vinced that he expected to be healed of the injury that he had re- 
ceived in the war and that this remarkable miracle or blessing 
would be given to him as an added testimony, removing from his 
mind any particular doubt that he had. But there was no outward 
demonstration of the power of the Lord in his behalf. Hands were 
laid upon his head and he was confirmed a member of the Church. 
He went along for awhile rather feeling that this blessing should 
come to him, but nothing particular was given to him as far as an 
outward demonstration was concerned. Because of this absence 
of any outward sign, he decided that the Church was not true and 
left the Church. 

We had another case where a woman had been in touch with 
the principles of the gospel from her childhood but had not taken 
the opportunity of coming into the Church. In the later years of 
her life, she felt that she could not stay out any longer, because of 
the testimony that had come to her, the truths that she had heard 
from time to time, as the elders visited at her father's home. She 
applied for baptism, and afterwards she expressed herself as being 
rather surprised that she felt no particular difference after being 
baptized than she did before. It was her idea that undoubtedly 
the Lord would so impress her that she would know beyond any 
shadow of a doubt that she was absolutely right in coming into 
the Church. Of course, in a way, she was rather disappointed that 
this outward manifestation was not given to her. 

I am of the opinion that often our young people, as well as our 
older people, are waiting for some of these remarkable things to 
happen to them, feeling that their faith all at once will be made al- 
most perfect by the demonstration that they will receive from their 
heavenly Father, as to the divinity of the Church. This is not the 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



way that the Lord usually acts towards his people, and all of us 
will be rather disappointed if our faith is dependent on outward 
signs. The way has been shown and marked out in a very plain and 
unmistakable manner, the following of which will bring us safely 
to a knowledge of the truth. 

I sincerely trust that our young people will feel that it is nec- 
essary for them to follow out the usual methods of receiving a 
testimony observing that marked path which has been given to us. 
If they will, there will be no question about their receiving such 
manifestation, the power of the Lord, as will indicate to their souls 
that they are in the right Church, that the Lord lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is his prophet in these latter 
days. 

The Lord has indicated that it is obligatory on the part of 
parents to teach their children the principles of the gospel, but in 
the final analysis of the thing, it is quite necessary for the children 
themselves to investigate, and to find out for themselves concern- 
ing the truth of the principles that have been taught to them by 
their parents. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that we will do what we can 
to interest our sons and daughters in the gospel, and guard them 
along intelligent lines, so that they will not have to go at it blindly. 
Then they may be shown how to apply the principles that will 
bring to them the desired blessings and the testimony, so that in 
the end our young people, as they grow to manhood and woman- 
hood, will not be left in doubt as to the truth of the gospel. They 
will have the staunch, firm testimony that their fathers and mothers 
had because of their application of the principles which bring a 
testimony. 

If we as parents will only do our part and follow the command- 
ments given to us, as far as teaching our children are concerned, 
the boys and girls will continue to work out for themselves the 
different processes necessary to be gone through in order to get 
this definite knowledge from their heavenly Father. 

Let us live the gospel, and lay up treasures in heaven by keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord, so that when the time comes 
that we are especially in need of blessings, we can draw on the 
account that we have with the Lord, and find that our balance is 
on the credit side. This knowledge will give us greater confidence 
in going to the Father, in faith, for blessings that we may stand 
so much in need of, which blessings may be in being able to reach 
the hearts of our sons and daughters, impress them with the testi- 
mony and faith of their Fathers. 

A tenor solo was sung by Charles S. Martin, entitled, "In my 
Father's house are many mansions." 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 
President of the Canadian Mission 
Never in my life have I felt more joy and happiness in proclaim- 
ing and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to mankind than I do at 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR.

the present time. It seems to me that there is a vital need of the simple 
faith that the gospel provides among the children of men. I am happy, 
therefore, in the thought that we as Latter-day Saints stand firmly 
on the ground that the quality of faith that will 'bring both spiritual 
and temporal salvation to human kind is the kind that leads us to 
know without a question of doubt that Jesus is the Christ, the resur- 
rection and the life of man, the Redeemer of mankind, and that through 
him and by yielding obedience to his great plan of life we are to become 
like him in that we are to have immortality and eternal life. 

When one takes into consideration the fact that there are extant in 
the world today many who are advocating and teaching from the pulpit, 
in homes, in conversation, and through the printed pages of newspapers 
and magazines, the idea that the Son of God was merely a great moral 
teacher and not the Savior of mankind, that the mighty works he did 
were only myths, that the literal resurrection of his body was not a 
fact, then it seems to me that our mission should be more intensified in 
teaching mankind everywhere the necessity of cultivating a vital faith 
in him so that the witness that God has implanted in our beings will 
spring up into everlasting joy, so much so that we will be able to 
impress the divinity of the Christ upon the hearts of those with whom 
it is our privilege to meet from time to time. 

A few Sundays ago, together with some of my missionary com- 
panions, I attended the services in a very fashionable church in one of 
the great cities of the land. We were interested in the services, and 
more especially in the sermon delivered by the minister of the church. 
His remarks partook more or less of the changes that take place in the 
lives of individuals who, when they are touched with some super- 
power that brings about a reformation in their lives, then after this 
change they step out and devote themselves to a cause, and usually the 
cause is along the lines of moral subjects which they teach quite relig- 
iously. His sermon was built upon the idea that we must be touched 
with a supernatural power before we are able to bring to pass anything 
worth while. I think his remarks were well received and suggested, at 
least, the idea that improvements were always in order and that we 
arrive at great heights only when operated upon by this power which 
gives us vision. 

I have often told missionaries that the greatest and most sacred 
thought that can enter the hearts of men is a thought of God, and then 
allow that thought to develop and expand until it becomes the dominat- 
ing power of life. A pure faith must be built upon this thought of 
God. He is the greatest we know and a knowledge of him is measured 
more by vital faith in him than the use of any device or mental process 
we can possibly adopt. We can soon come to our limitations in real 
faith when we use only our minds, but there are no limitations to our 
faith when we build it upon spirituality. If we were to judge the faith 
of Moses we would come to an understanding that it was built upon 
spiritual power. It was not until he was touched by the light of God's 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Holy Spirit that he reached the zenith of his power. This great leader 
of nations knew full well the value of faith in God, he led Israel out of 
bondage because his trust in God was so great that it seemed, as we 
read the story, that he could talk face to face with Jehovah whenever 
the occasion required. There was no doubt, it seems, of a perfect under- 
standing as to where he would receive help when he needed it. He 
also was conscious of the fact that to maintain this quality of faith he 
must devote himself to living righteously before God daily. 

The holy scriptures abound in testimonials where the quality of 
faith has always been operative in communing with God. Indeed, one 
is inspired when he reads the testimonies of the prophets regarding 
their talks with, and seeing, God. It seems that faith and trust in God 
have always been the gateway to joy and happiness. 

In the days of the Christ great principles of righteousness were 
taught and lived by him to demonstrate his divinity and have mankind 
believe in his mighty mission. We hear him constantly telling his 
followers that to believe in him was to have faith in him who sent him, 
and that to know him and his Father is life eternal. 

Let us pause for a moment and feel the effect that the Son of 
God had upon his disciples through this quality of faith. He had made 
them the promise that when he went away he would send the Comforter, 
the Holy Ghost, and he, the Holy Ghost, would teach them all things, 
and above all he would bear witness of the divinity of the Christ. 
Mark you, when Christ was gone from among them they had only one 
alternative, and that was to return to their former occupations. Then 
it was that they were touched by that light and power, and by their 
faith in the things that the Christ had taught them they increased their 
hope, faith, and knowledge, until they at last lost no time in doing the 
works that he had taught them to do. Only their faith impelled them 
to move among the people and preach Christ and him crucified. This 
faith, as their shield, went with the most of them to a martyr's grave. 
A faith in a righteous cause will live after men are dead and gone. We 
know what it means to have a vital faith in our Lord and Master. 
We have some idea of the character of work we must do to enjoy this 
kind of faith. 

It is written by a gifted writer : 

"Faith is a necessary faculty of the soul; the power by which we commit 
ourselves to any object that wins our devotion and commands our allegiance. 
No man avoids its use, and men differ only in the objects toward which 
their faith is directed. Of all the tragedies caused by the misuses of human 
powers, none is more frequent and disastrous than the ruin that follows 
the misuse of faith. With this necessary and powerful faculty in our pos- 
session capable of use on things high or low, to what determination can a 
man more reasonably set imself than this — 'Since I must and do use faith on 
something I will choose the highest'? It is with such a rational and worthy 
choice that the Christian turns to Jesus. He is the best we know. We will 
direct our faith toward him. This does not mean that in the end our faith 
does not rest on God — it does, for Jesus is the way, the door, as he has said, 
faith in him moves us up through him to the One who sent him. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR.

"Faith in Jesus is the most vivid, true, and compelling way we have of 
committing ourselves to the highest and best we know. In the light of this 
truth we can understand why John called such faith the supreme work 
which God demands of us." 

This very hope we have within us when crystallized into a vital 
faith is the greatest assurance we have of our immortality and eternal 
life. To me, this thought is wonderful, it drives me on in that channel 
whose tributaries are ever flowing into that stream of faith which makes 
me know and feel the Creator and Founder of the eternal plan of life. 
It is only when we deal in the complex things of life that our faith in 
Christ becomes skeptical and doubtful. The things that Jesus did while 
here upon the earth were simple and generous. They were even great 
and powerful in their simplicity. They added joy and happiness to 
those who were affected. Yet we find many today who are trying 
to belittle and destroy faith in these mighty truths. Who is there here 
that would care to have removed from the scriptures the simple story 
of the poor woman who had spent all her twelve years earnings on 
doctors to rid herself of the dread disease she was troubled with? Not 
one, I'm sure. Yet in a moment of aboslute faith in the Christ and his 
healing power she has left us an example of pure faith that cannot be 
excelled. In face of opposition she declares that "If I can but touch the 
hem of his garment I shall be made well." Then the Savior, with all the 
power needed, said to her, "Be made clean.' ' Shall we let this, together 
with all the other incidents filled with faith, slip away from holy 
writ and have people say they are only myths ? God forbid. There 
are too many such things being wrought by the power of God today 
to permit anything to come along and mar the beauty and power of 
this circumstance as it stands in the Bible. 

My dear brethren and sisters, to have faith in God and his Son 
Jesus Christ is the greatest thing we should strive for. It can be 
ours, this great gift of faith, by bringing ourselves to our knees and in 
the silent hour of prayer asking God for the fortifying power of his holy 
Spirit, and by responding to the principles of righteousness as con- 
tained in the mighty plan of life and salvation established by our Lord 
and Master, Jesus Christ. 

I bear witness with all the power I have that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that through him the 
gospel has been restored in power and authority. I do humbly pray that 
our faith will never wane, but that it will continue to develop and grow 
into an absolute fellowship with God and his Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANGUS T. WRIGHT 

Former President pf the New Zealand Mission 

My dear Brethren and Sisters: I rejoice in having this privi- 
lege of addressing you for a few moments in the overflow meet-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ing. My remarks, if I am so led, will be more in the nature of a 
report of the labors of myself and wife while traveling to and from 
New Zealand and some of our experiences while there. 

I must say first that I appreciate the honor which was con- 
ferred upon me in having had the privilege of representing the 
Church of God in that far off foreign land, to have been a mes- 
senger of salvation to those who are in darkness, and those who 
know not the plan of salvation. 

When my wife and I were set apart for this work, we were 
promised that we should be blessed and preserved to go in peace 
and to return in safety, and if we were faithful and diligent we 
should enjoy the promptings of the Holy Spirit of God. I want to 
testify here and now that those promises were fulfilled completely 
and I was frequently surprised to receive impressions and prompt- 
ings that when followed, led me aright every time and were really 
a source of wonder and consolation to me. President Grant, who 
was mouth, told me also to go and be a father to the young elders 
over there. I tried to remember and obey this admonition always, 
and so when I could not be a father, then I was a brother to them ; 
I tried to enter into their joys and to sympathize with them in their 
troubles and their sorrows. We had our annoyances — ves, among 
fifty elders one could not expect to have perfection in all, particu- 
larly when most all were very young — 18, 19 and 20 years only, the 
majority of them were, of course, inexperienced, but infractions of 
the mission rules were confined to but one or two of them. 

On our voyage over we were so unfortunate as to have a case 
of smallpox develop in the steerage, and in consequence, when in 
the Waitemate harbor, in sight of our friends on the wharf, the 
vessel was put about, and we all were taken to the quarantine 
island, fifty miles distant, and kept there for two weeks. It was all 
for a good purpose, however, as on the second Sabbath, I was 
asked if I would speak in the evening service for twenty minutes. 
I gladly consented and it was so arranged. Before beginning I was 
asked if I would speak on two subjects, namely, Polygamy, and, 
did we as "Mormons" believe in Christ? The time arrived and the 
large upper room was filled with the whole passenger assembly of 
about 300 souls. I told them frankly that we were not there to 
preach polygamy. In the year 1890 the practice had been discontinued 
through a manifesto from the then President of the "Mormon" Church, 
since which time no plural marriages had been solemnized in any place, 
nor by any officer in the Church over which the Church had any control. 

As to the second question, do we believe in Christ? Yes; we 
not only believe, but we know that Jesus is the Christ and that he 
lives because we have seen him. It is no longer a question of simple 
belief, but an absolute knowledge, as the Father and the Son ap- 
peared to our Prophet Joseph Smith and talked with him, and this 
is the important message which we have to bear to you, that these 
holy personages, after whose images we were created, came to the

earth and restored the everlasting gospel in its fulness, and this is 
what we preach to you today and bear our testimony to you that 
it is true, is God-given, and we call upon you to repent and to em- 
brace the gospel. 

I felt well and spoke to them for thirty minutes, and then they 
said I quit too soon. We made many firm friends among fellow 
passengers and removed much prejudice. While in that land we 
met many of the high government officials, also a number of other 
prominent men, and know that we removed much prejudice and 
feel well pleased with the results of our two years' labor. 

The principal newspaper at Wauganui had printed several 
scurrilous misrepresentations of our traveling elders, having been 
influenced by stories which had appeared in English papers to the 
effect that these Utah elders were sent out to induce young women 
to join the Church, who were then sent in large companies to Utah 
for immoral purposes, etc. 

I said to him: Now, Mr. Editor, I want to say, first, that these 
statements are all false, that we don't confine our work to the 
young ladies, that we are here to preach Christ and him crucified, 
and to warn the whole world of his second coming and to induce 
the whole people to be prepared to meet him; that to pay $250 per 
head to land young women in Utah, where there is already a great 
plenty and of the best quality, for immoral or any other purpose is 
preposterous, and as a business man you know that the emigration 
laws of New Zealand are so strict and each person applying for a 
passport is so closely scrutinized and thoroughly questioned, that 
this is all a physical impossibility ; and besides, the American laws 
governing immigration and the quota .allowed would absolutely 
prevent any wholesale transfer of young or old to Utah. Now, Mr. 
Editor, be fair to these young elders who have come thus far at 
their own expense to bear their testimonies to this people ; pub- 
lish no more of your damaging reports until you have personally 
investigated them. i 

He promised to do this and give us a fair write-up in the next 
issue of his paper. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, I must not take up more of the 
valuable time lest I encroach on the time of Brother Smith. I have 
much I would like to say to the parents of the elders over there, but 
time will not permit. Again I rejoice in this privilege, especially to 
be found in the company of these stalwarts, these mission presi- 
dents, some of whom have served in this capacity for a score of 
years. I testify that it is a noble work, that it is the work of God. 
I have been blessed in this labor, and I desire to continue to serve. 
May God keep us all true and faithful, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church 

There are only a few moments left, but I feel that I should take 
the time to comment upon a thought expressed by one of our 
speakers, who said that he was asked why our young people do not 
have a testimony of the gospel. I think that the person asking this 
question was either misinformed, or was not acquainted with the 
young people of the Church. It is true that few of them feel to ex- 
press themselves as having a testimony of the gospel, but when put 
to the test, they soon learn the difference between that strong feel- 
ing they have, that the gospel is true and the assurance that causes 
them to say they know. 

In my opinion, one reason for this apparent lack of knowledge, 
on the part of the young people, is that, as parents and officers in 
the Church organizations, we have not taken advantage of the 
means provided and have not given the encouragement needed to 
bring out this important fact. Perhaps we are not setting the 
proper example, and many of us fail to show the proper interest in 
this great gift, for we are told that a testimony is the gift of God 
and does not come unsought. 

Some of our young men go into the mission field and express 
themselves as not knowing for a surety that the gospel is true, but 
they feel that it is, and hope soon to gain a testimony. If they had 
been put to work and given more opportunities to bear testimony 
at home, this gift of God would have come to them, just as it does 
later in the mission field. It should be the aim of every parent and 
every officer in the Church to assist the young people to gain a 
testimony, for those who are not of our faith do not understand why 
we send young men and young women into the world to preach the 
gospel who seemingly are not fully converted. 

I read a letter the other day from a young man who a few 
months ago was attending the missionary class here. He is now 
laboring in one of the large cities in Europe. In his letter he calls 
attention to many little incidents that tend to impress him with the 
great importance of the service in which he is engaged, and of the 
guiding influence of the Holy Spirit. 

I will repeat one incident. One morning he awakened early 
and could not go to sleep again. His companion complained of his 
restlessness, which the elder could not explain. He finally arose 
from his bed to study, but could not apply himself to his study and 
so decided to take a walk. As he started out, he was impressed to 
go to another part of the city, where two other elders were living. 
On the way there he met a man and his wife from Utah whom he 
knew. They did not have the address of any of the elders or Saints 
in that city, and in their prayers had asked the Lord to direct them. 
This boy, being the only elder in that city who was acquainted with 
them, was led to them by this unseen Power, and his vision was 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 99 

opened to the great power of prayer and the willingness of the Lord 
to answer the prayers of his children. 

Similar incidents of the manifestations and power of the Holy 
Spirit could be related by nearly every member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Even so, are we fully impressed 
with the importance of these manifestations? Do they enter into 
our lives and cause us to turn to our heavenly Father in humility, 
with a desire to serve him with all our might, mind, and strength? 

Two or three days ago I met a young man on the street whom 
I have not seen for a great many years. As I stopped to shake 
hands with him, he said that he wanted to have a visit with me and 
a long talk. We stepped to the curb and he told this story : 

Having left school in his youth and obtained employment 
which took him away from home, he had very little opportunity to 
labor in the Church. His companions and associates having but 
little time for religion, he drifted from active participation in 
Church affairs. After two or three children had been born to him, 
his thoughts wandered to his early home teachings, and to the pros- 
pects of the future for his family. In his youth he had been taught 
to pray, and had never turned from this practice. 

Finally, the elders were called in to administer to one of his 
children who had been given up by the attending physicians. Al- 
most instantly the child was relieved and continued to improve 
until it was soon in perfect health. 

This little incident brought forcibly to his mind the teachings 
of his childhood, and he was so impressed that his whole soul is 
now centered upon so living that he may go with his family to the 
temple, there to have the promise of the new and everlasting cove- 
nant sealed upon them. This young man's mother has been a con- 
stant worker in the temple for many years, and her prayers have 
gone out to the Lord, asking that the heart of her son be touched, 
and in the Lord's own way and in due time these prayers have been 
answered. 

Thus, we see the importance of loving one another, as we are 
commanded to do and we should constantly be found serving the 
Lord by serving our fellow men and encouraging them in their 
efforts to earn as their reward salvation in the celestial kingdom. 

May this be our lot, is my prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Daughter of Zion." 

The closing praver was offered by Elder John Keddington. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING SESSION 

At 10 o'clock, Monday morning, October S, 1925, the meeting 
in the Tabernacle was opened by President Heber J. Grant who an- 
nounced that the choir and congregation would sing, "Come, come, ye 
Saints." 

After the song, Elder Bryant S. Hinckley, President of the Liberty 
stake of Zion, offered the opening prayer. 

A solo, "The Seer, the Seer, Joseph the Seer," was sung by 
William Russell. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

DIVINE REVELATION 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands for the 
doctrine of divine revelation, immediate, continuous and direct. 
"We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, 
and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important 
things pertaining to the Kingdom of God." Such is the language 
of one of our Articles of Faith, written for the Church by its 
founder, Joseph Smith, prophet, revelator and seer. 

My reason for referring to the subject at this time is a remark 
attributed to Colonel William Jennings Bryan, of honored memory, 
during the famous Evolution trial at Dayton, Tennessee. He is re- 
ported to have said that to destroy the Bible would be to destroy 
revealed religion. 

MAN IN THE IMAGE OF GOD 

Before going any further into that, I wish to say that I was in 
full sympathy with the Great Commoner in his general attitude on 
that historic occasion. I believe that when God made man in His 
own image, He made a man, and not a monkey, nor any other 
animal out of which man has evolved. I do not believe that the 
first of our race was a savage, or a cave man, who courted his wife 
with a club and carried her off by force. Such creatures there 
may .have been, and there may be now. I do not dispute the find- 
ings and the facts of science — real science — which is knowledge, not 
guess-work. But I do deny that the great father of the human 
family was a creature of that kind. 

adam's antecedents 

Adam was no ordinary character. How could he be, with such 
a mission and such antecedents as were his? In the heavens, before 
this earth was formed, he was Michael the Archangel, leader of the 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



101 



loyal spirit hosts that vanquished Lucifer and his rebellious legions, 
winning the right to take bodies upon this planet, to become "souls" 
capable of endless increase and advancement. What Latter-day 
Saint can doubt that Adam was among "the noble and great," re- 
ferred to in the Book of Abraham as "rulers," chosen before they 
were born into this world to play leading parts in the divine drama 
having as its purpose the uplift and promotion of "the lesser in- 
telligences" who became God's sons and daughters — the end de- 
signed by the all-wise, all-benevolent Creator from the beginning? 

THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL 

Bear in mind that the Gospel of Christ is not a mere life boat or 
fire escape — a way out of a perilous situation. It is all this and more. 
It is the path to endless glory and exaltation, the plan of eternal 
progression, designed by the wisdom of the Gods before the founda- 
tion of the world. Adam's fall was a part of the great plan. It 
brought death, spiritual and temporal death — for Divine Justice de- 
mands a penalty for every transgression,- — but it also produced the 
human race, so far as mortal bodies are concerned, a race re- 
deemed by the great Atoning Sacrifice, which paid Adam's debt, 
mended the broken law, repoised the unbalanced scale, and restored 
the equilibrium of right. Thenceforth man, by pursuing the path 
marked out for him, might go on to perfection. It was Adam's 
mission to bring us into this world. It is Christ's mission to lift 
us up out of this world, when the object of our sojourn here is ac- 
complished. 

THE DISPENSATIONS 

Adam was the first to receive and obey the Gospel, revealed to 
him out of Eternity at the very beginning of Time. Since his day 
it has been upon the earth repeatedly, in a series of dispensations, 
of .which this is the greatest and the last. Adarn,presides over all 
the gospel dispensations, including the Dispensation of the Fullness 
of Times — he presides over them all, just as the President of the 
Church presides over all the Stakes of Zion and all the outside 
Missions, though each has its own immediate presiding authority. 
Joseph Smith is the immediate head of this dispensation, and Adam 
is the -general head of all. Standing next to Christ in the Priest- 
hood, whenever that divine power is revealed from heaven to earth, 
"it is by Adam's authority." So says Joseph Smith. 

The world has not seen the last of Father Adam. He is coming 
again, as the Ancient of Days, to fulfill the prophecy of Daniel. He 
will' come to the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, where of old he 
blessed his posterity, foretelling what should befall them to the 
latest generation. He will call a council and assemble his righteous 
descendants, to prepare them for the glorious advent of the King 
of Kings. 

This is a part of the divine program, as made known bv modem 
reyelation, 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NEITHER APE NOR CAVE MAN 

Dismiss from your minds, my hearers — if any of you entertain 
the notion — that Adam, the Ancient of Days, the great Prince and 
Patriarch of our race, was ever a jungle-inhabiting ape, or even an 
unenlightened cave man. He knew more about religion than all the 
theologians of the world combined. He knew more about science — 
the sources of science — than any evolutionist has ever dreamt 
of knowing. How can anyone whose soul has been fed with the 
revelations of God, whose mind has been illumined by the spirit of 
the Gospel, the gift of the Holy Ghost, conceive of Adam, the first 
of the human race, as anything less than the Bible represents him 
to be — a man formed in the image of his Maker? — which is tanta- 
mount to saying that the Maker is in the form of man. 

BRYAN ANSWERED 

And now as to that remark of Colonel Bryan's. Is it a fact 
that the destruction of the Bible would mean the destruction of re- 
vealed religion? According to my reckoning there' are at least 
three books, in addition to the Bible, that would have to be de- 
stroyed before revealed religion could perish. I refer to the Book 
of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the PearL-of Great 
Price, which three, with the Bible, are the accepted doctrinal stand- 
ards of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All these 
sacred volumes have to do with revealed religion, and they would 
have to be destroyed before it could see destruction. Even then it 
would survive if a man like Joseph Smith remained, to receive from 
God the revelations of His will. 

NOT DEPENDENT UPON BOOKS 

Revelation does not depend upon books. It is an eternal prin- 
ciple, a perennial, ever-flowing fountain. Books may come and 
books may go, but revelation goes on forever. 

The Bible is one of the best books in creation. We do not 
undervalue it. To the Latter-day Saints it is the word of the Lord, 
save for the errors that have crept into it through faulty translation. 
But it is not the source of eternal truth, nor the foundation of all 
righteousness. No book can claim that distinction. Religion could 
exist without the Bible, and it did exist, as revealed from Heaven, 
before that ancient volume was compiled. 

There were prophets before Moses, he who wrote the Penta- 
teuch or first five books of the Bible ; and their inspired utterances 
(some of which have been brought to light in modern days) are 
just as sacred as the writings of Israel's great law-giver. But they 
are no substitute for revelation ; they do not constitute the founda- 
tion of religion. Religion rests upon the Rock of Revelation, and 
that rock is Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. 

Some critics think they have discovered that Moses did not 
write the books attributed to him. But there was no such thought 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



103 



in the mind of the Prophet Joseph Smith, when he revised, by the 
Spirit of Revelation, the writings of Moses, as they now appear in 
the Pearl of Great Price. He plainly identifies Moses with the 
authorship of the Book of Genesis. Surely the testimony of a 
prophet of God is quite as worthy of consideration as the theories 
of college students and the carpings of "higher criticism." 

The Book of Mormon is also the word of the Lord, and that it 
was translated correctly, we have the Lord's declaration to the 
Three Witnesses. But the Book of Mormon is not the basis of 
our religious faith. It rests upon a much solider foundation. 

The Bible is not the Gospel ; neither is the Book of Mormon ; 
though both may be said to contain it. Such books are records of 
the Gospel's experience among men, and are a means of preserving 
a knowledge of the truth and handing it down to posterity. Books 
are a great convenience, an almost priceless boon, but they are not 
absolutely indispensable. Religion could live without them. 

THE SCIENCE OF SCIENCES 

But it could not live without God. He is the Source of all true 
religion and all true science, revealed or unrevealed. What is 
science but a part of religion, a branch or form of revelation? And 
what is religion but the science of all sciences — the science of eter- 
nal life? Music, poetry, and other arts — they also are forms of 
revelation, means used by the Giver of every good gift to make 
known the beautiful and the sublime — things that we "seek after," 
and ought to seek, for they are portions of the Divine Message, ac- 
cessories to the Everlasting Gospel. 

THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL 

The Bible is a history of God's dealings with an ancient people 
— the House of Israel — the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob, in whom Jehovah purposed to bless all nations, and did so 
when He came through the lineage of those Hebrew patriarchs as 
the Redeemer of mankind. He also blessed the world when he dis- 
persed his chosen people among the nations, thus sprinkling them 
with the blood of the faithful, the blood that believes, and with 
spirits answering to that blood. The Bible is likewise a prophecy 
of God's intentions toward the human family, and a repository of 
laws and ordinances that His ancient people were commanded to 
observe and obey. 

LAWS ACTIVE AND OBSOLETE 

Some of those laws are still in force, notwithstanding the lapse 
of ages. Others are obsolete, out of date. This cannot be said of 
the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, or the princi- 
ples of the Everlasting Gospel ; but it can be said of many parts of 
the Holy Scriptures. They make good reading, but their day is 
past ; they are not in force upon the present generation. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The same is true of parts of the Book of Mormon and parts of 
the Doctrine and Covenants. They have no reference to us what- 
ever; and I'll prove it in a twinkling. 

MODERN ILLUSTRATIONS 

In the month of January, 1847, the main body of the Latter-day 
Saints were encamped upon the Missouri River, prior to crossing 
the great plains to the Rocky Mountains. President Brigham 
Young, who was then the head of the Church, voiced to its members 
"the word and will of the Lord," now constituting Section 136 of 
the book of Doctrine and Covenants. It directed all the people of 
the Church and those who journeyed with them to be organized into 
companies of hundreds, fifties and ten's (meaning wagons) prepara- 
tory to the passage of the plains. This meant that they were to 
yoke up their ox teams, hitch them to. their covered wagons, and 
organize as directed, "with a covenant and promise to keep all the 
commandments and statutes of the Lord our God." 

Now, this part of the revelation is still alive and in force. We 
are all required to keep the Lord's commandments, such as apply 
to our case and condition. But we are not required to hitch up ox 
teams, organize into companies of hundreds, fifties and tens, and 
cross the plains to the Rocky Mountains. Yet that requirement, 
obsolete as to us, was the word and will of the Lord to our fathers 
and mothers, our grandfathers and grandmothers, encamped upon 
the Missouri River in January, 1847. 

Another illustration : Many years ago there came to Salt Lake 
City a learned prelate of the Greek Catholic Church. He visited 
one of our Sacrament meetings, and was greatly shocked to see the 
Saints sipping water instead of wine at the table of the Lord. He 
afterwards said to me : "Why do you do this ? Jesus Christ author- 
ized the use of wine when he instituted the Sacrament at Jeru- 
salem." "Yes," I assented, "and He also authorized wine when He 
instituted the same ordinance among the Nephites here in America, 
as told in the Book of Mormon. But what has that fo do with us? 
We are living in another dispensation. We are not governed by 
what Jesus told the Jews to do, nor by what he told the Nephites 
to do. We are governed by what He tells the Latter-day Saints to 
do ; and the latest word that comes from Him through his living 
oracle at the head of the Church, must always take precedence over 
any former commandment given by Him to us or to any other peo- 
ple. We also will use wine in the Sacrament whenever the Lord 
requires it ; but since He has said that it matters not what we eat 
or drink at such times, so long as we do it with an eye single to His 
glory, we use water instead." 

THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD 

No book is good enough to preside over the Church of God and 
direct its activities. Books are not a sufficient guide for a pro- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



105 



gressive people on their way to the celestial kingdom. They are 
good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough. We have 
something better — a living, heaven-inspired Priesthood, with the 
restored Gospel, the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the principle of 
immediate and continuous revelation. Other churches are built upon 
books, traditions, decrees of councils and synods, private inter- 
pretations, man-made doctrines, maybe-so's and peradventures. But 
the Church of the Living God stands where He has placed it, upon 
the Rock of Divine Revelation, and the gates of hell cannot prevail 
against it. 

A BRAVE FIGHT 

No, Friend Bryan. You meant well, and you made a brave 
fight for the truth as you saw it, though somewhat hampered by 
tradition, and probably by environment. And the Lord will bless 
you for it and remember you when He makes up his jewels. But 
you fell short, through lack of further light and understanding. 

No, the destruction of the Bible would not destroy all that God 
has revealed. It would not destroy what the other good books con- 
tain, nor seal up the heavens against future revelation. It would 
remove only a history or a hand-book of religion, one of the means 
used by the Almighty to preserve among men the truth as Heaven 
nas revealed it. 

TRUTH THE ETERNAL 

What is Truth? Joseph Smith says: "It is the knowledge of 
things as they are, as thev have been, and as they will be." John 
Jaques, inspired by the Muse of Poesy, which is only another name 
for the God of Truth, built upon the same great thought when he 
gave us this glorious hymn : 

O say what is truth? 'Tis the fairest gem 

That the richest of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of truth will be when 
The proud monarch's costliest diadem 

Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or Gods can aspire ; 
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies ; 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 

The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp 
When with winds of stern justice he copes, 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast 
And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.

Then say what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er: 
Though the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

AUTHORIZATION OF CHRIST TO WITNESSES OF HIM 
"But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon 
you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, 
and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." 

These men who were to be witnesses were eye witnesses of 
the resurrectionxif the Lord Jesus Christ, and that is the principal 
fact to which they were to bear witness in all parts of Judea, Sa- 
maria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. 

THE REALITY OF CHRIST AS DEITY 

My beloved brethren and sisters, in the world today belief in 
Jesus Christ is too perfunctory, too conventional. The reality of 
Christ as Deity does not seem to possess the souls of men. The 
resurrected Lord is a something apart 'from most men's lives. I 
think I cannot better illustrate this thought than to read a few 
lines written by one of the soldiersin Flanders, when he was in the 
midst of shot and shell and facing death. Writing of the Christ 
he says : 

"We had forgotten you, or very nearly,. 
You didn't seem to touch us very nearly. 
Of course we thought about you now and then — 
Especially in any time of trouble — • 
We knew that you. were good in time of trouble — 
But we are very ordinary men. 

"Now, we remember, over here in Flanders — 
(It is not strange to think of you in Flanders) — ■ 
This hideous warfare seems to make things clear. 
We never thought about you much in England — 
But now that we are far away from England— 
We have no doubts, we know that you are here. 

"We think about you kneeling in the Garden — 

Ah, God, the agony of that dread Garden — 

We know you prayed for us upon the cross. 

If anything could make us glad to bear it 

'Twould be the knowledge that you willed to bear it — 

Pain, de^th, the uttermost of human loss!" 

Too many in the psuedo Christian world today can say as 
truthfully as the soldier : 

"We had forgotten you, or very nearly — • 
You do not seem to touch us very nearly." 

The reality of God the Father, the reality of Jesus Christ, the 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



107 



risen Lord, is a truth which should possess every human soul. God 
is the center of the human mind as surely as the sun is the center of 
this universe, and once we feel his Fatherhood, once we feel his 
nearness, sense the divinity of the deity of the Savior, the truths of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ follow as naturally as the day the night, 
and as night the day. 

HOW MAY WE KNOW GOD AND FEEL HIS NEARNESS? 

How may we know God, how may we feel that nearness to 
him ? That is the question that young men are asking today. Boys 
and girls are nof. naturally irreligious ; they are not profaners be- 
cause they love to be. I know they seem indifferent, but in their 
very hearts, they are asking these eternal questions, and they long 
for the answer. 

ONE WAY, TO THINK, TO REASON 

There are three ways, among others, to which we should like 
to ask the young men of Israel, particularly, to seek their God and 
to feel his nearness. One is to think, to reason. Reason though only 
an insecure guide will lead us to him. However, "Dim as the 
borrowed rays of moon and stars to lonely, weary, wandering 
traveler — is reason to the soul," but it is a guide, and too few men 
use it positively with a desire to know the truth. 

ANOTHER, TO ACCEPT THE WITNESS OF MEN OF INTEGRITY 

Another pathway is to accept the witness of men who have 
known him, who have seen him. I think we pay too little attention 
to the value of these witnesses. I have read in your presence this 
morning the authorization of Christ to his apostles who were to 
be witnesses of him. The very first act of the Twelve after Christ's 
ascension was to choose a man from among those who had been 
eye witnesses of Christ's resurrection. That was what they wanted 
the apostle to be who was to take Judas' place. (Read in the first 
chapter of Acts) — a witness of his resurrection. Mind you, many 
men in the world today accept 'Christ as a great teacher, but that 
is not the fact which is going to transform their souls. He was 
a great teacher, the greatest teacher of men, but he was also God. 
Through him we know God; through Christ, God reveals himself 
to men. It is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world of whom I 
speak when I plead for young men to come close to him and to think 
of him as a reality after his death, after his burial. Of the resur- 
rected Christ were the early apostles to be witnesses in all Judea, 
and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. 

Now let me here say that we ought not to question the in- 
tegrity of these men. I believe in them, I cannot believe that they 
wanted to deceive, I cannot believe that they were deceived, I can- 
not. In measurement of time we are a long way from them, I 
know, but if we study carefully their lives and their histories we 



i08 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



shall find that their testimonies are reliable and that the integrity 
of their lives is unquestioned. To emphasize the value of their 
testimony, let me call your attention to what Mr. Roger W. Babson, 
author of Fundamentals of Prosperity has written about integrity, 
how our entire social structure is built upon it: 

"The first fundamental of prosperity is integrity. Without it there is no 
civilization, there is no peace, there is no security, there is no safety. Mind 
you also this applies just as much to the man who is working for wages 
as to the capitalist and every owner of property. Integrity however is 
very much broader than the above illustration would indicate." 

Before this quotation, he shows that there is no value at all 
in the bank book, no value in the deeds and mortgages that we 
hold. 

"The value of them lies in the integrity of the lawyers and stenogra- 
phers who draw up the papers, in the integrity of the officer and clerks 
who sign the documents, in the integrity of the courts and judges who 
would enable us to enforce our claims; in the integrity of the people, the 
citizenship who will stand behind that enforcement, and make our claims 
legal and valid." 

"Integrity," he continues, "applies to many more things than money. 
Integrity requires the seeking after as well as the disposing of truth. It 
was their desire for truth which founded our education institutions, our 
sciences and our arts. All the great professions, from medicine to engineer- 
ing, rest upon this spirit of integrity, and only as they so rest can they 
prosper or even survive." 

TESTIMONY OF MEN WHO SAW THE RESURRECTED CHRIST 

These men who were to be witnesses declared before their 
enemies, the very men who had put Jesus Christ to death on the 
cross, that they had seen the risen Lord. I will first read Peter's 
testimony given immediately after the resurrection : 

"Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man ap- 
proved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God 
did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know; 

"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 

"Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because 
it was not possible that he should be holden of it . . . 

"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses." 

Ah, but the doubting critic says, and he says conscientiously, 
if we had absolute proof that this was Peter's testimony, it would 
have force. But remember, he says, that the Acts of the Apostles 
were not written until eighty years after Christ, or nearly half a 
century after the event of which Peter testified took place. Right. 
But let us remember also that in the severe test to which modern 
science has put all these ancient scriptures during the last half 
century, especially every ancient document that purports to con- 
tain any witness of the resurrected Christ, many documents have 
been thrown aside as spurious, the "Acts of John," the "Acts of 
Andrew," the "Acts of Peter," and others, have been thrown aside, 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



109 



but the Acts of the Apostles has emerged from that criticism with 
its authenticity established. Then we know that the author — we 
accept Luke as the author, and that, too, is fairly well established- 
Luke received the witness personally of the men who saw Jesus 
Christ after he was resurrected. We know that Luke was in Rome 
with Mark, and we know that Mark was in Jerusalem at the time 
that these great events took place. It is not thoroughly established 
but it is quite certain however that Mark was the young man who 
ran into the Garden the night of the betrayal. We know that Luke 
was in the house of Philip, the evangelist, and stayed many days 
at Caesarea. We know that at that time he went to Jerusalem, he 
conferred with James who presided over the Church at Jerusalem- 
James the brother of the Lord, who had accepted the gospel after 
the resurrection. The testimony of James, Luke heard, and in 
all probability the testimony of Peter, because Peter was there as 
one of the leaders when Luke went up to Jerusalem on that oc- 
casion, and he would hear first hand Peter's testimony. Men were 
living, five hundred of them at that time, who had seen the resur- 
rected Lord. What about the integrity of men, integrity of wit- 
nesses? What right had Luke to suspect them? He did not, he 
accepted their testimony as valid, and their testimony of the resur- 
rected Lord convinced him of the divinity of the work of Jesus 
Christ to which he subscribed and of which he became a member. 

He heard from Paul, day after day and night after night, the 
testimony that he gave, and if there is any question about the di- 
rect testimony of Peter we have the direct testimony of Paul in the 
oldest recorded testimony extant, older than the Acts — a testimony 
written in the first twenty-five years of the Christian church. Paul 
testifies that he saw the risen Lord. With that testimony you are 
all acquainted. He further testifies that the risen Lord was seen 
of Cephas (Peter), "then of the Twelve; after that he was seen 
of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part 
remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that 
he was seen of James; then of all the Apostles. And last of all 
he was seen of me also, as one born out of due time." 

I cannot doubt that testimony. Why can the world? This 
testimony is of the resurrected Lord, not Jesus the teacher, not the 
Jesus of Nazareth, who went about as any other Jew, but Jesus the 
Lord, the Redeemer of mankind. 

THE MODERN TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH 

Let me call your attention to another witness nearer to us than 
the ancient apostles — the testimony of Joseph Smith the prophet 
This comes closer to us. These other men are a long way from us 
in measurement of time. Joseph Smith testified that the risen Lord 
appeared to him, that he was introduced to the boy prophet by the 
Lord himself, the Father, who said ,"This is my beloved Son ; hear 
him." If that testimony stood alone it would be, as Christ said his 



no 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testimony would be, of no avail when he spoke of himself. If Jesus 
were the only witness it would not be of force, but he had also 
God's testimony and the Scriptures. And so, Joseph Smith has 
other witnesses whose integrity cannot be questioned. Of Joseph's 
wonderful testimony I have not time to speak, I am merely suggest- 
ing a line of thought that young men may follow and come nearer 
to Christ if they will be conscientious and true, and not "play 
pranks with their souls," but be honest as Joseph Smith was honest, 
and as these other men were honest to death in their testimonies. 

THREE WITNESSES CORROBORATE THE VISION OF JOSEPH 

Three witnesses corrobrated Joseph Smith's wonderful vision, 
and in that testimony which they give they bear record of another 
truth, the immortality of man. For if Jesus Christ lived after death, 
and the angel Moroni came as these three witnesses declared, then 
you and I shall live after death ! Man is immortal. Oh, what a 
wonderful revelation, what it means to men who now but perfunc- 
torily and in a conventional manner accept the gospel of Christ! 
These three men testified : 

"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom 
this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and 
our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, 
which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their 
brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of 
which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been trans- 
lated by the gift and power of God, for His voice hath declared it unto us." 

"Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, MartinHarris." 

I will not take time to read all. 

One of the most pleasant features of an interesting and profit- 
able visit that I recently made with President B. H. Roberts through 
the Eastern States mission, was our coming in contact with scenes 
in early Church history. When we were at Palmyra I read in one of 
the local papers a testimony, or memorandum, given by a man who 
knew these three witnesses personally. He has never joined the 
Church, but in that local paper I read this testimony of the integrity 
of one of these witnesses : 

John H. Gilbert, on September 8, 1892, the man who set the 
type of the Book of Mormon, says this of Martin Harris : 

"Martin Harris was a good farmer owning a farm of about one hundred 
and fifty acres about a mile north of Palmyra village, and had money at 
interest. Martin, as everybody called him, was considered by his neighbors 
a very honest man." 

Martin, the honest man, says to the world, "God's voice de- 
clared to us that the plates from which the Book of Mormon was 
translated are true ; an angel of God came down and he brought and 
laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the records." "A very 
honest man," bears the witness, why should we doubt it? 

I rejoiced at the last meeting in Pittsburgh to hear President 
Roberts bear witness in a most inspirational meeting, that he heard 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



111 



David Whitmer, another of the three special witnesses, testify in 
these words of the book: 

"Young man, if that book (pointing to one of the early editions of the 
Book of Mormon) is not true, then there is no truth in this, God's world." 

The integrity of these three witnesses cannot be successfully 
questioned. Men who heard these testimonies direct from the 
witnesses themselves are with us, and their witness is true. 

THE WITNESS OF THE SPIRIT 

But there is a greater witness than the witness of men, great 
as that is. If we receive the witness of man, the witness of God is 
greater, for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his 
Son : "He that believeth on the Son of God hath witness in him- 
self." There is a witness of the Spirit. God does reveal today to 
the human soul the reality of the resurrection of the Lord, the 
divinity of this great work, the truth, the divine and eternal truth, 
that God lives, not as a power, an essence, a force, as electricity, but 
as our Father in heaven. Oh, why do men try to make that power, 
recognized by science and religion everywhere, a mere force. I 
sometimes wish that such men would kneel down and try to pray 
to electricity. Imagine trying to pray to electricity ! You can't 
do it, and yet that is one of the greatest known forces. You can, 
however, pray to God the Father, a personal being. God reveals to 
the soul his existence. He reveals the deity of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, who came to earth to give to men the great reality of the 
existence of God and his Son ; and in that spirit and with such 
witness in my soul I bear testimony today that Jesus Christ is the 
Redeemer of the world : 

"I know that my Redeemer lives, 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives, 
He lives, He lives who once was dead; 
He lives, my ever living head. 
He lives, all glory to his name! 
He lives, my Savior still the same, 

the sweet joy this sentence gives, 

1 know that my Redeemer lives." 

God help us and all the world to sense the reality, that the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is established among men, and through obedi- 
ence to it the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man may 
become realities to every son and daughter of Adam. God hasten the 
day when that testimony will be real in every heart, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I feel very humble and never have I felt more than I do today 
to rejoice in the revelations of the Lord, especially in those that 
have come to us in this dispensation. It has caused my heart to 



212 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



swell within me as I have listened to the testimonies from our 
brethren as they have borne witness that God lives and that Jesus 
Christ is our Redeemer and the Son of God. I desire to add a few 
words of testimony to these great truths, knowing as I do that not 
only the brethren on this stand, but you, my brothers and sisters, 
are also able to bear the same testimony, because these things have 
been made known to you by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

TO KNOW GOD AND JESUS CHRIST IS LIFE ETERNAL 

In a prayer uttered by our Savior just before his death, he said : 

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God 
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. 

"I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which 
thou gavest me to do. 

"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the 
glory which I had with thee before the world was." 

I know, as these our brethren know, that God lives ; that Jesus 
Christ is the Only Begotton Son of God in the flesh, and the Re- 
deemer of the world. But I have not learned all that there is to 
know about him and our Father, neither have you, for in this mortal 
life it is impossible for us fully to comprehend the mission of our 
Lord and Redeemer, to know him and just who and what he is, and 
the extent of the great work he accomplished. But if we shall be 
worthy to enter into the presence of God the Father and Jesus 
Christ his Son and there be crowned with exaltation, it will be 
necessary for us to know them in the fullness. However, until we 
do enter into their presence and receive this great blessing, we will 
not fully know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he has 
sent. 

THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF CHRIST 

A very significant thing in this prayer is the expression, "And 
now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory 
which I had with thee before the world was." The work accom- 
plished by our Savior did not begin when he came into this world 
a babe at Bethlehem. A great work had already been accomplished 
by him before he came here, and he exercised authority in the 
eternities, under his Father, before this world was framed, but not 
with a body of flesh and bones. 

John, the beloved disciple, bearing witness of this, says : 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and 
the Word was God. 

"The same was in the beginning with God. 

"All things were made by him; and without him was not anything 
made that was made. 

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 

"And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth 
it not." 

THE WORK OF CHRIST TO BRING TO PASS IMMORTALITY AND 
ETERNAL LIFE 

Jesus Christ was the light of men before he came here to die. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 113 



Under the direction of his Father he created worlds — great earths 
for habitation by the children of God — and exercised authority as 
the Son of God, the first begotten in the spirit, beyond that which 
we can comprehend. In the scriptures, known to us as the Writ- 
ings of Moses, we have some account of this great work that was 
performed by Jesus Christ. I want to read a portion of the con- 
versation, had by Moses with the Lord, and recorded in this scrip- 
ture : 

"And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I 
made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in me. 

"And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine 
Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth. 

"And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them 
for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only 
Begotten. 

"And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many. 

"But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I 
unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by 
the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumer- 
able are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are 
mine and I know them. 

"And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be 
merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the 
inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and thy servant will be content. 

"And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens they are 
many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto 
me, for they are mine. 

"And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so 
shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. 

"For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the im- 
mortality and eternal life of man." 

So we see by this that Jesus Christ is the light and the life of 
men, he was a Creator before this world was made. But we are not 
concerned so much just now with the works he then performed, nor 
are we concerned just now with these other worlds and their in- 
habitants. 

LIFE DID NOT ORIGINATE ON THE EARTH 

This we know, and that will suffice until all things are revealed, 
the inhabitants of these worlds created by Jesus Christ, are begotten 
sons and daughters unto God. Life did not originate here; man 
did not first come into existence here. We are told by our Father 
in heaven, that man is eternal, that he has always existed, and that 
all life on this earth came from elsewhere. We may not be able to 
comprehend all this now, but the time will come in the providence 
of the Lord, when all these things shall be made known and we shall 
have knowledge in the fullness. 

THE FAITHFUL PROMISED ETERNAL LIFE 

The thing we are vitally interested in in this life is stated 
in that expression : "For behold, this is my work and my glory — ■ 
to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." This 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



truth is vital to every faithful Latter-day Saint, for we have had 
committed into our care the gospel of Jesus Christ, and have been 
commissioned and given power through the Priesthood, to go forth 
and proclaim this message of salvation in all the world. We are 
to bear witness to the fact that God our Father, through the re- 
demption made by Jesus Christ his Son, has granted unto all men 
the power of forgiveness and remission of sin through their faith, 
repentance, and baptism in water, by which they may come back, if 
they will be faithful in keeping his commandments to the end, 
and enjoy eternal life in his presence. Through the mercy of God 
all men are to receive immortality, and to those who are willing 
to serve and be obedient to all the commandments of the Lord, he 
has promised another great blessing known as eternal life. Immor- 
tality means life without death, and eternal life means much more 
than that, it is life in the presence of God and in the presence of 
Jesus Christ his Son, there to receive the fullness of the blessings 
and the power which the Father has promised to his sons and 
daughters who, through the keeping of the commandments are 
found just and true. All who receive the gospel and endure in 
faith to the end are heirs to the blessings of this great promise — 
eternal life. 

When the Savior stood at the well in conversation with the 
woman of Samaria, he gave her some very important instruction 
regarding eternal life. There he also declared himself to be the 
Son of God. He asked her for water to drink, and in turn promised 
her and all who would believe on him and keep his sayings, that to 
them he would give water which if they would drink of it they 
would never thirst. It is written : 

"Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water 
shall thirst again," (He was speaking of the water in the well), "but who- 
soever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but 
the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well springing up unto 
everlasting life." 

On another occasion when teaching the Jews, they asked Jesus 
what sign he could show, or what great work he had accomplished, 
to prove his ministry. They referred to Moses and to the manna 
that the Lord had sent to the children of Israel when they were in 
the wilderness. The Lord answered them thus : 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from 
heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 

"For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth 
life unto the world." 

So he declared himself to be the water of life and the bread of 
life, and made the promise that those who would receive this water 
and this bread should never thirst, and never hunger, their souls 
would be satisfied. They misunderstood him ; the woman thought 
he spoke of water which quenches thirst. The Jews thought he 
spoke of bread which sustains the body, but he was speaking of the 
principles of the gospel, these principles of eternal life which, if the 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 115 



people would live them, would bring them back into the presence 
of the Father. 

Again he said : 

"I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in 
darkness, but shall have the light of life." 

This is my testimony. I know these things are true. I know 
that if we are obedient to the laws and principles of the gospel as 
they have been made known to us, if we will walk in righteousness 
and endure in faith that we shall obtain eternal life. This life will 
bring us back into the presence of God, there to dwell in the full- 
ness of light, there to know our eternal Father, the only true God 
and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Those who do not dwell there 
shall not know them, for they shall not be blessed with eternal 
life, which is God's life, although they may be in possession of 
immortality, for all men will receive the gift of the resurrection 
through the atonement of Jesus Christ. We must have faith in 
Jesus Christ as the Son of God. We must believe in the Father, in 
the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, as three separate and distinct per- 
sonages, the Father and the Son having bodies of flesh and bones, 
not blood. We are misunderstood by many people when we say 
that Jesus Christ has a body of flesh and bones and his Father also, 
and they naturally conclude that such a body must be quickened by 
the blood, but the body after the resurrection is not quickened by 
blood, but is quickened by spirit, and is immortal. We must believe 
in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost as the great governing power 
of the universe. It is necessary for men to repent of their sins in 
order to have perfect faith, and after repenting of their sins it is 
necessary that they have their sins remitted in the waters of bap- 
tism, that they be cleansed in the manner which the Lord has pro- 
vided and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by which they may 
come back again from spiritual death to spiritual life, to dwell in 
the presence of the Father and the Son. 

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MEN MAY SECURE SALVATION 

In conclusion let me read these words by revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, the day on which this Church was organ- 
ized : 

"And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of 
Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on 
his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God. 

"And we know that justification through the grace of the Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ is just and true; 

"And we know also, that sanctification through the grace of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, is just and true to all those who love and serve 
God with all their mights, minds and strength. 

"But there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart 
•from the living God. 

"Therefore let the Church take heed and pray always, lest they fall 
into temptation." 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We are not saved now. I have stood on the street corners and 
heard men declaring that they are saved, because they have received 
religion and been converted. No man is saved as long as mortality 
endures, unless he is 'faithful to the end, and there is always a pos- 
sibility, as I have read to you here, that men may fall from grace. 

So, it behooves us, as Latter-day Saints, to be faithful, to keep 
the commandments of the Lord, to walk in righteousness all the 
days of our lives. Thus through obedience to those command- 
ments which are set forth in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and by 
continuance therein, we shall receive immortality, glory, eternal 
life, and dwell in the presence of God the Father and his Son Jesus 
Christ, where we shall truly know them. Oh, I pray that we 
may endure, that we may receive these blessings, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Datus E. Hammond, 
president of the Pioneer stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock, President Heber J. Grant announced the opening 
hymn, "Do what is right, the day-dawn is breaking." 

After singing by the choir and congregation, prayer was offered 
by Elder William R. Palmer, President of the Parowan stake. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Now let us rejoice." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I am humbled in the presence of this vast assembly. It is the 
earnest desire of my heart to make at least a small contribution to 
this great conference of the Church. I recognize, however, that I can 
hope to do that only through the aid of our Father's Spirit, and I sin- 
cerely pray that I may have his Spirit to guide and direct me in the 
remarks which I shall make. 

THE NATURE AND VALUE OF TESTIMONY 

I, with you, have listened with great interest and profit to the 
testimonies which have been borne during this conference, and I 
have sat under the spell of the inspired words which have fallen 
from the lips of those upon whom the Spirit of God has been oper- 
ating. I have thought of the value of testimony, and I should like, 
with your indulgence, to discuss for a few moments the nature of 
testimony. What is the testimony of Jesus Christ? I do not have 
reference to a differentiation between and among the various terms 
of scripture which are used to designate the testimony of Jesus. I 
am not particularly concerned that in some instances it may be 
called the gospel, or faith, or the Holy Spirit, or the Comforter, or 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



117 



even the Holy Ghost. It is the nature and essence of this Spirit 
which brings conviction to the hearts of people that has brought 
me to think and reflect upon it. 

MORE THAN JUST A MENTAL STATUS 

Is it more than just a mental status, a psychological phenom- 
enon which may be changed with the state of a man's mind, today 
believing and knowing, and tomorrow forgetting and denying? 
Has it constituency, essence, and force? These questions have 
given me food for much thought and reflection. I am persuaded 
that the testimony of Jesus is something indescribable, but never- 
theless some real tangible thing that has force and power, some- 
thing which serves, when once taken into the structure of a man's 
life, to work therein a transformation, to change some of the vital 
elements which are part and parcel of his life. 

GREAT SPIRITUAL FORCE 

Great physical forces themselves defy the efforts of science to 
fully describe and comprehend them. Science has not given the 
constituency *of gravity. What is light? What is electricity ? What 
is heat? As I understand it, we know these great forces of nature 
only by the effects which they produce. We see their manifesta- 
tions and we conclude that they exist, but can we describe them? 
I believe that with all the advancement made in the processes of 
scientific research and investigation they are yet mysteries to the 
intelligence of man. Is it unthinkable that just as light, heat and 
gravity are great forces of nature, bringing to bear upon the whole 
universe the results and manifestations of their power, that there 
may be in the world of men a force somewhat comparable, coming 
from God, which takes lodgment in the very beings of men and there 
brings about these transformations, these remarkable manifesta- 
tions, not at all incomparable with those manifestations that come 
from the operation of the physical forces. 

That a transformation is worked in the being of a man into 
whose heart comes the testimony of Christ is beyond all question. 
Examples are so numerous that they would, of course, not bear ex- 
tensive repeating at this time. 

THE MIRACULOUS CHANGE WROUGHT BY TESTIMONY 

When Saul received into his heart and soul that some- 
thing which we call a testimony, was he the same man who 
before had persecuted the Christians. No, he was a changed 
man. All his ideals, his conceptions, his works were changed 
by something that came into his life and wrought a miracle 
within it. When our missionaries go out into their fields of labor, 
stand upon their feet, and there proclaim the testimonies within 
them, do they not give expression to a force, a power, which has 
been operative within the very structures of their lives, and does 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not that very force in some way go from them to others to work 
a miracle? Is it just what they say, or the description which they 
give of the gospel plan, or their appeal to reason, which touches the 
hearts of this one and that one, out of great multitudes, and brings 
someone to say: "I know what they have said is true?" Or is 
there a transfusion in some indescribable way of a thing of essence 
from the personality of that humble servant of God into the con- 
vert that makes him feel and know? What is it that causes a man 
who has strayed from the path of truth, who has been inactive in 
the Church, after years, perhaps, of waywardness, when all at once 
confronted with the necessity of defending the faith, prompts him 
to rise and stand up like a man and say : "After all, I know the 
gospel is true"? Has there not been something ingrained within 
him that stays with him, a very integral part of his makeup ? 

TESTIMONY COMPARABLE TO PHYSICAL FORCE 

Sometimes I have thought that testimony, this something 
which has such tremendous force and power in the life of a man, is 
not uncomparable to those antitoxins which science has discovered 
to procure immunity from disease. I doubt not that but a few 
years ago if the world had been told that there were ways of ward- 
ing off yellow fever, typhoid, smallpox and other highly contagious 
diseases that there would have been general disbelief. Today these 
are proven facts. The mere injection of a serum into the blood will 
procure a substantial immunity which has saved the lives of thou- 
sands and hundreds of thousands of people from these diseases 
which once mowed down the human family in great epidemics, as 
the machine would mow dowh the ripened grain. May there not 
be something akin to this in the form of testimony that is injected 
into the very blood of a man, which wards off the disease of sin 
and makes a man immune from those microbes that come from the 
hand of Satan, scattered about among the human family to encour- 
age wrong-doing and departure from the established course of 
righteousness? I do not know that such a comparison is proper or 
illuminating, but this I do know, that sin is disease and that the 
testimony of Christ procures immunity from that disease. Not that 
man is deprived of his agency, but that while he reacts and responds 
to the great force and power of testimony, disease in the form of 
sin has no power over him, and into his life there comes a protec- 
tion against a more dreaded disease than any of those contagions 
which have been mitigated by the discoveries of science. This pro- 
tection, this immunity from disease and sin, is open to all. 

THE BLOOD OF ISRAEL SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE SPIRIT 

It seems to me, however, that there runs in some blood strains 
a higher susceptibility to the refining and saving influence of testi- 
mony than in other strains. I don't know that I understand it, but 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



119 



I have thought that the significance of the "blood of Israel" is that 
there is in that great blood strain, following the blessings and prom- 
ises of God, a susceptibility to the influence of the Holy Spirit, 
that does not run in other strains. Science has made some rather 
remarkable discoveries upon the inherited traits and qualities that 
go with blood strains. I have been reading of late some very in- 
teresting material with reference to the development of that phase 
' of scientific research. It is pointed out that experiments conducted 
on very large scales demonstrate beyond substantially any doubt 
that intelligence is inheritable, and, we with our training, can 
readily believe it. It would not take much to convince us that 
there descends from father to son tendencies and traits which make 
for or against the improvement of the race. These very things are 
said to run in the blood itself. I believe that testimony runs in 
the blood. I believe that it is inheritable, and that the tendency to 
faith may descend from father to son. It seems to me that Paul 
had that in mind when writing to Timothy, he said in substance : 
"I do perceive in thee the faith that was in thy grandmother Lois," 
thus recognizing that this tendency to faith, this susceptibility to 
testimony, courses along in the very blood strains of the race. 

IS TESTIMONY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PROOF? 

Is this that we call testimony susceptible of definite, tangible 
proof? To me it is. I recognize that by the use of my ordinary 
senses, — hearing, smelling, seeing, and touch, I demonstrate the 
existence of things. I prove to my satisfaction their materiality 
and the operation of the laws of nature so far as I know them. To 
me the operations of the Spirit of God within the structure of my 
life are as tangible, as susceptible of definite, concrete proof as the 
operations of many of the laws of nature. When I respond to this 
that I call my testimony, my heart warms, my body thrills. I feel 
the tingle of it. A satisfaction, a peace, a contentment, a joy that 
transcends description, envelops me. It is the proof to me that it 
is there, and so I assert it is susceptible of tangible proof and dem- 
onstration. Is it susceptible of scientific analysis? Yes, if the 
scientist will apply the test which is prescribed to demonstrate its 
truth. We may say to any scientist, to any man who inquires, 
just what God has said: "If you do my work and my will and keep 
my commandments you shall know whether it be the work of God 
or man." Are we justified in taking any other method than the 
method prescribed to determine the existence of testimony? I 
leave that thought for the reflection of those who would test the 
actuality of a testimony, for I know that it will come to every one 
who applies the prescribed method of attaining it. 

TESTIMONY PRODUCES GOOD FRUITS 

This testimony which is such an actuality always produces 
good fruits. Its results never vary. I know that it is said that 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

monstrous and terrible crimes have been committed in the name of 
religion. That may be true, but I say that no crime and no offense 
against the justice of God has ever been committed under the in- 
fluence of the testimony of Jesus and the Spirit of God. Men who 
have professed religion in organized or individual capacity have 
been guilty of heinous sin, but they were not under the influence 
of the testimony of Christ when they committed such sin. Testi- 
mony always brings to pass those things desirable for the race, be- 
cause it is consistent with truth, being the very spirit of truth. 

THE CRIME OF PLACING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF OBTAINING 

TESTIMONY 

This testimony is acquired by many with difficulty. I suppose 
that we often wish that it could be more easily obtained, and that 
it would come more generally to the people of the world, but God 
in his providence has made it somewhat difficult of attainment. 
Being so difficult to acquire, it seems to me to be a very serious 
thing to place one obstacle in the way of its attainment. I have 
wondered how it is that men who profess great learning and intelli- 
gence can throw an obstacle into the way of him who seeks the ac- 
quisition of this testimony. It may be that it is often done inno- 
cently. It may be that those who destroy faith are not fully aware 
of the consequences of their acts. If it be so, I trust God will be 
merciful to them, but I cannot think but that the Lord will hold 
responsible any man or woman who has increased the difficulty 
of another to obtain this light, this testimony of the divinity of 
Jesus Christ. 

It is a matter of great regret that in our schools and colleges 
there are those who pass under the designation of educated men 
and women, who seem to rejoice in the destruction of the testi- 
mony and the faith of young people. I warn them that a persist- 
ence on their part to destroy faith and to keep this great thing we 
call testimony from reaching the hearts of students, young men 
and young women, will constitute an offense in the sight of God 
for which they shall be held accountable. 

LET NOT THE THEORIES OF DOCTORS OF PHILOSOPHY DESTROY YOUR 

TESTIMONY 

I could wish that the faith of our young folks were so well 
established as to give them security, even in the face of these dan- 
gerous situations. We can say to them, God has revealed the truth, 
that truth will never change, all the discoveries of science will in 
the end but serve to confirm it. Therefore, young men, young 
women, keep your minds open, do not forsake the wisdom of the 
ages for the theories of a Ph. D. 

TESTIMONY INSEPARABLY ASSOCIATED WITH HAPPINESS AND JOY 

I thank God that I have a testimony. It is the greatest posses- 
sion of my own life. It is inseparably associated with all that 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



121 



makes for happiness and joy. It contemplates with me everything 
that really makes life worth living — my intelligence, my priesthood, 
my relationship to God, to man, to my family, — all comes from 
this testimony, that God has been good enough and kind enough to 
implant within my soul. I know that it exists. I know that it has 
essence, that it is a real thing, and that it will always be in me. I 
do not know that I will always respond to it as I ought. I pray to 
God that I shall always have the courage to do it, because I know 
that it will always lead me to right and to happiness. 

I pray too that everyone may feel the full import and impress 
of this great and wonderful blessing that God has given, a testi- 
mony of the Christ. Would that all. of our young people could 
know just what happiness it brings and just how it enriches their 
lives. May the Lord in his mercy make it possible for every young 
man and every young woman to receive a testimony of Jesus 
Christ as a bulwark against sin and danger and-temptation, I hum- 
bly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A soprano solo, "Calvary," was sung by Mrs. Edna Stromberg. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

The virility of the Church is the testimony of which Brother 
Stephen L. Richards has just spoken. We have in the mission field 
thousands who are giving their time and paying their own expenses, 
and preaching the gospel — because in their souls there burns this 
satisfying and impelling testimony. I predict that many of our 
older and more experienced church members who have this same 
testimony burning in their hearts will respond to the appeal that 
has been made by President Grant to go for about six months into 
the various parts of the United States and our neighboring coun- 
tries at their own expense and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
What but this testimony could induce people to render such a 
service ? 

A TRIP TO THE MEXICAN MISSION 

I returned recently from an extremely interesting trip with 
President Rey L. Pratt and Dr. George W. Middleton through the 
Mexican mission. Our neighbor on the south is a country with 
great resources and unusual possibilities. The climate, especially 
in those great valleys around the City of Mexico, is neither too 
warm nor too cold. The temperature rarely reaches 70 degrees and 
very rarely gets as low as 60 degrees. No provision is made for 
heated buildings, artificial heat being unnecessary. The history of 
the country thrills with romance. The ancient ruins of temples, 
cities, and palaces, showing a knowledge of engineering and con- 
struction which it is well nigh impossible to explain, has an in- 
tense interest to all of us who are familiar with, and interested in, 
the Book of Mormon. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The president of this mission is thoroughly filled with a love 
for the Mexican or Indian people who reside in our neighbor re- 
public. Average people have hardly a greater interest in their blood 
relatives than has President Rey L. Pratt in the Mexican people. 
An eloquent speaker, he knows their language more perfectly than 
many of them know it themselvees. 

You who have sons and daughters in that mission have reason 
to be proud of them. They are dignified, business-like, earnest and 
unselfish. They are carrying to the people of Mexico lessons in 
sanitation, agriculture, and even in ventilation. They are helping 
to build churches ; and, more important than all else, they are carry- 
ing to them lessons in honor and honesty, truth, virtue, and faith, 
which constitute the gospel. 

a tribute; TO JOHN j. mcclellan 

While I would like to say more about the Mexican mission, I 
shall not do so now because I feel that this occasion demands that I 
say something concerning the life and accomplishments of my 
friend, and yours, that master musician, the late John J. McClellan. 
I little thought six months ago when, in conference, we were stirred 
by the strains of the great organ, operated under his skillful touch, 
that he would not be here today. 

It is twenty-nine years since he came to Salt Lake City. A 
little more than thirty years ago he and I were boys together in 
Ann Arbor, Michigan. I was a student in the Department of Civil 
Engineering at the University, and he was studying in the Michi- 
gan School of Music. I have sat at the end of his piano by the hour, 
thrilled by the story which his music told. In those days he was 
kind enough to say that my enjoyment of his music was his greatest 
encouragement. 

His heart was deeply and truly religious as well as musical. 
Once when a group of voung people in that college city were hold- 
ing a testimony meeting, I said, "John, will you play for us?" 
Thinking I had asked him to pray, he arose and poured out the 
genuine fervor of his soul in a prayer that touched our hearts. 

At twenty he led the Catholic choir in Ann Arbor. He com- 
posed the mass presented in that great music center on Easter. He 
not only led the choir and prepared the parts for the singers, but 
also arranged the parts for the orchestra. Elsewhere this achieve- 
ment would have been greatly to his credit, but it was unusually so 
in that great musical center. 

The Columbian organ, constructed for the World's Fair of 1893, 
and secured by the Michigan School of Music, was the first great 
organ on which McClellan played. His teacher was Professor 
Stanley, and when the professor himself could not appear at recitals, 
McClellan was his substitute. Even in those, his boyhood days, he 
thrilled the audiences which filled University Hall. 

Shortly before his death Elbert Hubbard cancelled his reserva- 
tions to hear McClellan play. Later in the Fra he wrote : 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



123 



"If any man has the spirit of old Bach it is this man McClellan. He 
is a wizard of the keys. 

"I thought I had heard organ playing before, but the exquisite modul- 
ations, the tones and tints of sweet sounds that this man produces cannot 
be described. They must be heard — and more, they must be felt. McClellan 
does not play with his hands and feet; he plays with his heart and head, 
and the keys respond to love's caress. Only high intelligence, sympathy, 
and superb imagination can produce such music. 

"What Paderewski is to the piano, McClellan is to the pipe-organ. 

"The 'Mormons' make great use of instrumental music. Their choral 
societies deserve to rank as a pattern for all America." 

When his death was announced, telegrams and letters of sym- 
pathy came to his family from England, France, Germany, even 
from Japan and the islands of the sea. Wherever people are found 
who are interested in music, there it seems John J. McClellan is 
not only known but loved. 

A letter to the professor himself from one of his students in 
France, which came after his death, says in part : 

"We have quite a little colony here, and you are often the subject of 
our conversation. We are all intensely interested in your welfare. . . Dupre 
gave a recital on the new organ recently. It was of course a great perform- 
ance. He talked to us after the concert and inquired especially of you. He 
expressed deep interest in you personally, in your work and asked to be 
remembered to you most sincerely." (Dupre is one of the world's greatest 
organists.) 

The secretary of the Municipal Band of Long Beach, Calif., 
writes : 

"Mr. McClellan was known to nearly every member of this band, and 
they admired and esteemed him for his high character and they felt honored 
in his friendship. In his personal and professional life he has left a monu- 
ment in which his family and friends may take the utmost pride. . . . Many 
in Long Beach have been looking forward to the time when we might have 
a new auditorium, with John J. McClellan seated at a wonderful organ 
exercising the magic of his musicianship on the keyboard in the style in 
which he had so few peers." 

Mr. H. C. Bush wrote from Chicago: 

"He was. a genius in his personality as well as in his art, and his light 
shone brightly all over this broad land. . . He was ambitious beyond his 
physical strength, and like a good soldier, he died fighting." 

Wrote one tourist from West Virginia: 

"John J. McClellan was born with the soul of a genius and the heart 
of an artist. Probably a million people heard him in Tabernacle recitals. 
As one of the million I attended a recital eight years ago. I acknowledge 
therefore a debt which I can never repay." 

King Albert of Belgium was so pleased with his music that he 
decorated McClellan with the order of the crown.- He never played 
games, he was not interested in football, no one ever saw him dance. 
He devoted himself exclusively to his art. He and I were young 
men together in the old Salt Lake stake when it covered all of Salt 
Lake County. On many occasions while I was stake superintendent 
of the Mutuals he went with me to do the playing, Thomas Ash- 
worth to do the singing, and B. F. Grant to do the speaking. The 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



meeting houses in Salt Lake County were never large enough to 
hold the multitudes who came out to attend. 

He was always ready to render service. The last time I saw 
him it was to ask if he would be willing at an irregular hour and on 
an unusual day to give a recital for the members of the American 
Society of Civil Engineers. As usual he answered promptly, "I 
will." As I left his studio with William R. Wallace I said, "He is 
not able, nor will he be, to play at that recital. He is not well. I 
fear we may never hear him play again." 

While I have not seen him since, the words he handed me on 
that occasion concerning the great organ, I used in a public address. 
Among other things he wrote: 

"The organ in every department is well nigh perfect. It is one of the 
world's greatest — a master instrument. For tone it has no equal. Notables 
from all over the earth, including four Presidents of the United States, 
Senators, Congressmen, the nobility of Europe and the king and queen of 
Belgium have been entertained by its music. It is used in more public 
affairs than any other dozen organs. It has a corps of five organists who 
use it daily." 

I have been told by many who have had experience in the mis- 
sion field that without exception they find friends in those who 
have heard the great organ. And not tens of thousands, but hun- 
dreds of thousands, during his twenty-five years of service, have 
heard this instrument. To me it is a source of keen regret that I 
was too far away to attend his funeral. How appropriate that the 
services were held in this great, this historic building, every fiber of 
which has vibrated with his divine music. How appropriate that 
the great organ should be draped and should, during his funeral, 
be silent. 

While he has held no official position, yet for hours before the 
funeral hundreds came to take a last look at that friendly, intelli- 
gent face from which had come so many smiles and looks of kind- 
ness. When the hour for the funeral arrived, this great building 
was packed. The multitude came to do honor to a genius, a gentle- 
man, a friend. 

This man's father and mother were pioneers. He was purely 
a product of the "Mormon" Church. A commanding personality, a 
courtly manner, a disposition affable and charming, his life was 
full of love, laughter, and sunshine. The tenderness of his heart 
and the refinement of his mind, were expressed in his music. His 
eyes were always full of smiles. 

May heaven be good to the wife of my lifelong friend. May 
kind Providence remember his excellent son and his charming 
daughters to enable them always to remember the virtues of their 
talented father. May kind Providence comfort the heart of his 
widowed and pioneer mother, bringing comfort to her who bore 
him, and who, mother-like, was devoted to him, with the fondness 
of unceasing love, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I desire very much to say a few words upon this important 
occasion about the great responsibilities which rest upon the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is no more im- 
portant responsibility than that to which the President of the 
Church has referred, in issuing the call during this conference for 
men who have already rendered missionary service, who are at 
present qualified to preach the gospel, to re-enter that field and 
assist the youth of Israel who are at present laboring as mission- 
aries of the Church, particularly in the United States missions, to 
discharge this great responsibility which is resting upon the Church. 

MISSIONARY WORK A FIRST GREAT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH 

I rejoice in my heart that this call has come, for it has been a 
dream of mine about which I have talked a good many times. Only 
six months ago I recall it was the theme of some remarks which I 
made in the conference. I do hope that the call shall be answered 
by the able men of IsraeL that we shall recognize that God has 
placed the responsibility upon this Church to give to all flesh the 
news that he has spoken. I hope that this responsibility will be ac- 
cepted by all classes. I have said, upon this point, that I believe the 
doctors and the lawyers might do well to consider responding to 
such an invitation, and that they owe something to the men of their 
own profession whom they can reach better than any one else, to 
carry the message of the gospel to them. Likewise men in the 
business professions whom we have excused from long-term mis- 
sions, they may, with profit to themselves and without injury to 
their business, accept of this invitation to render service for a 
shorter period of time. 

ADVANTAGES IN MISSIONARY WORK 

I believe that every man who responds to this call will prolong 
his life. There is nothing so invigorating to the health, so uplift- 
ing to the spirits of men, as to preach the gospel. I believe that the 
money spent will be well invested in the good health that shall 
come, in the prolongation of life. 

While it has been a tremendous sacrifice on the part of parents 
particularly to send their sons and daughters into the missionary 
field, a constant and continual drain upon their resources, a drain 
that probably no other community on earth could stand, and we 
could not stand it were it not for the blessings of God; neverthe- 
less, I have never met in my associations, with hundreds of parents 
of missionaries, a single one who has ever regretted the money he 
spent in sending missionaries into the field to declare the gospel 
message. So far as the personal advantages to the missionary are 
concerned, I am sure that the money never could have been spent 
to equal advantage. If a young man had been sent to a college, or 
given a training in any other field, it would not have brought him 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



so large personal advantage as his missionary experience. It has 
developed those finer qualities of the mind, faith, confidence in one's 
self, as well as confidence in God, and has given him the opportunity 
to study human nature and to be able to succeed in winning those 
who are opposed to his views, and that in itself is a valuable asset to 
any man, when his missionary experience is concluded, I care not 
what his business may be. 

In addition to that, the valuable testimony, about which we 
have heard, can be obtained in the missionary field as nowhere else. 
It is worth more to any young man in Israel to have in his very 
heart and soul a burning conviction, a knowledge that God lives, 
and that Jesus is the Christ, than to be possessed of much wealth 
and to be dfcvoid of this blessing. There are few, indeed I know of 
none, who have gone into the missionary field to discharge this 
obligation and have done their duty who have not been endowed 
with an abiding testimony that God does live, and that Jesus Christ 
is his Son. This in itself is worth everything. Indeed we have 
proved, in our missionary experiences in this Church, that it is more 
blessed to give than to receive ; for if we have given to the world — ■ 
our time and service — that has been a blessing to mankind, and it 
has returned with added blessings upon our heads. We have been 
enriched as communities by the breadth and depth of understand- 
ing, and have become cosmopolitan in our conception of things be- 
cause of the varied experiences that these returning missionaries 
bring from all lands ; for, the best of all lands is brought back to 
us. In addition to that, we are discharging the great obligation that 
God has placed upon us, to bring to his sons and daughters the 
light and the knowledge of the eternal truth, preparing them to 
come back into his presence and to rejoice in the restoration of the 
everlasting gospel. 

NONE WflO ARE PREPARED TO GO ARE EXEMPT 

In responding to this call, I trust that bishops of wards will not 
excuse themselves. Perchance, one may go. Perchance, it may be 
possible that one of the stake presidency may respond, and indeed 
no one should feel himself exempt. It will be profitable to respond, 
to any who shall accept of this invitation. We need you, we need 
your strength in this cause. In addition to that, let those who are 
in need of assistance be helped if necessary by the cooperation of 
their brethren, because the responsibility is upon each ward to fur- 
nish at least one of these brethren, the kind the President has been 
calling for, and by a cooperative effort on the part of every one in 
the ward it may be easily possible to help one who could not go 
without assistance from his associates. I want to invite you also, 
my brethren and sisters, to prepare yourselves for a continuation 
of this work, for while the call now is but for a short period, in the 
ensuing year, I hope and I trust, that the number we are asking

we are asking for are the kind of men we need to strengthen young 
and inexperienced men in the mission field, and to carry the gospel 
to the people whom it is difficult for these young and inexperi- 
enced men to reach. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARING FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP 

Now the other point, the other responsibility that I have in my 
own mind, and about which I feel great concern, is the responsi- 
bility of taking care of those who come into the Church, all those 
who are born heirs of the gospel, children of the Latter-day Saints, 
keeping the flock within the fold, training them, preparing them 
for the future work which God has for this Church, and to prepare 
themselves for his coming. I feel great concern that we shall be 
successful in saving our own. I observe in our own Church records 
that we have had, so far as births are concerned, nearly four times 
as many children born to Latter-day Saint parents as all our 
baptisms number in the world, and that has been true for each of 
the last several years. While our baptisms in the world have been 
good — indeed they are a little better each year — we have nothing to 
complain about, so far as they are concerned, but the future 
growth and strength of this Church depends upon our ability to 
save our own. I feel that there is no greater responsibility placed 
upon us than to feed the sheep and to feed the lambs, and to keep 
them within the fold. 

NEED OF WATCHMEN ON THE TOWERS OF ZION 

I would like to say to the presidents of stakes, the bishops of 
wards and leaders in Zion, that there is need of the watchmen who 
are upon the towers of Zion, to exercise themselves vigilantly just 
now, a little more so perhaps than we have found it necessary 
heretofore. Yet it has always been necessary to be alert and active 
if we would preserve the flock. But by reason of conditions that 
obtain in the world, just at this time, I feel that we need to guard 
our flock against the inroads of the wolves in sheep's clothing. 
For, so far as the world is concerned, it is very evident to me that 
we have reached what I call the age of self-indulgence. The experi- 
ences through which we are passing reveal the fact that there is a 
spirit of indulgence in the world that leads men to the violation of 
the law in order to gratify appetite. The statistics of the United 
States Government reveals the fact that so far as the consump- 
tion of tobacco is concerned it has increased four hundred per cent, 
in the last ten years. It has doubled in the last two years, and the 
most sorrowful item they call attention to is the fact that perfumed 
cigarettes, manufactured to be sold to women, has shown the 
greatest increase in consumption, and that they cannot be manu- 
factured in quantities sufficient. to satisfy the demand. The cost 
of tobacco alone, in the United States last year, was a little over 
three billions of dollars. The increase in the consumption _of tea 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and coffee has also gone forward, to say nothing of the violation 
of the Eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States, prohibiting the manufacture of and indulgence in alcoholic 
beverages. Men know that these things are contrary to our physi- 
cal health, contrary to the peace and the safety of our nation ; but 
the appetite is stronger than the will. Passion and desire rule in 
many quarters today. Men in positions of trust and confidence, 
in ever-increasing numbers have shown a lack of fidelity and 
trustworthiness until surety rates, guaranteeing the honesty and 
integrity of men in business, have been doubled in the last two 
years. I could go on calling vour attention to these things indi- 
cating what I say, that the spirit of the age is the spirit of self- 
indulgence, and it finds its final expression in self-degredation, 
in the violation of the law of God, in the committing of sexual sins 
that are destroying the life of men and women. 

LET US KEEP CLEAN AND FREE FROM THE SINS OF THE WORLD 

I am not an alarmist, nor do I see anything, particularly just 
now, that would indicate that there is a serious condition in the 
Church of Christ, but I see outside the storms that are gathering. 
I see the influences that are at work. The Lord said that he 
gathered us into these stakes of Zion to preserve us against the 
storms when they should break forth without measure upon the 
inhabitants of the earth. These storms are reaching us. Their in- 
fluence will come. Individuals will come with their pernicious doc- 
trines that will destroy, if listened to, the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints. I am anxious, therefore, that the young men and young 
women of Israel shall keep clean and undefiled from the sins of the 
world. The greatest evil that is threatening us, yes, and threaten- 
ing the world, is the evil of immorality. So I am pleading with 
you that if you want to keep these boys and girls able to receive 
this witness and testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we must 
keep them clean, morally clean, and we must adhere to our stand- 
ards. For we have been taught — I received it from my mother's 
knee, you have heard it, you men of Israel, from your childhood — ■ 
that next to the crime of murder itself is the crime of sexual im- 
purity, and that rather than to be found guilty of these things we 
would better be found dead. Let us therefore adhere to this, our 
high standard, and we shall survive the storms, no matter how 
severe they become. We can save ourselves and save these young 
men and young women of Israel. 

PROSPERITY SHOULD RESULT IN SALVATION TO US AND OUR CHILDREN 

I rejoice in the bright prospects that are before us, so far as 
crops are concerned. That is good, that is splendid. It is of im- 
portance as a means, however, to a glorious end, and the glorious 
end is the salvation of ourselves and the salvation of our sons and 
daughters. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



129 



I wish to read a few words on this point from the Lord Jesus 
Christ, given to the early elders of this Church, and equally applica- 
ble to us in this present time. I am reading from the 16th Section 
of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, a revelation given to Peter 
Whitmer, Jr., in the month of June, 1829 : 

"Hearken, my servant Peter, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, 
your Lord and your Redeemer. 

"For behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine 
arm is over all the earth. 

"And I will tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee 
alone — 

"For many times you have desired of me to know that which would be 
of the most worth- unto you. 

"Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words 
which I have given unto you according to my commandments. 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the 
most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that 
you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom 
of my Father." 

There is nothing in all this world that can be compared to the 
value of a human soul, redeemed, sanctified, and made worthy to 
receive the blessings of God our Father. There is no investment 
which you men can put your money or your time into that will pay 
you so well in time or in " eternity as to invest in a human soul, 
whether that shall be in the missionary field or at home, in the care 
of those precious ones who have come under our supervision. We 
have already heard scripture in this conference, from the Lord 
Jesus Christ, wherein he declares that the worth of souls is great 
in his sight, and if we should labor all our days and as the result 
of that labor bring, save it be but one of those precious souls, how 
great will be our joy! I know that I need not convert you to the 
fact that this is a true doctrine, but we constantly need to be ap- 
pealed to, to be willing to give ourselves and our means in the ac- 
complishment' of this, the greatest work there is in all the world. 

CONCERNING GOING ON THE MISSION TO SOUTH AMERICA 

My brethren and sisters, I respond to the call that has come 
from the Presidency of the Church, to leave home and loved ones 
and my native land, to go with Brother Wells and Brother Pratt 
into the great South American country. I do not ^o with any feel- 
ing of elation that it is going to be a great pleasure Trip ; I go in 
fear and in trembling, trusting in the Lord, knowing that we shall 
be utterly helpless, save the Lord shall be with us. I have felt in 
my soul that the time would come — and I thank God that it has 
come — that that great country may hear the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I believe that it, too, is Zion, as the Prophet Joseph 
Smith has told us. I believe that it is altogether fitting and 
proper that more than half of the missionaries of the Church should 
be in the United States missions ; for it is unto this land, the land 
of Zion, that the spirit of gathering has called Israel from all over 



\

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the earth. They have been coming here, and here are the majority 
of our converts. As I recall it, three years ago one million two 
hundred fifty thousand people were permitted to come into the 
United States, and the quota was full. Yet, at that time, twenty- 
five million people applied to come. Since then, however, the gov- 
ernment has seen fit to further reduce the privileges of immigra- 
tion to this country, until today only three per cent, of the foreign 
population of any nation in this country, in 1900, may now come 
in, which means that not more than about two hundred thousand 
can enter this land in any single year from all nations of the earth. 
Where are they going? According to the evidence that I am gather- 
ing since this call came, millions of them are going to South Amer- 
ica. I have hoped and prayed that we shall find that there, too, the 
spirit of gathering has called men and women from all nations of 
the earth. They are there in large numbers from all nations, and 
if God is willing to open their hearts and bless us with the ability 
to reach them and carry the message of the gospel, it is our desire 
that they who are from the Gentile nations may also, with others, 
have this privielge of hearing the message of the gospel and come 
into the fold of Christ. I know not what purpose God may have 
in their being in that great southland, the other part of Zion. These 
matters will all unfold in the Lord's own due time. And then it 
may only be the beginning of that other glorious work that we are 
anticipating shall come, for the Book of Mormon came to us, not 
for our sakes, but especially for the sons and daughters of father 
Lehi, who have dwindled in unbelief. May the day speedily come 
that this revelation shall also go forth in that land to the millions 
of sons and daughters who have the blood of father Lehi in their 
veins, that the day of their redemption may come. 

TESTIMONY 

May God bless the Saints at home, that they may preserve in 
the fold safely these precious ones that have been given to us, that 
they may be ready in preparation for the further extension of the 
Lord's work, and may his work go forth, that his kingdom may 
come, that all men may hear and the hones;, obedient souls may 
have a witness and a testimony that he lives. I know with my 
brethren that God lives, as surely as I know that I live. My testi- 
mony is not based upon books. It has come to me by the revela- 
tions of the Lord Jesus Christ to my spirit, through the manifesta- 
tions of the Holy Ghost upon my soul. In the thirteen years I 
have already spent in the missionary field there have come to me 
innumerable witnesses and testimonies of the truthfulness of this 
great work. I know that Christ lives as well as I shall know it when 
the veil of his tabernacle shall be parted, and he shall be revealed, 
when I may have the privilege of hearing his voice and looking 
upon his face, or be invited as he did invite the Nephites to come 
up and touch him, to see and handle his hands, to feel the prints

of the nails. If that shall some day be my privelege, as I hope it 
shall, I shall not know any better then than I know today, that he 
lives, that he visited the Prophet Joseph Smith, that he did restore 
his gospel, and that what the world knows as "Mormonism" is in- 
deed the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Knowing this, there is no sacrifice too great. To leave father, 
mother, houses and lands, the world and all things for it, is not 
too big a price to pay for the thing that is the most precious and 
the most glorious. 

THE DESTINY OF ZION CERTAIN 

God help us that we shall keep in our hearts, burning sacredly, 
the desire to fulfil these great obligations that rest upon us, that 
Zion shall arise and shine, for her destiny is as certain as the rising 
of the sun. If only we keep the commandments of God, every 
promise shall be verified, and fulfilled upon our heads. May God 
help us to do it and speed the day of the redemption of all his sons 
and daughters, and bring the ungodly and the sinners to repent- 
ance ; for they shall come to repentance, if not through the preach- 
ing of the gospel, through the judgments of Almighty God, for he 
is speaking, and he shall speak to the nations until they shall hear. 
God bless you, my brethren and sisters, and his peace be with Zion 
and all her interests, at home and abroad, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen'. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding -Bishop of the Church 

In occupying this important place, my brethren and sisters, I 
greatly need your faith and sympathy that I may be able to say 
something that shall be of profit. To that end I desire to enjoy the 
light of the Holy Ghost. 

I would like to read a few words to which President Grant 
referred in his opening remarks of the conference. The Prophet 
Micah, in speaking to the people of Israel, and calling their atten- 
tion to the things which the Lord desired of them, wherein he 
stated that more than their sacrifices and offerings of rams and oil, 
the Lord desired their hearts, he made the following statement : 

"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good ; and what doth 
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and 
to walk humbh'- with thy God?" 

I would like to read also a portion of that which President 
Grant referred to — that brief but important revelation given to 
Joseph Smith, the father of the Prophet: 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he 
that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in 
store that he pe'risheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the 
glory of God, qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, 
brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence." 

In the important responsibility that has come to me I am sen- 
sible of the consideration of my brethren. I cannot express to you 
the appreciation I feel of their confidence and the confidence which 
I feel the Lord has in me. My only desire is that I may be worthy 
of that confidence and the confidence of all of you, my brethren 
and sisters, and of all the members of this Church. In accepting 
the place that has been assigned to me I realize the high standard 
which has been set by Bishop Nibley and his counsellors. I am glad 
to have the privilege of working with his associates, Bishops David 
A. Smith and John Wells, and all of the members of the department 
to which I have been assigned. I realize the great work that is 
there to do. I appreciate what has been done, the care and atten- 
tion and the accuracy of the work, temporal largely as it is, that is 
assigned to that important department of the Church. 

I desire with all my heart to do my part, to give the very best 
that is in me to advance this work, and if it were possible to even 
increase the care and the efficiency in looking after every interest 
that shall be intrusted to us in that department, to magnify the 
callings that come to us, and in every way to promote sympathy, 
kindliness, love and good will among all the members and officers 
of the Church. That is my only desire. I have never sought any 
office in this Church. I have always desired, since the years of 
my maturity, to endeavor to help in the building up of the work of 
the Lord. Since I have been able to appreciate the responsibilities 
of life and of the Church I have endeavored to labor and to live 
constantly with this expression in view contained in this revelation 
given by the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph, to his father — to 
labor "with an eye single to the glory of God." 

We were reminded yesterday afternoon by President Ivins and 
Brother George Albert Smith of the fact that we are created in the 
image of God, and that when the Lord created man he gave him 
dominion over all things of the earth. As stated by them, man is 
the only creature who has within himself the power of reason 
and of initiative. Men cannot lift themselves off the ground by 
their own boot-straps, but they can lift themselves out of their 
condition, mentally, spiritually and physically. 

There is an opportunity for every man and every woman upon 
the face of the earth to grow, to develop, to progress. Every one 
of us can testify of that because all of us, directly or through our 
parents or grandparents, have accepted the gospel out in the world 
— have accepted that clear call that has come to us of the truth — 
and have had the power within ourselves, through the blessing 
of the Lord, to grow and increase in knowledge and power and 
understanding and faith in all the things that are true and divine. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



133 



We have been enabled to grow and to break away from the in- 
fluences and the traditions of life which have interfered with the 
progress of man through the centuries. 

The Lord has given man dominion over all things, though we 
may some of us think that we have not very much dominion, so far 
as the things of this earth are concerned. Some of us are very 
grateful when we have the opportunity to enjoy and to call our 
own a very small portion of God's earth. If we have a home of our 
own some of us think we are very fortunate, and some even 
haven't that much. We may think that we are far removed from 
that condition, when man had dominion over the earth and over 
all things pertaining thereunto and when he could look to the ut- 
most bounds of the everlasting hills and call that dominion his 
own. But every one of us has a certain portion of the things of 
life and of this earth which the Lord has given to us. 

We may not consider, or man may not always consider, that it 
comes from the Lord. They may forget that "the earth is the 
Lord's and the fullness thereof," but if we realize our relation, if we 
sense our position, we cannot deny the fact that all that we have 
and all that we are comes from him. If we appreciate our re- 
sponsibilities we must recognize the fact that we are only stewards 
here upon the earth, that we cannot take from this earth anything 
of a material nature; that all we can take from here is that which 
we have stored up in our minds which has helped to develop us, 
the qualities which we have acquired and the service that we have 
rendered. For the material things will remain. They will be of 
no beneifit to us hereafter. Unless wisely used they may prove a 
curse, not only to us but to our descendants. 

What is our responsibility? What is the responsibility of men 
generally? All men should recognize their stewardship in all that 
they possess, whether it be little or great, whether it be of a small 
nature or whether their wealth amounts to millions. Some men 
in the earth today are recognizing that fact. Some of those who 
have acquired great fortunes through business transactions and in 
other ways, have recognized, in a measure at least, their account- 
ability and their stewardship. They have given and are giving 
large amounts of their fortunes for the welfare of humankind, for 
research and investigation which shall inure to the benefit of the 
human family, and for the promotion of greater and better con- 
ditions of health and of peace and of general welfare. The obliga- 
tion is upon everv one of us, that we should ourselves have con- 
stantly in mind this important injunction, that we labor "with an 
eye single to the glory of the Lord." The laborer, the farmer, the 
miner, the clerk, the professional and business people — all can put 
their very best thought and effort each day into the work that is 
before them, with the incentive to better qualify themselves and 
to achieve all in their power for the promotion of God's work 
and the welfare of his children. All that we do, all that we have 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and all that we are is the Lord's — not only our means but our 
time — as has been expressed here today by Apostle Ballard and 
has been expressed previously by others of the brethren. We should 
not be content with one mission, but if we have the means and if 
we labor "with an eye single to the glory of the God," diligently 
and faithfully and wisely, the Lord will bless us and will increase 
our store and our means, and enable us to give- more time, greater 
talent, greater energy, to the advancement of his purpose. We 
shall then not be content with preaching the gospel on one mission 
only, abroad, but we shall be'laboring continually here at home, as 
well as abroad, and by our testimony and our teachings, as well as 
by our lives and examples, evidence that we realize our responsi- 
bility, that we appreciate the opportunity that has come to us, and 
that we are striving to exemplify these things in our lives. 

Let us, every one, endeavor to impress upon our children, boys 
and girls, the thought that all that we have and all that they have 
belongs to the Lord and that they should not claim these things 
selfishly. If we have that spirit in mind constantly and if we strive 
to impress upon those who come after us, that they should use their 
means and their time, with the purpose in view to be of the greatest 
benefit and blessing to the work of God, and to the promotion of 
the welfare of mankind, then shall we have joy and satisfaction. 
We shall increase in these qualities which shall make us most 
nearly the men and women that God would have us be. 

May the Lord bless us and help us that we may grow in the 
knowledge of these things ! May we constantly have this in mind, 
that we shall be willing to serve the Lord and be prepared to give 
to him not only one-tenth of our means, not only one-tenth of our 
time, not only one-tenth of all that we possess, but that if it should 
be the Lord's will we shall be prepared to consecrate our properties, 
in the assurance that we should receive our stewardship and be 
dealt with in justice and integrity and in propriety for our welfare 
and progress and development and for the welfare of all human 
kind, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The hymn, "High on the mountain top," was sung by the choir 
and congregation. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Joseph K. Nicholes, 
President of the St. George stake. 

Conference adjourned until Tuesday morning, October 6, 1925, at 
10 a. m. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

The Tabernacle was comfortably filled as President Heber J. 
Grant opened the meeting on Tuesday morning, October 6, 1925, at 
10 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." 

Elder Heber J. Meeks, president of the Kanab stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A sacred baritone solo entitled, "There is no death," was sung by 
J. H. Wood. i ' 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My Brethren and Sisters: I ask that while I stand before you 
this forenoon I may be guided by God's holy Spirit, so that the 
words I speak may be of value to those who have come here this 
day in hope of spiritual food. As I look back over my life, it seems 
to me that in halls of learning or among the affairs of men I have 
had ample Self-confidence and sometimes just a little self-assur- 
ance; but when engaged in the work of the Lord, in this great 
latter-day program, I always feel my utter and complete depend- 
ence upon the Lord and his Spirit, if I would do my work well. 
In the high calling which has come to me in the Church — and I do 
not understand why that calling has come to me — I feel that I must 
be as clay in the hands of the potter, must be as an instrument in 
God's hands, by which divine purposes may be accomplished. So, 
I ask that I may have your assistance in the words that I may 
speak to you this morning. 

TESTIMONY AND GRATITUDE 

It seems that the theme of this conference has been that this 
Church is a latter-day witness to the reality and personality of our 
Father in heaven, of his Son Jesus Christ, and of the divine validity 
of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ. I desire to bear witness 
with my brethren who have spoken that I know that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ was his Son, that we are engaged iiTworking out 
an eternal plan for the salvation of mankind ; and that Joseph Smith 
was called in his boyhood, by God, to initiate the work of the 
restoration of the gospel in our day. I am grateful beyond, my 
power of expression for this testimony, and I bear it gladly to all 
who care to listen. 

THRILLED BY THE CALL FOR MISSIONARIES 

I have been fed and instructed by all that has been said by my 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



brethren during these two days ; but I must say that the one thing 
that pierced my heart and thrilled me during this conference was 
the call of our President, the living Prophet of God, for an army 
of mature men, one thousand strong, to go into the mission field to 
preach the everlasting gospel to those who do not yet understand 
it. I felt as if I heard the voice of the prophets of old, who asked if 
there were faith in Israel. I believe that there is faith in Israel, 
I believe that the call that was made will be answered, that the 
men who go out will be blessed abundantly, that the wives and the 
children who remain at home, in sacrifice that their husbands and 
sons may go out, will likewise be blessed and comforted, and that 
Zion and the world at large will be blessed by this call and the 
obedience that we shall give to it. When the call came, it seemed 
to me that I could see the army going out — an army to battle for 
righteousness, to battle against wickedness, an army which has no 
weapon save that of truth, an army devoting itself simply to the 
cause of truth. I am certain, my brethren and sisters, that we were 
all touched in our hearts when that call came from the lips of our 
President. 

THE WORLD NEEDS THE LIGHT OF THE CHURCH 

My own experience tells me that the world has need of such an 
army, waging the battle for righteousness in the name of the truth 
of Almighty God. It has been my duty, with the consent and 
knowledge of the First Presidency, to spend a part of this year in 
traveling over the Western states as an agent of a department of 
the government, which has given me intimate association with 
many men not of our faith. I have come out of this association and 
this labor with the conviction that the world now, as perhaps never 
before, needs the light that issues from this Church, and the truth 
for which we stand. We are indeed ready, as a world of God's chil- 
dren, for the army for which call has been made at this conference. 

HIGH QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP CAUSED BY PERFECT DOCTRINE 

Not long ago in one of the states to the north of us, in the com- 
pany of a local delegation, I called upon one of our branch presi- 
dents. The little branch numbered about a hundred people, had 
been organized only a few months ago, and was presided over by a 
young man who has been brought up in one of the stakes of Zion. 
After we had had a chat with this brother, as we left, the leader 
of the local delegation, who served as our guide, said to me : "We 
are keeping our eyes on this young man. He has been here less 
than two years, but he has in him the qualities of leadership. We 
believe that if we are not careful that 'Mormon' boy will sodn be 
the leader of our community." Then he added : "Will you tell me 
why it is that so many of your people appear to possess such high 
qualities of leadership, that we must recognize them, even in so 
young a man as the one we have just left? Is it because of your 
doctrine, or is it because of your wonderful leaders, and their wise 



ELDER JOHN A. W1DTS0E 



137 



leadership, irrespective of doctrine?" I answered this man as best 
1 could. My thought went back to a statement made by a modern 
prophet, President Brigham Young, when a similar question was 
asked him many years ago ; and when he paraphrased the words 
of one of the ancient apostles : 

"In conversation not long since with a visitor from the Eastern 
States, said he, 'You as a people consider that you are perfect.' 'Oh, 
no,' said I, 'not by any means. Let me define to you. The doc- 
trine that we have embraced is perfect; but when we come to the 
people, we have as many imperfections as you can ask for. We are 
not perfect, but the gospel that we preach is calculated to perfect 
the people, so that they can obtain a glorious resurrection and enter 
into the presence of the Father and the Son.' " 

A SYSTEM OF TRUTH LEADING TO PERFECTION 

Here is a definition given by one of the great prophets of our 
Church. We do possess a perfect doctrine ; and what a gift it is ! 
I wonder if the Latter-day Saints are fully appreciative of the fact 
that they are in possession of a system of truth which, if applied 
and used, embraced and wholly consumed by man, may lead man 
into perfection. As I read human history, ever since the beginning 
of time, the great thinkers and leaders of the world have sought to 
formulate systems of government, doctrine or thought, to lead 
people into a perfect state of living. Thus, we have the great men 
of the ages : A Confucius, arises in China, in search of a perfect 
guide to human conduct and achievement. We have a Buddha in 
India ; a Mohammed in Arabia, a Plato in Greece, and many others 
seeking for this one thing that we declare to all the world that we 
possess. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a system perfect in itself, 
which, if used by human beings, may lead every soul into a per- 
fected state of life, both on this earth and in the life to come. Per- 
fection is the ideal of Latter-day Saints — nothing short of it. A 
tremendous ideal it is ; smiled at by those who do not understand ; 
nevertheless our ideal. 

We live by our ideals, we die by our ideals. Nations grow 
large, or they dwindle, according to their ideals. A humble peo- 
ple, years ago, found the truth of God, — the only God, the living 
God, the personal God, — and Israel ever since its foundation has 
been a teacher of nations because of that high ideal. In our own 
day, within the memory of children in this congregation, a nation 
arose which formed as its ideal a godless superman, a man who 
would be like unto God, but without God; and as a result of that 
ideal came the bloodiest battles and the most destructive warfare 
recorded in history. 

CAN PERFECTION BE ATTAINED? 

Our ideal is perfection ; but, no doubt, the question arises, in 
the minds of every one of us : "Is it possible for man to win per- 
fection? Do we have reason to believe that there lies in the gospel 



138

of Jesus Christ the power to lead us into a perfected state of exist- 
ence?" As I have attended these conferences, these many years, 
I have often heard statistics read concerning the birth rate and 
death rate and other vital statistics, which point out that those who 
live the gospel of Jesus Christ are indeed being perfected. I had 
the privilege a short time ago to read the manuscript of a book 
written by Dr. Franklin S. Harris, the President of the Brigham 
Young University, in which he has taken the statistical facts con- 
cerning the Latter-day Saints, recognized by the world at large, and 
used them, according to the methods accepted by the world at large, 
to test out the fruits of "Mormonism." From chapter to chapter it 
is shown that the fruits of "Mormonism," when "Mormonism" is 
properly lived, are a condition of increasing perfection, or a per- 
fected state of living. 

AN AID TO PHYSICAL PERFECTION 

Let me call your attention to one principle which has in it the 
power of producing physical perfection. More than ninety years 
ago the Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired to write for us the 
Word of Wisdom. We know by our own experience that physical 
perfection may be achieved in part— that we may at least be on the 
road to physical perfection — by obedience to the Word of Wisdom. 
It is interesting to note that, ever since that Word was given, men 
of science have discovered, and are discovering, evidence upon evi- 
dence confirming the soundness of the statements in the Word of 
Wisdom. Alcohol is no longer regarded as a good thing for the 
human body ; and I am glad to know that our Nation is now a dry 
Nation, that we by acts of our Congress and Legislatures have de- 
clared that alcohol is not a good thing for man. Brother Ballard 
stated yesterday that the use of tobacco is increasing. Neverthe- 
less, the findings of men of science, in their laboratories and studies, 
are to the effect that tobacco is not good for the human body. Like- 
wise it has been shown that tea and coffee and all other stimulants 
are harmful and retard physical development. 

SMOKING A CAUSE OF MENTAL DEFICIENCY 

The last bulletin of Antioch College, one of the colleges in the 
East, has just reached me. This bulletin is devoted entirely to a 
study of the effect of tobacco on the students in that institution. 
I shall not take the time to read this to you, but only to quote the 
summary, on the first page, of the man who wrote it. Further on 
in the body of the bulletin he tells how very carefully the work 
had been done. He says : 

"A careful study of smoking among men students at Antioch does not 
disclose any permanent effects of smoking upon blood pressure, lung 
capacity, or pulse rate; but a definite relationship is established between 
smoking and low scholarship. Among men students, 31.8 per cent of 
nonsmokers fail to maintain required grades, while 62.3 per cent of heavy 
smokers similarly fail. Inhalers fail most often. Before this study began 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



139 



the more susceptible smokers had been eliminated, since many more 
smokers than non-smokers had failed and been dropped from college." 
And he concludes with this statement: 

"With these figures before us, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that 
smoking is actually a cause of mental inefficiency." 

A Latter-day Saint cannot read a statement like this without 
remembering the promise which" is contained in Section 89, that 
those who obey this Word of Wisdom shall find "wisdom and great 
treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures of knowledge" — it 
seems to be a literal confirmation. So, in every field of Church 
activity, or teachings, whether with respect to the physical, mental 
or spiritual aspects of life, we find that within the teachings of the 
Church lie the germs and powers of achieving perfection on the 
part of human beings. 

THE GOSPEL A POWER THROUGH WHICH PERFECTION IS ACHIEVED 

Brother Stephen L. Richards spoke to us yesterday about the 
testimony that may be won by a correct approach and search for 
testimony. I thought, then, of the scientific equivalent of a testi- 
mony. In the laboratory the chemist may take an element and, 
by heat and pressure, change it completely in its physical prop- 
erties. It is possible to take black amorphous charcoal and, under 
the influence of heat and pressure, to change it into transparent, 
crystalline diamonds. If lifeless, inert matter may be changed, a 
greater transformation may be expected in the souls of men, when, 
under God's influence, by the power that comes from the use of 
the truths that God has revealed to his children, men obey the 
gospel. Such a change, coming into human lives, is greater than 
that from the black charcoal to the luminous white diamond. The 
lives of Latter-day Saints, by the tens of thousands, attest that such 
a transformation is possible ; that there lies in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ the power for man to N achieve perfection, even in this life, 
physically, mentally, spiritually and in every way, if only he will 
give himself to the ideal of perfection. 

The question uppermost in my mind is whether we as a people 
are using" to the full the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ ; 
whether indeed we are perfecting ourselves as we should. _ We 
dream of a great day, a day to come when Lord and Master Jesus 
Christ shall come to reign and rule upon the earth, when he shall 
be the King, and all shall bow to him. That is our great dream. 
We are here to hasten the coming of that day ; to prepare the way 
for the coming of the Lord. The question with respect to myself 
and my fellows is always whether we are so living, so conducting 
ourselves, so approaching perfection, so strong in courage, so 
fearless that that work is being done in a manner to hasten .the 
great day. The Lord uses us, men and women of flesh and blood, 
made in his image, possessing his eternal doctrines, to work out 
his purposes. We must qualify ourselves so that the Lord may 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



work his purposes rapidly and well through us, men and women. 
What a tremendous responsibility we are under. We need to go 
out fearlessly and we can go out with courage, for we have the 
tremendous fund of knowledge and the irresistible power that 
come from a knowledge and testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
We must not hesitate to do that which lies before us, and which 
the Lord requires of us. 

a newsboy's proud answer 

I like to recall my experience with a little newsbody. My wife 
and I stood at the west door of the Hotel Utah, in the company 
of a most distinguished American and his wife. We were talking 
about the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Latter-day Saints. 
Somebody said something about the Priesthood, and mention was 
made of the fact that in this Church all men may make themselves 
worthy to hold the Priesthood. Someone remarked — perhaps my 
wife — that even the boys after a certain age held the Priesthood. 
Just then a little lad came along the sidewalk calling out the after- 
noon paper — "Deseret News ! Deseret News !" On the spur of the 
moment I said: "Perhaps that little boy holds the Priesthood." I 
called him to me. He thought I was a tourist, about to buy a paper. 
I said: "Are you a 'Mormon,' my boy?" 

He straightened up, put his heels together, looked me in the 
eye, and said: "I am." 

I said: "Do you hold the Priesthood?" 

He said : "Yes, sir, I hold the Priesthood." 

I said: "What office in the Priesthood do you hold?" 

The little boy ga,ve me the salute of the Boy Scout and replied : 
"I am a Deacon, sir." 

There was the fearlessness of the child, the pride of his pos- 
session, though understanding only as a child, dimly, the meaning, 
the spirit and the vastness of this latter-day cause. We who have 
grown to maturity, must possess, in a larger degree, the same fear- 
lessness to conquer ourselves and to make ourselves worthy of the 
call which has come to us, to go out to teach the nations that which 
we have received. God bless us and be with us and make us the 
mighty Church which he designs we shall be, I ask, in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I desire very much to enjoy that same sweet spirit which has 
attended the remarks of my brethren. It is a very important privi- 
lege to associate with these men whom the Lord has called in this 
important day and time to proclaim and defend his work. In 
humility I wish to express my appreciation for the privilege that 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 141 

has come to me as one of the youths of Zion to take part in this 
important work, in the manner in which I have been called. 

I have made some very remarkable observations, in my brief 
ministry as a worker in the Church. I have observed that we have 
some of the best people in all the world from the young men and 
women to the aged fathers and mothers, and grandfathers 
and grandmothers in the Church. I have observed also that 
we are living in just a little different time from that of our great- 
grandfathers, and perhaps the obstacles which were before them 
were not the same kind that are before us as young people today. 
While our grandfathers and grandmothers had their responsibilities, 
their trials and their struggles, I am sure we, as young people, 
today, have ours. But in my anxiety to discover the greatest sup- 
port, the greatest help to battle with these trials, responsibilities and 
obstacles, I know of no other that compares in any way with the 
privileges and possibilities that come to us as young people to work 
in the Church of Christ. There are constantly being taught to us 
the principles of defense, the principles and powers that will aid and 
assist us to more fully enjoy our privileges and blessings in the 
great time and day in which we are living. It is true that we are 
living very near to the world. There was a time, perhaps, more 
than there is today when people could observe that we as so-called 
"Mormons" could be recognized by our attitude and our very ap- 
pearance, but today we are so near to the world that sometimes it 
is almost impossible to tell by our physical appearance whether we 
are of the world or not. 

As one of the youth of Zion called to stand upon her watch 
towers, I desire to express my faith and my belief in the fact that 
the Lord has not forgotten us, that his preserving and protecting 
care will continue to be with us, if we will only hearken unto the 
teachings and counsels which we have received. If we as young 
people will only observe the teachings of our parents in righteous- 
ness, to keep ourselves worthy of the great blessings which the 
Lord, for generations, has prepared to be administered unto the 
children of Israel in these the last days, we need not be disap- 
pointed. 

I have observed this very important lesson. You have just 
heard Elder Widtsoe, one of our great students in the Church, de- 
clare that under certain conditions the crude charcoal could be made 
into the lustrous diamond. Under natural conditions oil and water 
will not mix. To make them mix they have to be treated by heat 
and other agents, but just as soon as you come back to nat- 
ural and normal conditions again, the oil separates from 
the water and the water separates from the oil. While this is a 
crude example, I wish to bring it to you for this purpose. It is the 
best example I think of at the present time to explain the thought 
I have in view, that it is impossible under normal conditions for us, 
as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



whether old or young, to enjoy the blessings of the Church, as they 
are designated to us through the teachings of the Church, and live 
in the world, as the people of the world live. If you or I desire to 
enjoy those precious blessings which the Lord, through his holy 
prophets, has been declaring from the early ages up to the present 
time, we must obey the principles, and the laws, which govern those 
blessings. We may go through the form of receiving 
them but unless our hearts are in tune with them, through 
obedience to the laws that govern them, we will not receive the 
blessings. Just as soon as we come to our normal condition in our 
conduct in life, we will be just like the oil and water when they are 
in their normal condition. They do not naturally combine. So 
let me urge upon you, my brethren and sisters, to be careful in 
your conduct, in your ways of living. Do not deceive yourselves 
that you can break the Word of Wisdom, known among us as mem- 
bers of the Church as the "law of health" and the word of God to us 
as a people. You cannot break those commandments and those 
laws and expect to get the blessings that are enjoyed by those who 
do not break the laws. The Lord is kind and merciful, but like any 
other parent, he cannot give us the blessings that he would like to 
give us unless we prepare to be worthy of them. 

Through observations which have come to me, day by day and 
year by year, I am impressed more fully with that humble testi- 
mony that this is God's work and that he is ever blessing those who 
are laboring under his tuition and spirit to carry out his work, that 
he has been very mindful of his people. He has blessed us in our 
homes, in our fields and flocks and herds. I don't know when I 
have ever seen a more blessed year than this has been to the people 
of this intermountain country, and I do pray that the Lord will in- 
spire, within the hearts of the people, a true devotion to the Giver 
of these blessings, that he will not be forgotten. 

Already men are responding to the great call that har, 
been made by the President of the Church. Men in business, 
men in the professions, are already beginning to arrange their af- 
fairs, and I am sure there will be a response of willingness and 
gratitude, in the midst of the Church, to go forth and express in 
work, and make a great defense of this work, that men of the world 
may discover that there is an important period in their lives in 
which the Lord has been mindful of his children, and that the Spirit 
of the Lord will be poured out in mighty power upon those who 
express themselves in willingness to turn unto God's work, and 
take part in it, to proclaim it, and defend it, both at home and 
abroad. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may be upon the members of 
the Church wherever they live, that they may express that appre- 
ciation of their blessings in right living, that they remember the 
Lord in gratitude and in thanksgiving and in proper conduct; and 
not be deceived by their carelessness and their indifference. Nephi,.

the great character of old, taught his people in his time that those 
who thought they could do a little here and a little there, telling 
a lie here and a lie there, or steal a little today and steal a little to- 
morrow, that they could forget the Lord today and remember him 
tomorrow, procrastinate and put off, that they would be deceived in 
the end, that the adversary who was lying in wait to destroy the 
faith of the people then, that adversary still lives and is still in wait 
to take advantage of the follies of the people, and to place barriers 
in their pathway. But I want to promise you, my brethren and 
sisters, that though he is alive and in waiting for the weaknesses 
and follies of the people, that if you will observe the teachings of 
your faithful parents, that if you will observe the teachings of the 
elders in Israel, if you will observe the laws of nature and the words 
of wisdom, as they have been taught unto you from the beginning 
of this Church, since they were revealed to us, that the God of 
heaven will give you power every day of your lives to defend your- 
selves, that you may keep yourselves worthy of the blessings that 
the Lord has in store for you, and that you will have power to 
triumph over these barriers, to live and enjoy this happy, wonder- 
ful testimony that God lives, that he is the giver of life, that he for- 
gives sins, that he gives you power to "overcome weaknesses, that 
he will spare your lives in usefulness, that he will bless the labor 
of your hands temporally and spiritually, that he will give you 
understanding through the quickening of your minds and your de- 
sires and your ability to see and to understand. I have faith that 
the God of heaven will hear your prayers and answer you, he will 
remember you in mercy and bless you beyond your power to appre- 
ciate your blessings. 

I desire to express my appreciation for the blessings that the 
Lord has granted unto me, for my faith in and my knowledge of 
God and his works, for I know that God lives, that he does hear 
and answer prayers, that he does forgive sins unto those who hon- 
estly repent of their sins, forsake them and live in obedience to the 
teachings of Christ. 

I pray God to bless the officers and members of the Church 
throughout its entire organization. May faith, knowledge and 
obedience increase among the people to the glory of the Lord and 
his work, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
Eastern States Mission 

I thank God for music, and for these gifted sons and daugh- 
ters of God who vocally and on instruments can produce it. If I 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



could only preach the gospel as these gifted sons and daughters of 
God sing it, and could produce in the souls of men the thrills that 
come to me when the truth is set to music, and artistically ren- 
dered, I would ask no other wealth or gift from God. 

When the sessions of our conference closed on Sunday after- 
noon I felt that if nothing more should be added, this conference 
would go down in history as of great importance, because of the 
treatment that had been already given upon great and fundamental 
principles, principles of highest importance, and especially at this 
present time, and in view of the waves of religious thought and 
irreligious thought that are sweeping over our nation, and I pre- 
sume over other nations also. But when I stand before you to 
make my own very humble contribution to this historic confer- 
ence, it is with a great deal of misgiving, and I approach that brief 
and humble task with much trepidation. 

On my way home from the Eastern States I bought some 
magazines with which to while away the tedium of the journey, 
and in one of them I was attracted by this title : "It Is a Wise 
Father Who Can Answer His Own Child." 

In the course of setting forth that thought the father who 
wrote the article describes how a son about eight years of age said 
to him one day: 

"Daddy, why are people?" The father felt that "an armful" 
had been handed him, according to his own confession. So he 
stalled a little and replied to his son that that was a question that 
had been debated some five or ten thousand years, and it was riot 
quite certain yet that anybody had found the right answer. 

"Well," said the boy, "that's funny." Then, after a silence he 
said again: "Daddy, don't you think that is funny?" The father 
again stalled and he said : "Well, it is just possible that if we knew 
everything, life would not be so very interesting." "Well," per- 
sisted the boy, "I think it is funny. Now I have to go out and 
play ball the rest of the afternoon, and if you find out anything I 
would like to hear it at dinner." 

Now of course that may be a strange way of presenting a great 
theme. It has been much thought of, and the question put in a 
more worthy form. I think perhaps the poet-prophet of Israel, King 
David, stated the question in a manner much more worthy, and I 
call your attention to it. It is very familiar to you, but I am sure 
it is worthy of your further consideration : 

"Oh, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast 
set they glory above the heavens. . . . 

"When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the 
moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained ; 

"What is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the son of 
man, that thou visitest him? 

"For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and 
hast crowned him with glory and honor. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



145 



"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy 
hands ; thou hast put all things under his feet : 

"All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field ; 

"The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever 
passeth through the paths of the seas. 

"O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth !" 

David here asks some very important questions. He does not 
answer them, however, either in this psalm nor in any subsequent 
one. St. Paul quotes this passage from David in his letter to the 
Hebrews, but he does not answer the questions. This passage 
brings up the question of the purposes of God in the creation ; but 
these two prophets, David and Paul, do not give answers to the 
questions they ask. None of the philosophers outside of those cults 
that have been recognized as founded upon revelation from God 
have ever answered these questions in any authoritative way. It 
may seem like a bold statement, but it is true, nevertheless, that 
there is no answer contained in the Old Testament to these ques- 
tions. In all the revelations that^are given in the Old Testament 
there is no declaration made of the purposes of God in the crea- 
tion. I am going to ask you to go one step further, and to bear 
with me while I say to you that neither in the New Testament is 
there any adequate declaration that satisfies the inquiring mind 
upon that subject. The only scripture that comes anywhere nearly 
touching it is found in the following: 

"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and 
power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they 
are and were created." (Rev. 4:11.) 

That is the nearest, either in the Old or in the New Testa- 
ment, in all that is written — the nearest approach to an explana- 
tion of the purpose of God in the creation. I think you will agree 
with me that that is not very satisfactory to you or to me or to 
mankind in general. God has created all things and for his pleasure 
they are and were created. All right, but where do we come in? 
And what explanation is that to us of the purposes of God in our 
creation? 

I call your attention to the fact that this father to whom the 
lad propounded his question, confessed that he had been "handed 
an armful." He did not, however, regard the question of his boy as 
"silly." "On the contrary," said he, "it is so fundamental that it 
quite bowls one over." And then he adds this thoughtful remark : 

"Think what it would mean to the human race to have an an- 
swer that every one of us would accept. That I should say would 
be quite a neat little achievement;" that is to give an intelligent, 
acceptable, and, I will add, an authoritative answer to the question, 
"Why are people?" Or in other words, what is the purpose of God 
in the creation of man? I have rather boldly said that you can 
find no answer in the Old Testament nor in the New Testament. 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But now I will ask you to follow me for a few moments in some 
suppositions I am going to make. 

Suppose that in some catacomb in Egypt, or some musty tomb 
of ancient prophets, a fragment of parchment could be found that 
could be well established as containing the very words of the great 
prophet Moses; and suppose that fragment should contain this 
statement : 

"THIS IS MY WORK AND MY GLORY, SAITH THE 
LORD, TO BRING TO PASS THE IMMORTALITY AND 
ETERNAL LIFE OF MAN." 

What would be the result upon the thought of the world if by 
human means such a fragment of parchment could be brought forth 
and established as undoubtedly the utterance of the great prophet 
of Israel, Moses? It would be regarded, I warrant you, as the most 
valuable utterance that had occurred among men. Aye, its value 
would be greater in giving enlightenment to men as to the purposes 
of God in the creation of man, than all else that is written in the 
Bible ; and as a discovery it would be as important as the discovery 
of the original tablets on which were written the Ten Command- 
ments would be. 

Again I will ask you to suppose that under similar circum- 
stances and by human means, another literary discovery was made 
that should read as follows — this is a second fragment that we will 
suppose has been discovered: 

"Man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and ele- 
ment, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy. And when 
separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy." * * * 

"The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the 
tabernacle of God, even temples ; and whatsoever temple is defiled, 
God shall destroy that temple. 

"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and 
truth." 

That is to say, the light by which truth is discerned. I would 
like to make this addition to the foregoing quotation. It does not 
occur in this same passage, but I would like to make this addition 
to this scrap of supposed parchment, and have it included in our 
whole supposition : 

"The body and the spirit is the soul of man, and the resurrec- 
tion from the dead is the redemption of the soul." 

Now let us add these statements together in these supposed 
parchment fragments, then put the two together — the one from 
Moses and this passage just quoted. We would then have: 

"This is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the immor- 
tality and eternal life of man. . . . 

"The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably 
connected, receive a fullness of joy. . . . 

"The spirit and the body is the soul of man; the resurrection 
from the dead is the redemption of the soul." 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



147 



Now I begin to see forming a marvelous, a splendid, a worthy 
conclusion, out of these discovered fragments — the purpose of God 
in the creation of man, It is the purpose of God to bring to pass 
the immortality and eternal life of man, because a union of spirit 
and element is essential to the fulness of man's joy. That immor- 
tality and eternal life is brought to pass by the indissoluble union 
of the body and the spirit of man, bv which he becomes soul — 
one, united, inseparable, an entity indestructible, and put in the 
way of attainment of a fulness of joy. But the end is not yet. 

I will ask you to suppose the discovery of another fragment of 
manuscript from ruined temple, from catacomb or from musty 
tomb, and yet its antiquity and its authenticity as going back to an 
inspired man of God — a prophet — may not be questioned. We will 
suppose this third discovered, sacred parchment should say this — 
I will ask you to mark the beauty of it : 

"All things have been done in the wisdom of Him who knoweth 
all things." 

Now that has in it the music of inspired poetry, to me. It also 
has a depth of philosophy that is quite wonderful. 

"All things have been done in the wisdom of Him who know- 
eth all things." 

Perfect wisdom can come only from perfect knowledge, and 
here you have the two combined, — perfect wisdom rising from per- 
fect knowledge ; all things ordained for the earth and the inhabitants 
thereof have been wrought in the highest wisdom, according to the 
declaration of this third discovered fragment we are supposing. 
And then the rest of the fragment must be read to get the full im- 
port of its meaning. I will read the two beautiful lines I have in 
mind together: 

"All things have been done in the wisdom of Him who know- 
eth all things : 

"Adam fell that man might be. Men are that they might have 
joy." 

And thus these fragments of truth — we will say for the mo- 
ment from ancient parchment just discovered — have enlightened 
the world on this great theme as no other utterances have ever en- 
lightened the children of men. If they could only be discovered 
in the way we have supposed, it seems to me that there would rise 
up from all the hosts of men peans of praise to Almighty God, for 
this great light shed abroad upon the minds of men with reference 
to the purposes of God in the creation ; and especially as to the crea- 
tion of man. 

Now we will drop the suppositions assumed. These three great 
utterances constitute the message of "Mormonism" to the world 
upon this great theme. The first comes from a fragment of the 
teachings of the prophet Moses, found not in musty tomb or ruined 
temple, but revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith before this 
Church of ours was six months old. The second comes from a 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



revelation from God to him, in the year 1833. The third contribu- 
tion comes from our Book of Mormon, and is the contribution of 
sleeping nations once inhabiting the American continents, a mes- 
sage through their prophet leader to the modern world, and a con- 
tribution to the modern world for its enlightenment. How splen- 
did all that is ! 

We are not quite through, however, with this magazine lad's 
questions yet ; nor with David's sublime questions. We have 
learned a little about the purpose of God in- the creation, but the 
other part of the question still remains : What is man that God is 
mindful of him? Or the son of man, that he visits him, and gives 
him dominion over his works? 

Only just a moment can be devoted to the great theme. I 
quote the words of the Christ in that last prayer of his in Geth- 
semane : 

"Father, the hour is come;- glorify thy Son, that thy Son also 
may glorify thee." 

I quote that scripture because without any equivocation it de- 
clares by the lips of the Christ himself the fact that he is the Son of 
God ; and now he says : 

"Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory 
which I had with thee before the world was." Here the Christ pro- 
claims both the pre-existence of his own spirit and the glory he had 
with his Father before he came to the earth. These doctrines used to 
puzzle those among whom he moved when in his earth life. In con- 
troversy with the Pharisees on one occasion, when they were boast- 
ing about Abraham being their father, he said : 

"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it 
and was glad." "Oh," said they, "you are not yet fifty years old, 
and hast thou seen Abraham?" And he answered, "Before Abra- 
ham was, I am." 

Reference was made by President Ivins on Sunday to that 
most marvelous of all revelations on the pre-existence of the spirit 
of the Christ given to Moriancumer, the brother of Jared. So com- 
plete was that vision, so certain it was, that the Prophets as he be- 
held the finger of the Lord stretched forth, exclaimed : "I knew not 
that the Lord had flesh and blood." This view was corrected by 
the Lord, who said : 

"This is the body of my spirit, and as I appear unto you in the 
spirit, so will I appear unto my people in the flesh." In other 
words, it was the spirit form of the Christ which Moriancumer be- 
held. It is the spirit that gives form to the whole man. The spirit 
out of the elements in this earth-life clothes itself with this beauti- 
ful garment, the human body, which in the providences of God 
shall be made immortal. This through the processes, first of birth 
into mortality — earth life ; and after that, birth into immortality 
through the resurrection. Through these processes shall come 
forth those personages that shall be eternal — a union of spirit and 



ELDER BRIG HAM H. ROBERTS 



149 



element that shall be indissoluble. The mortal state is but a pre- 
lude to that immortal life, and to that "eternal life" which shall in- 
clude with it an eternal union with God, a union that shall lead to 
the eternal progress and development of the divine intelligences 
that inhabit these bodies. 

Now, Jesus Christ is the Son of God. All right, what is our 
relationship to him? He met Mary early in the morning .of the 
resurrection, and when she would approach him and place her hands 
upon him in loving affection, he said : 

"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father." 
It seems he was reserving contact with his resurrected, immortal 
body, for the first embrace of the Father. "Touch me not, but go 
and tell my brethren," referring to the apostles, — "tell my brethren, 
that I ascend unto my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and 
to your God." 

I know of no other scripture that so beautifully sets forth the 
relationship of brotherhood of man to the Christ than this passage ; 
unless perhaps it might be this one : 

"For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified are 
all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them breth- 
ren." Showing that our origin is the same as the origin of the 
Christ. Now I understand Paul clearly when he says : 

"We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we 
gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection 
unto the Father of spirits, and live?" 

Now ask the question, David; "What is man that thou art 
mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?" The 
answer is : Sons of God, brothers to the Christ, sparks struck from 
God's own eternal blaze — parts of him — parts of God ! Hence, God 
is mindful of man ; hence he visits them, hence he places all things 
under their feet, and gives them the high mission to multiply and 
replenish the inhabitants of the earth, and to have dominion over it. 

How blessed this doctrine! How high and lifted up it is above 
the notion that man has his origin in the slime of the ocean, and 
the protoplasm which rises from it, until it differentiates into the 
various forms of life, and man comes from some one or other of the 
many lines that lead out from this common source of life ! 

I have been thrilled in this conference by reference to that 
vision that the Lord gave to Abraham of the intelligences that were 
organized before the world itself was formed. In the great host 
before the throne of God there were many noble and great ones — 
noble and great ones ! And God looked upon these spirits, "and they 
were good ;" and he said to Abraham : "These I will make my 
rulers. Thou, Abraham, art one of them." I pray you note the 
characterization of these prominent spirits — "noble," "great," 
"good" ! These are characteristics that embrace all other virtues. 
They include everything that could be desired in the way of char- 
acter elements. How splendid that is ! Of course we common 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



men, doubtless stand far below that high level on which God 
placed these "noble" ones, and "great" ones, and "good," in the 
vision he gave to one of the noblest — Abraham. But how comfort- 
ing it is, and how blest it must be to have the assurance that 
though far below, in excellence, these whom God has selected to 
be his rulers, we nevertheless are brothers to them ; and in lesser 
degree possessing that which they possess, with the opportunity 
and privilege granted to us to approach if we may not attain to 
their excellence. Then to be brothers to him — brothers to the 
Christ; and brothers to that worthy host that has been chosen to 
be associated with the Christ in leadership of those things which 
make for the accomplishment of God's purposes with reference to 
the existence of man in the earth. That affords me much more 
comfort than to think of man as being related — even though dis- 
tantly related — to the brute creation. 
I close with this scripture : 

"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon 
us, that we should be called the sons of God ; * * * and it doth 
not yet appear what we shall be." That is, we cannot estimate the 
possibilities growing out of that truth, and that relationship — "it 
doth not yet appear what we shall be." Eye hath not soon, ear hath 
not heard the depth and height of the glory which God designs for 
his children. We may not fathom it upward or downward, "It does 
not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall 
appear, we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is. And 
every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even 
as he is pure." (I. John 3:1-3.) God grant that it may be so, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I, too, sincerely pray that the Spirit of the Lord may be with 
me in the very few minutes that I speak. My heart, my spirit, my 
mind, have been raised to praise for the power of the Almighty 
God, and for gratitude that I am called to be one of his servants. 

This conference has been impressive for the fact that our faith 
in God, more and more, has been expressed by every speaker; and 
not that I could carry on the great thought that has been expressed 
the last few moments to the end that we might be raised to still 
greater faith, but let me please add the thought that has impressed 
me during the morning session of this conference ; namely, that in 
all history, in the story of the development of God's children to the 
present moment, we find that they who have had faith in him as 
the Creator of the heavens and the earth, they, the races, the peo- 
ples, the nations, the individuals who have been converted to the 
ways of Christ, and have been able to raise their voices in expres- 
sion of the living faith in Christ, — those people and nations have 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



151 



been the ones who have made the great contribution to man's up- 
lift, and have given the assurance to the human race of the meaning 
of life and of the destiny of man. 

There is something great that we must contemplate in the mis- 
sion of the Master. He did teach the glory of God, he did give 
unto us the teaching that man is divine and that the power of the 
intellect and of the spirit are not limited, but are unlimited. An- 
other great thing that Jesus has left to us as an abiding testimony 
is that the kingdom of God, a literal kingdom, will be established 
upon this earth, a kingdom of God over which Christ Jesus will 
rule, and we shall be members of that kingdom, as we place our 
faith in God and know for a surety, from day to day, in the very 
living of our lives, in our contemplation and in our work, in those 
things shall we become members of Christ's kingdom. 

It is a mistake, a great mistake, today, to lose sight of the fact 
that man can know God. In that masterful work The World and 
Life that was put out just previous to the death of Alfred Russell 
Wallace he did rise to an occasion, and when the pastor said in his 
previous book entitled The Place of Man in the Universe, "Man 
cannot know God," yet he did conclude in his latter work that "man 
can know God, but there is only one way, and that is by divine 
revelation which," said he, "man has not had." We Latter-day 
Saints give our testimony to the world that man may know God, 
and he knows God by revelation. It is our testimony to the world, 
it is the only true way, it is the only way in which we understand 
the relationship of ourselves to our Maker. 

My brethren and sisters, there are two great sources that will 
make the world move onward to the Christ and to the kingdom of 
God. They are education and religion. Religion is the inner light. 
It is something within and not without. Our greatest power lies 
in the spirit, and it will be by the spirit that we will work out this 
problem. It must come from within. It is a condition of mind, a 
condition of spirit, this religion, this vision ; and the trouble with 
the world today is that there is no vision, and the world is perish- 
ing for the want of it. We claim to have the vision, and we have, 
but that vision comes as an inner light, and our power is the inner 
light, and it binds us to our Maker. Now men do search for truth, 
and men will find out truth; and, continuing this theme of President 
Roberts, I think the words of Isaiah stand, then, as a fitting com- 
plement, if you please, to this great truth that has been uttered : 

"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen 
upon thee." 

And Luke, continuing this same great thought, says, in the first 
chapter of his writings : 

. . . That comes "to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the 
shadow of death" he comes "to guide our feet into the way of peace." 

And we might add — truth and right and understanding. For 
the light and the glory of God will be understood as we come to 
place ourselves in a position to understand, and understanding 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



comes through the condition of our spirits, and our spirits are 
cleansed, made clean, by righteous living and an attitude toward all 
mankind, showing that we love them. Truth expresses itself in 
love and happiness and joy and peace. For this reason the Latter- 
day Saints should not only be thankful for vision, they should be 
grateful for the happiness that has come to us, for the spirit of the 
gospel of Christ is one of happiness and joy and thanksgiving. We 
should be the most encouraged people in all the world. That God 
may grant that we may continue in the vision, that the vision may 
continue with us, one by one, each and every one of us, that the 
vision of the Father, the power of God and the establishment of 
his kingdom may remain in our hearts to lead and direct us, I ask, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder George W. McCune, 
president of the Los Angeles stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

PRESIDENCY OF THE PRIMARY ASSOCIATION REORGANIZED 

We will now present the General Authorities and the general 
officers of the Church and of the auxiliary associations for your sup- 
port. Before doing so, however, I wish to announce that Sister 
Louie B. Felt who, for forty-five years, has faithfully and diligently 
presided over the Primary General Board, has requested that she 
be released from those labors ; and her counselors, Sisters May An- 
derson and Clara W. Beebe, will naturally be released with her. 
These sisters are releasd with our love and blessing and with our 
sincere thanks for their very splendid labors. Sister Felt not only 
has presided for forty-five years, with dignity and energy and for 
the benefit of these Associations, but she was also, as I remember 
it, the president of the second Primary Association organized in the 
Church, which was in the Eleventh Ward of this city. 

Sisters Louie B. Felt and Counselors were released as the

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I rejoice with you in all that has transpired and been said dur- 
ing this conference. I have never believed, since I have been active 
in the Church, that God gives to man fear. 1 know that God gives 
to you power and love and a sound mind when you are under the 
influence of the holy Spirit and have the spirit of your office and 
calling. I appreciate the fact, perhaps better than some men do, 
that it is very difficult to be understood. God's declarations to the 
children of men (it is self-evident from what has been said during 
this conference) are misunderstood by many of his children, and 
they misinterpret them. The Savior, the Son of the living God, 
came upon this earth and went through all his sufferings and did 
the things he saw his Father do, but he was not understood. He 
was misinterpreted, and some of his children did it conscientiously, 
no doubt, and some very wickedly, Joseph Smith, a prophet of 
God, a man whom I have honored all my life — I was taught it by 
my father in my childhood — see how he was misinterpreted ! In 
the Southern states, when I was presiding over elders in that mis- 
sion, I told them, "You want to make friends, but when under the 
influence of the Spirit of God, you testify that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet, it will bring you all the trouble you can endure." I found 
that true, butx among God's children we found good people who 
would be willing to accept the gospel. All great men have been 
misunderstood. So I conclude that to be misunderstood is great- 
ness; that is, if you speak the truth. 

I want to tell you in a few words that there is nothing in the 
world that the wicked dislike so much as the truth, and if you will 
tell the truth under the influence of the holy Spirit you will have 
to have faith in God and realize that you are in his service. I have 
a paper here — I did not write it for this conference as I never like 
to read, but sometimes I have to do it in order to make myself 
clear — it is the impressions of J. G. Kimball. You ought to know 
who I am by this time : 

"It is not difficult, in fact it -seems to me natural — it is just as 
natural as water running down hill, to accept God's own declara- 
tion of truth as it has been revealed and to uphold and sustain the 
prophets as mouthpieces of God. It is not difficult for me, I do not 
know anything else. I have never been taught anything else. The 
very foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ is faith in God and 
in his Son Jesus Christ, and one of its chief corner stones is author- 
ity. The perfection of righteousness is implicit faith in God, in his 
revelations, in his disciples, and in their teachings. The very es- 
sence of goodness is not to doubt, as doubt is sometimes the very 
opposite of faith. It could not be otherwise, as it is easy and natural 
for Latter-day Saints to accept God's declaration, as given through 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, as the word of God, and to sustain all 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those who are mouthpieces for God. We make the further claim 
that the elder of the Latter-day Saint Church is also called of God, 
and his commission is from above and his position is eternal." 

I set elders apart, assisting the brethren-almost every week. I 
never hesitate when placing my hands upon those young men, to 
say, "You have been called by divine authority through the presi- 
dency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." I try 
to impress them that they were not called by the bishop, or by the 
presidency of the stake, they were recommended and their names 
were sent in properly endorsed ; but they are all called by revela- 
tion, just as I was in 1883, among a body of missionaries. I was 
the only one in that whole number of men who was not ordained 
a Seventy, as my first mission in the south was filled as an elder, 
I enjoyed the same spirit and the same blessings that the Seventies 
enjoyed because I was called by the same authority, and the spirit 
of my appointment went with me. 

An elder is sent out not to represent his personal views or the 
views of the people, but to proclaim the truth as it is revealed. He 
is not chosen as a spokesman for the people, not just as a mes- 
senger, but the bearer of a message to the people. 

We reach the final conclusion that this is the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, the gospel of Jesus Christ restored 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The religion that we advocate 
is Christ's religion, not "Mormon's religion" ; that is, it is the word 
of God. We do not teach for doctrines the commandments of men. 

That is my testimony. I do not think I have to get myself all 
exercised and all wrought up and tear my lungs all to pieces to 
impress you, after forty years of labor in the ministry. Notwith- 
standing all my mistakes and blunders I have had this testimony 
from the beginning, and the beginning was in the Brigham Young 
Academy, under the teaching and instruction of Brother Karl 
G. Maeser. President Grant told us last evening of a spot of 
ground he will never forget. And it impressed me with a feeling 
which never can be blotted out — my experience as a pioneer in 
Bear Lake when I went into that log meeting house and heard 
Brother Maeser talk, and he was talking about the gospel, I shall 
never forget, though I have never remembered what he said, but 
I know how I felt, and my brother Elias and I, and our mother 
with us, made as great a sacrifice as I have ever made to go on a 
mission, when we moved from Bear Lake down through Evanston 
and through the deep snow by team, and not by railroad or auto. 
It took us three or four days to reach Provo. We went to school. 
1 attended two years and my brother Elias went three. 1 am telling 
you this because I have felt, as I have not felt for a long time, the 
inspiration through the prophets of God when they concluded to 
send out a thousand missionaries ; and i,t seems that some 'of our 
people did not understand President Grant, they got the idea that 
they were sending them all to South America. It is a mighty good 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



157 



thing that they did not do so because it would have created per- 
secution. If you ever rush a thousand missionaries into a place I 
will tell you legions of devils will turn loose and drive them out. 
You have got to go in by degrees. I know that. That is what 
happened to Heber C. Kimball and those great missionaries in 
England, when they fell as if dead, and for one hour they laid there 
and had a vision and heard the trampling of feet of legions of devils 
or evil spirits. The devil always kicks up a row. I remember in 
President Roberts' day, when they began to persecute us and drive 
us out of the South — I remember when Brother Roberts was com- 
ing home with an emigration and I was left in the office. Letters 
came from all over the mission in 1884, one of the terrible years of 
the South, "What shall we do?" I wrote to President Taylor and 
asked him what I should do? He only wrote a few lines, "When 
they persecute you in one place, flee ye into another." I wrote that 
hundreds of times, when the mob was after the elders, "Flee to 
another place, and just as soon as you can, come back." But if 
they drive you out and tell you never to come back, if you do go 
back they will kill you just, as they did the brethren in Cane Creek. 
They told them not to go back, but they needed a resting place, 
and they killed them. I know, I was in the mission. 

Brethren, what I want to talk to you about a few minutes is 
my own experience. I know more about myself than any man, 
living in the flesh. I am getting pretty well acquainted with my- 
self. I am surprised sometimes at the things I do and say, more 
than you are. I remember after I went to school I came home and 
went to Bear Lake. I came down here on a little business which 
I happened to have with William C. Spence, of the President's 
office; he said, "Brother Kimball, President Taylor sent you a letter 
calling you on a mission, and he is disturbed because you have not 
answered." I said, "How could I answer it, when I never got it?" 
"Well, you'd better go in and see him." I went into the President's 
office, the first time since I was a young boy with my father, and 
I met that great and wonderful prophet. I said, "President Taylor, 
I never received your letter." "Well, Brother Kimball" (he was 
so kind, he thought so much of Heber C. Kimball and that made 
him think a lot of me), "you cannot go now." I had been praying 
for it, I had been asking the Lord why I could not go. My mother 
had been praying that God would send me out. I said, "President 
Taylor, give me one hour and I will give you my answer." I went 
out on the street, and the first man I met was Bishop Thomas 
Jenkins of the Seventh ward, who had been to Bear Lake and I 
knew him. I said, "Brother Jenkins, will yau sign my note for a 
hundred dollars?" "You bet, I will." So we went down to the 
Deseret National Bank and he endorsed my note, and I came back 
to the office with one hundred dollars in my pocket, and I said, 
"President Taylor, I am ready." I went on that mission. N;o 
greater blessing has ever come into my life. 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That is the first time I ever saw Elder B. H. Roberts. No 
greater favor ever comes to a man than to be called on a mission. 
I met a nephew last night, one of Heber C. Kimball's grandchildren. 
He said, "Uncle Golden, when I was a young fellow"— he is now a 
High Councilor in one of the stakes — "you came to me and said, 
'Are you ready for a mission ?' I answered you as I should not have 
done, but the greatest mistake I have ever made in my life was 
that I did not respond at that time and have you present my name." 

There is a little story in connection with this that I want to 
impress you with. 

I remember when we arrived at Chattanooga, Brother Roberts 
sent me and a son of an apostle into Virginia. When our visit in 
Chattanooga was over, and we had paid our expenses I had ten 
dollars. When we got to the end of the railroad I said to my com- 
panion : "Let's ride in a carriage, it will be the last time we will 
ever see one." I did not know that I was a prophet, but it came 
true. When we reached our field of labor we lay around there for 
about three weeks. I said to my companion, who was from the 
Brigham Young Academy, "Let us go up into the woods and see 
if we can sing," (I couldn't carry a tune, I never tried to sing in the 
Academy), "and let us go up and learn to pray." We did not have 
any audience, only those great big trees. And I said "Let us learn 
to preach." I would advise young elders to do that before they 
start out and not practice so much on the people ; we practiced on 
the trees. So I prepared myself and occupied the time. My com- 
panion was prepared, and we sang. We made an awful mess of it, 
but after a while — and that is another testimony — God brought the 
tunes to us, and we could sing the songs that we had listened to in 
the Academy. Then I preached. God was kind to us and he 
loosed our tongues and we found we were able to express the 
things we had studied. I rem'ember my companion was dismissing. 
We had our eyes shut and our hands up. I thought he would 
never get through; and when he said, Amen, we looked back, and 
there were four men standing behind us with guns on their shoul- 
ders. I said to my companion, "That is another lesson, from this 
time on in the South ; I shall pray with one eye open." 

So, I will conclude my remarks by saying that I filled that 
mission. Brother Roberts and Brother John Morgan are my wit- 
nesses that I completed it, although I was broken down with 
malaria. But I came home with an honorable release ; it was in 
1884 that I came home. I worked in the Mutuals, started in Bear 
Lake with the elders. I wound up as superintendent of the Mutuals. 
I traveled from Evanston to Soda Springs in snow and cold wea- 
ther, and suffered. By the way, when I went on my first mission 
I told President Taylor, "If you will let my brother Elias stay at 
home, I can fill my mission." That put the idea in his head, and 
Elias was called right after I was, and we both went, we left our 
cattle and our horses and everything we had. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



159 



Then came my second mission. There was no noise about it, 
word just came, "You are called to preside over the Southern States 
mission, and Brother Spry will take you down and turn the mission 
over to you." He did, and he did it mighty hurriedly, too, and left 
me to preside. During my first year I came home with an emigra- 
tion, and while I was trying to comfort my wife who was sick, 
Brother Roberts wired me to come down and be ordained as one of 
the First Council of Seventy. They never asked me, they never 
consulted with me, they just sent for me, and I have been in this 
Council thirty-three years. I filled my mission. One day Brother 
Reynolds and I came out of the Council meeting, and when we got 
to the gate, he said, "Brother Kimball, you are released, and your 
brother Elias is appointed." The two of us spent ten years in the 
south and when we came back we didn't have a thing but our 
families and our lives. 

The Lord has been good to me. No man in the Church has 
been favored more or treated more kindly than I have. I have 
got all that I have deserved and a good deal more. My brethren 
and sisters, that is my testimony. I have been among the Seventies 
for the past year. My health was not very good last vear. I have 
never allowed a Sabbath day to pass me, if I could make an ap- 
pointment, that I have not been among the Seventies. I am 
acquainted with the Seventies. If you want Seventies to go on mis- 
sions I can speak for them. If you call them they will go, but if 
you want them to stay home they will do so, and so will L I will 
go on a mission if called. I am not just talking either, God knows 
it, and I know it. I would go if I were brought back in a casket, 
and I do not know but I would be tickled to death to have it come 
that way. 

I have never been more greatly impressed than by Colonel 
Bryan, a man of the world who died fighting for God and testifying 
as far as his knowledge went. What more can any man do? That 
is the way I feel. I shall stav in this work. I uphold it. Inasmuch 
as you need a thousand missionaries for six months' missions there 
will be no trouble in getting them. I have asked hundreds of 
Seventies and had them stand on their feet and asked, "How many 
of you have filled missions?" (They would stand up). "How many 
of you have not filled missions?" "How many of you have never 
been asked to go on missions?" And I am astonished at the hun- 
dreds and hundreds of the Seventies who have never been asked 
to go. They may have been considered by the prsidents of stakes 
and bishops. But if you want a man to go on a mission, call him. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, to bless the authorities of the 
Church, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I have been very greatly impressed during the meetings of this 
conference with the wonderful drama that has been enacted on 
the stage of this earth upon which we dwell. It has been said by 
a Latin scholar that history is the witness of time (Historia, testis 
temporum est), and it seems to me that there is nothing that is 
more indelibly imprinted upon the history of the human race than 
the purposes of the Almighty, that there is a Providence over all, 
and he is guiding and directing the destinies of his children. I 
think it has been made plain that this history, if we are to prop- 
erly understand it, begins before the foundations of this earth were 
laid; that we who dwell upon the face of the earth today, counted 
as we are by many hundreds of millions, and those who were before 
us, even from the very beginning of time, have at one time dwelt in 
that primeval world in the presence of our Father in heaven as his 
children; and the scenes that are now being enacted are in pursu- 
ance of the great plan that was evolved by him in the very begin- 
ning, in that primeval state that we read about in the holy scrip- 
tures, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of 
God shouted for joy. Then and in that pre-existent state, as it is 
now, there were differences among the children of God, there were 
some who were noble and great and good ; there were some who 
were evil and had many weaknesses, and fell far short of doing the 
things that were necessary for their own progress arid exaltation. 
But in the midst of all the children of God, when the plan was an- 
nounced, there were some who fulfilled their first estate, not all in 
equal degree, but they were different, some of them were great and 
noble and were chosen to be the rulers among men. There were 
some who were choice, though in lesser degree, who were worthy 
of some distinction, and still others who were not so worthy, yet 
all of them having fulfilled their first estate were permitted to dwell 
in mortal life upon the earth, and they were known of the Almighty 
and he was interested in the welfare of them all. 

Among the great ones, as we have been told, was Abraham. 
Abraham was a man whom God loved ; and he, too, loved the Lord, 
and the Lord knew him. He knew that he would keep his statutes, 
that he would obey his commandments, and not only that but he 
would teach his own children after him. It is through that lineage 
that we today have the knowledge of the true and living God. It 
is through that lineage that a record has been preserved among 
the children of men, giving a history of the dealings of God with 
his children. Those that were more favored because of their faith- 
fulness in that pre-existent world were the ones that were to come 
through the lineage of Abraham, for the Lord blessed Abraham and 
promised him that in him and his seed should all the nations.of the 
earth be blessed. Those who were faithful to a marked degree in 



\ 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



161 



that pre-existent 'state were privileged to come in due course of 
time through that lineage, the children of Abraham. What greater 
privilege could a child of God desire than to be numbered among 
those whom God permitted to come through that lineage, that 
should bring into this world and preserve among the children of 
men a knowledge of the true and living God that they might be 
taught in his ways ? 

In the progress of this human drama the Lord delivered his 
chosen people out of their bondage in the land of Egypt, directed 
and guided by a great prophet of God, Moses. He brought them 
out into the wilderness and endeavored to eradicate from among 
them the idolatrous ideas they had imbibed in the land of Egypt. 
And the Lord took his servant, the Prophet Moses, up into the 
mountain and delivered unto him the word of the Lord regarding 
the plan of life and salvation. The tablets upon which it was writ- 
ten, when he came down from the mount and saw them worshiping 
the golden calf, were broken into pieces in the anger of that mighty 
man of God. He was called again up into the mount and brought 
back with him the law of carnal commandments, that men might 
repent of their sins and avoid the evils of the world and be 
schooled that they might disseminate among the inhabitants of the 
world a knowledge of those principles that had within them the 
power of God unto salvation. 

And in further process of time, after having sent so many 
prophets, whom they stoned and persecuted, came the Only Be- 
gotten of the Father in the flesh, to restore anew that great law, 
the law of grace, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, that the 
world might not be without it and the children of God might be 
saved, and might be brought to repentance and prepare themselves 
for that eternal glory that was thought out and planned from the 
very beginning. Notwithstanding the rebellious spirit that mani- 
fested itself throughout all these ages, there has been committed 
to that lineage a knowledge of the things of God, and of him who 
was indeed the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Great promises 
were made unto that lineage, and I am going to read just a little 
from the scriptures, to be found in the forty-ninth chapter of 
Genesis. Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father 
of Jacob, whom the Lord named Israel, who became the father of 
the twelve tribes of Israel; and that great and mighty man, when 
his days began to draw to a close, called around him his twelve 
sons and bestowed upon each in their order his blessing, to be ful- 
filled upon their heads, and to Joseph he gave this blessing: 

"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose 
branches run over the wall." 

And later in that same blessing said he: 

"Even by the God of my father, who shall help thee; and by the Al- 
mighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of 
the deep that lieth under." 

I have ofttimes thought, what can these references mean?" 



162 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Here is a family, a lineage, a seed scattered among the children of 
men, by which all the nations of the earth are to be blessed. That 
was the blessing that was given to Abraham, and the Lord gave 
him a promise, and led Moses into the promised land, which was 
to be the land of their inheritance, the land of Palestine, the land of 
Judea, the Holy Land. This was the land that was given unto the 
seed of Abraham to be an everlasting inheritance unto them. But 
here we have him pronouncing the blessing upon the head of 
Joseph : "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a 
well ; whose branches run over the wall." What did it mean ? 
Did it not mean that this blessing was being realized when father 
Lehi left the shores of old Arabia and crossed the great waters, 
even the mighty Pacific Ocean, and landed probably on the west- 
ern coast of Chile in South America, in Valparaiso? One would 
almost think that father Lehi and his family had suggested the 
name, for that was the valley of Paradise. Surely they felt that 
under the guidance they had received they had come to the para- 
dise of God, Valparaiso, the valley of Paradise. Here then, it seems 
to me, although vaguely stated, might be a fulfillment of this prom- 
ise unto Joseph, whose branches, but not all of the house of Joseph, 
ran over the wall. Rather vague, perhaps, but let me read another 
paragraph following, wherein it says : 

"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and the Almighty, 
who shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, blessings of the 
deep that lieth under." 

Here then is another inference. What else could it have re- 
ferred to than the land of America, standing as he was at that time 
in Egypt, saying that his branches should run over the wall, and 
that the blessings of heaven above and of the deep that lieth under 
should be given him. He seemed to have understood at that time 
that the world was round, and that that part (which is now Amer- 
ica) that lieth under was to be the land of Joseph. Even this may 
be considered a somewhat vague reference. But let us read on. 
It would seem that there was a determination to banish all doubt 
from our minds when we read these words pronounced upon the 
head of Jeseph,. for it says here : "The blessings of thy father," 
(that was Jacob, called Israel) "have prevailed above the blessings 
of my progenitors." Who were they? Abraham, and Isaac, the 
blessings that were pronounced upon them, and the giving to them 
of that land of promise, — Palestine, Judea, — to be an eternal in- 
heritance to the seed of Abraham. But here was something above 
and beyond pronounced upon the head of Joseph. Said he: 

"The blessings of thy father (Jacob) have prevailed above the blessings 
of my progenitors, unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills." 

O, how plain it would seem; the vagueness disappears; But 
that pertained to the house of Joseph : Let us read on : 

"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my 
progenitors unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, and they shall 
be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was 
separate from his brethren." 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



163 



And here we are in the land of Joseph ; and through the inter- 
position of the Almighty, his purposes are written in the pages of 
history, wherein he has sent the seed of Abraham all over the 
world, that all the nations of the world are to be blessed in his 
seed. The Jews are to return to the land of their inheritance, but 
Joseph must be gathered upon the land of Joseph, which is North 
and South America. And so we are gathering them from the coun- 
tries of Europe. Those who came with father Lehi were mostly 
the children of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, but most of those who 
have been scattered in the different nations of the earth are the 
children of Joseph through his son Ephraim, and these are they who 
hear the voice of the good Shepherd and are being gathered to the 
land of Joseph through the ministrations of the elders of Israel in 
these days, and in whose veins flows the blood of Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob, and of Joseph; for they belong to the tribe of Joseph. 
Have our patriarchs not prophesied upon our heads, O ye children 
of Israel, ye sons and daughters of Zion, have we not been told that 
we were the children of Abraham through Joseph and Ephraim? 
And so, I say, the children of Ephraim are being gathered upon the 
land of Joseph, a choice land above all other lands, extending from 
the north pole to the south pole in this great western hemisphere. 

I rejoice therefore in having the opportunity of doing my little 
part in the bringing about of this great work, in carrying the mes- 
sage to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and in gathering into 
the fold the children of Abraham, by bearing the message of life 
and salvation, searching them out wherever they may be. I ac- 
cept, as Elder Ballard did, the call that has come to me, and I re- 
joice in having the opportunity of playing a small part at least in 
the opening up of that great work in the southern hemisphere 
among the children of Lehi, and I hope and sincerely pray that the 
Lord will qualify me for that mission. I rejoice in the companion- 
ship that we have in Elder Ballard, an apostle of the Lord, a wit- 
ness of the Lord Jesus Christ. How I feel to uphold and sustain 
him, and will endeavor to assist him with all my might that he may 
be able to accomplish all that the Lord would have him do in this 
great mission. I rejoice in the companionship of Elder Rey L. 
Pratt, whom I have learned to love as my fellow laborer in the 
Council to which I belong, and in my association with him. With 
the help of the Lord I desire to go and discharge myself of the 
duty that now lies incumbent upon me ; and in this labor I hope 
and pray that we may have the faith and prayers of the Latter-day 
Saints, that the purposes of the Almighty may be furthered, and 
that in that continent where the gospel has not yet found a foot- 
hold, there may be an opening, that the children of Israel, the de- 
scendants of Abraham, the descendants of father Lehi, may be 
brought to a knowledge of the truth and rejoice in the blessings of 
the gospel of our Master, and I pray for this in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I need the sympathy and faith of this audience and the blessings 
of the Lord if there is to be fulfilled during the short time that I stand 
before you the earnest prayer in which you joined this afternoon, that 
the spiritual feast might be continued. I trust that it may not be 
marred, but that if possible it may be added to. 

John, in his first general epistle, uses this language : 

"For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and 
show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested 
unto us." 

It has been made clear by the remarks of the brethren during this 
conference that there are two classes of witnesses, the first, the Divine 
witness, as spoken of very clearly by Elder Whitney, and also by other 
speakers during this conference, and human witnesses, mentioned par- 
ticularly by Elder David O. McKay. The first great class is illustrated 
in the last chapter of Moroni, which is the last chapter in the Book 
of Mormon, wherein we are told that by the power of the Holy Ghost 
the truth of all things may be made known unto us, and the formula 
is given for obtaining the power of the Holy Ghost as that witness — 
by prayer to God the Eternal Father in the name of Jesus Christ, with 
a sincere heart, with real intent and with faith in Christ. 

Human witnesses are provided for as shown by the twenty-seventh 
chapter of II Nephi. The importance of this class of witnesses is 
emphasized by the promise of the three witnesses and eight witnesses in 
support of the divinity of the Nephite scriptures. In the scriptures we 
have human as well as divine testimony to support the truth. 1 appreci- 
ate both classes of evidence. I am impressed with the testimony of 
Mary, the mother of the Master. Her testimony is recorded in holy 
writ in language that has always thrilled me when I read it. Of all the 
witnesses except the great testator, the Holy Ghost, it seems that Mary, 
the mother of Jesus, should know as well as anyone the divinity of her 
son. Her testimony is recorded in the first chapter of Luke, beginning 
at the forty-sixth verse, when she realized that she was favored above 
all women, as the angel had informed her. She exclaimed: 

"My soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
Savior. 

"For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden; for, behold, from 
henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 

"For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name." 
Elizabeth, her cousin, had the same witness. She knew that Mary 
was greatly favored above women. The same divine testimony came 
to Joseph, and he understood the honor that had been bestowed upon 
him and upon his espoused. 

A little later, Simeon was privileged to perform the law, and 
when he takes the babe in his arms he feels that the honor is sufficient 
for him; that he is now ready to depart. He exclaims, "Lord, now 
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



165 



eyes have seen thy salvation, which God hath prepared before the face 
of all people, a light to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." 

There was also the promised son of Elizabeth to testify to the 
coming of the Master, the voice crying in the wilderness, calling to 
repentance and anouncing that there came one after him whose shoe 
latchet he was not worthy to stoop down and unloose, He who was to 
baptize with fire, as he, John, was baptizing with water. 

Then there was Jesus' marvelous ministry. At twelve years of age, 
the boy in the temple asking and answering questions with the wise men. 
Later the matchless Sermon on the Mount, after hearing which the 
people were astonished because he taught them not as the scribes, but 
as one having authority. Then his wonderful ministry of which a 
ruler of the Jews, Nicodemus, could say to him, "Rabbi, we know that 
thou art a teacher sent from God for no man could do the miracles that 
thou doest except God be with him." 

And yet after all testimonies of Jesus' ministry we have reached an 
age when study and scholarship seem to darken these great truths. 
Those of us who have accepted as a reality the introduction of the Son 
by the Father to the Prophet Joseph, the revelation upon which the 
restoration of the gospel is founded, can scarcely realize the darkened 
condition of the minds of some so-called Biblical scholars. I am not in 
the habit of repeating things that are not constructively helpful, but it 
is not enough to be satisfied ourselves, but we have the duty of assist- 
ing the world to come to a knowledge of the great truths which we 
rejoice in. There were published in some of the recent magazines of 
international value the remarks of a professor of one of our great 
institutions, upon this subject of the divinity of the Master — a man 
who had written a good deal concerning Jesus, and yet who seemed to 
become more darkened the more he wrote, because in an article in the 
Hibbert Journal, on Jesus, he asserted that the divine incarnation is 
alien to the teachings of Jesus Christ and to those of the original dis- 
ciples, and that we cannot longer regard the teachings of Jesus as of 
unique authority or of permanent validity. These critics profess to 
give greater weight to> the so-called synoptical gospels, Matthew, Mark 
and Luke, than to the writings of John or of Paul. Since reading this 
assertion of this professor I have re-examined the sayings of Jesus as 
recorded in some of the synoptical gospels, particularly Matthew, to 
see whether it was possible that I had been mistaken all this while in 
the thought that these gospels did give indication that Jesus proclaimed 
that he was the Christ. We have had some of these instances testi- 
fied to during this conference. The answer to the question that he 
asked his disciples as to whom men said he was — the final answer of 
Peter, "Thou- art the Christ, the Son of the living God," and the reply 
of approval by the Master, when he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven." 

And yet in the light of such scriptures there are so-called pro- 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fessors who will declare that it is alien to the teachings of Christ that 
he claims incarnation, or to be the Messiah of the world. 

I have noted many passages of scripture, particularly from Mat- 
thew, that indicate he was more than mortal. For instance, in the 
raising of the boy with the palsy, when he said: "Thy sins be for- 
given thee," and then, reading the thoughts of the Pharisees, question- 
ing that he had that power, he asked them whether it was easier to say, 
"Thy sins bje forgiven thee," or, "Arise and take up thy bed and walk?" 
He performed healings under cricumstances that one could not doubt 
that he had the power also to forgive sins. 

When the mother of Zebedee's children came to him and asked 
the privilege for one of her children to sit upon his left hand and one 
upon the right, he told her that privilege was not his to bestow, but 
was the right of his Father. 

He spoke of ascending in glory. 

I shall not take time to refer to any considerable number of these 
instances, but just a few to illustrate how presumptious and blasphemous 
it would have been for the Savior, had he been a mere mortal, to have 
assumed the authority and uttered the words that he did, in the auth- 
ority of his high calling as the Messiah and the Redeemer of the 
world. He spoke of the time when the Son of man shall come in his 
glory and all the holy angels with him. "Then shall he sit upon the 
throne of his glory, and then shall the king say unto them on his right 
hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for 
you from the foundation of the world." Again, at the time of his 
crucifixion, "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father and 
he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?" And 
then the circumstances of the administering of the holy sacrament to 
his disciples, and the concluding commission to them : "Go ye therefore 
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I have given you, and lo, I am with you always even unto 
the end of the world." What presumption would it have been to so 
speak, if he had been merely human? 

These professors shy at the teachings of St. John, although his 
gospel has been called the most influential book known to the literature 
of the world, a book, by the way, which is replete with testimonies 
pertaining to the divinity of Jesus. Let me quote a few of these : 

"I and the Father that sent me." 

"Ye neither know me nor my Father." 

"That which I have seen with my Father." 

"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." 

"I am the Light and the Life of the world." 

"I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world." 

"The glory which I had with thee before the world was." 

"The Word was made flesh." 

"In whom dwell all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." 
Many more expressions along this line, are found which time will 
not permit to call your attention to. But there is much, particularly 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



167 



in the writings of John, in support of his claim of Messiahship, which 
some modern writers, in the sterility of their learning, seem to take 
pleasure in denying There is a type of mentality which seems to 
think it an indication of freedom and independence on their part to 
deny the most vital and well established truths. 

The testimony of the divinity of Jesus by the Prophets of old, 
you are no doubt familiar with. The expression of Isaiah taken from 
the ninth chapter of this prophet: "For unto you a child is born, unto 
us a Son is given, and the government shall rest upon his shoulders, 
and he shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace." 

May the Lord help us to cherish this precious testimony which 
he has given unto us of the Prince of Peace, this Mighty God, our 
Savior and Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen, 
i 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

This conference has been one of joy and pleasure to me, and I 
have listened with appreciation to the doctrines, teachings and 
instructions of my brethren. These meetings give us all new life, 
new vigor, a new outlook, new thoughts and new resolves ; and I 
believe that we shall go home from this conference filled with the 
bread of life. 

When President Grant announced the great missionary move- 
ment and the call for one thousand mature men to go on missions 
for short terms, it filled my soul with gladness. I saw these vigor- 
ous, mature men, able defenders of the gospel, accepting this call, 
coming to Salt Lake, being set apart under the hands of the serv- 
ants of God ; I saw them arriving in the various fields of labor, re- 
ceiving counsel and advice from their mission presidents ; then 
going forth to the villages, hamlets, and the great cities of this land, 
and perhaps of other countries, preaching the gospel of Jesus 
Christ and crying repentance to all people. 

I saw these devoted men, and perhaps women, knocking at 
the doors of the people's homes, offering tracts, soliciting entertain- 
ment, sometimes being rebuffed and sometimes welcomed ; deliver- 
ing tracts which convey the gospel's message to those who will 
open their doors. I saw them on the street corners, addressing ever- 
shifting and changing congregations ; in the civic centers, in the 
parks, upon steps of public buildings ; and, in fact, wherever the 
police will permit them to preach. I saw these men, happy and 
thankful for the privilege of raising their warning voices once more 
to the inhabitants of this and other lands. 

As a result of this preaching and tracting the hearts of some 
will be truly touched by the message of the gospel ; some will stop 
and listen ; others will invite the missionaries to call ; still others 
will hear the message through their friends. A few words will sink 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



into the hearts of some of the listeners, and they will want to hear 
something more of this work. They will attend the little meeting 
places, sometimes a rented hall, sometimes a small chapel owned 
by the Church, and now and again a nice building. 

This work has been done by the bearers of the gospel thou- 
sands of times. Men will say to themselves and to one another : 
What shall we do? They will hear the message through the serv- 
ants of the Lord, and some few will accept it and become valiant 
defenders of the truth in their own communities. They will re- 
ceive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and this will drive 
out of their minds, if they will but permit it, all sectarianism and 
dogmatism from which the world is suffering today. 

Then I thought: It is probable that under the inspiration of 
the Lord our brethren have called this multitude of men to labor 
on these short missions so that our great nation may be once more 
warned. 'During the last few years there has been a slipping away 
from religious ideals and spirituality in the missions. Great con- 
troversies have been waging. Only recently this happened in Ten- 
nessee, and prominent men have shaken the people's faith in a liv- 
ing God and in the fundamental teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ 
and his atonement and the resurrection. Is the Lord sending out 
our brethren to warn these people to hold fast to the truth and to 
acknowledge the redemption and saving power of Jesus Christ? 

So, in my opinion, a great mission will be accomplished. It 
will stand out as an epoch in the history of this Church because of 
the mighty effort that will once more be made to call all the in- 
habitants of this nation and other nations to repentance. 

I had in mind this afternoon to say a few words concerning the 
poor, but time will not permit me to express all my thoughts. In 
Section 52 of the Doctrine and Covenants there is a statement given 
by the Lord, which startled me for a moment when I first read it: 
"And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and 
the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not 
my disciple." Is it possible that in our haste and hurry and in the 
rush of life we have not digested this thought? It may be that 
some have said to themselves that the poverty and misery people 
suffer is usually brought upon them by their own folly ; but King 
Benjamin in giving his final message to the people of Nephi says 
this: "Perhaps thou shalt say: the man has brought upon himself 
his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto 
him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may 
not suffer, for his punishments are just." But that good man said 
unto them : "Whosoever doeth this, the same hath great cause to 
repent." It is a common habit for us to express ourselves in that 
way. 

I will also quote you a favorite passage of Bishop Nibley's from 
the writings of the Apostle James in the New Testament : "Pure 
religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



169 



the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world." 

Then, our Lord and Savior, when talking to the lawyer, made 
two definite propositions : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and 
with all thy mind ; and thy neighbor as thyself." 

I hope we shall all go home, thankful to the Lord for the 
abundant harvest, for the way the land has been blessed, for the 
opportunity that has come to the people of the Lord to get out of 
debt; and with all these blessings we shall not forget the poor, the 
sick, and the afflicted. If only our people could remember that even 
ten cents a day each month would do so much and if each church 
member would give this amount, the bishops would have in their 
hands each month $50,000. Then widows "could be provided with 
homes and some of the comforts of life, and we could give more 
intelligent service to the sick, the afflicted, and all those who need 
our help. We are not doing enough of this. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to remember our responsi- 
bilities to live up to our privileges and to keep his commandments, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

INTRODUCING ELDER REY L. PRATT 

If this were a picture show or some silly thing we could 
laugh at, we could stand it for two hours and a half and perhaps 
three, but if we should run ten or fifteen minutes over the time 
today I expect many of you would get up and go out. 

Before the close of this conference I desire to hear the testi- 
mony of Brother Rey L. Pratt. I desire this grandson of Parley P. 
Pratt who was one of the greatest of all the great writers of inspired 
hymns in our Church, and one of the great preachers, to bear testi- 
mony to us before departing upon his mission to South America. 
And if there is anybody who cannot stay until Brother Pratt gets 
through, I would be much obliged to them if they would leave now. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the oppor- 
tunity this afternoon of standing before you here and bearing my 
testimony concerning the divinity of the gospel of our Lord and 
Savior, which has been restored to this day and age in which we 
live. I am indeed happy to have been deemed worthy to be the 
least of the three chosen to go into the land of South America for 
the purpose of establishing a mission there, and opening up in that 
land the work of the Lord for the preaching of the gospel to our 
Father's children who reside there. Particularly am I happy, my 



170 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



brethren and sisters, in the thought that the gospel is to be carried 
to more of our Father's children in the house of Israel, verily the 
Lamanite people, who reside upon this land of America; and my 
heart has been thrilled, my brethren and sisters, with the sure and 
faithful teachings of this conference. 

I realize that I am going into a southland, that I shall pass 
over the tropics, that I shall go through the lands where monkeys 
dwell, and I rejoice in the testimony that has been given unto me 
that I do not have to consider them the cousins that I am going to 
preach the gospel to. I am of the house of Israel through Ephraim, 
according to the patriarchal blessing that I have received, in which 
I believe implicitly. The people that we go to preach to are of the 
house of Israel, of Joseph, through Manasseh principally, also with 
a sprinkling of the blood of Ephraim among them. They are our 
brethren and sisters, they are our blood relatives, they have an in- 
heritance upon this land, they are heirs to the gospel. The Lord 
has foretold in words of plainness this day that has now dawned 
upon us, and for which I do most truly thank him. 

If I may impose upon your time just a moment or two I should 
like to read from the Book of Mormon a number of predictions that 
to me seem to be fulfilled now. Of course, the work is all before 
us, and I do not undertake this work with my brethren in the 
thought that we are going down there to have particularly a good 
time, in the sense in which many deem it a good time, but I realize 
fully the responsibility of our call and the enormous amount of 
work that it will take to bring about the prophecies of the Lord that 
I should like to refer to here this afternoon. If you will turn to the 
first chapter of the 2nd Book of Nephi, you will find recorded the 
following : 

"And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of 
teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things unto them — 
how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the 
land of Jerusalem. 

"And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the waters, 
and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed 
up in the sea. 

"And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which 
they had obtained — how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that 
we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem. 

"For, behold, said he, I have seen a vision, in which I know that 
Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also 
have perished. 

"But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land 
of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the 
Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance 
of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my 
children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries 
by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore, I Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit 
which is in me, that there shall none come into this land save they shall 
be brought by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore, this land is concecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And 
if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



171 



he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall 
never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; 
for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto 
the righteous it shall be blessed forever. 

"And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the 
knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the 
land, that there would be no place for an inheritance. 

"Wherefore, I Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those 
whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his 
commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land, and they 
shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto 
themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they 
shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest 
them, nor to take awa} r the land of their inheritance and they shall dwell 
safely forever. 

"But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in unbelief, 
after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord — 
having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the 
great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; 
having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the command- 
ments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness 
into this precious land of promise — behold, I say, if the day shall come 
that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Re- 
deemer of their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just shall rest 
upon them. 

"Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give unto them 
power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, 
and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten." 

My brethren and sisters, Lehi foresaw what would be the condi- 
tion among his children if they would live in harmony with the 
commandments of the Lord that he had received for his children 
upon this land — that it should always be for them a land of security, 
the land of their inheritance, and that they should possess it un- 
molested by other people. But when they should turn away the re- 
verse would be the case. History tells us that they turned away 
from the God of the land. They rejected Jesus Christ after his 
kingdom had been set up here, and behold the curse of the Lord 
has rested upon the land. I was in company with Elder Richard R. 
Lyman and Dr. George W. Middleton, only recently traversing the 
parts of Mexico where many important ruined cities lie, and it is 
marvelous to note the wonderful civilization that has once lived 
there, and it is marvelous to note how completely even the memory 
of them has been wiped out, and they are nowhere to be found. 
Were it not for the sacred volume of history from which I have 
read there would be no answer to the great riddle of those wonder- 
ful cities that were builded with such wonderful architecture in 
that land. Huge stones that we measured and calculated would 
weigh more than twenty tons, fitted closely together, having been 
brought a distance of three miles, and the joints fitted without 
mortar. So close are they fitted that the pen knife which we car- 
ried with us could not be inserted between the joints. This be- 
speaks a people who were mighty. It bespeaks also the fulfilment 
of the word of the Lord in regard to the destruction of this people. 
Prophets of that time, particularly Nephi the son of Lehi, foresaw 



172 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



all these things as a consequence of neglect among the people. 
What greater fulfilment of the word of the Lord could we desire? 

These prophets stated that they should be scattered and 
smitten by other people. Other prophecies in the book state that 
it should be the Gentile nations that should come in among them, 
that they should reduce this people to a remnant. The descendants 
of the builders of those mighty cities, my brethren and sisters, have 
verily been reduced to a remnant. Statistics given out by Jauregue, 
a statistician and historian of Guatemala, are to the effect that of 
all the native tribes south of the Rio Grande, since the coming of 
the Spaniards they have been reduced. nine-tenths. They have be- 
come a hiss and a by-word, they have become the hewers of wood 
and drawers of water for the Gentile oppressors who have come in 
amongst them. 

But I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the prophecy that I 
shall not take time to read, but merely to refer to, the word of the 
Lord that came to Nephi ; you will find it recorded in I Nephi 13, 
wherein he saw all these terrible things that should befall his peo- 
ple, but he said that he saw that in the providences of the Lord 
he would not permit the Gentile nations to utterly overcome and 
wipe out the remnant of his seed, that should be among his brethren 
the Lamanites. Neither would he permit them to utterly overcome 
the seed of his brethren and wipe them out from the face of the 
land. If you will turn then to II Nephi 30, you will find wherein 
the Lord said that there should be a church established among the 
Gentile people, and a book should come forth. Many among the 
Gentiles should believe the words of the Book that was to be writ- 
ten, and they should carry it back to the descendants of those who 
wrote it, for their redepmtion, for it should contain the fulness of 
the Everlasting Gospel, and it should be preached among the 
descendants of those who wrote the book, and not many genera- 
tions should pass away save they should become a white and a de- 
lightsome people again. 

Then if you will turn to III Nephi 21, you will find recorded 
there the time when we might look for the beginning of this won- 
derful work of restoration and redemption among that people who 
have been cursed of the Lord, and who have suffered so much and 
so long. Only those who have become intimately associated with 
them, my brethren and sisters, and have been touched by the ages 
of sorrow that they have wallowed through, know how they have 
suffered. And the Lord said that when these things should begin 
to come forth unto the seed of Lehi from the Gentiles to whom 
these things should be committed, and the seed of Lehi should 
begin to believe, then the Church, then the world, then all men 
might know that the Lord had set his hand to establish his work 
among that people, and to bring to pass his promises, and the great 
redemption that he had prepared for that people. 

I bear you my witness, my brethren and sisters, this afternoon 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



173 



in all solemnity, that I know that this is the work of the Lord, and 
for nineteen years have I labored in the land of Mexico and we 
have hundreds and thousands of valiant, true, faithful Latter-day 
Saints who believe the message of the gospel as it has been re- 
stored. They have not only begun to receive it, but they are now 
receiving it in considerable number. I wish to call your attention 
to the fact that so far this year already in the Mexican mission 
many pure-blooded Lamanites have been baptized. Yes, even more 
than were baptized during the ministration of Moses Thatcher, as 
president of the Mexican mission, with those who succeeded him; 
namely, August Wilson, Anthony W. Ivins, Heleman Pratt, Horace 
H. Cummings, and Henry Eyring. More have been baptized this 
year than were baptized during the ministry of all those men. 

So I have faith, my brethren and sisters, that the time has come, 
and I feel that our leader, under the inspiration of the Lord, has 
made no mistake in opening up the work in that land. I hope to 
play my part well. I have no desire other than to serve God by 
serving his children who need my services in that land or in any 
other land. I have dedicated my life to this work, I have given all 
upon the altar, and I have had to make sacrifices. As President 
Ivins said last night, we labor and we do sacrifice, and I have had it 
brought home to me that the Lord sometimes takes us at our word 
when we say we are willing to make sacrifices. I have cast my 
lot in that foreign land to sacrifice for this work, and I wish to 
continue faithful, my brethren and sisters, I wish to go with the 
faith and the prayers and the good will of my brethren. I know, as 
I stated in the beginning, that I only go as a helper. I am con- 
tented, I am proud, I am willing to go as an assistant in this great 
work of the Lord in that land. Oh, how my heart rejoices to think, 
as I picture now those great buildings that we visited the other day, 
that those who built them might now be smiling, they might now 
be rejoicing in the fact that God has moved upon his servants to 
call some others of his servants to go and bring the truth to their 
descendants, to call them out of their lethargy, out of their super- 
stitions, out of the traditions through which they have wallowed 
all these generations, that there might come to them that faith, the 
greatest thing in all the world, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, upon 
which this work is builded, that it may be kindled in their hearts 
and burst into a flame, that they may become workers of righteous- 
ness. 

I rejoice in this great work. I pray for the blessings of the 
Lord to be upon the Saints at home and to be upon us who shall 
go so far away. I have brethren come to me and congratulate me 
upon my call, which I accept gladly, and they have said: "I wish 
that I could go. I wish I were numbered among those who are 
going to that land." Let me give you just one little hint. If you 
really and truly mean it, prepare yourselves for the work, for I 
think I can see, as this work begins to open up, the necessity for 



174 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the calling, not of one thousand men, but of ten times one thou- 
sand men, to reach all of our Father's children who yet need the 
blessings of the gospel. Prepare yourselves by study. Prepare 
yourselves by getting out of debt. Prepare yourselves by shaping 
your financial affairs so that when the time comes you can answer, 
''Aye, Lord, I am ready, take me, and do with me as thou wilt, in 
the consummation of thy great work among thy children here upon 
the earth." 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and bless us 
all in his service. My testimony to you is that God lives, that I 
know he lives, and that Jesus Christ is his Son, and that I, even I, 
in company with all of you, am made in his image and in his like- 
ness. Oh, how I rejoice to know these things ; oh, how I desire to 
keep alive in myself the faith that I have in Him, and how I an- 
guish and how I grieve when I think of the possibility of that faith 
being destroyed in my children whom I am obliged to leave to the 
mercies of the schools of the age, the Church schools and otherwise, 
and know that there are conditions and that there are men who, 
if it were possible, are anxious to destroy that faith in my children. 
I love them as I love my life, but more than anything else, I desire 
that they shall keep alive the faith that is the foundation of eternal 
life, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I bear you this testimony and 
invoke the blessings of the Lord upon us all, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

TESTIMONY OF MILANDO PRATT 

"President Heber J. Grant, Beloved President: My bosom has swelled 
with exceeding joy in listening to the most interesting conference services 
over the radio, from my bedroom, where I have spent most of the time 
for the past nearly ten years, through a severe operation, followed by a 
prolonged, painful illness. I have heard distinctly all the tabernacle serv- 
ices, about three miles distant from my home. I am quite sure all the 
speakers were greatly inspired. Your brother in the Gospel, 

"MILANDO PRATT." 

Milando Pratt is a cousin of our last speaker, and a son of 
Orson Pratt who was one of the greatest writers and defenders of 
the truth that the Church has ever had. 

Brother Roberts reminds me that way in the 50's the grand- 
father of Brother Rey L. Pratt, namely, Parley P. Pratt, first car- 
ried the gospel to the land of Chile, in South America. 

ELDER JOSEPH BARLOW DEAD 

I overlooked announcing that Brother Joseph Barlow, coun- 
selor to the President of the Raft River stake, has passed away 
since our last conference. We extend to the family our sympathy. 

MISSIONS ESTABLISHED SINCE LAST CONFERENCE 

There have been established since our last conference the 
North Central States mission, with John G. Allred as President; 



PRESIDENT HEBER }. GRANT

and the German-Austrian mission, with Elder Fred Tadje as Presi- 
dent, formerly president of the Swiss and German mission. 

NEW PRESIDENTS OF MISSIONS 

Six presidents of missions have been appointed as follows since 
last conference : J. Howard Jenkins as president of the N«w Zea- 
land mission ; Herbert B. Foulger, acting president of the Tahitian 
mission; John H. Anderson, president of the Swedish mission; 
Hugh J. Cannon, president of the Swiss and German mission ; and 
Ernest C. Rossiter, president of the French mission. 

MISSION PRESIDENTS RELEASED 

Mission presidents released since our last conference : Angus 
T. Wright, New Zealand mission ; Ole B. Peterson, Tahitian mis- 
sion ; Hugo D. E. Peterson, Swedish mission ; Russell H. Blood, 
French mission. All of these released mission presidents have our 
love and blessing and full confidence, and also those who have been 
appointed. 

ABSENT 

There have been absent from this conference, as you know, 
Elder Reed Smoot, of the Council of the Twelve, in Washington, 
and Elder James E. Talmage, of the Council of the Twelve, who 
is presiding over the European mission. The reports from Brother 
Talmage are very encouraging and very satisfactory, and he is 
thoroughly enjoying his labors. The newspapers keep us well 
posted on the very wonderful and magnificent labors that Senator 
Reed Smoot is" performing in Washington. These brethren have 
our love and confidence and constant prayers for their success. 

APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE EXPRESSED 

I feel to say on behalf of the Presidency of the Church that we 
are very grateful for the wonderful outpouring of the people during 
this conference. We are grateful for the light and inspiration of 
the Spirit of the Lord accompanying those who have spoken to us, 
and we give to the Saints the love and blessing of all of the Gen- 
eral Authorities of the Church, and we echo the sentiment that 
has been uttered here, time and again during this conference, 
in the opening and closing prayers and in some of the remarks, that 
, the inspiration and spirit of this conference may be carried by the 
people who have been here to the various stakes of Zion. 

May God bless you one and all. May each and every one of us 
who have a testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged, so order our lives that those who know not the truth, 
seeing our diligence, our faith, our humility, and our desire to 
serve God, may be led to investigate the truth that we have to bear 
to them. This is my prayer and desire, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



176

WHENCE THIS GOSPEL WE TEACH? 



Read 

"Restoration of the Gospel" 

By OSBORNE J. P. WIDTSOE 

"This book prepared by Elder Osborne J. P. Widtsoe, dealing with 
the important subject of the Restoration of the everlasting Gospel, 
should be read and its contents carefully considered by those who are 
seeking after truth. It treats the Restoration clearly, and places before

ANOTHER NEW ONE THAT IS WORTH WHILE 

The Fruits of Mormonism 

FRANKLIN STEWART HARRIS and NEWBERN I. BUTT 
Author of "Scientific Research and Human Welfare," etc. 

This study grew out of a demand for the real facts concerning 
conditions among the Mormons. The authors have had the best pos- 
sible opportunity for making personal observations in every part of 
Mormondom and they have spent a number of years gathering material 
for this book. No attempt has been made here to determine the truth 
or falsity of Mormonism as a religion. The authors have been concerned 
to discover the accomplishment and condition of the Mormons as 
regards social welfare and as compared with other peoples of the 
country. The chief sources used are the reports of the United States 
Census Bureau and the official reports of various state, county, and 
municipal agencies. 

Successive chapters deal with the effect of the philosophy of Mor- 
monism on the lives of its members; education and the development 
of leadership among the Mormons; the Mormons as colonizers; their 
attitude toward the government; their patriotism; their charities; their 
health; motherhood, marriage, and divorce; insanity and crime.

WHAT DID JOSEPH SMITH KNOW ABOUT SCIENCE? 

Read: 

Joseph Smith as Scientist 

By JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

"In the life of every person, who receives a higher education, in or 
out of schools, there is a time when there seems to be opposition be- 
tween science and religion; between man-made and God-made knowl- 
edge. The struggle for reconciliation between the contending forces 
is not an easy one. It cuts deep into the soul and usually leaves scars 
that ache while life endures. There are thousands of young people in 
the Church today, and hundreds of thousands throughout the world, who 
are struggling to set themselves right with the God above and the world 
about them. It is for these young people, primarily, that this book has 
been written."

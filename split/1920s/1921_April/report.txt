being led captive by the will of 
the devil. 

14. Now this is the state of the 
* souls of the wicked, yea, in "dark- 
ness, and a state of awful, fear- 
ful looking for the fiery indigna- 
tion of the wrath of God upon 
them; thus they remain in this 
state, as well as the righteous in 
"paradise, until the time of their 
resurrection. 

15. Now, there are some that 
have understood that this state 
of happiness and this state of 
misery of the soul, before the 
resurrection, was a first resurrec- 
tion. Yea, I admit it may be 
termed a resurrection, the 'rais- 
ing of the spirit or the soul and 
their consignation to happiness 
or misery, according to the words 
which have been spoken. 

16. And behold, again it hath 
been spoken, that there is a 'first 
resurrection, a resurrection of all 
those who have been, or who are, 
or who shall be, down to the res- 
urrection of Christ from the dead. 

17. Now, we do not suppose 
that this first resurrection, which 
is spoken of in this manner, can 
be the resurrection 'of the souls 
and their consignation to happi- 
ness or misery. Ye cannot sup- 
pose that this is what it meaneth. 

18. Behold, I say unto you, Nay; 
but it meaneth the 'reuniting of 
the soul with the body of those 
'"from the days of Adam down to 
the resurrection of Christ. 

19. Now, whether the souls and 
the bodies of those of whom has 
been spoken shall all be reunited 
at once, the wicked as well as the 
righteous, I do not say; let it suf- 
fice, that I say that they all come 
forth; or in other words, their 
resurrection cometh to pass "be- 



fore the resurrection of those 
who die after the resurrection of 
Christ. 

20. Now, my son, I do not say 
that their resurrection cometh at 
the resurrection of Christ; but be- 
hold, I give it as my opinion, that 
the souls and the bodies are "re- 
united, of the righteous, at the 
resurrection of Christ, and his 
ascension into heaven. 

21. But whether it be at his 
resurrection or after, I do not 
say; but this much I say, that 
there is a p space between death 
and the resurrection of the body, 
and a state of the soul in happi- 
ness or in misery until the time 
which is appointed of God that 
the dead shall come forth, and be 
reunited, both soul and body, and 
be brought to stand before God, 
and be judged according to their 
works. 

22. Yea, this bringeth about 
the restoration of those things of 
which has been spoken by the 
mouths of the prophets. 

23. The "soul shall be restored 
to the body, and the body to the 
soul; yea, and every limb and, 
joint shall be restored to its body;' 
yea, even a hair of the head shall 
not be lost; but all things shall 
be restored to their proper and 
perfect frame. 

24. And now, my son, this is 
the restoration of which has been 
spoken by the mouths of the 
prophets — 

25. And then shall the right- 
eous shine forth in the kingdom 
of God. 

26. But behold, an awful 'death 
cometh upon the wicked; for they 
die as to things pertaining to 
things of righteousness; for they 
are unclean, and "no unclean thing

NINETY-FIRST 

ANNUAL CONFERENCE 

Of the 

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 



FIRST DAY 

The Ninety-First annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints convened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, at 10 
a. m., Sunday, April 3, 1921. 

President Heber J. Grant presided.

2 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

and there were, besides, overflow meetings in the Assembly Hall, and 
at the Bureau of Information. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Zion stands with hills sur- 
rounded." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. A. Hyde, President of the Po- 
catello stake of Zion. 

"Behold the Lily" was sung by the choir and the Misses Catherine 
and Louise Watson as soloists, the music being by Tracy Y. Cannon. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am indeed delighted to see such a wonderful audience here this 
morning. It is gratifying to note the interest that has been manifested 
by the Latter-day Saints in their assembling together, throughout the 
various stakes of Zion, during the past six mojnths, in fact, during the 
past year, in their houses of worship, to render thanks to the Lord for 
his goodness and mercy to them, and to testify of the blessings they 
have received. 

I have prepared some items that I believe will' be of interest to this 
conference. It has been usual, in the opening address, to give some 
items regarding the condition of the Church. 

INCREASED ATTENDANCE AT SACRAMENT MEETINGS. 

Our reports show that there has been an increased attendance at 
our sacrament meetings and fast meetings, all over the Church. I 
never listen to the revealed prayers: that came from God, to> be used in 
our sacrament meetings, wherein we, through those who administer the 
sacrament, express our determination to remember our Lord and Re- 
deemer, Jesus Christ, and to express our willingness to obey him and to 
keep the commandments which he has given us but what I rejoice in 
the inspiration of Joseph Smith, in translating the Book of Mormon, 
and giving to us those two wonderful sacramental prayers, those two 
marvelous covenants that all Latter-day Saints make when they assem- 
ble together and partake of the sacrament. I rejoice in knowing that 
there has been an increase in the attendance at these meetings, and 
also at our fast meetings, where we are able to testify of the many 
blessings of God to us as a people. I am grateful to our young peo- 
ple for adopting the slogan that they were in favor of developing spirit- 
ual growth by attendance at our sacrament meetings. The attendance 
has increased, and therefore there has been a spiritual growth. 

LOCAL MISSIONARY LABORS. 

The missionary work which was outlined in our general Priest- 
hood meeting at the last October Conference, has been successfully 
conducted in most of the stakes and has been the means of doing a 
great deal of good. This labor is twice blessed. It blesses him that 
gives and him that receives. Some of the choicest meetings that I have 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 3 

been permitted to attend, during the last six months, have been gath- 
erings of those who are engaged in missionary work in the various 
stakes of Zion; and I rejoice to know that many people who have 
heard the word of God, through these missionaries, have been baptized 
into the Church. I believe that in proportion to the amount of labor 
that has been put forth in the various stakes of Zion, o'f a missionary 
character, among those who are in our midst, but who know not the 
gospel, there have been as many, if not more, baptisms than there 
have been in the missionary fields throughout the different parts of the 
world. 

TEMPLE WORK. 

The work in our temples is progressing very satisfactorily; the 
attendance has been increased, and the great interest throughout the 
Church in temple work is very encouraging. We are now having 
four companies daily in the Salt Lake Temple. I think that it was a 
very wonderful .example of the faith of the Latter-day Saints in temple 
work, when a fast-day was declared and the people were requested, 
last September, to make donations to aid in the erection of the temple 
in Arizona, that over one hundred eighteen thousand dollars was col- 
lected without one cent of expense, by donation upon the special fast- 
day set apart for that purpose. Nothing could more conclusively show 
the loyalty of the Latter-day Saints to that principle of the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, revealed again to the earth, namely, the right 
and the privilege to perform labors in the holy temples of God for 
those of our ancestors who have passed beyond the veil than to have 
upon a single fast day throughout this Church one hundred .eighteen 
thousands dollars contributed by the people for the erection of the Ari- 
zona Temple. 

TEMPLE BLOCK LABORS. 

I wish to commend the splendid missionary work done on the 
Temple Block, under the direction of the Bureau of Information, to- 
gether with the free organ recitals which are given to the public. The 
amount of good done by this excellent labor can hardly be estimated. 
I have met people who have visited the Temple Block, from Salt Lake 
City to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Salt Lake City to New York, 
and to San Francisco, and in Canada and other places, and I know 
from my conversation with them of the splendid impression that has 
been made upon their minds by coming in contact with those devoted 
men and women who are working upon the Temple Block here as mis- 
sionaries. 

CHANGES OF OFFICERS IN STAKES AND MISSIONS. 

There has been a slight increase in the payment of fast offerings, 
although there is still room for much improvement in this matter. 
Since our last Conference there have been two new Stakes organized 
— North Sevier stake, with Moroni Lazenby as president and South 
Sevier stake, with John E. Magleby president. Since our last Confer- 
ence, John N. Henrie, President of the Panguitch stake, has passed 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

away. He was a faithful, diligent president of that stake of Zion. 

Since our last Conference the following bishops have passed away : 
Bishop Herbert Beck, of Centerfield ward, South Sanpete stake; 
Bishop Godfrey Fuhriman, of Providence First ward, Logan stake; 
Bishop Walter Roberts, of Sutherland ward, Deseret stake, and Bishop 
Clyde A. Hammond, of Moab ward, San Juan stake. We extend the 
blessings of the General Authorities to the families of these our 
brethren, who have been called from us since our last Conference. 

The following changes in stake presidencies have been made since 
our last Conference: Albert Choules has succeded Don C. Driggs as 
President of the Teton stake, William J., Henderson has succeeded the 
late John N. Henrie, as president of the Panguitch stake. Brother 
Driggs was released with the love and confidence and blessing of his 
brethren, as the President of the Teton stake. 

In the Netherlands mission, John T. Lillywhite has been appoint- 
ed president, to succeed John A. Butterworth. Mark Coombs has been 
appointed as President of the Tonga mission to succeed Willard L. 
Smith. J. Wiley Sessions has been appointed president of the South 
African mission to succeed Nicholas G. Smith. I have received a let- 
ter from Brother Sessions announcing his arrival in South Africa. 
Brother Sessions had been trying for nearly a year to get to South 
Africa, but on account of the obstructions put in the way by officials, 
who refused to vise passports and to allow him to go there, we have 
been under the necessity of keeping Brother Nicholas Groesbeck Smith 
in that mission another year after we felt that he should have been 
released. Brother Smith has filled a splendid mission in South Africa 
and will return with the love and blessings of all the authorities of the 
Church. 

; VITAL AND EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS. 

Seventy-five per cent of the families of the Church in the Stakes 
of Zion own their homes. The birth rate of the Church is now 
38 per 1,000. The death rate is 9 per 1,000. The marriage rate is 
15.5 per 1,000. There has been expended for educational purposes 
$718,497.19. There has been expended for tabernacle, meeting houses 
and amusement halls, $346,203.17. 

MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES. 

There has been expended for missionary activities $511,709.97. 
This does not take into aocount the amount expended by the individ- 
uals who go upon missions, nor the amount that they lose by giving 
up their employment to go upon missions. This, I am sure, would be 
more than two million dollars a year, in addition to this half million 
dollars. So that the Latter-day Saints, as a people, are giving to the 
world an object lesson, such as I believe no other people upon the face 
of the earth are giving of their love of God, that first great command- 
ment given to us, and also the second commandment to love our neigh- 
bor as ourselves. When we stop to reflect that a handful of people, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 5 

numbering in all parts of the world only five hundred thousand men, 
women, children and babies, that they are expending $2,500,000 a 
year in time and means to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, with no hope of earthly reward, we find an object lesson of 
the love of our fellows that I believe cannot be matched, in fact I know 
it cannot be matched, in all the wide world. 

HELP FOE THE POOR. 

There has been expended for assistance rendered to the poor, 
$450,000, of which $110,000 was raised during a single fast day for 
the relief of the sufferers in Europe, in Armenia and other places. 
There has been expended for Temple purposes $158,715.29. 

I received a splendid letter from the Near East Relief Commit- 
tee, in New York, which I failed to find this morning ; but a day or 
two ago the following letter was received from Herbert L. Gutterson : 

"New York City, March 21st, 1921. 
"Mr. Heber J. Grant, 
47 E. South Temple St., 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 

"Dear Mr. Grant: We are in receipt of your letter of the 16th, addressed 
to Mr. Hoover, which we wish to acknowledge in his behalf. 

"The contribution of $68,318.21 from your Church is a most splendid testi- 
monial to the cause, which was the basis for the formation of the European 
Relief Council." 

"Please accept in the name of the European Relief Council as a body, our 
most sincere, heartfelt thanks for the contribution from the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; and we beg that you will express to them this 
sentiment and gratitude for their co-operation. 
"With kindest wishes, we are, 

"Very sincerely yours, 

"Control Committee. 

"By Herbert L. Gutterson." 

DEATH OF PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Since our last Conference we have suffered the sorrow of part- 
ing with one of the Presidency of the Church, President Anthon H. 
Lund, than whom, from the day of his baptism as a boy in Scandi- 
navia, to the day of his death, no more faithful, diligent, energetic, 
painstaking, conscientious and intelligent worker have I known in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Lund was a 
man beloved by all. I never heard one soul in my life say anything 
but good of the late President Anthon H. Lund. His ability and ca- 
pacity were known to all the General Authorities as that of a great 
and noble and a true man, a Latter-day Saint to the very core. We 
mourn his loss. But in the providences of the Lord we feel that he 
will raise up others to assist in the rolling on of this great work. We 
had here a most wonderful audience at his funeral, the house being 
crowded to overflowing, thus showing the love and confidence and 
the respect of the people for President Lund. 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

CHANGES IN THE FIRST PRESIDENCY. 

I believe that in the promotion of Brother Penrose to be First 
Counselor in the First Presidency after he has labored from the time 
that he was a boy, nineteen years of age, for ten long years in his native 
land, proclaiming the gospel, and returned to that land to fulfil three 
more missions, a total of over twenty years of missionary work, and 
then labored here at home constantly with pen and tongue to pro- 
claim the gospel ; after his having accomplished all this, I feel sure that 
the Latter-day Saints rejoice in the promotion of this aged man, now 
in his ninetieth year, to be the First Counselor in the Presidency of 
the Church. 

I believe that the Latter-day Saints generally have approved in 
their hearts of the selection of Anthony W. Ivins to be my Second 
Counselor, to become a member of the Presidency of the Church. 
We have not yet presented these names but they will be presented 
before the Conference adjourns. 

CHOICE OF A NEW APOSTLE. 

I am convinced in my own heart that if President Anthon H. 
Lund had had the privilege of nominating a man to fill the vacancy 
caused in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, through his death, and 
through the promotion of Brother Ivins, that he would have named 
Brother John A. Widtsoe. The gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has 
gathered from the British Isles and from the Scandinavian countries 
many thousands upon thousands of honest, energetic, faithful, loyal, 
true Latter-day Saints. Scandinavia, second only to the British Isles, 
has furnished great numbers of converts to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. I believe that the Saints generally approve of 
those who have been called to these positions. I am; convinced beyond 
a shadow of a doubt that the Presidency and the Apostles, under the 
inspiration of the Lord, nominated the proper man to fill the vacancy 
in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and T have absolutely no doubt 
but what the Latter-day Saints will sanction our having set apart and 
ordained to the Apostleship Brother John A. Widtsoe. 

HEARTY RESPONSE TO INSTRUCTIONS AT LAST CONFERENCE. 

I rejoice in what I believe has been a response to the speeches 
made here six months ago. The keynote of our Conference at that time 
was to obey the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, to have in 
our hearts a love of God, a love of our fellows, to have in our hearts 
the spirit of forgiveness and of long-suffering, to have in our hearts a 
desire to do those things that would be pleasing and acceptable to our 
heaveniy Father ; and I feel grateful that, during the past six months, 
there has been a spiritual! growth. I believe that there has been a bet- 
ter feeling, that some of the animosities that were existing six months 
ago, because of political differences, have disappeared, now that men 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

have had time, figuratively speaking, to "cool off." I would rejoice 
beyond all the power which God has given me to express my feelings, 
if the Latter-day Saints could express their opinions in times of pol- 
itical campaigns without animosity, without vindictiveness, that they 
could simply proclaim those principles in which they believe, without 
indulging in personalities. 

CHANGE OF SENTIMENT FAVORING THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

I think that we as a people have very great cause to rejoice in 
the era of good will and fellowship that is existing today for us as 
a people, among those not of our faith, in comparison with the con- 
ditions that existed some years ago. I do not know of any single thing 
that has happened in my experience, during the long time that I have 
been one of the General Authorities of the Church, that has impressed 
me more profoundly with the change of sentiment towards the lat- 
ter- day Saints than the reception that was accorded to mei December 
last when I went to Kansas City and delivered a speech upon the ac- 
complishments of "Mormonism." When I reflect upon the fact that 
in the leading hotel: in that wonderful and progressive city — (I don't 
know that all of the people here, in fact I feel sure that perhaps the 
majority of those here are not aware of the fact that although *that 
city is only one-half as large as St. Louis, its bank clearings are larger 
than those of St. Louis, that in some particular items they stand first, 
in commerce, among all the cities of the United States ; and I do not 
know whether you are aware of the fact that they have one paper there 
that is conceded to be one of the six leading newspapers of the United 
states, the Kansas City Star)- — I was permitted to stand up within ten 
miles of Independence, the place from which the Latter-day Saints 
were expelled, by an expulsion and exterminating order of the Gov- 
ernor of the State, Governor Boggs, and to proclaim the accomplish- 
ments of the Latter-day Saints ; to relate the prophecies of Joseph 
Smith, to give to those men that were there assembled — over three 
hundred of the leading influential business men of the city — the testi- 
mony of Josiah Quincy regarding the Prophet Joseph Smith ; to re- 
peat to them the great Pioneer hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints ;" to re- 
late the hardships, the drivings and the persecutions of the Latter-day 
Saints and to have that body of representative men receive that ad- 
dress with approval, applaud it in many places, and many of them 
come to me after the meeting and shake hands and congratulate me 
upon the address; and to have some of the members of the Board of 
Directors of that great club — the Knife arid Fork Club of Kansas City 
— (which I have been informed is the second greatest dinner club in 
the United States, the Gridiron of Washington standing first) to have 
them say that they hoped for a return date so that they could hear 
more of our people; and then stop to reflect upon the fact that the 
Prophet and his followers, in the early days, were expelled from 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Missouri ; that many of them were murdered ; that all kinds of crimes 
were committed upon the people ; that their property was confiscated ; 
that we have never received anything for our property that belonged 
to us in that section, that today some o fthe valuable country that we 
traveled over there is the very property that our people owned, (for 
when you follow up many abstracts of valuable property you will find 
that the title centers in the bishop of the "Mormon" Church, and only 
because of lapse of time have people secured a proper title to these 
lands, and not because it was ever paid for) — I say to stop and reflect 
that the drivings and the persecutions of the Latter-day Saints, of 
which no tongue can tell and no pen can paint th.e conditions ; and 
then to realize that there is a feeling in that community now, among 
the people residing in the very place, so to speak, from which Presi- 
dent Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the living God, arid others were 
driven out; to be invited to go there and be asked to talk of the ac- 
complishments of "Mormonism," and to have that talk received, with 
open arms, shows the most wonderful change of sentiment. 

A short time ago the editor and publisher of the Coast Banker a 
paper that has a circulation all over the Twelfth Federal Reserve bank- 
ing district, asked me to write ah article on the accomplishments of our 
people. I did not have time to write the article, but I sent him my 
speech delivered before the Knife and Fork Club, and told him if that 
would fill the bill, I would be very glad indeed to have him publish it. 
Of course, I realized it was a very long speech, because I talked pretty 
rapidly and I talked for fifty-seven minutes, but he published all that 
I said. He published, besides, an introduction of such a character that 
I am very proud of it. I thanked him kindly, when I met him, for this 
introduction to my speech. 

Now, I pray the Lord to bless the Latter-day Saints. I pray the 
Lord that we may remember that same keynote that was given here 
six months ago — keep the commandments of the Lord. Why, you 
know, if we can just remember those first two great things, to love the 
Lord our God with all our hearts, with all our might, with all our 
mind, with all our strength, and to love our neighbor as ourselves, we 
are sure to walk in that straight and narrow path that shall lead us to 
life eternal. God bless you one and all, and all Israel, and all the 
honest, the world over, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

The Choir sang, "The Lord's Prayer," music by B. Cecil Gates. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I feel grateful to the Lord for the inspiration of his Spirit to so 
many of our people in the writing of the beautiful music that we have 
for our hymns, and for selections such as this that we have just listened 
to. May God bless our composers and our poets who have given us 
such inspired words and such inspiring, sweet music. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

It is a great pleasure to me to behold this vast congregation, com- 
posed chiefly of Latter-day Saints, gathered from different portions 
of the Church, also to listen to the remarks that have been made by our 
President. I was in hopes that he would have continued his remarks 
and taken up the time of our first session of this Conference, for sev- 
eral reasons. One of them is that I was doubtful, this morning, when 
I arose from my bed, whether I would be able to get here. I expe- 
rienced a violent vertigo, attack of swimming of the head. In these 
troublous times and in the great and swift changes that are taking place, 
there is enough to turn anybody's head, bigger heads than mine a great 
deal. But I have been able, since coming into this congregation, to 
compose myself and to listen to the inspired utterances of our President, 
and they have had a splendid effect upon me, physically as well as men- 
tally and spiritually. 

REJOICES IN CHANGES OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF THE SAINTS. 

I rejoice in these changes which he has spoken of, that have taken 
place among the people who are not of our faith. So many are now 
beginning to understand a little about "Mormonism," that it does not 
consist of one peculiarity which has been proclaimed throughout the 
world as our chief tenet. They are beginning to understand that the 
Latter-day Saints, the "Mormons," are a practical people, that they have 
a practical faith, and that they da things, and the knowledge of this is 
coming to the nations of the earth more rapidly than I ever expected it 
to come. I always had faith, from the time that I was a boy and joined 
the Church — the only one of my family who did so, that "Mormonism," 
as it is called, would prevail, that the kingdom of God, which it was and 
is to me, would overcome all things, and that the name of the true and 
the living God would be brought before the world ultimately for their 
adoration and their obedience. I never had a doubt about the triumph 
of this great organization, established by the Almighty, by the personal 
action of the Father and the Son and', the Holy Ghost; and today I re- 
joice in my soul to see the evidence of the progress of this work, here 
on these tabernacle grounds, where people have' assembled at our first 
session in such numbers that the Assembly Hall has to be used for an 
overflow meeting and the grounds themselves for another, at the be- 
ginning of our Conference. Thank the Lord, praises and blessings be 
to his Holy Name ! 

GOD OUR ETERNALj, FATHER AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST, 

The beautiful music we have just listened to called "The Lord's 
Prayer," brings before our attention that prayer which Jesus uttered; 
not that people were always to repeat it, although it is a mighty good 



10 GENERAL CONEERENCE. 

thing that so many people do so, even if they do not realize what it 
means. Ever since I was a little boy, I have heard that prayer re- 
peated in the churches in the world, before I ever knew anything of 
this work. It begins with a truth that all people ought to understand, 
and that is that God is our Father, that he dwells in heaven ; that he 
is not and cannot be personally omnipresent, as is taught in the heathen 
and so-called Christian churches of the world; that he is a divine 
being, a personage, a perfect and perfected man so to speak. We do 
not say that God is a man ; he is a perfected man ; he is exalted above 
all mankind, and he is our Father. He begat us in our original being, 
as his sons and daughters, verily and [literally and truly. Jesus Christ 
who uttered that prayer is his Son just as we are, in the spirit, only he 
was the first-born. There is a truth connected with that principle which 
we should all understand, for Jesus Christ himself has declared it. He 
says to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints : "I also was 
in the beginning with the Father, and am the first-born. Ye also 1 were 
in the beginning with the Father, that which is spirit." That part of 
mankind which is spirit was in the eternal world with the Father, before 
this world began, as we read in the first and second chapters of the 
Epistle to the Hebrews, which I commend to your attention, my brethren 
and sisters. We learn a little ;of this fact : 

"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past 
unto the fathers by the prophets, 

"Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath 
appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 

"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his 
peison, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had 
by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on 
high." 

He was the firstborn in this great family of the Almighty, the 
Creator of the worlds, and they were made by him, through and by 
Jesus Christ, his Son. Some of our brethren get the idea that he could 
not have been the creator of this world, as is declared in the latter-day 
revelations, that he was with the Father in this work, and that "all 
things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that 
was made," as we read in the opening chapter of the writings of John 
his beloved disciple and apostle. 

JESUS CHRIST THE ONLY BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER IN THE FLESH. 

We should understand this, that Jesus the Christ came into the 
world, in the meridian of time, to be the Only Begotten Son of God 
in the flesh. That is a doctrine established in this Church, and we have 
received it by revelation, so we can put aside any doubts or speculations 
or contentions in regard to it. That was when he came and taber- 
nacled, being in the image of his Father, the "express" image of his 
Father before he came into the world; and with power, as the heir 
of all things, God honored him and loved him, and he knew the faith- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 11 

fulness in all the work entrusted to him, and knew beforehand what he 
would do when he came on the earth to be the Redeemer of mankind. 
This is a subject that I do not want to dwell upon now, because I do 
not want to take up too much time, but it is a most important thing in 
the progress and development of the purposes of the Almighty. Jesus, 
as we call him, the Nazarene, the son of Mary, of the offspring of David 
— therefore the Son of man — was the Son of God, who is the Father of 
his spirit. So, in the beginning he was with God and was the firstborn 
of this great family, and on the earth he was the Only Begotten of 
the Father in the flesh. He lived and died as a Son of God in all 
things, and was raised from the dead and appeared to his disciples. In 
these last days he appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in his boy- 
hood, and has manifested himself personally several times, on several 
occasions, and he lives as the Son of God and our eldest brother in the 
spirit. The declaration of the doctrines of the Church in that remark- 
able condensation of principles which are called The Latter-day Saint's 
faith, begins with : "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his 
Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." 

THE HOLY GHOST, A PERSONAGE OF SPIRIT. 

In regard to the Holy Ghost, I want to say a few words this 
morning, since I have this grand opportunity, in reply to questions and 
letters that come to us, in the President's office, concerning this mat- 
ter. There seems, in spite of all the preachings and writings and ex- 
planations and expoundings of the Church, some confusion of mind 
in regard to this question about the Holy Ghost. "Is the Holy Ghost 
a personage?" So we are told in the 130th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, which contains several grand principles uttered by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. One is that God is a personage of tabernacle, 
the Son also, but the Holy Ghost is "a personage of spirit." This 
seems to create great wonderment among some of our people, because 
they confound the two terms "Holy Spirit" and "Holy Ghost" and 
think that there is a difference in their meaning. There is a difference 
in one sense of the word. We attach the words "the Holy Ghost" to 
the personage of spirit ; and we attach the name "Holy Spirit" to that 
universal means by which God and Jesus Christ are omnipresent. That 
divine, beginningless and boundless essence is called the Holy Spirit ; 
but the two terms really mean the same thing, so far as language is 
concerned. Brother Lund used to talk a good deal about the one Ger- 
man word which means the Holy Ghost as well as the Holy Spirit. The 
word means "Ghost" but it attaches to the influence which we call 
spirit, 'the spirit of man, and to the Holy Ghost the Comforter. Now 
let me say just two or three words on that point, to settle this question. 
In the fifth chapter of the first epistle of John, the beloved disciple, we 
read this : 

"There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the 
Word," — that is the name that John generally attached to the Savior — 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God." That is applied to the Son, the first born in the 
spirit and the only begotten in the flesh— "There are three that bear 
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and 
these three are one." Some people get very much confused in regard 
to that oneness or unity. There are three persons united as one God, 
one Deity, and it takes three of them to bear record in heaven; or 
rather, as the Prophet Joseph Smith explained very fully, that in all 
the presidencies that are divine, there are three. The Father, the Son 
and the Holy Ghost are three personags. Two are persons of taber- 
nacle. Now, questions arise as to whether the Holy Ghost will ever 
get a body. I do not know anything about that, because the Lord 
has not revealed it ; and if our brethren, while trying to be wise when 
they are not always so, would leave out of their preachings and their 
speculations that which they think may be in the future, but do not 
know, there will be a good deal of contention avoided. 

The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, as Jesus Christ was 
when he was Jehovah. He was Jehovah from the beginning of the 
world, according to the history we have in the Old Testament scrip- 
tures. He was a personage of spirit, and he came here to the earth that 
he might be exactly like his brethren and like his Father, and have a 
body made out of the lower elements of the universe. The elments 
of his body are eternal, and the elements of the spirit are eternal, 
without beginning; but there was a beginning to his body, when he 
was born of the virgin Mary, and God was his Father. His power 
overshadowed the virgin and, as she was told by the angel Gabriel, 
the offspring was the Son of God. Jesus Christ taught that doctrine 
to his apostles and made it very plain, I think, as it stands in the New 
Testament : "Our Father which art in Heaven" — not our Father who 
personally is throughout all space, without center and without circum- 
ference ; but his dwelling place is in heaven. The Lord says : "Heaven 
is my throne; the earth is my footstool;" and to the ancient Jews he 
cried: "Where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the 
place of my rest?" Our Father is a personage of tabernacle. He has 
a spiritual body, as well as a spiritual existence besides the physical 
body; the elements in him are joined inseparably. One of the reve- 
lations of God, the 88th Section in the Doctrine and Covenants, declares 
that "the elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably, con- 
nected, receiveth a fulness of joy; and when separated man cannot 
obtain a fulness of joy." 

The spirit of man is the offspring of God. It has affinity with 
spiritual things. In its spiritual being and nature it is above earthly 
things, but when tabernacled in a body, it becomes, to a great extent, 
subject to the laws that govern earthly things. When death comes as 
we call it, ( the separation of the spirit and the body, aa| we learn in the 
Scriptures, "the body without the spirit is dead," when that separation 
comes, then the spirit goes back to its former condition, to this extent, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 13 

that it is without the natural body until the resurrection. But the 
necessity for the resurrection is shown, very plainly, when we under- 
stand that only by these affinities can we obtain a fulness of joy. That 
which is spirit in our nautre has affinity with things that are above. 
The natural body has affinity with the things that are grosser or be- 
neath. But when the two, spirit and element, are inseparably con- 
nected — quickened by the Holy Spirit — and I mean by that the spirit 
which is called the spirit of life and light, then perfection can come to 
the individual, and without that union there cannot be obtained a 
fulness of joy. ' 

Now the pattern of it all is in the life and service and devotion and 
death of Jesus our Redeemer, and his resurrection from the dead, his 
return into the presence of God, where he sits with him on the ever- 
lasting throne. But about the Holy Ghost, what about that ? Why, he 
is a personage of spirit, an individual, a being, and he bears witness 
of the Father and of the Son and makes them plain to man. He is called 
by the Savior, the "Comforter." If you read the writings of John, the 
15th, 16th and 17th chapters, there you will see that he is called the 
Comforter. He is a personage. "When he, the Spirit of truth, is 
come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, he will teach you 
all things and he will show you things to come." John calls him "He" 
and "Him." He is a person. "If I go not away," said Jesus to his 
disciples, "the Comforter will not come, but if I go away, I will send 
him to you, and he shall bear witness of me and of the Father ;" for that 
is his office and calling. The understanding we have is that the 
Holy Ghost, as a personage, came on the day of Pentecost, and that 
he was manifested in the sign of the cloven tongues, as he was to 
John the Baptist by the sign of the dove, when the Savior was bap- 
tized in the river Jordan. Now then, understand that the personage 
spoken of there, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, is an individual, the 
third person in the trinity, and it takes the Father and the Word and 
the Holy Ghost to make a complete record in the heavens ; but the 
apostle John goes on to say, "there are three that bear witness, on the 
earth — the spirit, and the water, and the blood, and these three agree 
in one. Now as to the oneness I was just touching upon, it is clearly 
explained* in the prayer of the Savior, offered to the Father before he 
went to the garden of Gethsemane. He prayed for his apostles : 

I pray "for them * * * which thou has given me ; for they 
are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine ; and I am glori- 
fied in them. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which 
shall believe on me through their word ; that they all be one ; as thou, 
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us ; that 
the world may believe that thou hast sent me; and the glory which 
thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we 
are one." (John 17:9, 20, 23.) 

There is the oneness of Deity, the three in one; not as some 
preachers try to expound it, in the doctrines of the outside world, in 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the Article of Faith that they have, making them one immaterial spirit 
— no body, no real personage, no substance. On the contrary, they 
are three individuals, one in spirit, one in mind, one in intelligence, 
united in all things that they do, and it takes the Father, and the Son, 
and the Holy Ghost, to make the perfect Trinity in one, three persons 
and one God or Deity, one Godhead. 

THE HOLY GHOST BESTOWED IN CONFIRMATION. 

Now about the Holy Ghost bestowed in confirmation.^ It is re- 
quired of people who are baptized in water, to be baptized with "the 
Holy Ghost and with fire." Of course, the word "fire" does not mean 
a literal blaze to burm you up ; it is a divine fire, and all people know, 
who have been baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost, bearing witness 
of the Father and they Son, (and in these times, to the; divine mission 
of the Latter-day Prophet, Joseph Smith) that this Spirit is in the 
Church, and each individual member receives it as a gift. The Holy Spirit 
or Holy Ghost if you please, is "the true light that enlighteneth every 
man that comes into the world." So John teaches in that fine treatise that 
he wrote, called the Gospel of St. John. Now then, the light that is in the 
stars, that light that shines dimly in these lamps here this morning — 
what is it? Why, it is one manifestation of that divine essence called 
the Holy Spirit, and it permeates all things, not only on this globe, but 
in all the worlds that have been made. For we read in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, take the 29th Section and read it carefully, that God 
created all things by that Spirit, firstly spiritual and afterwards that 
which is temporal. That Holy Spirit, so we read in the 88th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, "is in all things, and through all things, 
and round about all things, and is the law by which all things are gov- 
erned. It is the light of Christ, and it is in the sun, and the moon and 
the stars, and the earth on which ye stand." It permeates all things 
throughout the vast domain of space, which has no bounds. It is the 
spirit that gives life, it is the spirit that gives light ; and when we came 
into' the* world and breathed the breath of life we became "living 
souls." 

There is no time now to talk about this creation, as we read of 
it in the book of Genesis. However, when man was formed out of the 
dust, and afterwards by eating the products of the earth and becoming 
earthly thereby, when he came into his being on the earth, he breath- 
ed the breath of life, and "man became a living soul,"thereby. So we, 
you and the rest of us, when we were born into this world, when we 
came to the condition that we could breathe the breath of life and be 
quickened by it in our mortal being, we were living souls ; and when we 
are resurrected from the dead we will still be living souls, but in a more 
perfect state. If we are worthy of the celestial glory we shall be 
quickened thereby when we are raised. As Paul puts it, "the body is 
sown in dishonor, it is raised in power; it is sown in weakness, it is 
raised in strength; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual 



■PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 15 

body." So, when we are raised from the dead, the body that is sown 
in the grave, in weakness, is raised in power, glorified like the glorious 
body of the Son of God. These are simple! things taught in the Scrip- 
tures, and when we go beyond them and make theories of our own, we 
get into the dark. 

The Holy Ghost, spoken of in the 88th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants is in all things, round about all things, throughout the im- 
mensity of space. What is it? Why it is a spiritual essence which 
gives life and light to all things, to animals and vegetables as well as 
to human beings ; but that is not the Comforter that Jesus said he would 
send, because it was here already, and is the light that enlighteneth 
every person that comes into the world. It is the essence of ordinary 
life; it is the very essence of life in the fulness of its manifestations 
around the personality of God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son ; in 
heaven, where they dwell. Therein is the glory of God. 

In its smaller or lesser manifestations, it is the same Spirit but 
not to the same degree. When we are born/ by water baptism into the 
Church, born of God, then we are baptized with fire and with the Holy 
Ghost, we have an additional manifestation of light and power in that 
Holy Spirit which is given to us in the confirmation — '"Receive ye the 
Holy Ghost" — as a gift from God, as a light to your feet, a lamp to 
your path, as a perpetual witness, an additional gift of light! and truth. 
Don't I know in my own being that I received that gift? I certainlv 
do, a swell as I know that I see things naturally by those manifestations 
of light that come from the sun and the moon and the stars and the 
lamps that we light, and the electric light that we bring forth by touch- 
ing the button. We do not create that light, we do not bring it into being, 
we only bring it into action. It is governed by law, and when the laws 
are fully understood and we live by them, and we are quickened by 
that power to the full, in body and in spirit, we will be like our Father 
and like Jesus Christ his beloved Son : "Beloved," says the Apostle John, 
"now are we the Sons of God. It doth not yet appear what we shall 
be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall 
see him as he is, and every man that has this hope purifieth himself 
even as he is pure." 

By keeping the commandments of God, as we were exhorted to do 
six month ago, and today also, by keeping the commandments of God 
and walking in his ways, that spirit is developed in us. Its light is 
clearer and plainer and it shines out and reveals the things of God. "No 
man knoweth the things of man but the spirit of man that is in him, 
and no man knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God, and the 
Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God." That is good 
plain scripture. 

Now my brethren and sisters do not get into confusion about this 
matter. The Holy Ghost is an individual, is a personage of spirit, one 
of the great Three that the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke so plainly 
about so many times just before his death. 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PERTAINING TO THE STATEMENT IN THE LECTURES ON FAITH. 

There is one little point in regard to that which I will mention : In 
the book of Doctrine and Covenants we have a number of lectures in- 
serted in the first part ; which are not revelations. There are seven lec- 
tures, and in the fifth lecture, particularly, we are told that there are 
two personages in heaven, the Father and the Son, and that the holy 
spirit is the mind of God. That is true, so far as it goes. But the reve- 
lation through the Prophet Joseph Smith as to the personality of the 
Holy Ghost came many years after ; it was given in 1843. In that reve- 
lation we are clearly instructed concerning the third personage in the 
Trinity. Now, as far as Sidney Rigdon, and some others who delivered 
those lectures, went, they spoke the truth. There are two persons in 
the heavens, the Father and the Son, but the Holy Spirit is passed by 
almost, as the "mind of God." It is true that the Holy Spirit conveys 
the mind of God; that is, I am speaking now of this universal spirit 
which is the life and the light of all things, which is in.and through and 
round about*- all things, and God says he made the world by the power 
of that spirit. That is his agent; but the personage, the Comforter, 
which Jesus Christ said he would send when he went away, that was a 
personage of the Trinity. He promised to send this Comforter to re- 
veal the things of the Father and to bear witness of the Father and the 
Son. 

When Joseph the Prophet saw the Father and the Son in the grove 
where he was praying, the Holy Spirit made them manifest. When 
he commenced to pray, or tried to pray, he could not say anything. 
He was seized upon by an opposing power which seemed to almost 
overcome him, but he struggled against it and continued to pray, un- 
til a light came, a pillar of light, the manifestation and presence of the 
Holy Spirit, and by the power of that Spirit, which quickened his 
spiritual vision, he saw two personages in that cloud of glory, and they 
conversed with him, or rathen one did. The Father does not converse 
much with mankind individually. He said : "This is my beloved Son, 
hear him ;" and he is the person we want to hear and to obey as rep- 
resenting the Father. As we read in the Book of Mormon he is, in 
some respects, both the Father and the Son. He represents the Father 
to the full. We are in the image of God, but the Christ, the great Je- 
hovah, is the express image of the Father's person, God manifest in the 
flesh, and he has gone into his glory. We will follow him to that 
glory if we will keep his commandments. He is the resurrection and 
the life. God has entrusted that to him, given him that power and made 
him heir of all things, in the heavens and in the earth. "All power 
is given to me, in heaven and upon the earth. Tarry ye at Jerusalem, 
until ye are endowed with power from on high." That is what he 
told his apostles. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 17 

THE LIGHT OF GOD MANIFESTS THE THINGS OF GOD. 

I hope, in what I have said on this subject, I have made this matter 
clear. All I want to do when I get up to talk before my breth- 
ren and sisters, is to make the things that are clear in my own mind, 
clear also to them, if I can. It is. the light 'of the Lord that manifests 
the things of God, and if we live in that light and walk in its rays we 
will keep the commandments of God. That is the tendency of it. In 
the operations of natural light, displayed by the spectrum, there are 
seven different colors or rays, as I remember being taught, when I was 
a boy at school — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet ; 
they are all one in a pencil of light, and that is a manifestation of the 
Spirit of God. In that there are, as in the higher revealings, various 
operations, as the apostle teaches in the twelfth chapter of First Corin- 
thians : 

"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another 
knowledge by the same Spirit; 

"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healings 
by the same Spirit; 

"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another 
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the in- 
terpretation of tongues; 

"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to 
every man severally as he will." 

So, my brethren, if we receive that gift, when hands are laid 
upon us, after we have been baptized into the Church and it is said unto 
us: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," that gift is sealed upon us. The 
gift is ours whether we act upon it or receive it or not, the gift is given 
to us by the Holy Ghost, which explains and manifests and enlightens 
our souls in regard to these things that are divine. It searches all things, 
yea, even the deep things of God. I know it in my own being and have 
known it ever since I was baptized into the Church. That gift was 
sealed upon me, and in all my labors and duties, spoken of by the 
President this morning, it has only been by the power of the Holy Ghost, 
the Spirit of the living God, the light of the Almighty, through Jesus 
Christ his Son, that I have been able to bring people to an understanding 
of and obediencel to the truth, and to conduct affairs with wisdom and 
in the light that I have received from God. 

A TESTIMONY. 

I know that God lives, I know that he is my Father, I know he has 
guided me on land and sea, that he has been with me in all my travelings 
at home and abroad, and that his Spirit is with me today. Thanks and 
praise be to his holy name. All I care for, of position' or office in this 
Church, is to build up the work of the Father through Jesus Christ 
his Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost. Truly we believe in God, 
the Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost; and 
to God the Father, to Jesus Christ his Son, and the Holy Ghost, be 
honor, praise, glory, and dominon forever, Amen. 



13 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Thanks be to God," by Mendelssohn. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I do not remember, my brethren and sisters, a period in my 
life's experience in the Church when I felt my dependence 1 upon 
the Lord to a degree greater than I do this morning. Should I fol- 
low my own inclinations, I would not attempt to make remarks at all, 
but to gam wisdom and knowledge and understanding by listening to 
the remarks of my brethren and communing with the Spirit of the 
Lord which is here this morning. I feel the necessity of wisdom, of 
sound judgment, of the help of the Lord in expounding the scrip- 
tures, and teaching the Latter-day Saints, and in discharging the 
responsibility which has come to me,, as I have never felt it before. 

THE CHURCH AFTER NEARLY ONE. HUNDRED YEARS. 

We are here to review the condition of the Church, after nearly 
an hundred years of its existence. We .'are here that we may deter- 
mine whether or not progress is being made, to hear the scripture ex- 
pounded, and the order of the)Church explained, that we may deter- 
mine whether or not in the administration of its affairs, we are ad- 
hering closely to the word of the tLord. The Lord has declared to 
us that all scripture is given by inspiration from God, that it is of great 
value to us as a means of proper exhortation, a means of reproof 
and of correction where correction may be necessary, and he has 
reminded us that it must always be expounded and explained in a 
spirit of righteousness. The Lord has admonished us to search the 
scripture, because in it|we think we have everlasting life, and that it 
is the scripture which testifies of him. I have beeni thinking, my 
brethren and sisters, while listening to the remarks made, that it 
was through obedience to this latter admonition of the Lord, that 
Joseph Smith found the key which opened this gospel dispensation. 
He searched the scriptures and in them (found the path which leads 
to everlasting life, to all of those who care to enter in through faith in 
God our Father, and in Jesus Christ, his Son. 

OPENING OF THE LAST DISPENSATION. 

At the time that Joseph Smith went to the written words for 
light, the" scripture which 'I have quoted was understood to apply, and 
he undoubtedly so understood it, to the Bible, this book which I hold 
in my hand. It was the only book which was accepted by the world 
as containing the fundamentals of Christianity, and of the hand-deal- 
ings of the Father, as they applied to his children! Who were here upon 
earth. Through the prayer which he offered, and to which reference 
has been made by President Penrose, the faith which he exercised in 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 19 

obedience to this admonition of the Lord, he received that first 
glorious manifestation, -when the Father and the Son appeared to 
him, now more than a hundred years ago, at which time he was not 
>|et fifteen years of age. This glorious manifestation, with the great 
importance which attaches to it, carried with it no authority to act 
in the name of /the Lord, neither in the opening of this gospel dis- 
pensation, the organization of the Church, nor in the administration 
in the ordinances thereof. As time passed and the 'boy gradually ap- 
proached manhood, he waited and, undoubtedly, wondered when the 
time would come for the accomplishment of the .greater work which 
had been outlined in this first manifestation which came to him from 
the Lord. On the night of September 21, 1823, after he had engaged 
in prayer and retired for the night, Joseph Smith states that he ob- 
served that light began gradually to appear in his room, which in- 
creased in brilliancy until the room was lighter than at noon day, 
when a personage appeared at his bed side, who declared that he was 
a messenger sent from the presence of God and that his name was 
Moroni. He declared to Joseph Smith that the Lord had a great 
work for him to perform, a work which would make his namte known 
among all nations and people, that among some it would be held in' 
honor, among others it would be held in reproach. He declared many 
important things to Joseph Smith, but the (principal purpose of his 
visit appears to have been to announce to him that there was a book 
deposited, written upon gold plates, which contained the history of 
the ancient inhabitants of this continent, and the source from which 
they came, and that it contained the fulness of the everlasting gospel, 
as it was delivered to the ancient inhabitants of this continent by the 
Redeemer of the 'world, and that means had been provided by which 
the inscriptions upon the plates might be translated into the English 
language. Joseph Smith visited the locality and readily recognized the 
place where the plates were deposited but was not permitied to take 
possession of them until four years later, at which time he was in his 
twenty-second year, when the plates were entrusted to his care by 
the same messenger who had first appeared to him. The work of 
translation was commenced and continued until completed, when 
the plates were returned to the messenger from whom he had received 
them, and Joseph Smith proceeded to publish their contents to the 
world in the form known as the Book of Mormon. 

\ THE BOOK OF MORMON. 

The first .edition of the Book of Mormon was issued in the 3'ear 
1830, under the circumstances and in the style which tthe time justi- 
fied, a style which would not be considered appropriate at present. 
From time to time other editions were issued, the arrangement 
slightly changed to make the book more appropriate, with chap- 
ters, index, footnotes and references added. The existing edition hav- 
ing become exhausted, it recently became necessary to issue a new 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

one and the suggestion was made that the style of the book, which 
still' adhered closely to the original, might be so changed that it would 
be better adapted to the use for which it was intended. A commit- 
tee was chosen from among the Council of Twelve, who carefully 
examined all editions, including the original, compared them care- 
fully, compared and checked the footnotes and references, and after 
making some slight changes in arrangement, tore have issued a new 
edition of the Book of Mormon, which I hold in my hand. The text 
remains as heretofore, but the book has been printed in double col- 
umns instead of single, a change which has resulted in a reduction in 
size of one hundred pages. The frontispiece remains as heretofore, 
but there has been added a brief synopsis of the contents of the book 
and the story of its origin! as related by Joseph Smith. The testimony 
of the witnesses remains as heretofore, and then follows the general 
text. The name and order of the books contained in the volume are 
also given ; chapter headings have been added ; the footnotes have 
been carefully compared and revised, where revision was necessary ; a 
pronouncing vocabulary has also been added : and a brief synopsis of 
chapters and a very greatly improved index which facilitates the study 
of the book. So we have brought out a new edition off this book which 
is of such great interest to the Church and its members, which we 
commend to you, my brethren and sisters, and to all other people for 
study. 

The Book of Mormon is the scripture of the American continent, 
preserved and brought forth by the power of the Lord, that his de- 
crees and purposes might be m&de known to the people who were to 
occupy this continent in this the dispensation of the fulness of times, 
the greatest dispensation which 'the world has ever known, for in it 
the Lord has said that he will consummate the work commenced in 
all other dispensations which have gfone before it. This book is the 
strongest corroborative evidence to the divinitv of the things contained 
in the Bible, that there is in the world. Tt is the strongest evidence 
of the divinity of the mission of the Redeemer of the world, that can 
be found, the Bible alone excepted. It contains the fulness of the 
everlasting gospel, in simplicity, easy to be understood, as it was 
taught to the people bv the Redeemer who established his Church 
among the Nephites. The code of morals which it teaches is beyond 
criticism, and if adhered to would redeem the world from the con- 
dition of moral degeneracy which now prevails. Tt teaches ethics 
in civil government which, if adhered to, would solve the perplexing 
nolitical questions which bewilder the world today, would remove the 
burdens of taxation from the backs of the struggling masses, and 
bring peace to the earth land fraternity among all mankind. Tt de- 
clares the redemption of the remnant of Tudah, the gathering- of the 
Ten Tribes, the restoration of scattered fsrael, and the fulfilment of 
the words of the prophets, both ancient and modern. While it stronglv 
denounces wickedness, it holds out great hope to the righteous, and

forgiveness and redemption to the repentant sinner; it unfolds the 
hitherto unknown past, and outlines to us events of the great future 
upon the threshold of which we stand. It has been before the world 
now for nearly one hundred years, during which period it has been 
subjected to the criticism of the learned and to the ridicule of the ig- 
norant. Not one line in it, not one doctrine which it teaches, not one 
truth which it sets forth, has been found to be out of harmony 
with the word of the Lord, as contained in the Bible, and as it has 
come to us through his inspired servants — a thing which can be said 
of no other book in the world. It should be an evidence of its truth, 
that with the closest scrutiny given it by this committee, in the light 
of the present, with he past behind us, not one single instance was 
found where it needed correction or amendment. 

So, my brethren and sisters, we commend the Book of Mormon 
to you and to the people, particularly of this country in which we live ; 
for this record is of special and transcendent importance to them. It 
declares in plainness that this is a land choice above all other lands, 
that it is dedicated to the service of the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, and it warns the people who occupy this land that whenever 
the time shall come that they are lifted up in pride above all other 
nations, when the time shall come that they are full of all manner of 
iniquity, of secret abominations, of whoredom, and priestcraft, and of 
all manner of wickedness, that at that time, except they repent and turn 
to the Lord, destruction shall come to them, as it has come to> other na- 
tions and people who have occupied the land before .them. We ask 
you, and particularly the people of the United States, to become fa- 
miliar with its contents. If we will do so and be governed by the doc- 
trines it teaches, we will be redeemed from the sins of the world, will 
understand the purposes of the Almighty as ! they apply to us, his pur- 
poses in the opening of this great gospel dispensation, the great ac- 
complishments of the past and the immediate future which is before 
us. It will redeem us from the sins of the world and enable us to live 
clean and spotless before the Lord, regardless of our surroundings. It 
is the word of the Lord brought forth through the instrumentality of 
Joseph Smith for the redemption of mankind, to go with the Bible as 
an additional evidence and witness to the people of the world that the 
decrees of the Father are unchangeable, that the words of the prophets 
will be fulfilled, that Israel will be gathered, and that redemption will 
come to the covenant people of the Lord. Search the Scriptures, my 
brethren and sisters, for in them we have eternal life, and they are 
they which testify of God and of the truth of these things which I 
have said to you. I pray that we may all become familiar with them, 
that we may all, through adherence to their tenets, attain to ever- 
lasting life, through Jesus Christ, Amen. 

.The closing prayer was offered by Elder Samuel W. Parkinson, 
President of the Franklin stake of Zion. 
Conference adjourned until 2 p. m.

CHANGES IN CONFERENCE PRESIDENTS 

iWe announced here at the last conference, the changes in the Aus- 
tralian, New Zealand and the Swiss and German missions. At that 
time Brother James N. Lambert who had been to New Zealand was 
with us and spoke to the congregation. Since then, Brother Arnold 
G. Miller, from the Australian mission, and Brother Angus J. Cannon 
from the Swiss and German mission have arrived home. We welcome 
them and tender them our sincere thanks for the very splendid, long 
and arduous labors that they have performed in those missions. 

INCREASE IN PAYMENTS OF TITHING 

In reading a number of items this morning, I read what became of 
several millions of dollars of the funds of the Church during the last 
year, and lo and behold, I skipped the all-important item of tithing. 
The Saints have done remarkably well, during the past year, in the pay- 
ment of tithes, especially when we consider the hard times through which 
we are passing. I wish to commend' the bishops, and other officers of 
the Church, as well as the membership of the Church, in general, for the 
faithfulness exhibited by the Saints in payment of their tithes. I think 
that it is nothing less than wonderful in view of the great hardships 
financially, through which all sections of the country have been passing, 
during the year that is just closed, that there should be no falling off 
at all in the tithes of the Latter-day Saints. The tithes for the 
past year have been slightly in advance of those for the previous year, 
which was one of the largest years for the payment of tithes in the 
history of the Church.

AN EDITORIAL IN THE "COAST BANKER." 

Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, President of the California Mission, 
came up and suggested that I should waive my insurance modesty, and 
that I should read the introduction to my speech, as written by the 
editor of the Coast Banker; and I shall do so. One of my insurance 
friends in San Francisco, president of one of the greatest companies 
in the United States, remarking on the photo of myself that is printed' 
with the article, stated that he would pay a great deal if he could only 
have a picture taken of him that would flatter him as much as this pic- 
ture flatters me. 

(The editorial, which was here read by President Grant, and 
the speech in full may be found at the close of this record. — Clerk.) 

THE CANTATA "THE MARTYRS," BY EVAN STEPHANS 

The sacred cantata, "The Martyrs," by Evan Stephens, and a 
chorus of 400 will be presented in the Tabernacle, Monday evening, 
April 4. I read an editorial in The News, last night, and felt that 
Brother Stephens was entitled to have this splendid editorial read to 
you here today: 

"Among other events of the approaching Conference season claiming 
th: attention of both residents and visitors the rendition of Evan Stephens' 
sacred cantata, "The Martyrs," in the Tabernacle, on Monday evening next, 
is deserving of special notice. A year ago this gifted home composer fairly 
electrified a mammoth audience in the Tabernacle with "The Vision" — an 
appropriate precursor of the present woik; and those who- are in a position 
to speak with intelligence and authority on the question, affirm with en- 
thusiasm that 'The Martyrs' is in all respects the equal of, and in some 
respects is superior to, the earlier masterpiece. Certainly in the matter of 
attention to detail in presentation, Mr. Stephens has allowed nothing to be 
overlooked — a fact upon which those who know his artistic and indefatigable 
nature will need no assurance. He has in conspicuous degree the talent of 
infusing into his performers a measure of his own zeal, so that to the most 
exacting demands of practice and rehearsal they yield without demur. The 
result is that when at length the hour for the public performance arrives, 
all those who have been engaged upon it are prepared to give it a rendition 
as nearly faultless as is humanly possible. Apart from the fame of the 
soloists, the heavier choral work of the great chorus of four hundred voices 
should prove at once a mighty attraction and inspiration. In short, it is to 
be hoped, and it is the probability, that, vast as is the auditorium where the 
performance will be given, the demand for seats will be so great that not 
all can gain admission, for it promises to be in all respects a stupendous and 
memorable occasion." 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My dear brethren and sisters: We had a glorious meeting this 
morning, and now are gathered again in this building, a great 
assembly of Latter-day Saints, members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ, the only Church under the heavens that bears the name of 
the Savior. It is true that he is not here with us in person, but he is 
here by the power of his Spirit and his authority. His authority, is 
called the Priesthood, the holy Priesthood after the order of the Son 
of God, and this authority is held by the prophet, seer and revelacor 
and the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Not only does it rest upon him, but it is widely distributed through- 
out the Church, and rests in some degree upon every worthy man in 
the Church. 

WOMEN" AND THE PRjIESTHOOD. 

The Priesthood is not received, or held, or exercised in any 
degree, by the women of the Church ; but, nevertheless, the women 
of the Church enjoy the blessings of the Priesthood through their 
husbands. This emphasizes very strongly the importance of mar- 
riage. Every woman in the Church, of mature age, and worthiness, 
who is ambitious to attain to exaltation and glory hereafter should 
be married, should be sealed to a man for time and all eternity; and 
we trust that the young women of the Church as well as the young 
men of the Church realize the responsibility of this important 
ordinance. 

THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD. 

The Priesthood, my brethren and sisters, is complete in itself. 
Nevertheless, we know that there are two great divisions in it, namely 
the Melchizedek, or higher Priesthood, and the Aaronic, or lesser 
Priesthood, which lesser Priesthood is an appendage to the higher 
Priesthood. The Melchizedek Priesthood administers the gospel and 
holds the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the 
knowledge of God. Therefore, in its ordinances the power of God 
and of godliness is manifest, and without the ordinances and the 
holy Priesthood the power of godliness is not manifest among men. 
Therefore, wherever the holy Priesthood of God is not found in a 
Church, such a church cannot be the Church of Christ. 

Moses very well understood this great principle. He held the 
higher Priesthood. He was a great prophet of God and he sought 
diligently to sanctify the children of Israel, that they might behold 
the face of God. But it is said in the revelation that they hardened 
their hearts and could not endure his presence and therefore the 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 25 

Lord in his wrath — for his anger was kindled against them — swore 
that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, 
which rest is a fulness of the glory of God. In consequence of this, 
the holy Melchizedek Priesthood was taken from their midst. But the 
lesser Priesthood — the Priesthood that holds the keys of the ad- 
ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel — was continued in 
Israel down to the time of the Savior. We learn a great lesson from 
this incident, for we perceive that because of the hardness of their 
hearts and their unbelief and rebellion, at times, Moses and the holy 
Priesthood were taken away from the children of Israel. But it is 
not so with the Latter-day Saints, because you will find the authori- 
ty of the holy Priesthood, the high Priesthood as well as the lesser 
Priesthood, throughout all the stakes of Zion and in every ward. In 
this is shown the mercy and the loving kindness and generosity of 
our Father in heaven, because it is seen that God is no respecter of 
persons, and that the right to the Priesthood belongs to every faith- 
ful man in the Church — I think I may say it is his by right divine. 
So it is. 

Now, brethren and sisters, we say to all Israel, beware of hard- 
ness of heart, and the spirit of rebellion, and the sin of idolatry, for 
these sins are great evils in the sight of the Lord. He requires hum- 
ility of heart and diligence and faithfulness and submission to his 
authority. I think that there is nothing in the scriptures or in the 
revelations of God that emphasizes the greatness of the power of the 
holy Priesthood as the words which occur in Doctrine and Covenants, 
section 84, a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Latter- 
day Saints, give ear to these words and ponder them in your hearts, 
for the Lord said : 

"For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two Priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the 
' Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abra- 
ham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God; 

"And also all they who receive this Priesthood receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, receiveth my Father's' kingdom; 
therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to 
the Priesthood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive the Priesthood, receive this oath and 
covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved." 

But now, mark you, there is a proviso, and it is significant. It 
is highly important: 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and al- 
together turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world 
nor in the world to come." 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

This is the reservation, that is the proviso. Now if we shall at- 
tain to these great blessings we must be humble, faithful, consistent 
Latter-day Saints. 

SOME PERTINENT QUESTIONS TO THOSE WHO HOLD THE PRIESTHOOD. 

Now, brethren and sisters — and I say sisters because, as I have 
said, the sisters participate in the blessings of the Priesthood through 
their husbands — do we appreciate the Priesthood of God, this divine 
authority? Do we honor it in our lives? Do we honor it in our file 
leaders ? Do we teach our boys at home the importance and value of 
the Priesthood? Are they receiving this instruction in the various 
organizations? Because, I take it that the Priesthood of God is about 
(the greatest gift unto man, for it represents divine authority. Let 
us give heed to this matter. Oh, I pray that the responsibility of it 
may rest down mightily upon the authorities in the stakes of Zion, 
and that they will see to it that proper and full instruction is given 
in respect to this matter. 

Now may the Lord bless you, the Lord bless our President, who 
has spoken so beautifully and so powerfully to us today, and Presi- 
dents Penrose and Ivins. We have had rich instructions already. 
Oh, if we could only fully receive it into our hearts, and carry it out 
in our lives, how blest we would be ! May the spirit of the Lord con- 
tinue to be upon this people and in the congregations of the Saints, 
and may it rest upon the authorities of the Church, and all the 
speakers at this Conference, is my prayer,! in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I have rejoiced with you, my brethren and sisters, in this general 
conference as far as it has progressed. I feel in my soul to endorse 
what has been said. I feel that the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and 
was with usi very richly in the opening session. T desire to contribute 
something, through the help of the Lord, that will be of profit to some 
of us, if we will listen and hear, and be doers of the word and not 
hearers only, deceiving ourselves. 

EVIDENCES OF THE FAITHFULNESS OF THE SAINTS. 

The key-word of our Conference, six months ago, was given us 
by President Grant, to keep the commandments of the Lord. If I un- 
derstand the key-word given to us in this Conference, it is to continue 
our faithfulness in keeping the commandments of the Lord. We have 
abundance of evidence of faithfulness on the part of the great major- 
ity of the Latter-day Saints. The very fact that, under existing finan- 
cal conditions, the tithing of the people has increased, during the past 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 27 

year, is an evidence of their faithfulness in keeping the commandments. 
The reports we have of the increased attendance at sacrament meet- 
ings and of stake conference meetings is an additional evidence of faith- 
fulness on the part of the people in keeping the commandments of the 
Lord ; also, the increased attendance and membership in the auxiliary 
associations of the Church, is an evidence of faithfulness on the part of 
the young as well as the older people of the Church. I have the utmost 
confidence in the Latter-day Saints including Zion's young people. I 
have the utmost confidence in the ultimate triumph of God's work in 
the earth. No power can stay the progress. Zion is to arise and shine 
and become the glory of the whole earth, and we can see her brightness 
already. Those who are not of us, and among us, and those of the 
world whose eyes have been turned toward us, are also mindful of this 
fact. A friendly feeling toward the Latter-day Saints and the doc- 
trines which we have for the world is growing up wherever the gospel 
is being preached. There are, of course, some exceptions. In our 
travels in the Stakes of Zion we have abundance of evidence of devo- 
tion on the part of leading men and women to their callings in this 
great work. I feel in my heart to commend them for their faithfulness 
and for their devotion and to pray God's choicest blessings to rest upon 
them, that they may be abundantly rewarded of him in time and in 
eternity for the sacrifices which they are making, of time and means, 
in the carrying on this great latter-day work. These matters of 
which I have been speaking, of which we know by records which are 
kept and reports which are made, indicate to me that the Latter-day 
Saints are making improvement in other ways, where we are unable 
to check them up so completely as on some of these matters, such as at- 
tendance at meetings and the payment of their tithes and offerings. 
The tithing is an index of the faithfulness of the individual. I am 
sure that the Lord manifests his pleasure to the individual who is mak- 
ing the required sacrifice for the onward progress of his work, and for 
the salvation of his children and such is the character and the work 
being done by the Latter-day Saints. 

CARING FOR THE FATHERLESS, AND KEEPING OURSELVES UNSPOTTED 
FROM THE WORLD. 

The Apostle James said: "Pure religion and undefiled before 
God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their 
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." 

We should not overlook this latter part of the definition. I believe 
that the Latter-day Saints are improving in that respect in _ keeping 
themselves unspotted from the sins of the world. We are visiting the 
widows and the fatherless, we are feeding the hungry ; we are clothing 
the naked ; we are visiting the sick and the afflicted ; and we are taking 
care of the stranger and feeding him the bread of life, as opportunity 
is afforded. I do believe, Latter-day Saints, that when we pay our 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

tithing in full, conscientiously before the Lord, and are generous in the 
giving of our offerings, that we are answering the requirement of the 
law, and there will be none to suffer. The widow and the orphan will 
be well taken care of in the Church, if we all attend to these particular 
duties in faithfulness ; and the Lord will reward us amply for our efforts 
and our sacrifices in this direction. I believe that the people today, the 
Latter-day Saints, answer the call to leave their homes and go into the 
nations of the earth to preach the gospel among strangers as readily 
as they ever havei done, notwithstanding the individual expense of the 
elders is almost double what it was a few years ago. This is another 
evidence of faithfulness which inspires confidence in the Latter-day 
Saints. It is the young people in the main — our sons and our daugh- 
ters, who are called to bear this responsibility and to make this sacri- 
fice. They are answering the calls in a generous and satisfactory man- 
ner and the Lord takes these weak men and women and with them 
threshes the nations, and the wisdom of the wise does perish before 
their humble, truthful testimonies. 

SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE SIN OF NEGLECT. 

This is the time, my brethren and sisters, for our planting, this 
period of our eternal progression, while we are here in mortal life. 
If in the season of the planting of our crop, the planting be neglected, 
there will be no time of reaping. I do hope that we will bear this 
thought in mind and make every preparation that is necessary while 
we are here and have the opportunity ; that when we go beyond we will 
find peace, we will be satisfied with that which we have to reap as a 
result of our life's work here. The Savior gave us a parable that is very 
impressive upon this point — at least to my mind. It re- 
fers to the rich man who dressed in fine apparel and 
fared sumptuous every day. The pear man lay at the ga|te of 
the rich man ; the dogs licked his sores, and he fain would have taken 
the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. After a time the poor 
man died, and the angels bore his spirit to the paradise of heaven. 
The rich man died also, and went to hell ; and in hell he lifted up his 
eyes in torment. Seeing Lazarus afar off and in Abraham's bosom he 
cried to Abraham : "Father Abraham, send Lazarus that he may dip 
his finger in water and touch my parched tongue, for I am in torment." 
You know the answer. That was impossible. Then the next request 
was to send Lazarus or somebody else from the dead, that they might 
go down to earth and visit his five brothers that they might be spe- 
cially warned that they might not come to his fate. But that was im- 
possible. The answer was : "They have Moses and the prophets. If 
they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither would they be per- 
suaded though one were sent from the dead." There are several im- 
portant lessons to be learned from this parable ; but the one I wish to 
bring to your attention is the serious consequence of the sin of neglect. 
There does not seem to have been any other charge made against this 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 29 

rich man than that he had the means to do with, the opportunity was 
laid before him, his responsibility he clearly saw, and ignored it. 

OUR DUTY TO FEED THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE BODY. 

Now it is a blessing to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked. That 
is a part of pure religion and undefiled ; but I have thought and I do 
feel, my brethren and sisters, that it is better to feed the soul of a man 
or woman than to feed the body, to minister unto their spiritual and 
eternal needs and welfare rather than to their physical. The body 
must perish soon anyway. There are those among us who are starving 
for the word of God. They are wandering from sea to sea, and from 
the north even unto the east, running to and fro, seeking the word of 
God and cannot find it. They do not hope to find it among the Latter- 
day Saints. They are blinded to the truth which we have received, but 
we know we have received the responsibility to preach it in all the 
world as a witness unto all nations before the end shall come. This is 
the food of which the world of mankind are so much in need today, 
and with which we are so bountifully blest. It is that kind of food 
that we can give to those who are in need, generously, and they become 
the happy recipients and are blest through it, and we will not be impov- 
erished. Indeed, as we undertake to minister unto the spiritual needs 
of men and women, our souls grow and enlarge, our love for our 
fellow men increases ; our love for our Father in heaven and our 
Savior increases ; our love and appreciation of the truth also increase, 
and we are even more blest than they. The very anticipation and desire 
to do good brings happiness and peace to our souls. On the other hand, 
if we, having the abundance of this spiritual food, and knowing those 
about us who are in a starving condition, if we fail to minister unto 
their needs we are likely to experience in the life beyond, a disappoint- 
ment corresponding with that of the rich man who neglected to min- 
ister unto the needs of his poor neighbor. As it is more blessed to feed 
the soul, so is it a greater neglect, a greater sin, and I believe will 
be attended by a greater penalty to neglect to feed the souls of men 
and women. 

NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BLESS BOTH THE LIVING AND THE DEAD. 

The work for our dead, brethren and sisters, we have not been 
organized in the past to do, as we have been organized, as a Church, 
to preach the gospel abroad. We have been left to our individual initia- 
tive largely, in this matter of searching for the genealogies of our an- 
cestors and going up to the temples of the Lord and doing the work 
for them. This responsibility rests heavily upon us, and some of us 
do not realize it. If we neglect our dead, when we go to the other 
side, they will reproach us, and that will be hell and torment. We 
may desire to come back to have another opportunity, but it will not be 
afforded us. Now is the time; this is our opportunity to bless man- 
kind, both the living and the dead, and to prepare an eternity beyond 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

that will be one of peace, contentment and all that our hearts can 
desire. 

In conclusion, let me recite you a few lines impressive of this 
principle. It is entitled "A Little Parable/' and reads like this : 

"I made the cross myself, whose weight was later laid on m.e, 
This thought is torture as I climb up life's steep Calvary. 
To think my own hands drove the nails! 

I sang a merry song, 
And chose the heaviest wood I had, 

To make it firm and strong. 

If I had guessed, 

If I had dreamed its weight was made for me, 

I would have made a lighter cross to bear up Calvary." 

May the Lord add his blessings, I pray in Jesus name, Amen. 
The Elite Male Quartet sang, "Jesus, I my cross have taken." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

You perhaps have noticed from the announcement in the paper, 
that Elder Whitney will go to Europe to preside over the European 
mission, succeeding Elder George Albert Smith ; so this will probably 
be the last time that we can hear from Brother Whitney for some 
months at least. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

For the past fifteen years I have been preaching the Gospel in 
the Stakes of Zion, and after living on "stakes" all that length of time, 
1 need, and it seems I am to have, a change of diet. If you wish to 
know how I feel about the call that has come to me, I will tell you : 
I rejoice in it. I am going with a glad heart and a cheerful counte- 
nance to do my duty — is I have done it here — on the other side of 
the world. 

EARLY MISSIONS AND APPOINTMENTS. 

This will not be my first mission as an Elder of the Church. My 
first mission of all was to the United States, from 1876 to 1878, I 
labored five or six months in Pennsylvania, and theh went to Ohio, 
my father's native State, where the Whitney family embraced the 
Gospel in early days. While I was in Ohio my mother wrote to me 
asking why I did not return. Said she : "AH the missionaries who 
went with you, or went at the same time that you! did, are back home. 
Why don't you come ?" I answered : "Because I have not been re-

leased ; and I shall stay here until I receive, without any solicitation 
on my part, an honorable release from the Presidency of the Church." 
Having been honorably released, I returned, and was made a 
Ward Bishop. 1 served in the Bishopric for nearly twenty-eight years, 
and in April 1906 was called into the position that I now occupy. Mean- 
while, from the autumn of 1881 until the summer of 1883, I filled a 
mission in Great Britain, laboring most of the time as assistant editor 
of the Millennial Star. 

NO TIME LIMIT. 

No time limit was placed upon my missions. I never felt that 
1 ought to ask for a release, or come home until the servants of the 
Lord presiding over me said : "It is enough ; you are at liberty to re- 
turn." 

An impression now prevails in the mission fields among some 
of our young elders, that they were called to labor for a set time ; and 
after that time has expired — say eighteen or twenty months — ihey 
seem to think they are entitled to a release, and some even ask for 
it. This is contrary to my traditions and training. I have never 
called myself upon a mission ; have never appointed myself to an of- 
fice ; and have never thought it my privilege to resign, or ask to be 
relieved of any responsibility in connection with the Lord's work. I 
have responded to every call miade upon me thus far, and I expect 
to do so as long as I live. 

LABORS OF THE TWELVE. 

In times past some of our brethren and sisters have worried over 
the question of the labors of the Twelve apostles. They have hinted 
that we ought to be out preaching the gospel in the world — evidently 
overlooking the fact that the Twelve travel under the direction of 
the First Presidency; that they do not call themselves upon missions, 
but have to wait until they are sent. I have never known one of the 
apostles to refuse or even hesitate to respond to ahy call that came to 
him from rightful authority. Years ago I said from this stand, quot- 
ing a little verse that we sometimes sing: 

"I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, 

On mountain on land or on sea; 
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord, 

I'll be what you want me to be." 

And I paraphrased it thus : 

I'll go where you want me to g,o, dear Lord, 

I'll go whenever you say; 
But till I am sent I'm not going to go — 

I'll stay where you want me to stay. 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Now that I have been appointed to go, I am going ; and I promise 
President Grant and his counselors, and you my brethren and sisters, 
that I shall go with a free will and with joy in my heart, having no 
desire to be released at the expiration of any set time. I leave that 
with the Lord. I am going where he wants me to go, and will stay 
there as long as he wants me to stay. This is God's work, and I know 
it, and I am proud and happy to be engaged in it. 

alma's wish. 

I would like to read you a few paragraphs from the Book of Mor- 
mon. A Prophet named Alma, standing upon the American Continent 
seventy-six years before the birth of the Savior, uttered these wonder- 
ful words: 

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the 
earth, and cry repentance unto every people; 

"Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance, and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come 
unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of 
the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be con- 
tent with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it 
be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men according 
to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he 
that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good 
and evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he desireth 
good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than 
to perform the work to which I have been called? 

"Why should I desire that I was an angel, that I could speak unto all 
the ends of the earth? 

"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation 
and tongue, to teach his word; yea. in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that 
they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, 
according to that which is just and true. 

"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it: 
I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath com- 
manded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument 
in the hands of God, to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy." 

PROVIDENCE IS OVER ALL. 

Many beautiful lessons might be drawn from, this passage of 
scripture, but I have only time to dwell upon one. It tells me that 
Providence is over all, and that he holds the nations in the hollow of 
his hand; that he is using not only his covenant people, but other 
peoples as well, to consummate a work, stupendous, magnificent, and 
altogether too arduous for this little handful of Saints to accomplish 
by and of themselves. Alma seems to have thought, for the moment, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 33 

that man was doing God's work for him, instead of which it is God, 
who is doing his own work, and using men as his instruments. 
Nor is he limited in the choice of instruments to his own people. He 
sways the scepter over all nations, and they are all playing into his 
hands, knowingly or unknowingly. Alma knew this, but had mo- 
mentarily lost sight of it. 

"of their own nation and tongue." 

All down the ages men bearing the authority of the Holy Priest- 
hood — patriarchs, prophets, apostles and others, have officiated in 
the name of the Lord, doing the things that he required of them; 
and outside the pale of their activities other good and great men, not 
bearing the Priesthood, but possessing profundity of thought, great 
wisdom, and a desire to uplift their fellows, have been sent by the 
Almighty into many nations, to give therm, not the fulness of the 
Gospel, but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and 
wisely use. Such men as Confucius, the Chinese philosopher ; Zoroas- 
ter, the Persian sage ; Guatama or Buddha, of the Hindus ; Socrates 
and Plato, of the Greeks; these all had some of the light that is uni- 
versally diffused, and concerning which we have this day heard. They 
were servants of the Lord in a lesser sense, and were sent to those 
pagan or heathen nations to give them the measure of truth that a 
wise Providence had allotted to them. 

OTHER AUXILIARIES 

And not only teachers— not poets and philosophers alone; but 
inventors, discoverers, warriors, statesmen, rulers, et al. These also 
have been used from the beginning to help along the Lord's work — 
mighty auxiliaries in. the hands of an Almighty God, carrying out his 
purposes, consciously or unconsciously. 

"There's a divinity that shapes our ends, 
Rough hew them as we will." 

The God of Israel used Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to pun- 
ish his chosen people for their sins. Jeremiah the Prophet was sent 
with the word of the Lord to Zedekiah, king of Judah, commanding 
him to submit to the Lord's "servant" — this same Nebuchadnezzar. 
And because Zedekiah refused to obey, a terrible fate befell him; his 
kingdom was overthrown, his eyes were put out, and he and his 
people were carried away captive into Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar 
was a great king; he built the "Hanging Gardens," one of the seven 
wonders of the world ; but he arrogated to himself the glory for what 
God had done, and had to be humbled to the dust, and sent forth to 
eat grass like the ox, until "seven times" had passed over him, and 
he had learned the lesson "that the Most High ruleth in the king- 
dom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Babylon was overthrown by Cyrus the Persian, a great and good 
monarch, called by the Lord "his anointed," and named by prophecy 
more than a hundred years before he was born. Cyrus was instru- 
mental in restoring the captive Jews to their own icountry, that they 
might rebuild Jerusalem in time for the Savior's advent. 

When the. Medo-Persian empire 'became corrupt, it was over- 
thrown by Alexander the Great. Alexander conquered the world 
and "wept," it is said, "because there were no more worlds to con- 
quer." He died a drunkard, or from! a fever caused by excess of 
drink. But was that all he did? Dean Farrar says of him and of the 
great service he unwittingly rendered to the cause of Christ: 
"The immense field covered by the conquests of Alexander 
gave to the civilized world a unity of language, without which it 
would have been, humanly speaking, impossible for the earliest preach- 
ers to have made known the good tidings in every land which they 
traversed." "Wherever he went," says the historian McCabe, "he left 
the Greek language, . . .all powerful in drawing the nations of 
the old world into a closer and more intimate contact with each other. 
. . . At a later period the Hebrew Scriptures, translated into 
Greek, were made accessible to the .whole world, and the way was 
thus paved for the mission of Him of whom these Scriptures testify." 

This also from Farrar: "The rise of the Roman Empire created 
a political unity which reflected in every direction the doctrines of the 
new faith. The Gospel emanated from the capital of Judea; it was 
preached in the tongue of Athens ; it was diffused through the Empire 
of Rome ; the feet of its earliest missionaries traversed the solid 
structure of undeviating roads by which the Roman legionaries — 
'those massive hammers of the whole earth' — had made straight in the 
desert a highway for our God. Semite and Aryan had been uncon- 
scious instruments in the hands of God for the spread of a religion 
which, in its first beginnings, both alike detested and despised." 

AMERICA A NURSING MOTHER. 

Coming down to later times, we have but to open the Book of 
Mormon to see how the Spirit of the Lord rested upon a man among 
the Gentiles, impelling him across the great .waters to the Land of 
Zion, a land reserved by Providence for the triumph of truth and 
freedom in the last days — the place for the building of the New Jeru- 
salem and the beginning of the work of preparation that will have to 
be done before the Lord comes in his glory. Columbus was inspired 
to discover America for this purpose, though he knew it not. After 
him came the Pilgrim Fathers ; and then Washington, Jefferson, 
Franklin, Hamilton, and other Patriots of the Revolution, all moved 
upon by the same Spirit, to create the mighty fabric of this great 
Republic, a free nation, guaranteeing liberty to its citizens of every 
creed and of no creed, and raised up by the Almighty to play the 
part of a nursing mother to the restored Church of Christ. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY , 35 

True, the Latter-day Saints have been persecuted under the Stars 
and Stripes in various States of the Union; but we must not make 
the mistake of supposing that it was (because of the Flag, or of the 
Constitution, or of the genius of the American government, that these 
deplorable happenings took place. No ; it was not because, but in spite 
of them. Those persecutions were inflicted by lawless force, by mob 
violence, ever to be execrated and condemned by every true patriot. 
Let us credit our noble Nation with what it has done in the direction 
of filling its God-given mission. In no other land — in no other na- 
tion upon this land, would the Lord's people have been treated with 
the same degree of consideration. In no other country on earth would 
this work have been permitted to come forth. This nation was 
founded purposely, that the Church and Kingdom of God might be 
established and all nations bask in its light and share in its blessings. 

-truth's triumph inevitable. 

We must never allow ourselves to grow misanthropic or fearful 
concerning the outcome. The success of this work is assured. The 
triumph of Truth is inevitable. The clouds, may gather, the billows 
rage, the tempests burst in fury ; but the unerring Pilot is at the helm, 
and the Ship steered by Him, will weather every storm. 

"Truth forever on the scaffold, 

Wrong forever on the throne. 
Yet that scaffold sways the future, 

And behind the dim unknown 
Standeth God within the shadow, 

Keeping watch above his own." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters: I stand before you on this occasion 
with great timidity; partly because I ami unaccustomed to speaking 
in this vast auditorium and before so large a gathering of people, 
but chiefly because I sense the tremendous responsibility that rests 
upon all who, at these general conferences, are called upon to address 
the Saints. I pray for your support and your faith now and always. 

A TESTIMONY. 

Nevertheless, my brethren and sisters, I am glad at all times 
to have the privilege of bearing my testimony to the truthfulness 
of this work, this system of thought, of doctrine, of practice, whicl. 
men denominate "Mormonismi," but which we know to be God's- 
eternal,) unchanging and unchangeable plan of salvation for the 
human family. I know, my brethren and sisters, that this work is 
true. I know that it has come from God and that it leads men back 
to God along happy and joyous paths. This testimony has been 
fed and strengthened, throughout these two meetings, by hean'ng 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the testimonies of the Presidency and the Apostles who have spoken. 
I trust this testimony may always be mine. 

THE UNIFYING POWER OF THE GOSPEL. 

As 1 have looked over the congregations this morning and this 
afternoon, no thought has impressed me more than that here we 
have all classes and all manner of people, men and women of dif- 
ferent degrees of knowledge and of varying capacities; yet these 
people, unlike in their God-given gifts, are finding the satisfaction 
of their lives, after they have once accepted the gospel, in the doc- 
trines and the life within the Church. Whether of high or of low 
degree, rich or poor, learned or unlearned, of quick or of slow intel- 
ligence, from Scandinavia, Germany, England or America, these 
people, because of the gospel and through the gospel, see alike, 
apparently think alike, and very largely act alike. There is some- 
thing within this gospel that unifies all who accept it and who belong 
to it. This is not true alone of this generation and of this dispen- 
sation. It has /been so in all ages, in all generations and in all 
dispensations. The Patriarch Enoch, in his holy city, Abraham on 
the Plains of Mamre, Moses in the wilderness, Samuel in God's tem- 
ple, and all the other worthies of which history gives an account, 
gained strength and found the solace of their lives in the identical 
gospel to which we adhere and to which we give our allegiance. 

THE CHURCH MAKES NO APPEAL TO MYSTICISM. 

It has always impressed me that the universality of the appeal of 
"Mormonism" is especially remarkable in view of the fact that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not attempt to win 
support by specially devised appeals to the emotions of men, which 
is so frequently the case with other Churches. We have no elaborate 
system of ritual ; we have no mystical doctrines to lead men on by 
the appeal of the unknown ; we do not attempt to win converts by 
threatening a future hell. We are in all respects plain and simple 
in our worship ; in fact, in this Church, which believes that "the glory 
of God is intelligence," it is difficult to establish doctrines of mysticism 
and in that way win adherents to the cause; and in a Church which 
declares that there is a graded salvation, within the ultimate reach 
of every human being, if he cares to accept of it, there can be no 
deep-seated fear of the hereafter, especially when we have been told 
that the lowest glory of this graded salvation is entirely beyond the 
understanding and wildest fancy of 'man. 

TFIE TEST OF TRUTH IS SIMPLICITY. 

I am not so sure, my brethren and sisters, but that one of the 
strongest evidences of the truthfulness of "Mormonism" lies in the 
fact that it has such universal appeal to men and women of all capaci- 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE ' 37 

ties and of all degrees of knowledge. Truth is always simple; the 
test of truth is simplicity. That which is dimly understood, which 
confuses the mind of man, is likely to be .but partly true. The 
scientist in his laboratory applies this final test to his work. When, 
after many months or years of labor, he finds that the things he has 
discovered can be told simply and plainly to his fellow men, he is 
likely to say: "Now I have found the truth." Men and women of 
this Church have accepted the Gospel because they have learned to 
understand it, because it is clear, because it is simple, because it is not 
surrounded by confusion or dimness of any kind. 

To enlarge briefly upon this thought, the reason why those of 
great mental ability, great God-given powers, may find their full soul's 
satisfaction in the gospel, seems to me to be that the truth of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ is not in the form of chunks or bits of truth, isolated 
truths, but in the form of great general principles or laws — principles 
which encompass thousands and tens of thousands of single truths — 
principles of truth that interpret and illustrate all the phenomena that 
we find as we journey through) life. To know that the sun shines upon 
the earth, and in that way gives the earth energy, is an important and 
interesting fact, but it does not interpret the universe. The great law of 
gravitation, the law of the indestructibility of matter, and other such 
fundamental laws, however, do interpret not only the relationship of 
the sun to the earth, but innumerable of the varied ifacts of the 
universe. The basic principles of the gospel are of such comprehensive 
nature. They may be unyielding, they may never be departed from, 
but they point with certainty the road that men may travel to dis- 
cover all the incidental truths 'that may be desirable in life. The 
mightiest intellect will never exhaust these great laws. Many religions 
upon the face of the earth rest upon one isolated truth. Each has 
taken a great, glittering, .brilliant truth, and upon it has erected an 
elaborate system ; but because it is only one truth of many belonging 
to a great principle — which principle is not understood in full — the 
system of religion is not likely to prevail forever arriiOng men. 

DANGER IN DEPARTING FROM FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS, 

I want to bear you this testimony, my brethren and sisters, that 
we have in this Church the great, everlasting principles of truth, the 
basic laws of truth upon which we may erect the spiritual and religious 
structure of our lives, here and hereafter. I want to say also that 
it is my conviction that the greatest danger that may affect this 
Church at any time is to depart, ever so little, from these fundamental 
principles. All that we do, all that we plan to do, must be tied to 
the fundamental principles of the Gospel. Then we shall have no 
apostasy in this Church. The apostasies of past dispensations, have 
come ordinarily when some one has taken a glittering, desirable 
truth, and magnified it to the forgetfulness of the principle to which 
it belongs. 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Some may say that this doctrine stops all progress. If we have 
solid, substantial, unchanging principles which may never be departed 
from, then how is progress possible? Yet, my brethren and sisters, 
you all know that the only real progress possible in this world is that 
which is based upon adherence to simple, general laws) of truth. When 
man discovers some great law pertaining to the universe, and builds 
upon it, then he and science both make progress. The great principles 
or laws of truth may be likened to the great steel structure of one of 
our lofty office buildings — rigid, firm and bolted together so that it 
may not move or change — yet within those steel beams and girders, 
around them, above them, below them, are built floors and walls and 
doors and windows and decorations until the structure meets every 
want of those for whom it is intended. i 

WE MUST USE AS WELL AS POSSESS TRUTH. 

I trust my brethren and sisters, that the people of this Church 
may forever study and understand and adhere to these fundamental 
principles of doctrine and of organization which lie at the foundation 
of the persistence of this Church, in this time and in the time here- 
after. May we also remember that to possess truth is only a part of 
the problem. We must use it also ; and truth cannot be used properly 
or wisely unless we do, as has been explained here this afternoon, 
apply to it the authority of the Priesthood of God. The two great- 
gifts to this Church are the gifts of truth and authority. May we 
Latter-dav Saints remember them, treasure them, and not depart from 
them ; and may they be with us always, I ask it in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I feel very humble this afternoon in standing here before this 
vast congregation. Yet I am made to rejoice in the testimonies which 
have been borne by those who have spoken, both at this session and at 
the opening session of this conference. T have been greatly interested, 
and I trust that I may 'be led by the Spirit of the Lord to say that 
which I ought to say in the few moments that I stand here. 

GOD IS AT THE HELM. 

God is at the helm, as Elder Whitney has said. I greatly rejoice, 
as I know" you rejoice, in that great fundamental truth. This is not 
the work of man. It was not instituted by man. but by the Lord and 
Savior of this world. I am as fully convinced, I believe, I was going 
to say, as any man, that Joseph Smith was called and appointed in the 
very manner in which he has borne testimony ; that the Spirit of the 
Lord rested upon him, that he was called to usher in the dispensation 
in which we live, to establish the gospel in its fulness, to restore the 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 39 

Priesthood, which is power from our Father in heaven, by which we 
are able to officiate in all the ordinances of the gx>sriel for the salvation 
of the souls of men. I am firmly convinced of these truths. The Lord 
has not left us to wander ; he has not left us alone in the world to grope 
in darkness, but the Church which he has founded is guided by the 
spirit of revelation, and the inspiration of the Lord rests upon those 
who stand at the head. They are not doing this work in their own 
name, they are not endeavoring to establish themselves, but to carry 
out the plan which the Lord has revealed, and to make known Unto 
the children of men the great desire of our Father, that all men mav be 
saved through obedience to the gospel and receive a place and standing 
in his kingdom. 

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES DO NOT CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF PROGRESS. 

President Ivins this morning drew our attention to some things 
pertaining to the establishing, the ushering in, of this great and 
marvelous work, as it is spoken of, in these latter-days. He referred to 
the youth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, how he was called, how the 
Lord made himself known unto him ; how he was appointed, not only 
to establish the Church, but to give unto us a great volume of scripture 
which volume contains the doctrines, the teachings, and the history of 
a great people who dwelt upon this continent. As he was speaking, 
and as o*rier brethren have been speaking here, regarding the prin- 
ciples of the gospel, my heart was made glad in reflecting on the great 
truth referred to this afternoon, that this work is based upon fundamen- 
tal principles that do not change. They must not, they cannot change, 
because they are eternal. I believe in progression ; we all believe in 
progression : and the Lord has 1 not curtailed us in any respect, but we 
cannot substitute the ideas of men for that which the Lord has given, 
or the plan which he has adopted and revealed to us, by which we 
may be saved. For instance, there is no name other than that of 
Jesus Christ by which men shall be saved. Men may formulate 
plans and adopt theories and introduce strange works and gather and 
teach many peculiar doctrines, but this teaching is fundamental and 
from it we cannot depart, that all things are concentrated in and 
around the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Redeemer of the world. So 
we accept him as the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, as ex- 
plained by President Penrose, the only one who has dwelt in the flesh 
who had a Father who was immortal. We must accept, and do ac- 
cept, the great truth that because of his birthright, and of the conditions 
surrounding his coming into the earth, he became the Redeemer of 
men, and that through the shedding of his blood' we are privileged 
again to return into the presence of our ' Father, on conditions oi 
our repentance and acceptance of the great plan of redemption of which 
he is the author. We must believe in the resurrection of the dead, 
absolutely so, that every soul born upon the face of this earth shall 
come forth in the resurrection, either of the just or of the unjust, for 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the resurrection shall be universal, and that, too, through the great 
atonement which was made by the Savior of the world. 

PERFECTION W'OUttD fRESULT IF THE REVELATIONS OF THE LORD WERE 

OBSERVED. 

I look over this congregation and I see, as Brother Widtsoe has 
already expressed himself as seeing, people who have been gathered 
from the nations, who have been brought here through the preaching 
of the gospel, for the purpose of worshiping the Lord, with desires in 
their hearts of keeping his commandments and of receiving, through 
faithfulness, an exaltation in his kingdom. Immediately in front of 
this stand are a great many faithful, true Latter-day Saints, men of 
renown, men who are filled with the spirit of truth, who are intelli- 
gent, and on whom the Lord has conferred the Priesthood, which is his 
power, by which they officiate in his name for the salvation of souls. 
This causes me to reflect somewhat upon the organization of the Church, 
how the Lord has established all things in order and has given us a 
perfect svstem. We cannot improve upon it. Tf we would carry out 
that which the Lord has revealed, as he has revealed it, then all things 
would be perfect ; for the organization is a perfect organization, the 
theory of it, the plan of it, is without flaw, and if we followed all the 
orders that have been given to us in the priesthood and otherwise, if 
we would put into practice the great doctrines which have been re- 
vealed in the revela+ions contained in the Holy Scriptures, it would 
only be a matter of a very short time until this great people would be 
in the same condition, absolutely, as were the people in the city of 
Enoch. We would be able to walk with God, we would be able to 
behold his face, because then faith would abound in the hearts of the 
people to the extent that it would be impossible for the Lord to with- 
hold himself, and he would reveal himself unto us as he has clone in 
times past. Now 1 I base that largely upon the expressions in the Book 
of Mormon. Referring to the revelation made known to the brother of 
.Tared we read that so great was his faith it was impossible for the Lord 
to withhold himself. Not only was it possible, through his great 
faith, for that great prophet to see the finger of the Lord, but the Lord 
was under the necessity of making himself manifest and showing his 
entire bodv, the body of his spirit — ; for it was not then a tabernacle of 
flesh and bones. 

ORDER AND PERFECTION IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH. 

How perfect is this organization. It was not all given at once, and 
therein is made manifest' the truth of the statement of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, that he was taught of God ; for this work was not all 
ushered in at once, but the Lord revealed unto him as occasion required 
it — here a little and there a little, until the full grandeur of it was made 
known. The first officers in the Church were elders, two elders ap- 



ELDER POSEPH FIELDING SMITH 41 

pointed by that small body who gathered on the 6th day of April, 
1830, to officiate for them. But as time advanced and as the Church 
grew in numbers, it became necessary that other officers should be 
called and therefore we received high priests and bishops and patri- 
archs and a little later, seventies and apostles, and the whole plan was 
made known in its glory as we have it now in the Church. The Lord 
revealed, even in the beginning, the order of the various quorums, or 
rather the duties of the various quorums of the Priesthood. He taught 
us the duties of elders, the duties of teachers, the duties of deacons, and 
later of high priests when they were made known, and even before that 
the duties of apostles, and then the duty of patriarchs and of each 
branch of the priesthood. The duty of teachers is to visit in the homes 
of the people to see that there is no iniquity there, that there is no back- 
biting, no fault-finding, that all the members perform their duty; the 
duty of the priests is to go into the homes of the people to teach them 
the principles of the gospel, and not wait until they can attend the Sun- 
day school or a Mutual Improvement organization or even a quorum 
meeting of the priesthood. All this is good, all this is necessary as a 
part of the plan which the Lord has given us, but the priests were to 
go into the homes of the people and there instruct, there reveal, there 
make known unto the family, the will of the Lord. Thus the Lord 
prepared this plan and reveaJed it to us that we might walk in a know- 
ledge of the truth, in righteousness and in humility. If we followed 
it as perfectly as the Lord intends that we should there would be no 
iniquity in this Church, there would be no fault-finding, there would 
be no jealousy, there would be no envying, no strife, no bitterness in 
the hearts of members of this Church against other members, for all 
that would be done away, and we would stand with one united front, 
and with one desire in our hearts to serve the Lord and keep his 
commandments. But we are frail, we are mortals, we do not live up to 
all of the requirements that are made of us. We fall short some- 
times in many respects. We, being imperfect, and the Lord being 
under the necessity of using us as his instruments, the great plan as 
he has given it is somewhat below the great standard which he has set, 
and we do not reach those heights which we should. 

OUR DUTY TO MISSIONARY WORK. 

But it is my duty, as it is your duty, my brethren and my sisters like- 
wise — for responsibility is placed also upon you — to do the very best 
that is within our power, and not to shirk, but endeavor with all our 
soul to magnify the callings the Lord has given us, to labor diligenty for 
the salvation of our own house, each one of us, and for the salvation of 
our neighbors, the salvation of those who are abroad ; and so the gospel 
is to be preached, as we have heard, to the nations in the world, as well 
as here in the stakes of Zion. But let us not lose sight of the fact — and 
I do not think that we do — that a soul here at home is just as precious 
in the sight of God as is one from abroad; and there is a great mis-

sion field right here among the Latter-day Saints, and we might im- 
prove in our faith, might improve our works, might improve in our 
fellowship and standing in this Church. There are among us a great 
many honest souls who have never accepted the opportunity, or have 
never taken the trouble to search, that they might find these glorious 
truths which have been made known in the revelations of the Lord. 
They do not think of these things, they live among us, we associate with 
them and we come in contact with them daily. They think we are a 
pretty nice sort of people, but peculiar in our religious views, and 
therefore they pay no attention to our faith, and therefore this great 
missionary work that is being carried on now in the stakes of Zion is 
gathering in a harvest of honest, faithful souls right here from among 
those who before had never taken the opportunity, I say, which has 
been theirs, to hear the gospel. 

Now,, my brethren and sisters, these are some of the reflections 
that have come to my mind this afternoon. I realize that my remarks 
have been somewhat disjointed, not altogether in the one line of thought, 
but nevertheless I want to say this in conclusion, that the Lord is with 
the Latter-day Saints, that his Spirit is resting upon this people, and 
he requires of us that we go before him in humility, forsaking our sins, 
our jealousies, our evil thoughts, our envyings, our strifes, if such 
things exist, and of course, more or less, they do exist in the hearts 
of the people ; and he expects that we love one another. That I pray we 
shall do, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

ARIZONA APPROPRIATES $2,500 TO "MORMON" BATTALION MONUMENT. 

I have rejoiced in all that has been said here today and endorse 
most heartily the remarks of my brethren. I have a little note from 
Brothers J. W. Lesueur and Andrew Kimball of Arizona, the pres- 
idents of Maricopa and St. Joseph stakes. They call my attention to 
the fact that the Arizona legislature has appropriated $2,500 for a Mor- 
mon Battalion Monume'nt; that the majority of all the agricultural set- 
tlements in Arizona were begun by the "Mormon" people; that the 
State of Arizona will issue next month the Mormon Settlement book 
giving an account of the settlements of our people in Arizona, a book 
of four hundred pages, with sixty illustrations. The state of Arizona 
is publishing a history of that state, and this volume is a part of it. 
This volume alone will cost approximately $15,000. The Governor of 
Arizona and the Historian of the state have devoted a great deal of 
time, and our friend and brother, LeRoi C. Snow, has been employed 
in the Historian's office there. We understand that if this volume is 
sold at the price at which they will sell it, the state will be at a 
loss of fully $10,000. I have had a brief letter from Brother Snow, 
enclosing a full account of the contents of the book, but I have been 
too busy, since I returned from the coast, to read the same.

"the deseret news" commended. 

After announcing the time and place of various meetings, Presi- 
dent Grant continued, referring to the Cantata of Prof. Evan Stephens, 
and to the splendid editorial in the Saturday News regarding the Can- 
tata, and said : "You should all take the News. The Deseret News is 
the organ of the Church, and it is entitled to the support of all Israel. 
Because it is an excellent paper, and also because of the announce- 
ments which are made there by the Presidency, from time to time, 
and other matter it contains, the paper should be in the homes of the 
people. Read the editorial regarding the Cantata wheln you get home. 

reference to changes in the relief 1 society. 

There is one thing I forgot — and I regret it exceedingly. In the 
meeting of the Relief Society yesterday, I forgot to invite all of the 
honored and released members of the General Board of the Relief So- 
ciety, who in years past have sat there to the right of this stand to 
continue to occupy seats with the new mlembers of the Board. They 
have our love, our confidence and our blessings, and we want them 
to know, as we have said to our retired mission presidents, that there 
is always a place reserved for them at our General Conference meet- 
ings. I have been sorry this afternoon, in looking for the familiar 
faces, that I forgot to make this announcement yesterday. We want 
our sisters here, they have our love and our confidence, and our 
blessing for their past labors, and our prayers for their future hap- 
piness. 

The choir sang the hymn, "The Lord Victorious." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph C. Bentley of the 
Juarez stake, Mexico. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p. m., Monday, April 4. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, April 3, 1921. 

Elder Charles A. Callis, President of the Southern States Mission, 
presided. 

The music was furnished by the LeGrand ward choir, Liberty 
stake, Heber K. Aldous, conductor, and James Gilbert and Gladys 
Spry accompanists. The choir and congregation sang, "Come, let us 
anew our journey pursue." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop LeGrand Richards, of the Sugar 
House ward, Granite stake. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Father in Heaven." 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

{President of the Northern, States Mission.) 

We are met today in our General Conference, and this particular 
conference, in the spring of the year, brings to our minds the wonderful 
experience that the boy Joseph Smith had 101 years ago. As I pon- 
der the glorious revelation that was vouchsafed to him, and look back 
upon the early days of his ministry, I sometimes wonder if he. in his 
wildest fancies, in his greatest hopes and ambitions, dreamed that, in 
the short space of one century, conferences of the Church would be 
held where there would be in attendance thousands and tens of thous- 
ands of its members. To me these gatherings are a testimony that the 
work is of our heavenly Father, that it has his sanction, and that that 
which we are doing and striving to do has his hearty approval. He is 
blessing us and sustaining us in our efforts to do that which he gave to 
his children, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, at the beginning of 
the last century. Nowhere in the world is there a gathering of people 
comparable with these conference meetings held in Salt Lake City today, 
and for the next two or three days. Nowhere in the world is there 
such a gathering of men and women giving their all for the great work 
of the Master. Nowhere on earth will you find the body of men bearing 
the Priesthood of the living God, that you find here in Zion, on the 
occasion of these conferences. The power, the influence, and the spirit 
of these gatherings, are carried into all the world by the men and 
women, who come here and attend these meetings. 

It is a wonderful thing to know that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and to know that, in this day and age, a mighty work has been 
begun, and that we, the children of our Father, are active in this 
great work. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in the privilege of 
being here and bearing my testimony. I am grateful for the oppor- 
tunity of being as helpful as I can, in the work of the Lord. I trust that 
in coming together we have done so with one thought only, and that is 
to strengthen ourselves, to build ourselves up, so that when we go back 
to our homes, to our wards, to our stakes, to our various activities, 
we will take with us a stronger testimony, and a firmer determination 
to do the 1 work that God has placed in our hands. We make wonder- 
ful claims to the world. In fact, there is no body of religious wor- 
shipers making a claim that compares with ours. We stand aloof from 
all the world, and in our aloofness, we maintain a position that is true 
or false. If it is true, and we know that it is, we have taken upon 
ourselves the most tremendous responsibility that any people upon the 
face of the earth has been called to bear. We declare to the world 
that with us, in our Church alone, in our organization, is the power of 
the Priesthood of the living God. We declare to the world that with 
us alone there rests the right to officiate in the name of Him on high ; 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH 45 

and, in this declaration, we place before the world something that, 
sooner or later, it must acknowledge. Individually there is responsi- 
bility. We cannot live careless lives, failing to walk uprightly before 
our heavenly Father, and, at the same time, hope to convince the world 
of the great claims we make. We make bold declaration in our articles 
of faith ; yet something plain and understandable. We say to the 
world : "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus 
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. We believe that men will be punished 
for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression. We believe that 
through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved; by obe- 
dience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. We believe that 
these first principles and ordinances are: first, faith in the Lord, Jesus 
Christ ; second, repentance ; third, baptism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins ; fourth, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, 
and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach 
the gospel, and administer in the ordinances thereof. We believe in 
the same organization that existed in the primitive church, namely, 
apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc. We believe in 
the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpreta- 
tion of tongues, etc. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as 
far as it is translated correctly ; we also believe the Book of Mormon 
to be the word of God. We believe all that God has revealed, all that 
he does now reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great 
and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God." 

It is that old fashioned religion, which we declare ; that religion 
that God gave in the beginning. It is the plan of salvation to his 
children. It is the same religion that he has given, time and time 
again. It is, in fact, the same plan, with the same laws, the same or- 
dinances, the same gifts and blessings, that he gave through his Son, 
Jesus Christ, when he was here fulfilling his earthly mission. We be- 
lieve these things, and we declare them to the world. We go forth, 
giving our time, our means, and sacrificing, that the world may know 
them. Then, brethren and sisters, with this belief, there rests upon 
us the responsibility of living so that the world by our lives, and by 
our fruits, will see that we really do believe the things that we declare, 
and not only say that we do. Our responsibility is of the greatest, in- 
dividually and collectively, and we will stand before the judgment seat 
of our heavenly Father, and we will be judged according to that which 
we will do. We will be judged according to that which we know. 
When the time comes that we will be called to stand before the great 
"white throne," "the books" will be opened, and righteous judgment 
will be meted out. We will be called to answer for the degree in 
which we have fulfilled our mission, and done our duty here on the 
earth. 

Your sons and your daughters, your boys and your girls, are 
going into the world by the hundreds and by the thousands. They are

declaring this message. They are working hard. They are sacrific- 
ing, they are meeting opposition, they are taking the revilings, and the 
scoffs, and the scorn of the world. Why? Because they know that 
this thing is true. Are you, my brethren, and sisters, supporting them ? 
Are you back of them with your faith and prayers ? Are you sending 
them words of encouragement? If you are not, you are not doing your 
part in bearing the responsibility. Are you criticising the priesthood ? 
Are you, in your homes, speaking evil of the men who are called to pre- 
side in your ward, in your stake, or in the Church at large? Are you 
sharing with these men, in the mission field, fully their responsibility ? 
If you are not, then there is room for improvement, and" you will be 
called to answer before the throne of our Father, when the time comes 
that you shall be judged. I testify to you that, this being a divine work, 
we dare not do anything, or say anything that will retard its on- 
ward progress. It is the work of our heavenly Father, who is God 
Jesus Christ is his son, and, in this age, he has raised up a prophet to do 
a great and mighty work, and to you and to me has come the duty 
of sharing the responsibility of the work. Let us bear it. Let us sus- 
tain the authorities of the Church. Let us magnify every calling that 
comes to us, and live our religion in the home, so that when our boy 
or our girl goes into the mission field, he or she will go from a home 
where God has been served, and where his religion has been lived. Then 
when our boy, on a mission, writes letters home and bears testimony of 
the joy he has in his labors, our own joy will be greater, and we will 
feel fully comforted for the sacrifice we make for him, and for the 
Church. 

My brethren and sisters, it is a wonderful thing to hold member- 
ship in the Church, and to bear the Priesthood of the living God. Can 
you conceive of anything more glorious? Why, we may die tomor- 
row. We will all be called some day ; this may be our last. Are our 
lives right? Have we ordered them and lived them so that if our call 
should come, we are ready? Can we say we have done our duty? 

I rejoice in this privilege of meeting with you. I rejoice in the men 
that God has placed over us to lead us in this work. I sustain and 
support them with my whole heart and soul. They are the choicest 
men of this world today. Their hearts and souls are in this work. Let 
us be loyal, let us be true ; let us remember that this is God's work, and 
that it will triumph. If we hold fast, we will triumph with it. If we 
fall aside, we will not be greatly missed, and the Church will go on 
just the same, but the day will come that we will feel keenly our loss. 

May God bless us and preserve us; may he prosper us; may his 
work roll on ; may this great Latter-day gospel be preached to all the 
world, that no man can say that he has not heard that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that God has spoken from the heavens, and begun again his 
mighty work here upon the earth. My testimony is that the gospel 
is true, that the missionary work will go forward, that mankind will be 
warned, and that upon you and me rests a responsibility to do our 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 47 

part in bringing to pass God's purposes. May we do our part nobly 
and well, that we may be worthy of the choice blessings of our Father. 
God bless you. Amen. 

The LeGrand male chorus sang a selection entitled, "Content." 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission.) 

I sincerely trust that I may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord, and be 
able to say something that will be for our benefit. One of the great 
testimonies that comes to me, from time to time, is the presence of 
so many people who gather at the conferences of the Church in this 
city many of whom come hundreds of miles to spend a few hours 
in meeting, listen to the truths that are made plain by men who 
are appointed to speak ; and who, undoubtedly, make a great sacri- 
fice to be present. Those of you who live in this immediate section 
of the country, I feel never understand fully what it means for men 
and women to come to conference from great distances. You are 
not put to much expense. Your homes are here, which can be reached 
in a few hoitrs or a few moments. But the fact that people travel from 
the northern end of our country, and from the south, and from all 
parts, is a wonderful testimony to me ; and if it were not for the 
testimony of Jesus that is found in the hearts of men and women, 
they would not come. It is the power of our Father made manifest in 
their souls, that this is the work of the Lord, that this gospel is the 
power of God unto salvation, and the inspiration that comes to them 
as individuals prompts them to a high sense of duty. And when one 
attends to his duty in the highest sense of honor, he is always happy 
and in a. progressive state of mind, and the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty is found in him. 

This comes through a continual observance of the principles and 
doctrines of Christ, and through a repentance daily. While much im- 
provement coukl be made by all of us, yet I believe that the spirit of 
repentance is felt by the majority of the men and women in this 
Church, and as they repent, the more the spirit of repentance comes 
upon them, and they feel their weakness, and their need of living near 
the Lord, in order to obtain the blessings that are so necessary to last 
them through the day, or as the days come and go. Paul, upon one 
occasion, said, "I die daily." And that is true. There were many 
things that he put out of his life daily, as all men and women do who 
progress and grow in a knowledge of their Redeemer. And if there 
ever was a time when repentance needed to be preached or practiced 
it is at the present time. 

It takes a lifetime to repent. We hear of men who repent at the 
last moment of time on the earth. Not long ago the great newspapers 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

of the country contained an account of a certain individual who had 
lived a most wicked life; his experiences all testified that he had no 
reverence for God. But just before his death, his minister met with 
him in his confession, and "he made peace with his God," repented 
of his sins. While I have never felt to criticise what was in the heart 
of that man, who professed to be a minister of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the fact is that millions of people read an account of this man's re- 
penting at the last moment of time, and I am quite sure that thousands 
were impressed with the idea that even at the last minute a man can 
repent. Such a doctrine never came from the Lord. It is not true, 
because men do not know that they are absolutely relieved or pardoned 
for all sin until they have fought the fight which they came into the 
world to fight, until they have lived, and have made an attempt dur- 
ing their life to overcome. The spirit' of repentance must be found in 
the hearts of men and women continually, and it must be there to 
keep them not only from the greater things that are wrong, but the 
lesser things, for it is the little things in life that cause men and 
women to stumble and fall. A man walking along does not fall over 
great objects, he goes around them; but the little things, even the 
small stone or splinter, may upset him, and cause him injury. So it 
is with troubles in life. Men become influenced by little things that 
really ought not to enter into their hearts, but which do nevertheless. 
And people are often led to oppose the work of God until they finally 
find themselves outside the Church. Men do not go wrong all at 
once. It takes time. 

And so it is with our duties. They cannot be accomplished all 
at once. It takes time. For who knows how strong he is until he 
has been tested and tried. This whole life is the time for men to be 
tested and tried. We are away from home. This is our temporary 
abode only. We did not have a beginning here. We existed before we 
came here, and we lived and walked in the presence of an immortal 
Sire and Mother, and were there taught in the principles of life as re- 
vealed in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph Smith ; and 
as we lived there we' were given power to overcome when the time 
should arrive in which we should be called upon for our reserves. 
After we had advanced in that life, perhaps as far as we could, we 
were given, in accordance with our desire, the privilege of coming in- 
to this world. And here we are in these bodies of flesh and bones, 
enjoying full faculties of mind with the laws of God always before 
us, associating with men and women of righteous desires and also 
with those of the opposite nature. We find evil as well as good, and 
men and women are swerved by the things to which they pay attention ; 
one is swerved one way, and another, another. Somethings that 
would tempt me perhaps may not tempt you at all, and vice versa. 
And so the fact of the matter is that as we live we grow daily, and if 
we keep the commandents of the Lord as well as we can, we are always 
found in a progressive state, and we are in a measure able to say 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 1 49 

"no" when we ought to, and say "yes" when it is right to do so. But 
it takes time and study and faith and work and devotion and attention 
in order to do it. 

I believe that men and women ought to commit to memory, so 
that they would become a part of their lives, the principles of the gos- 
pel as they are given unto us from time to time in the pulpits of the 
Church, and in the revelations of the Lord, both of these last days 
and of ancient times. I fully believe that die Ten Commandments 
were not only for ancient Israel, but were given as a guide unto the 
Children of Israel forever, of which we are a part. That man or 
woman who becomes better acquainted with the laws of life is less 
likely to violate them. For instance, that man who has become fully 
convinced of what it means to violate the law of chastity, when he 
has been fully converted to the fact that it is wrong and contrary to 
God's law — when he remembers that the Savior of the world gave to 
Moses and the Children of Israel this commandment which he wrote 
with his own finger, that it was as their life and their guide ! — that 
man will not be found violating it. The man that has learned in his 
heart, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and who cherishes the law 
and who loves it, will not be swerved by adulterous men and women 
to crime. So you may take any one of the commandments that the 
Lord has given, a man will not be found violating them when he has 
learned to believe in and cherish them. The Sabbath day was a day 
set apart for men and women to honor, whereon to rest from their 
daily labors ; they were to prepare their food in singleness of heart, 
even the day before if necessary, they were to feast spiritually, they 
were to study, they were to go to church and bear testimony, and let 
that be a part of their lives. Men and women who do this will al- 
ways be found much richer and better in a spiritual way, they will be 
more firm in the faith, and more fully established in the gospel of 
Christ and also in the things of this world, than those who do not. 
These laws are given, they are within our reach. They are testified 
of continually by men and women in every part of the Church, the 
bearing of which testimonies brings the inspiration of God. 

We make a great sacrifice, we think, as missionaries. It is true 
that the man or woman who sends a son or daughter into the world 
does make a sacrifice in more ways than one. The money they pay 
out for them is indeed a sacrifice; but if it were not for that sacrifice 
there would not be the blessings. For there is a great bless- 
ing which comes to the individual who answers this call, even one 
that is not to be measured. I have seen men grow so in missionary 
work that you would not think them to be the same individuals as be- 
fore. As Joseph Smith, the prophet, said, some men were called 
before the world was, called while still they were in the prior estate, 
and given this privilege, to be ordained and to go into the world as 
missionaries at certain times, and each one who goes and fills a mis- 
sion is fulfilling the blessing that was there pronounced upon him. 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Further than that, it is the duty of men and women who have learned 
the truth and who have become obligated to the Lord for the things 
which he has given to them, to give them unto others, and in the fu- 
ture I believe there will be much room for criticism if we fail to 
do our duty. Opportunities come to all men, and that man or woman 
who makes the best of life is the man or woman who succeeds. I tell 
you, it is wonderful to find men and women who have had the power 
to resist evil and to stand for the right. It only proves that God is 
no respecter of persons ; but in every country and clime men who re- 
spect the Lord are given power to overcome, and when they have 
overcome, and they have substantially proved that they have overcome, 
they are not tempted, but they are blest and revered and given priv- 
ileges that men never know who have not had that experience. 

So I say, in conclusion, that the spirit and testimony of Jesus 
Christ is in the earth ; it is borne by the thousands of men and women 
who live upon the earth, men and women who are in this congregation 
and others coming from all parts of the country, who are working to- 
day, testifying to all men that there is a spirit and a vitality in Mor- 
monism that cannot be found in all the world. And this spirit will 
lead men to repent. That is the great key-note that was given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that men must repent and prove 
themselves to the Lord, and honor him and keep his commandments. 
It takes time, and cannot be done at the last moment before the death 
of any individual, no matter what men may preach or declare. Such 
doctrine never came from the Lord, nor is it reasonable or true. The 
spirit of testimony is what brings about the spirit of repentance, and 
correct living only clinches it and proves it to be true ; and when men 
find out this truth it enables them to do what they were intended to 
do. 

May the Lord help us, that we may not be swerved by fear or 
by things that may be wrong, great or small, but may so live that we 
may correct things that go wrong and set men and women straight, 
and at the same time set ourselves straight ; that we may have the 
testimony of Jesus, and may be able to declare and know that. Joseph 
Smith was called to be a Prophet of God, and that he was selected to 
be a leader of men that he, indeed, received a visitation from the 
Father and the Son, that he heard them and saw them, and that he 
died for his testimony. May we live according to the truth that the 
Lord has revealed, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Enid Orlob and Bessie Newman sang a duet entitled, "I waited 
for the Lord." 

ELDER J. N. LAMBERT 

(Associated with the Bureau of Information.) 
I am happy to add my testimony to those already borne in your 
hearing this morning, by those who have preceded me, for I have 
a testimony that this work is the work of the Lord. 



ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 51 

While President Winslow F. Smith was speaking, and remind- 
ing us that something over one hundred years had elapsed since the 
Prophet Joseph received his manifestation in the visit of the Facher 
and the Son, my mind ran back to what has been accomplished since 
our people reached these valleys. It was my privilege, some years 
ago, to go back and visit a number of places where the Saints former- 
ly lived, in Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, New York and Vermont. Previ- 
ous to this visit, I had indulged somewhat in a feeling not altogether 
wholesome toward the people of Illinois. My grand-parents with 
other Saints had been driven from that state, and I felt they had 
not had justice, and that if the time ever came, perhaps, that I could 
do something to the people who lived there for the treatment they 
had given to my grand-parents, I would have been happy in do- 
ing so ; but the visit I made took that unholy feeling out of me. When 
I visited Nauvoo, and thought of what it had been at one time, with 
a population of upward of twenty thousand people, with a hum of 
industry on every hand, and to see what it was then, with but a few 
over a thousand souls, and more like a country village, I could 
not help but think the Lord had withheld his blessings from that 
people and from that land, and I came back with a different kind of 
spirit from that which I had when I left home. 

I then thanked the Lord that my grand-parents, with the other 
Saints, had been driven out from that place, and that they had found 
a better place to live in. I then appreciated more than ever before 
the inspired words of Brigham Young, when he said upon arriving in 
this valley, "This is the place." There was no mistake made on the 
part of the Lord in bringing our people to this land. Great as is the 
state of Illinois, with its wonderful acres and their great production, 
I believe that within the confines of this commonwealth, together 
with the state of Idaho and other surrounding states in which our 
people are now living, there are far greater and better conditions 
of productiveness, reserved by the Lord for the people who are now 
living here, than ever could have been found in Illinois. 

The Lord did not make a mistake in leading President Young 
and our people here, in the year 1847, notwithstanding, that such men 
as Col. Bridger and others tried to persuade them that this was not 
a fit place of habitation for men, that crops could not be matured 
here, and suggested that we need not attempt to make a home here. 
That has all been set at naugh by what has been accomplished by those 
who settled here. Compare the wisdom of such advice as that of Col. 
Bridger, to the inspiration of President Young. No doubt in his pro- 
phetic eye he could see what our people would some day accomplish. 

We have people coming here as tourists, to this block, who come 
here, you might say, to scoff, and literally remain to pray; people 
who have no idea, no desire even to affiliate with us, or to indulge in 
the faith that is so dear to us, and yet after being told the story of 
"Mormonism," and what has been accomplished by our people, and 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

seeing it for themselves, have gone away and marveled at what we 
have done. 

I remember President Roosevelt coming here in the year 1903 ; 
when over in the tabernacle he said, "I pay my respects to the early 
'Mormon' Pioneers, who came here to this great American desert, 
and made it literally to blossom as the rose." 

You remember when President Brigham Young came here and 
said, "We will settle here," that there were some in that first com- 
pany who thought a mistake had been made. They had seen other 
spots that were more inviting to the eye, than what presented itself 
when they first saw this valley ; thev were willing to take chances on 
what lay between here and the Pacific ocean, and so expressed them- 
selves, but President Young, said, "This is the place ;" and when 
reminded that this was a desert, said, "We will make it blossom like 
a rose." Years afterwards President Roosevelt, holding the highest 
position in the gift of the people of this great country, the United 
States, gave testimony of the wonderful wisdom and prophetic ut- 
terance of President Brigham Young. Surely the Lord made no 
mistake in leading us here. 

The Lord established his Church and kingdom here upon the 
earth for a purpose. We have been privileged to become members of 
the same, and ought to appreciate our standing and membership in 
the Church. I wonder sometimes if we really do appreciate such a 
blessing. If not, and we need to repent or adjust ourselves so that 
we can more fully appreciate our standing, we should do so. 

If we are not in harmony with the commandments of God, if we 
cannot purge from our beings whatever is unholy, whatever is not 
consistent with the mind and will of the Lord, and live consistently 
with the Spirit of the Lord, which will lead into all truth, then we 
are not Saints in very deed. 

On the other hand, if we can order and so conduct our lives 
as to conform to the requirements of the Lord, keeping the com- 
mandments and laws of the gospel, our influence and power can- 
not be measured. Such unity cannot be hidden. Do you not think, 
then, that our influence will be felt all over the earth? Whv cer- 
tainly. Ask these mission presidents, who are sitting here, and who 
can testify of what they hear men say about the work being done in 
a missionary way by the Bureau of Information. They can tell you 
of hearing men say how they have been impressed with what thev 
have seen and heard while here, and they have gone away to tell 
it to their friends, and to urge them to come and see for themselves. 

The positive stand that we have taken as a people on education, 
morality, clean living, and other things that have put us in a class 
by ourselves, is now being brought to the attention of the world, and 
people are beginning to better, appreciate us. Our stand on these 
thing's ought to be of a most positive kind, however. 

I remember a man I knew, when I was a little boy. I was im- 



ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 53 

pressed with his goodness, and I remarked to my father, "Brother 
So-and-so, is a pretty good man, isn't he?"* and my father said, "Yes; 
but what is he good for?" And then he went on to impress me that 
we must be good for something, not good for nothing. As I look 
back now, I cannot remember anything that this m;an did that was 
positively good. Now we want to be good for something. We want to 
be positively good, not negatively good. We want to be so good that 
other people will appreciate us ; for we are told that the time will 
come when people will know us as w.e are known, when they will 
know us as we should be known. And yet, I almost fear the time 
when all people will begin to say good things about us. 

I remember the admonition of the Savior, when he said that, 
we should take care when a time like that should arise, and that we 
should rejoice and be exceedingly glad when people would speak evil 
against us, falsely. But beware when people begin to prate about our 
good points. I believe, however, that the time is past, long since, when 
people want to believe something that is not true. I believe the time 
is past when people should ask, "Am I my brother's keeper?" Now 
they are wont to say, "I am my brother's keeper." 

The movement that has grown up among the Rotary, Progressive, 
and other clubs, that we are brothers, the Big Brother and the Big 
Sister idea, and which has spread to nearly all parts of the world, 
is a sign that the people of the world are looking out for one another 
rather than, as it has been in the past, each for himself. 

My testimony to you is that the Lord is at the helm and will guide 
us through trouble and storm. He is not going to desert his people. 
My testimony is that Joseph Smith was a prophet ; that his legal suc- 
cessors have been prophets. Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford 
Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith and Heber J. Grant, have 
been sent by the Almighty for a purpose ; the Lord has blessed them 
with prophetic vision, and with the power to discern and tell the peo- 
ple the things that they should know. He has given to this people a 
mouthpiece, that we may know when to go and where to go, when to 
do and when not to do things; that if we find we are not doing the 
things we should do, that we should repent, and repent sincerely ; that 
we should get in line and remain in line, not set up our judgment 
against our leaders, or against the rule or direction of the Church. 

There have been men, I regret to say, who have had the audacity 
to say that tbey have known certain things to be the mind of the 
Lord, when they have not been in accord with the Church. I can- 
not think that such a man is going to be prospered, or is going 
to_ have the Spirit of the Lord to be with him. The Lord may be 
with him. The Lord may be long-suffering and patient, considering 
that such a man might see the error of his way and repent; but in the 
long run that man, unless he repents, is going to fall The Spirit oi 
the Lord will not always strive with man, and oh, what darkness 
when he is left dependent on himself 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

This morning, I stood at the tabernacle door. A man came along. 
I asked him, "What is your position in the Church?" I knew the 
man, and I knew he had been doing some things that I did not think 
would entitle him to come to a certain place that had been reserved 
tor those holding certain positions in the Priesthood, 'Ie said, "I 
am an old man, and for the first time in my life I am without a posi- 
tion." Just think of it, after a man is' almost ready to go down into 
his grave, he is stripped of the Priesthood of the Almighty, and he 
is without a position in the Priesthood, in the Church of God ! Do 
you want to be in a position that will compel you to make such a con- 
fession as that? God grant that the time will never come when anv 
of us will have to give such an answer. 

May the Lord ever bless and assist us in our faith ; may he en- 
courage us to keep the commandments of the Lord, that we may be 
able to hold fast to the Iron Rod, which will bring us back into his 
presence, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission.) 

I humbly pray that I may speak under the power of the Holy 
Ghost, for only by that power can the servants of God reach the 
hearts of the children of men. The missionaries of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in preaching the everlasting gos- 
pel, have this thought in their hearts, which they express in their testi- 
monies and in their discourses ; namely, "Friend, go up higher," for 
that is the effect of the gospel, in the lives of men. It lifts them up 
higher, for it is the "power of God unto salvation." The Latter-day 
Saints are blessed with gospel ideals. We are a people with ideals. 
Jesus said, "Ye are the light of the world," and he also said, "For I 
say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the right- 
eousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into 
the kingdom of heaven." And by obedience to the gospel teachings 
we desire to be a light unto the world ; we are a light unto the world ; 
and we are, in a measure, at least, letting "our light so shine before 
men, that they may see our good works, and glorify our Father which 
is in heaven." 

We believe in the gift of healing; we cherish that as one of the 
most precious blessings that our Father has given to his children in 
the household of faith. James says, in the 5th chapter of his epistle: 
"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the Church: 
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of 
the Lord; And the prayer of faith shall save the sick." You and I 
bear testimony, that the power of the Father is in this Church, and 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 55 

our loved ones who are afflicted are. raised up by his power, to his 
glory and to the magnifying of his holy name. 

A few weeks ago, in the city of Atlanta, the Episcopal Church or- 
ganized an association, the purpose of which is "to visit the sick and 
pray over them;" and the dean of that church, in a sermon, declared 
that the gift of healing was once a gift in the church, that the Re- 
deemer and his apostles preached it and practiced it, and he said, "we 
must restore it." The clean continued, "the religion that does not care 
for a man's body as well as his soul is a ghastly joke." Is not this 
a testimony that Joseph Smith was a restorer of the ancient faith? 
And it was restored in God's way. John, the apostle, said: "And I 
saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every na- 
tion, and kindred and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, 
Fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come." 
That is the way the gospel was restored, by a holy angel, in accord- 
ance with the mind and will of the Creator. Did not Paul say, "For 
I neither received it [the gospel] of man, neither was I taught it but 
by the revelation of Jesus Christ." And by the revelation of the 
Redeemer, the Prophet Joseph Smith received this gospel. By the 
power of the Highest he restored it to the children of men. 

No man could have restored this gospel. It is a heavenly gift ; 
it came from heaven, and you and I bear testimony that, from the 
courts of glory this plan of life and salvation did come. 

The Latter-day Saints are expressing their love for the gospel 
in service. There are thousands of men and women in this Church 
who are not on the "firing line," in the mission field, but who never- 
theless are doing a splendid work. "Peace hath her victories no less 
renowned than war." 

In this assembly hall, a few months ago, I was talking to a good 
sister who has a son on a mission in the Southern States. I said, 
"how many children have you?" "Seventeen," she replied, "but we 
have never been blessed with any children of our own." I said, "Sister, 
will you please make this more clear to me, and this is the substance 
of that good woman's reply : "We have never had any children of our 
own. We took four babies, three girls and one boy, when they were 
twenty-four hours old to six days old, adopted and reared them. The 
boy filled a mission. We reared a little girl of seven; she is adopted 
to us. She has filled a mission. We emigrated from Germany two 
boys and their sister. The boy stayed with us ten years, the girl un- 
til she was married. One of the boys filled a mission; we helped him 
to fill it. For five years we cared for three little boys whose ages 
ranged from 4 to 7 years. We took two boys, one was 7, the other 
8; they stayed with us nine years. One of them served in the war. 
We have four orphans now at our home, two girls 12 to 15 years old, 
two boys, one 13, the other 10. I took the ten-year old boy when he 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

was a year old. W,e have emigrated 15 children from the old country. 
For sveral years we have kept three children, from Switzerland. We 
don't want to stop the good work of taking orphans to bring up." 
There is a story of service. This woman's name may not be written 
in the book of fame, kept by mortal man, but in heaven angels have 
recorded her name. She is among those who are saving souls, who 
are helping young people to find their way through the temptations 
and tribulations of life into the salvation that God our heavenly 
Father hath in store for them. 

Two weeks ago, I was holding conference in Mississippi, not far 
from New Orleans. We had no church to meet in, so we met in 
the shade of the trees, because it is warm in that climate, about this 
time of the year. Why did we meet in the open air? Because in that 
settlement mobocrats have burned down two of our churches. But 
some of the very men who instigated this outrage, and who assisted 
in the destruction of our humble places of worship have asked to be 
allowed to donate toward the building of another house, in which 
the Latter-day Saints there may meet for the worship of God. God 
has softened the hearts of the people. Your sons and your daughters 
are preaching the gospel in the power of the spirit of testimony, for 
only in the spirit of testimony can this gospel be preached in a manner 
to reach the hearts of the people. Day unto day brings forth testi- 
mony, that this gospel is the work of the Lord, day unto day brings 
forth testimony that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, the 
instrument in the hands of Deity to establish this glorious work which 
bids men to go higher up, lifts men up, which purifies their nature 
through the spirit of repentance, by the gift of repentance, from evil 
and wrong doing. 

And now, with you, my brethren and sisters, with my brethren 
who have preceded me this morning, I bear my testimony that the 
Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand upon the earth in the latter- 
day; that he will come in glory to reign on earth with his Saints a 
thousand years. And I bear my humble testimony that the Book 
of Mormon has been brought forth to testify, among other things, 
that Jesus is the Christ, that he was resurrected, and that all men 
will be resurrected. 

I also bear you my testimony that President Heber J. Grant is 
a servant of the Lord, his mouthpiece to his people, a man of honor, 
a man in whom we can depend, for he is led by the Spirit and power 
of God. This testimony I fearlessly bear, for I know that these things 
are true. May the Lord bless us all, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang, "O worship him." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Parley Bennion. 



ELDER HEBER C. I VERS ON 57 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held outdoors, near the Bureau of 
Information, at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, April 3, 1921. 

Elder John M. Knight, President of the Western States Mission, 
presided, and called the congregation to order. 

Singing was furnished by the congregation under the direction of 
Elder C. S. Martin. The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, 
for a prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop A. T. Shurtliff, of Wandamere 
ward, Granite stake. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ve Saints of 
the Lord." 

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission.) 

I rejoice, my brothers and sisters, in the opportunity of meeting 
again in conference with the Saints of the Lord. To me there is noth- 
ing sweeter than "communion with Saints." I rejoice in the spirit of 
the great work in which we are engaged, and am reminded that just 
a little more than two years ago I received a letter over the signature 
of President Heber J. Grant wherein was contained the information 
that I had been selected to preside over the Northwestern States Mis- 
sion ; also these inspiring words, the spirit of which is in my soul, and 
I thank the Lord therefor, and trust that this spirit shall never be- 
come dim, but every hour be brighter and brighter, so long as, life shall 
last: 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; for, be- 
hold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he 
suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 
And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
hin.'., on conditions of repentance; and how great is his joy in the soul that 
repenteth. Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people; 
an : if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance un- 
to this people, and bring, save it he one soul unto me, how great shall be 
your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father? And now, if your joy 
will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom 
of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls 
unto me?" 

Another revelation of the Lord, containing the same spirit and 
sentiment was given to John Whitmer, through Joseph, the Seer, in 
Fayette, Seneca county, New York, June, 1829 : 

"Hearken, my servant John, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, 
your Lord and your Redeemer, for behold, I speak unto you with sharp- 
ness and with power, for mine arm is over all the earth, and I will tell you 






58 ' GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone, for many times you 
have desired of me to know that which would be of the most worth unto 
you. Behold, blessed are you for this thin^, and for speaking my words 
which I have given you according to my commandments. And now, be- 
hold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto 
you, will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring 
souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father. 
Amen." 

No greater work was ever entrusted to men than to cry repentance, 
and labor for the salvation of souls in the kingdom of God. Upon 
me as an individual, a preacher of repentance, lies the responsibility 
of directing the labors of 180 missionaries, among them the sweetest 
and most beautiful young men and young women in all the world ; and 
I assure you that keenly do I sense it, and sincerely do I pray that the 
spirit of this calling — important above all others that come to men in 
the world — shall be mine. My great task has been to know, as I 
instruct those young men and young women, that which is better than 
any other thing, to posses ; that more than all else which will qualify 
them to make of them efficient servants and preachers of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. In Paul's instructions to the Corinthian Saints, declar- 
ing his own power and the source thereof, he recognized that it was 
not in his profound learning (for he sat at the feet of Gamaliel; and 
among the philosophers and learned men of his day he stood fore- 
most), but from some other Power, the source of which he has in- 
dicated most unmistakably in his Epistle to the Corinthians, from which 
I desire to read a few words. 

In II Corinthians, 12, he speaks of the wonderful manifestations 
of God, the revelation of Jesus Christ, who appeared to him while on 
the way to Damascus, to bring bound the Saints that he was persecuting. 
The Lord said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" and in answer 
Paul said, "Who art thou, Lord?" and the Lord said, "I am Jesus 
whom thou persecutest ;" and Paul replied, "Lord, what wilt thou have 
me to do?" In this wonderful revelation he was caught up into the 
third heaven where he beheld indescribable glories and heard things 
which he said were not meet for men to utter; yet he affirmed that 
not upon these did he depend for the strength of his testimony and the 
power of his ministry, for, said he : 

"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance 
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger 
of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this 
thii..g I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he 
said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made per- 
fect in weakness." 

The Lord would have Paul know that in the humility of his heart, 
the sincerity of his soul, and in the recognition of God, lay the source 
of his power, wherein he should find great strength, and not in the 
wisdom of man. This was also indicated in a previous declaration to 
the Corinthian Saints, wherein Paul said : 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 59 

"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of 
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I 
determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him 
crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much 
trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not wjith enticing words 
of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that 
your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of 
God." 

When I read these words, I think of that most wonderful and 
successful of all converters of souls in this latter dispensation — aye, 
I believe of any dispensation of the gospel of Jesps Christ, the humble, 
unlearned Wilford Woodruff, who taught, converted and baptized by 
the power of God, nigh unto two thousand souls — a record, I believe, 
that is not equalled by any other servant of the Lord in any age of the 
world. This he 1 accomplished, not with the wisdom of man or the 
philosophy of the sage, but by the power and Spirit of Almighty God, 
which possessed his innocent and humble soul. Continuing, Paul de- 
clared : 

"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wis- 
dom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which none of 
the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not 
have crucified the Lord of glory." 

(And they who crucified the Lord of glory were not the ignorant 
men of the world ; they were those who stood in high places and occu- 
pied 'positions in the courts of kings and royalty; they were the learned 
men of the world who crucified the Lord of glory.) Paul further 
says: 

"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear ,heard, neither have 
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them 
that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the 
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the de.ep things of God. For what man 
knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him? even 
so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 

"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which 
is .of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of 
God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom 
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things 
with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit 
of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, be- 
cause they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all 
things, yet he himself is judged of no man." 

And as I read the '12th and 13th verses of this chapter, I think 
of another illustrious example of the inspiration of the Almighty, 
manifest in one of his chosen servants : 

"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit 
which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us 
of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wis- 
dori teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual 
things with spiritual." 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Of Joseph F. ' Smith, our late revered prophet and leader, it has 
been said', by one who speaks with understanding and from personal 
knowledge, that Prest. Smith never prepared in his life a sermon. This 
man who traveled with him in Europe, on the isles of the sea, and 
through the stakes of Zion, year after year, thousands upon thousands 
of miles, and heard him deliver hundreds and thousands of sermons, 
asserts that he never heard Prest. Smith deliver two sermons of 
which it could be said, "this sermon reminds me of another one I heard 
him deliver." To me that is a marvelous testimony to the divinity of 
the calling and inspiration of the man, for such achievement is not 
humanly possible. Human intelligence has its limitations. But the 
intelligence and inspiration of the Almighty are infinite ; and the man 
who is in touch therewith, inspired thereby, has no limits, and can 
preach sermons day after day, year after year, under the inspiration of 
the Spirit of the Almighty, and never repeat. But when men prepare 
their sermons, and by worldly wisdom hope to teach the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and glorify themselves, then they are not possessed of this 
unlimited, irresistible power which finds lodgment in the souls of hon- 
est men. Wherein, then, lies this wonderful power? What is the 
character of it? That is the question that should concern every mis- 
sion president, and every teacher of righteousness, and preacher of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. You remember what Paul says in the 13th 
Chapter of First Corinthians : 

"Though 1 speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not 
love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though 
I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knoiwledge! 
and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have 
not love, I am nothing." 

In comparison with this wonderful power, charity or love — these 
accomplishments here mentioned pale into insignificance. Qualified, 
and endowed with these rare gifts we naturally conclude, one must of 
necessity be a most powerful preacher; he can speak with the tongues 
of men and the eloqunce of angels ; he understands all mysteries, and 
has all knowledge and faith so that he could remove mountains. But he 
lacks one thing, and that Js the vitalizing force which is the secret of his 
power. And what is that? It is that supreme love which the Savior 
describes in the following words : 

"Except a man is willing to leave father and mother, houses and lands, 
wives and children, and all for my sake and the gospel's, he is unworthy of 
me." 

It is that love of God, which overshadows and transcends the love 
of everything else in the world whether it be personal glory and honor, 
wealth or fame. It matters not what it may be, there is no love in 
his heart equaling his love of God. That is the source of his power; 
and possessed of that, his words are irrestible, and his power will re- 
dound to the honor and glory of God and the salvation of his children 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 61 

— which power may God endow us with, I humbly pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

{President of the Canadian Mission.) 

My brothers and sisters : I sincerely pray in my heart that I 
shall have strength of mind and body to speak to you a few moments 
this morning. I have found it to be a very taxing ordeal to speak in 
the open air to a large congregation. 

With President Iverson, who has just spoken to you, I too rejoice 
in the privilege of meeting with you in this general conference of the 
Church. With all the power of my soul I rejoice in the knowledge 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know it is the power of God unto 
salvation. There is nothing in the realm of things knowable for which 
I an so deeply grateful as I am for my knowledge of the divinity of 
God's great latter-day work. I do know that the God of heaven, with 
his own hands laid the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I know that the Spirit of the Almighty has in- 
spired the hearts and the minds of those who have built the super- 
structure of this Kingdom of our God. I know that this Church is en- 
dowed with the Priesthood, the authority of Almighty God. I know 
that this Church is the depository of the riches of God's wisdom and 
his knowledge. 

I rejoice in the knowledge that the great achievements of this 
great people are coming to be known among the children of men. 
The day is past and gone when men can speak evil of this people and 
escape rebuke. There are men and women in every center of popu- 
lation today who know of the splendid achievements of the Latter- 
day Saints. These men and women are brave enough and true enough 
to speak in defense of the truest and noblest people in this world. 

I have had occasion frequently, in the cities of eastern Canada, 
to tell the people that the Latter-day Saints, inspired by the power of 
their noble religion, have established in the world, the highest civ- 
ilization known to modern man. That is a bold statement to make 
about a people, but the statement is just as true as it is bold. 

What is the first essential to civilization? What is the first es- 
sential to the highest wellbeing of humankind? It is good health 
and clean blood. The statistics of the United States tell us that dur- 
ing the year 1920, 101 babies out of a thousand in the United States 
died before they became a year old. These same statistics tell us that 
in Utah only 64 babies out of a thousand died before they became 
a year old. What do these figures mean? They mean that the 
Latter-day Saints have clean blood in their veins. These figures 
mean that Latter-day Saint fathers and mothers live moral and whole- 
some lives. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

What is the next essential to the highest civilization? It is the 
common prosperity. I use the expression the "common prosperity" 
advisedly, because a people who are partly rich and mainly poor 
cannot attain to anything great in moral or civic progress. What do 
the facts show concerning the conmon prosperity of our people? On 
the 29th day of January, 1921, the Country Gentleman, one of the 
leading farmers' magazines of the United States, carried the state- 
ment that Utah should be known as the "home-owner's state." And 
this statement was followed by the further statement that out of 
62,662 farms in the state of Utah, seven-eights of them were owned 
by the men who operated them. What do these figures mean? They 
mean that our people have made the greatest progress in material 
prosperity of any people in the world. 

What is the next mark of a highly civilized people? It is edu- 
cation. On the 23rd day of July, 1920, the Toronto Evening Tele- 
gram, one of the largest papers published in the Dominion of Canada, 
published a statement quoted from Dr. E. A. Winship, one of the 
greatest educators in the United States, in which Dr. Winship said, 
"No state is within hailing distance of Utah in an efficient attempt 
to solve the civic, industrial, and moral problems of the education of 
the youth from 12 to 18 years." You will notice that he says that 
no state is within hailing distance of Utah. He does, not say that 
our state is almost on a par with other states in education ; he tells us 
that no state ranks with us in an efficient attempt to provide for the 
education of the youth. 

What is the next mark of a highly civilized people? The next 
essential is morality. Theodore Roosevelt, that grand man, whose 
name has rung around the world, in an article published in Colliers 
Magazine, in February, 1911, said, "Indeed among these 'Mormons' 
the standard of sexual morality was unusually high; they were better 
than their neighbors." 

What is the next mark of a highly civilized people? It is spirit- 
uality — that quality of which President Iverson has spoken so fer- 
vently this morning. How do the Latter-day Saints rank in spirit- 
uality? In April, 1920, Colonel William Jennings Bryan sat in the 
great tabernacle, over there at one of the sessions of that conference, 
within three feet of the mission presidents, and listened to the ser- 
mons of the leading men of this Church. At the conclusion of that 
session of the conference, he made an informal talk, in which he 
said, "I have never witnessed such religious fervor in all my life 
before." 

Here we have a people who have the five leading marks of a 
great people. They are a healthy people, they are a prosperous peo- 
ple, an educated people, a moral people, a spiritual-minded people. 
I tell you, this people is God's people. With all my heart I thank 
my God for membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and with all my strength I pray for power to do my part in 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 63 

making known to the world the great things which God has wrought 
in our day and time. 

My brothers and my sisters, let us remember our heritage of 
power, of truth, our heritage of inspiration of faith. If we will re- 
member these things, we shall rise and shine and be the glory of all 
mankind 1 — which may God grant, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may be able to make my- 
self heard, and that I may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord and be able to 
say something this morning that will encourage us in living our re- 
ligion. 

It is truly an inspiring sight to see this vast congregation gath- 
ered together here, and to know that our great Tabernacle is filled 
to overflowing, and also the Assembly Hall, and that these people 
have gathered together for the purpose of worshiping the Lord and of 
hearing his word. To me it is an evidence that there is burning within 
the hearts of this people a testimony of the divinity of this great latter- 
day work. To me it is an evidence that they are desirous of growth 
and development in the Lord's work, that they desire to become a bet- 
ter people, that they desire to learn more of his will and of his pur- 
poses ; and I take it, my brethren and sisters, that it is with a desire 
that they might also extend this great knowledge to our Father's 
children, wherever they may be — because upon us devolves the re- 
sponsibility of carrying the gospel to the nations of the earth and to 
people everywhere. 

As President Iverson was speaking this morning of the great mis- 
sionary work being done, I was reminded of the words of the Savior, 
his commission given unto his disciples, when he appeared unto them 
after his resurrection : 

"And be said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gos- 
pel to every creature. He that believeth and lis baptized shall be saved; but 
he that believeth not shall be damned." 

It seems to me, my brethren and sisters, that inasmuch as this is 
the same gospel, established by our Savior, and that the same author- 
ity held by those unto whom he gave this commission is held by the 
Church today, through its membership, that the call is to us today ; and 
I say unto you, my brethren and sisters, that we have resting upon us 
the responsibility to go into all the world and to preach the gospel unto 
every creature, for it is indeed the power of God unto salvation unto 
all who will believe. And how can a man believe a thing that he has 
not heard ? and how can he hear, save someone be sent to teach it unto 
him? 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

The preachers have preached ever since the Reformation, but re- 
ligious thought throughout the world has not been particularly im- 
proved. Divisions have continued to occur. We hear today the 
thoughts expressed of a uniting of the religious world; but, my 
brethren and sisters, men cannot unite in the true Church of God 
if they have it not. We have been told here this morning that we 
are perhaps a distinct people, a people better than other people; I 
want to tell you the reason of it is that we have the truth, we have 
the gospel, and we have restored to earth again the power of God to 
speak in his name, and I say, Woe would be unto us, if we were not 
different ; woe unto us, if we were not distinct, and if our righteous- 
ness — as the Savior said to his disciples — were not better and greater 
than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, or the righteous- 
ness of the world, we could not in any way inherit the Kingdom of 
our Father in heaven. 

Brethren and sisters, represented here among the speakers this 
day are missionaries extending their labors and their activities from 
the provinces of Canada to the boundary line of southern Mexico, down 
to Guatemala. Under their direction are laboring hundreds of young 
men who have responded to this call. I am thankful to the Lord 
that I have been counted worthy to he associated with them and to 
labor with them ; and, as one who knows, because your sons have 
been under my care, I want to report to you that your sons are acquit- 
ting themselves admirably and nobly in the mission field. They are 
men on the day after they arrive there, although they come into the 
mission field many of them boys of 18, 19 and 20 years of age. They 
are told, when they come into the mission field, to be men, and they 
respond, and they seek for the Spirit of the Lord, to assist them in 
their labors, and they are able (though not at first from the stand- 
point of the wisdom of the world, not being educated in seminaries of 
learning particularly along the lines of religious thought), by the 
inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord which they enjoy, and by the 
power of the holy Priesthood which they have, to confound the wis- 
dom of the wise. 

I recall just now how our boys, in a foreign tongue, on the 
streets of the great city of San Antonio, many times have been able 
to congregate as many people in the streets as stand before us here 
today, telling their message of salvation unto the people. And they 
are not left alone, but they are heckled and they are contested by 
the preachers of the day — they are boys just come from the farms 
and from the workshops and from the vocations in life from which 
our boys go into the mission field, but by the power of the Lord, and 
his help and assistance that come to them, they have been able always 
to come off victorious in any contest that they have had in that city. 
And the same is true, I am sure, wherever our boys go. You have 
reason, my brethren and sisters, to be proud of them. 

We know the very great sacrifices that the fathers and mothers 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 65 

are making in these times to support their boys in the mission field, 
but I will say to you, my brethren and sisters, you could not invest 
your means to a better advantage than by supporting them there, and 
I wish to bespeak for them your support by way of encouragement — 
not sympathy, for the boys are well off, they are well taken care of, 
the Lord is their helper and he raises up friends to them, and if they 
betimes fast a day or two, it is only for their good; they are all in 
good health, they are in good condition, and they do not need your 
sympathy along that line. What they need is your support, what 
they need are letters from home encouraging them to do their part, 
to give their all to the service of the Lord ; to remember this, that they 
must love him with all their hearts, with all their minds, with all their 
might, and with all their strength, and that next to that they must 
love their neighbors as themselves. 

And who are our neighbors in the world? I say to you, we are 
all neighbors, we are all brethren, we are all children of the same 
great heavenly Father, and we should manifest our love for our 
brethren in the world by taking to them that greatest of all gifts, which 
is the gospel, the power of God, by which they may be saved. Our 
mission is not particularly to any one people, or to any one race, but, 
as I have read to you now, and as I could read many other passages, 
which show you that the gospel is to be preached to all nations as 
a witness, and to every creature, everywhere. The saving powers of 
the gospel are manifest among one people just as much as they are 
manifest among another people, if those people strive to live in har- 
mony with the gospel teachings. 

It has been my great privilege, my brethren and sisters, after the 
tempestuous times that Mexico has passed through for the past ten 
years, and after we have had to withdraw our missionaries, and our 
brethren, natives of that land, have been left for many years almost 
isolated from the Church, it has been my privilege, and I thank the 
Lord for it, to have returned last month, with twelve of your boys, 
and to have picked up again the broken threads of the work in that 
land ; and if I could express to you as I felt it, and your boys felt it, 
the happiness that came to those people upon our return, I am sure, 
my brethren and sisters, those of you who have sons among that 
people would be grateful to the Lord that they are the instruments in 
carrying such joy and such happiness back to that people. 

And I would speak a word in praise of our brethren and sisters 
in that far-off land; for, nothwithstanding the fact that they have 
been alone for ten years, we found their branches perfectly manned, 
the Priesthood had been left with them. That is the thought I should 
like to leave. Although the missionaries from Zion had been with- 
drawn, the Priesthood of the Lord had been committed to those peo- 
ple, and their own people had been ordained elders and set apart as 
branch presidents, and not for one single day had they forgotten 
their obligations to the Lord. They are living their religion, they 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

are teaching it to their neighbors, and many are being brought into 
the Church through the efficient labors of our native brethren in that 
far-off land, and they are living as near as may be in harmony with 
the principles of the gospel. 

I am thankful to the Lord for the intergity of those people. I 
would just like to quote to you what one of our native brethren said 
in a fast meeting, not long ago, in El Paso. He was a young man 
who served as a missionary there some ten years ago, a very efficient 
missionary, too, and someone was saying how bad it was that we 
had all been called away from the mission down there, and that per- 
haps things would go badly because the elders from Zion were not 
there. He said, "I thank the Lord that the Priesthood has been 
given to my people, and that that Priesthood will never again be taken 
away from them ; and with that Priesthood, men will be raised up 
among them to carry on the work." And I testify to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that we have seen a demonstration of the truthfulness of 
the testimony of that young man concerning the Priesthood, as it is 
operating among the people of Mexico. 

I am thankful to the Lord for the integrity of those people. I 
went into the mission field as a very young man, and I have been in 
the missionary, field ever since. I am not very old, but I remember 
that I am getting a little older all the time, and that many years have 
passed over my head during the time that I have been associated with 
the missionary work in that land. I do not begrudge a single hour, 
nor one single penny nor labor, nor regret one single affliction that 
has come to me ; but I deem it a privilege and a great blessing that 
the Lord has bestowed upon me in permitting me to go out and lift my 
voice in defense of the truth among the children of men. 

I feel weighing upon me greater today than I ever have in all 
my life, the responsibility of going into all the world to preach the gos- 
pel to every creature. I tell you, my brethren and sisters, this must 
be done. We have witnessed signs that bespeak the coming of the 
Redeemer of the world, through wars and rumors of wars and through 
pestilences : but I recall also his prophetic words which he said, "This 
gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, as a witness 
to all men, and then shall the end come." That responsibility still 
weighs heavily upon us, my brethren and sisters. O, what a' responsi- 
bility to know that we have within our hands that power that can 
save men, and what a responsible position we will be in if we do not 
do all that is within our power to take this and give it unto those who 
have it not, who are in the world ! 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may rest upon you. I pray 
that you may be prospered. O, how I pray for the parents of those 
boys who are struggling in poverty to fulfil their missions ! I hope 
that means will come to you, and that you will be able to maintain 
your boys. Do it, if you possibly can. T know that no greater bless- 
ing can come to you than the privilege, of sacrificing in that way. 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 67 

And the blessings of heaven, remember, after all, come through sac- 
rifice, and we must be tested, and we must be tried. Support your 
boys, encourage them to stay. We encourage them to be frugal, we 
encourage them not to spend your means unnecessarily, and we wish 
your support in every way, my brethren and sisters. And I believe we 
have it. I know that you have trying times at home. Many times 
have I talked with missionaries in our particular mission who are 
cramped for means, and my heart goes out to their mothers and fath- 
ers, or to those who are supporting them. I know what they are pass- 
ing through; and if reward comes to those who proclaim the gospel, 
so also will reward come to those who support them while they are 
there. May the Lord bless you, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission.) 

Sincerely do I pray for the spirit of this occasion. Like my 
brethren, who have spoken, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, 
for I realize it is the power of God unto salvation unto all those who 
obey it. I have felt all my life that I need make no apology for my 
religion. We have nothing to be ashamed of and court the fullest and 
freest investigation of all its principles and practices. The world, with 
all its strife, turmoil, bitterness and confusion, needs the gospel of Christ 
to bring peace again to the earth, and I am happy to play my 1 little part 
in testifying to the restoration of that gospel, in this dispensation, 
through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I have felt in 
my heart of hearts that we have a definite message for the world, and 
that the world is in need of that message. While Elder Jensen was 
speaking I remembered the words of Josiah Quincy, who visited the 
Prophet Joseph Smith just forty-four days prior to his martyrdom at 
Carthage, Illinois, and published in his Figures of the Past, this: 

"It is by no means improbable that some future text book, for the use of 
generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this: What 
historical American of the 19th century has exerted the most powerful in- 
fluence upon the destiny of his countrymen? It is by no means impossible 
that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written; Joseph Smith, 
the 'Mormon' Prophet. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most 
men now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. His- 
tory abounds in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The man 
who established a religion in this age of free debate, who was, and is today, 
accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High 
— 'Such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his memory 
with unsavory epithets. Fanatic, impostor, charlatan, he may have been, but 
those hard names, furnish no solution to the problems he presents to us. 
Fanatics and impostors are living and dying every day, and their memory 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

is buried with them; but the wonderful influence which this founder of 
religion exerted and still exerts, throws him into relief before us, not as a 
rogue to be criminated, but as a phenomenon to be explained. The vital 
questions Americans are asking one another today have to do with this man 
and with what he has left us." 

Such a text book has not yet been written, but the vital questions the 
world is asking today, have to do with this thing called "Mormonism." 
lit is becoming a real nightmare to some of them, but the vile epithets 
they hurl are hurting it not at all. Its power and influence are being ex- 
tended in every part of the land, thinking men and women are listening 
to the testimony of the servants of God, a knowledge of its great truths 
is coming into their lives, and some of the very best among them are 
yielding obedience to its principles. The promise made by the Redeemer 
of the world to those who accept the gospel and obey its teachings, 
namely : 

"My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do 
his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether 
I speak pi myself." John 7:16-17; 

is being realized. They are sure it is true, and that it is the power of 
God unto salvation. I was reading, a few days ago, an article that ap- 
peared in the Denver Post, one of the leading newspapers of the western 
states, entitled, "The Churches Have Failed to Find the True God," 
"Religion Flas Succeeded in Creating Everything but Real Deity." 
Alfred W. Martin, associate leader of the Society of Ethical Culture, 
addressing a New York audience, according to the Nezv York World, 
has this to say : 

"The spectacle of leading representatives of Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Christianity, and the rest, each claiming that his religion will be the re- 
ligion of the future, makes the claim, ridiculous and absurd. No less absurd 
would be the claim that the ethical movement, with its inadequate name 
and its deepest religious issues not yet fully worked out, will hold the future. 
Rather is the ethical movement an instrument for finding a satisfying re- 
ligion. In the search for it the movement originated forty-five years ago, 
and it is still searching. The most that can rightly be claimed for it is that 
it will make important contributions to the religion of the future, notably 
by its doctrine of morality. A futile and thankless task it would be to at- 
tempt a description of the religion of the future. Of this much, however, we 
may feel certain, namely, that the religion of the future will not be either 
the Ethical Culture Movement as we know it today, nor any of the existing 
religions." 

I do not know if Mr. Martin is acquainted with the Church of Jesus 
Christ, commonly called "Mormon," but I want to bear testimony that 
this is the one Church that will hold the future, with its adequate 
name, "The Church of Jesus Christ," with all its fundamental and deep- 
est religious issues, principles, and doctrines fully worked out by its 
author, Jesus of Nazareth, and stated in definite, positive, concrete terms 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith,the leaders of the Church, and the elders 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 69 

who are promulgating its truths in the world ; and is the one gospel that 
removes doubt, fear and anxiety, and brings the satisfying feeling of 
peace, joy and contentment to the soul. I am happy to know we are not 
classed, as a rule, among the so-called Christian churches ; that we are 
not apostate from the Catholic church, nor a product of the great refor- 
mation. Our bitterest enemies and severest critics have never accused us 
of coming from either source. We stand out in bold relief before the 
world, as the one church claiming to be the Church of Jesus Christ, 
and of receiving our authority and appointment to preach the gospel 
from the Foundation of all Truth. Resurrected beings having visited the 
earth and conferred upon Joseph Smith the holy Priesthood, which gave 
him the right to organize the Church of Christ in the earth, which he 
did, April 6, 1830. I want to leave my testimony with you that the 
church of the future will be the Church organized by the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, in the dispensation in which we live, and that it will go for- 
ward in power and might until, it shall accomplish its mission and des- 
tiny in the earth. That mission and destiny is to preach the gospel of re- 
pentance and bear witness of the life and ministry of the Son of God. 

I want to read another item that appearead in the same paper on 
the same day. It is from Rabbi Louis J. Kopal, of Buffalo, New York, 
speaking of the mockery of present-clay religion, he said : 

''The mockery of present-day religion is the pathetic feat that we seem 
not to be profiting from the experiences of the centuries, that we seem not 
to heed the lesson of how and why religion failed to prevent the world war, 
but rather are slumping back into the smug and fruitless religious life of 
pre-war days. The war evidenced the fact that religion had succeeded in 
creating everything but God. All the peoples of the earth- have sought to 
find God, but they have each and every one failed. The way of the Jew has 
failed, the way of the Christian has failed, the way of the Catholic has 
failed, the way of the Protestant has failed. They have failed and 
failed ignobly, and the moral maelstrom, the spiritual chaos, the social re- 
actionism of the moment is the child of their creation. Because religion 
has proved itself to have created everything but the reality of God in life. 
Religion will fail again unless God becomes to us more than a name, an 
idea, a fetish, a prayer, a Cathedral, a Church or Synagogue. 

"Let us prove our sincerity by closing our Churches and Synagogues 
and Cathedrals until we are ready to make our practice consistent with 
our profession. Such sincerity may bring a religion that is real. Sincerity 
will remove the shallow sham, the menacing mockery of present day re- 
ligion, and bring God to America." 

That is a terrible arraignment of the religious world, but it is 
in keeping with the words of the master to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
in the woods of New York, when the boy was told to join none of the 
existing sects ; that they had a form of Godliness, but denied the 
power thereof ; taught for doctrines the commandments of men ; draw 
near with their lips while their hearts were far from him. Why have 
the churches failed to find God, and to make him a part of their lives ? 
It is because they have created their own gods, made their own 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

deities instead of worshiping the God of the Bible. To all of them 
he is incomprehensible, unfathomable, unintelligible, and' to thinking 
people it is no mystery why the Jew, the Catholic, the Christian and 
Protestant have failed to find him. 

The Latter-day Saints have a definite and positive message for 
the world on this subject, declaring unto the world that the God of the 
Bible is a personal being, we ourselves being fashioned in his image : 
that Christ was God, manifest in the flesh, the exact counterpart of 
his Father, both of them being intelligible and in a measure at least, 
understandable. The people of the earth will continue their search 
without success until they are willing to acknowledge the great truth 
expressed in the first revelation given to Joseph Smith, in the per- 
sonal appearance of the Father and the Son. Then it was that God 
came to America, and I say to you, my brethren and sisters, in the 
face of the statements I have read from the learned gentlemen, both of 
whom are prominent in the religious world, there is needj of the elders 
of the Church of Christ in every part of the earth to proclaim the God 
of heaven, and testify to the divine mission of his Son, Jesus of Naza- 
reth, who was crucified' for the sins of the world. They have the same 
commission as the disciples of old, and bear witness of the great plan 
of redemption wrought out on Calvary by the Redeemer of the world 
for the salvation of the human family. From one end of our mission 
to the other, the elders are faithful in bearing witness to these 
things, and to the restoration of the gospel, through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in this day and age of the world'. They are not afraid 
to lay down the gauntlet and declare unto men and women everywhere, 
that if they will accept the truth, yield obedience to the gospel, repent of 
thir sins and be baptized by immersion for the remission of their 
sins, they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands. This witness of God' will manifest that we speak not of our- 
selves, that the doctrines are not ours, but his that sent us. It will re- 
veal unto them the truth of all things, and by it they may come to know 
God and his Son, Jesus Christ. i 

The world at large is without this great gift, they deny its power, 
not beliving in present-day revelation. Paul, the apostle, writing to 
the Corinthian saints declared unto them: 

"Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the 
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus 
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." (I Cor. 12:3.) 

The Savior himself declared' to the people in his day, in the won- 
derful prayer recorded in St. John 17 : 

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true 
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." 

Since all the peoples of the world have sought to find God, it is 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 71 

really interesting to discover in his word how we may come to a 
knowledge of him and his Son ; and since a knowledge of them is 
necessary, if we obtain eternal life, and we can only obtain that 
knowledge by and through the revelations of the Holy Ghost, it is 
absolutely essential that men and women be in possession of this gift 
of God. They can receive it only upon obedience to the fundamentals 
of the gospel, and in no other way. 

I rejoice that these truths have become a part of our lives, that 
God is more to us than a name, an idea, a prayer, or a church, and 
that we are in no way responsible for the menacing mockery of pres- 
ent-day religions. 

I pray that God will be with us as his children, that wq may have 
power to live the principles of the gospel, be consistent with our pro- 
fession, exemplary in our conduct, that in reality we may be the salt 
of the earth, the leaven that will leaven the whole lump, putting our 
light upon a hill, where it can be seen, and not under a bushel — that 
others seeing our good works may be led to glorify the God: of 
heaven. 

I testify to you in the name of the Master that I know, as I know 
I live, that this work in which we are engaged is the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that it was restored to earth through the instrumentality 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that it will fill its mission and destiny in 
the earth, and that no power under high heaven can stay its progress. 
God hath spoken it, and he will not be mocked. It will go forward 
until it shall fill the whole earth ; men and women in every clime will 
recognize in it the truth of heaven. I pray that the peace of our 
Father may be with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Our God, we raise to thee." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder C. S. Martin. 



THIRD OVERFLOW MEETING 

The third overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, Sun- 
day afternoon, 2 o'clock, April 3, 1921. 

Elder James E. Talmage, of the Council of the Twelve, presided. 

The music was furnished by the LeGrand ward choir. Liberty 
stake, Heber K. Aldous, conductor, and James Gilbert and Gladys 
Spry accompanists. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop Edward M. Ashton. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Grant us peace." 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

The congested condition existing upon this block at this time is 
but typical of the congested condition in the Church. It seems im- 
possible to provide meeting houses enough, or room within the walls 
sufficient, to accommodate the Latter-day Saints in their assemblies. 
There is, without doubt, a great spiritual revival amongst the people; 
and in this we all rejoice. Besides this gathering at this hour, there 
is an open-air meeting in progress on the grounds, and also the main 
assembly in the great tabernacle. 

When the brethren of the Twelve go out amongst the people they 
have, of course, very close and cordial dealings with the stake presi- 
dencies, but we have one little criticism to offer that I think may well 
be voiced here. It is somewhat difficult to get one of the stake presi- 
dents to say much when one of the Council of the Twelve is present. 
I want these brethren to understand that they are the visiting brethren 
on this occasion, and I want them to do just as we have to do when 
visiting their stakes. And I pray that they may be inspired by the 
Spirit of the Lord, for I know you will be edified by what they have 
to say. 



ELDER HEBER L. ALLEN 

{President of the Taylor Stake of Zion, Alberta, Canada.) 

It is not a very pleasant sensation to have the tables turned on you, 
the way Brother Talmage has done towards us this afternoon, in re- 
quiring us to do all the talking, because I believe the situation which 
he has stated exists in most all the stakes. I know it does in our stake. 
I know I once attempted to speak on the first principles of the gospel, 
and one of the presidents got up and said it was very refreshing to 
hear a stake president talk on that subject. We usually let the other 
fellows do that. 

I pray that the Lord will bless me with his Spirit that we may be 
benefited by meeting together. As Brother Talmage has stated, I 
come from the far north, Canada, a name that makes most of you, I 
suppose, shiver; you think that that is so far off and such a cold 
country that you have no desire to go there ; but I assure you that 
we have a great many people in that land of the Latter-day Saints. 
And the Lord has blessed us fairly well in that land during the last 
thirty-four years, since we first began to settle there. We try to do 
what we can, in our weak way, in that stake of Zion. We have adopted 
the method counseled at the last conference: we have sent out a few 
missionaries, and I think they have done a great deal of good. You 
know, there are only eight or ten thousand of us in that country — in 
that great nation. Most of us came from the United States. A few 



ELDER. HEBER L. ALLEN 73 

children, of course, have been born there, in fact quite a number. We 
have been treated in that wonderful land with the fullest measure of 
liberty that could be extended to any people. We have had every ad- 
vantage enjoyed by any other people in that country, and we feel very 
thankful that that is the case. 

Now, in our missionary labors that we have taken up recently, we 
have advised the elders to go to the non-"Mormons," who do not un- 
derstand the gospel, and also to those of our brethren and sisters who 
have been a little careless ; and when they come back, they report that 
they have a great many very agreeable gospel conversations with 
some of our non-"Mormon" friends. Some who are not members of 
the Church have entertained our elders for hours at a time, and they 
have stated that they had no idea that we promulgated such ideas as 
we have. One man who had been educated for the ministry had the 
privilege of hearing two of our elders, and he had been so prejudiced 
against our people and doctrines that although the meetings were held 
in the schoolhouse, nearby, he would not go in. When the elders called 
on him, he would not invite them in ; but they finally persuaded him 
to go into the schoolhouse. He said, "I was educated for the min- 
istry, but I don't believe anything now, there are so many conflicting 
ideas." But when they left, he said, "Come back again, because I did 
not know, nor have any idea that you had such splendid principles as 
you have been telling me of." 

A great many people feel that our people are away up out of the 
world in Canada. Thirty-four years ago, when people first went up 
there, many of our people felt that after the storms had blown over 
the time would soon come that they would be called back to Utah. 
My grandfather was one of them who said that. I told him, no ; be- 
cause, I said, "You have heard some wonderful predictions in relation 
to the labors of this people in this land. I have heard people who come 
up there say that 'you will have very many more settlements in this 
beloved country.' President Joseph F. Smith said, 'You would have 
thousands and tens of thousands, and they would extend far up to the 
Great Bay, pointing up to the great Hudson's bay.' " I have taken a 
great deal of pleasure in predictions of that kind, and I have spent 
all my time and energies there, in fact. I have become a citizen 
there, over 30 years ago; but still I can say that no man born in this 
great country can feel a warmer feeling in his heart for this great Re- 
public in which you live than we ; and we always look back and say, 
That is a wonderfully blessed land where the Lord said that he raised 
up good and wise men for the purpose of establishing his great work. 
Now I say, we see the fulfilment of these prophecies. 

I have often thought of that wonderful vision that Nephi had. 
He said, he saw that wonderful Church, and it spread abroad, and 
multitudes of people belonged to it ; and he also saw that the people 
of the Lord were scattered over the whole earth, but their numbers 
.were few. It may be that the Lord will use that as a means of 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

promulgating his work in the last days. Some people are so full of 
prejudice they will not give attention to the principles that we preach. 
If they did, they would say, as this man did, that they had never had 
any idea that we had such wonderful and noble principles. But when 
they come to examine our principles they wonder, and think they could 
be patterned after. 

Some of our people have attended some of the meetings of a 
great Farmers' association there. We have a very strong organization 
along that line in Alberta, and our bishops have been strong repre- 
sentatives of that organization, and in one of our meetings they put 
forward a resolution in relation to tobacco, and they petitioned par- 
liament, or at least the provincial legislative body, that they would 
raise the age at which cigarettes could be sold to boys. In the recent 
vote for prohibition, the province went overwhelmingly in favor of 
prohibition, and of course our people stood where they ought to stand, 
in the lead, and our vote was the largest in the province. Now they 
can see what we are doing. We have already maintained, for a great 
many years, the only local option district in that country. Through 
the efforts of President Card, that was brought about, and finally the 
majority of the people there voted in favor of temperance, prohibition. 

We live on a little branch railway known as the Cardston branch, 
and some of the travelers, after we had put forth the M. I. A. slogan, 
have said, "Why, my house has told me not to come down this way 
with our wares, because the people have adopted that resolution, and 
won't buy our coffee there. Now our stores are quitting the sale of 
tobacco," he said. Another man said, "I sell tobacco, and my house 
has ordered me not to go down there, for none of the stores are selling 
tobacco, and we cannot sell very much down in that country." An 
example of that kind begins to have its effect upon the people. 

I was in a big banquet not long ago, at which one of the members 
of the board of trade, with a wide reputation, happened to be sitting 
by me, and they have a habit of almost smoking you out in their ban- 
quets. He said, "Mr. Allen, I feel that it is almost a sacrilege to 
sit here and smoke beside you." That meant to me a good deal ; it 
meant that they had begun to take notice of what we had been teach- 
ing. In a few ways of this kind the gospel is being preached in that 
great land. 

In that great convention I mentioned, we were told, "You 'Mor- 
mons' are not getting the benefit of all the taxes that you ought to get, 
and that you help to pay, because you haven't got enough men in the 
penitentiary." Those men said, "You haven't got any men in the 
penitentiary, and still you are paying your share of the taxes." 

Up where I live they organize for the farm women also, so that 
they can get social and other privileges. When they came into our 
midst they said they recognized something that there was not in any 
other province. They said, "You are looking after your own poor 
better than anybody else in the province ; and this is a part of our 



ELDER HEBER L. ALLEN 75 

work that we do not emphasize, because you do not need it in this 
community. " 

Recently when we paid a visit to the leading educators, and on 
the occasion of the visit of Superintendent Adam S. Bennion, in the 
interest of the Church schools, they said something that was interest- 
ing. You know, there has been talk of closing up Church schools ; 
but the minister of education said, "You hold to that Church school 
just as long as you possibly can, because it has filled wonderfully a 
want felt in that community, that no other province has done, in getting 
young men into the school and educating them." He said, we want 
to introduce domestic art and other manual and domestic training in 
our Church schools, and the best representative of that was right in 
Raymond, and these things are efforts along a line of work that is 
highly important. They are carrying out the ideas that President 
Young advocated more than fifty years ago, when he said that the 
boys ought to be taught to be better farmers; and the girls, better 
housewives, so that they can be better citizens. We had the first 
schools in the province that introduced domestic art and science ; and, 
in fact, others want us to cooperate with them. 

When our trustees went up to the educational convention they re- 
ported that ours was the only school outside of their large cities that 
was carrying on any of that work. 

In this way, it may be that the gospel may be preached, for they 
will get a chance in that way to see some of our good works. May 
be, after a while, they will begin to recognize that there are some 
other principles that are very valuable, and for the uplift and benefit 
of men ; and I hope that the day will soon come that they can recog- 
nize us for our real worth, and when the spirit of the gospel shall be 
better than anything else with them, and when they can be baptized 
into the same spirit that we are baptized into, and a spirit of brotherly 
love and kindness shall exist in all parts of the world. Then they will 
begin to receive the benefits of "Mormonism," for which it has been 
restored to the .earth. 

Now, at home we have the privilege of entertaining most of the 
general authorities of the Church, and I would just like to bear testi- 
mony of the worth of these men. I do this because we are sustaining 
two new members of the general authorities at this conference. We 
have had the privilege of entertaining 22 out of 26. Brother Talmage 
has not yet favored us with a visit, nor Brother Widtsoe, of course. I 
want to bear testimony that they are very, very good men, and that 
we are perfectly safe in following their footsteps ; and we don't want 
to get the idea that we want to do something that is contrary to the 
will of the Church ; because, from the ideas that I have received from 
carrying them over our great prairies, and having them in our own 
homes, they are splendid men, and I have not heard any one of them 
suggest that which would smack of trickery or anything of that kind, 
but they are pure-minded men. While I loved President Joseph F. 



76 GENERAL CONEERENCE. 

Smith above all other men, I can see that the Lord raises up other 
men who are carrying on the work, just as well as men have been 
carrying it on in the past. At the present time I can say that I admire 
President Grant very much. I rode with him all over our stake, just 
previous to his being promoted to the presidency of the Church, and I 
found him to be a man that is pure-minded, and one who has the in- 
terests of the people at heart. And these other brethren who have 
recently been sustained, I can sustain them with all my heart. It is a 
source of pleasure to sustain these men by raising our hands and then 
going home and supporting them in everything that we do in life. 
May the Lord enable us to do that, and also recognize that there is 
order in his Church, and that whenever he has anything to do he will 
do it through the proper channel. I pray that we may follow our file 
leaders, that we may be indeed true Latter-day Saints, and also, that 
we may do our part in promulgating the gospel. This is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The LeGrand ward male quartet, under the direction of Leland 
I. Acomb, sang, "Nearer, my God, to thee." 



ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG 

{President of the Sevier Stake of Zion.) 

This inspiring congregation, the opening prayer and the beautiful 
music, all make one feel like Peter oif old, that "it is good to be here," 
although one's individual part m,ay be a trying ordeal. 

The Sevier stake of Zion is not situated in the extreme north or 
south. We are centrally located ; and, until recently it comprised 
what President Grant notified you of today, both North Sevier stake 
and South Sevier stake. We had a very large stake, both in number 
of wards and in large territory to cover ; hence, the brethren deemed 
it wise to divide it up into three different stakes. So the Sevier stake 
is not today as large as it was at the time oi our last conference. 

I have enjoyed the remarks of President Allen. In just a few 
words, I will tell you why : when I hear the name "Allen" it links 
an incident up in my life that has always been and always will be 
sacred to me. I do not know whether President Allen is a representa- 
tive of the Allen family I now speak of. My mother was an orphan 
girl. Her home was in Glasgow, Scotland. She was fourteen years 
otf age when she received the message of truth, through the elders of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She received a testi- 
mony and became converted. She had been cared for during several 
years by the Allen family who were neighbors to her mother and 
father before their death. They asked her, "Mary, are you interested 
in the 'Mormon' faith?" In tellmg the story, the tears welled up in 
the little girl's eyes, for she knew what was coming, and she told 



ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG 77 

them, yes, that she was very much interested in them, that she be- 
lieved that they were true servants of God, and that this was actually 
the Church of Christ. They asked her, "Do you insist in going to 
their meetings?" She answered, "I would like to." Grandpa Allen 
said, "Very well, my son John says that you are disgracing the fam- 
ily." Inasmuch as they were business people in that community, he 
said, "I hear it from all our customers and from people on the street, 
that the little girl who is with you and whom you have been caring 
for, is giving continual attention to those 'Mormon' people and John 
is very much offended ; it has come to this, Mary : you either accept 
of our home and its hospitality, or take 'Mormonism,' and there is 
the door." She took the door. Thank God for the courage, for the 
faith, and the stability the Lord had granted to her in her teens. She 
had but one shilling. She secured what was known as the Townshead 
hall ; and she pleaded with the caretaker, for the one shilling, to per- 
mit the elders, who were traveling without. purse or scrip, to preach 
there that evening. She prevailed upon themi, and they permitted 
the elders to speak. She related to them that she was homeless, and 
the elders blessed her. Before she left the meeting, she was offered 
several homes, by several people, who were impressed by the power 
of the Lord to give her assistance. But the story is this — I don't in- 
tend Brother Allen personally to take this — that Grandpa Allen said, 
to his children and his wife : "If 'Mormonism' can fasten itself upon a 
little girl securely as it did on Mary, knowing her life as we all know 
it, knowing her appreciation for our home and our comfort, then I 
want to say that there is some greater power than just man's, about 
this great work known as 'Mormonism.' " To cut a long story short, 
the first dinner my good mother received, after she left the old coun- 
try, she received here in Utah, prepared by the Allen family, and as 
far as I know they have continued to remain firm, steadfast and im- 
movable to the cause of our Savior. 

Here, this afternoon, we sang that beautiful hymn, "How firm 
a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excel- 
lent word." Is it not to all of us an excellent word? Is it not the 
most secure foundation that we could imagine? Is there another or- 
ganization, that is as secure, as solid, as perfectly organized, as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ? 

We have heard, this morning, from the Prophet of the Lord, who 
gave us his blessings. With him are his counselors, the Council of the 
Twelve, the seven presidents of Seventy, and like organizations, as you 
go down the line of the priesthood, one by one, organized in every 
stake and ward of Zion. Now. I know that they are men of God. I 
have been acquainted with them for many, many years. They have 
been in my home ; and they have slept there and eaten there. I have 
labored with them in various capacities, some of them, and I want to 
testify that there are no men that I have ever come in contact with in 
my life who are so absolutely devoted, heart and hand, dedicated to 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the service of the Lord, for the welfare of their fellow men, banish- 
ing selfishness, and thinking of others. I think of the home, if you 
will pardon me, that I was reared in ; I think of my good old father 
standing up, and with tears in his eyes, saying to his boys and girls : 
"O how bad I would feel, if one of my boys and girls ever in their 
lives permitted the servants of God to be assailed in their hearing." All 
the days of my life I heard, in that home, while my father lived, 
courage, good words, words of counsel and advice. If we will fol- 
low closely and carefully the counsel of these meh, and ; be painstaking 
we shall have success in life, and be able to live in righteousneess ; and 
we shall be crowned with a crown of glory resulting from successful 
life here in mortality. 

Just one word with reference to our organizations. Sometimes 
our boys and our girls, at certain ages, are a little careless, probably 
grow a little doubtful, skeptical in a degree, and do not quite under- 
stand clearly. I think of the words of the poet, wherein he said : 

THE OLDER I GROW 

The older I grow the more patient I am, 

And fonder of people I seem to become: 
I find much that's real hidden deep in the sham, 

I know that life's juices are under the scum. 
The care that once fretted as trifles appear: 

And the faults that loomed large in the friends that I know, 
Seem to fade in a background of kindness and cheer. 

The older I grow. 

Time was that I questioned the purpose of life — 

In the mad way of youth I was quick with my hate: 
But I knew not the depth nor the breadth of the strife, 

And I knew nothing then of the workings of fate, 
I judged from the surface and not from the deep, 

I was wasteful with pleasure and fearless of woe, 
But I find that my joys I'm more eager to keep 

The older I grow. 

I chose all my friends with particular care, 

And heedlessly wounded the truest and best: 
To many a false god I sent up a prayer, 

Then the real things of life seemed a subject for jest, 
And the bad seemed the good, and the good seemed the bad. 

I scorned in my haste what was splendid below: 
But I find myself longing to have what I had, 
. The older I grow. 

I have learned that men's follies are not printed deep: 

That many, youth mocks at, are splendid and fine: 
And young people scatter the joys they should keep, 

In the very same way that I once wasted mine. 
I'm more tolerant now, I am slower to sneer, 

For I've suffered my griefs and I've winced at a blow: 
And the money I find matters less and less here, 

The older I grow. 

From the Wall Street Journal. 



ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG 79 

I wonder, my brethren and sisters, if I may say one more word. 
As in all parts of the Church we see manifest in our own stake and 
wards, a spiritual uplift ; we see an increase in activity in all branches 
of the work, and in all the organizations of the Church in our stake. 
We notice that there is more painstaking and care, that people keep 
the commandments more truly than they ever did before. But with all 
that, I feel that our homes are not just given the full attention, they 
deserve, because of the many worldly affairs, with which the bless- 
ings of God have provided us. I wonder if we are remembering our 
boys and girls, are we praying with them morning and night? I wonder 
if we are asking them to take their turn, and thank God for these peace- 
ful homes in the valleys of the mountains. 

Thank the Lord for our leaders, these good men whom God has 
chosen ; there are no better ; they will guide this people safely through 
all the storms of life, may we become endeared to these men, and know 
them; as they truly are, servants of God. Good reading is good seed- 
ing, it has been said ; good counsel is good seeding, and if we can 
bring and keep our boys and girls under a beneficent influence, then 
we have accomplished a successful thing. If not, as we grow older, 
we will find our hearts long to taste what was offered us, but which 
we did not fully appreciate as young men. As one grows in years, 
comes to the years of accountability, the teachings of childhood stand 
more specifically and clearly in one's life ; then the youth sees more 
clearly what he has to do, and if his parents have been faithful, they 
have given him just what is kith and kin to his better nature. 

While all this is going on, while we have a general increase in 
our activities, I wonder if we are watching the home circle care- 
fully. I spoke to one of our special missionaries lately, and I know 
that once he had been just a little obstinate and I said to the brethren : 
"There is the meeting house ; I am not my brother's keeper, if they 
want to go to meeting let them go to meeting." He said to me just 
the other day: "Oh. Brother Young, I feel so sorry for what I once 
said to you. If this missionary work has not done anything else, it 
has converted me beyond the possibility of a doubt, that I am my 
brother's keeper, and that God holds me responsible to discharge to 
the very best of my ability the work that he places in my hands." Our 
work is increasing. We have never had anything else in our stake 
that has accomplished so much good, apparently, with those who were 
wandering, careless, and negligent in reference to their duties, as 
this special missionary work. 

We have a wonderful foundation laid for our faith, and I want 
to say that these wor : - r,f Christ are true: "My sheep know ! my voice, 
and a stranger they will not follow." When I was in the mission 
field I had a wonderful testimony. A Scandinavian brother who came 
to Australia, had a sister who was converted to "Mormonism" and 
before he left, she put in his trunk a Book of Mormon and a Doc- 
trine and Covenants. There were two Lutheran bovs who came to 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Australia who were very bitter. One of them became converted out 
there. He asked the other man, his companion, to read with him, be- 
cause he had got a testimony that the gospel was true. Finally he died, 
and on his deathbed, and to the disgust of his Lutheran minister, he 
said he was a "Mormon," and wanted to be buried as a "Mormon." 
But his last words to his companion were, "Will: you read the Book of 
Mormon, and will you ask the Lord to guide you and direct you, and 
if you do not receive a testimony, as far as I am concerned, I will hold 
you no more responsible. He died; his companion received a testi- 
mony. He did not know for some time that there were any elders in 
Queensland until he had heard from Copenhagen to this effect. He 
came to search for us. The ministers tried to keep him away. Finally, 
when he landed in Brisbane, Aus., he was met by them, and inas- 
much as he was determined to find the elders, they told him where he 
would find the re-organized church. As a last resort they thought, we 
will send him there. He listened to their story. He had never met 
an elder in his life. His name is Peter Christensen, and he is now in 
Idaho ; he had never met an elder, but he listened to their story, and he 
said: "You are not the people that I am looking for;" and he went 
on. He came to our headquarters. I met him; and talked to him, and 
the tears streamed down his cheeks, as he said, "You are the people." 
I thought that a wonderful testimony. 

May the Lord bless us. May we sustain, uphold, love our neigh- 
bors as ourselves, and never be found speaking evil of God's anointed, 
our brethren and sisters, or our fellow men, is my prayer, in Ihe name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER 

{President of the Woodruff Stake of Zion.) 

In listening to the report of President Grant concerning the prog- 
ress of the Church and the increase in attendance at the sacrament 
meetings throughout the Church, and in witnessing the thousands of 
people who have come up to attend this great conference, I have had a 
great deal of joy and satisfaction in my heart, for I can assure you that 
my heart is in the work of the Lord and in the progress of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upon the earth. 

There is no greater evidence of the faith of the people than the 
sacrifices that they make in order that they may enjoy the blessings of 
the Lord and the teachings of the gospel. It is a wonderful thing to 
me to see hundreds of people at this conference who remained in their 
seats from one meeting to another, in order that they might be able 
to hear the servants of the Lord. As a people we have manifested our 



ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER 81 

faith in the Lord and in the gospel of Jesus Christ from the beginning of 
this Church. We have read in the good books, which we call the 
Scriptures, evidences of the faith of the Saints- in former dispensations; 
we have evidence of the faith of Abraham and. those of his dispensa- 
tion, the faith of the apostles of our Lord in their day, in traveling 
throughout the earth, promulgating the principles of eternal life ; but 
it does seem to me that there has been no greater faith evinced by 
any people than that of the Latter-day Saints in our own dispensation. 
The early elders of the Church, and in fact all of the prophets and 
apostles of the Church from its organization, have manifested the same 
great faith and diligence and labors in the cause of the kingdom of 
God as were ever manifested by those of ancient times. Not only these, 
but the Latter-day Saints generally, as referred to by the previous 
speaker regarding his mother, who embraced the gospel in her girl- 
hood days, and therefore was driven from her home. Hundreds of 
people have done the same. The people of this dispensation have been 
gathered "one of a city and two of a family," and have been gathered 
to these valleys of the mountains under greater or less trying circum- 
stances, and they have been faithful and true to the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. This is a great evidence of its divinity today. 

In this conference are assembled today people from all over this 
western country, from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south, 
and I presume that as an organized stake of Zion, we are farthest on 
the east ; and we have also those from the ocean on the west, who 
have spent their means and their time, and gathered up in this great 
concourse of people to worship God and be instructed in the principles of 
eternal life, and to assist in sustaining before God, our eternal Father, 
those who have been called to act as our leaders in this great dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times. It seems to me that this is a wonder- 
ful testimony, for it is a wonderful display of the faith of the Latter- 
day Saints. 

I was thinking, while the former speaker was speaking of his 
mother joining the Church in her childhood days, of my own mother; 
and you will pardon me a moment if I refer to her, as I am perhaps 
better acquainted with her efforts and labors in the kingdom of God, 
and the training she gave me, than any other thing I am acquainted 
with on this earth. She was one of those who left her home, country, 
and everything near and dear to her for the Gospel's sake, and came 
across these barren deserts, and she drew a handcart with a little child 
three years old from the Missouri river to these valleys. She did not 
draw the handcart all the way. Her husband accompanied her part of 
the way, but he laid his body down upon the plains, and left her to 
continue the journey with the little child three years of age, in the 
handcart. She was one of those caught in the snow with a late com- 
pany, in the Sweetwater country, when the teams and brethren came 
to meet them, and saved them all from starvation. And then she came 
to this country as a widow, having left a comfortable home, parents, 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

brothers, sisters, and friends, and all that was near and dear to her 
upon the face of the earth, in a foreign land, and traversed these 
plains, and got caught in that deep snow. I have heard her say many 
times, that when they slept in their tent out in the snow, their camp- 
fire went away down in the deep snow, and they were above the fire. 
And I remember her relating a little incident in connection with the 
death of her husband. He became so fatigued and worn out, that he 
could not travel any further. They took him in a wagon, after the 
brethren and teams had met him ; she had a little piece of candle that she 
had carried in some way. She could not stand to see the breath of life 
leave her husband in the dark, and she not be able to behold his face. 
She prayed to God that this little piece of candle might remain lighted 
as long as life remained in her husband. This prayer was granted to 
her, for with the going out of the candle the breath of life went out from 
her husband. Nine persons were buried' in the same grave, the next 
morning. Now I just refer to this to show you the faith of those 
who have received the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

It seems to me that the Lord is pleased with us who have assembled 
at this conference today. It must be pleasing in the sight of God to 
see us hungering and thirsting after righteousness. I see people try- 
ing to get access to all the buildings here. I know that the time is 
far spent, and there is another speaker, and I do not wish to intrude 
upon his time. I pray God to bless you. Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL F. SMITH 

(President of the Snowflake Stake of Zion.) 

I pray that my heart beats true and that my voice will ring in 
accord with the Spirit of the Lord which is in the hearts of the Latter- 
day Saints assembled here. The mention of Arizona may warm you 
up, and I trust that it will warm up your souls unto salvation. Ari- 
zona is a good land to live in. 

At the suggestion of Elder Talmage, I might say something 
about our stake, if it may not be considered throwing boquets at my- 
self and my people. There is no one present, I believe, who belongs in our 
stake, because there were only five persons who came in our company, 
and I believe they are all in the Tabernacle, and they will therefore 
not hear what I may say, and so perhaps I may be pardoned for say- 
ing something kindly about our own people. I want to say something 
about our climate, though, so that you will not be going away with a 
misapprehension. Snowflake, Arizona, is in (the mountains of that 
land, and therefore is not hot. Our climate is delightful, as much 
so as that of Salt Lake City. The Latter-day Saints there are trying 
their best to keep the commandments of the Lord, as you are. We are 
glad, always, to compare notes with our neighbor stakes. We are de- 
lighted when the bulletin comes down there, and we can compare our 



ELDER SAMUEL F. SMITH S3 

record with others. We very seldom, I am sorry to say, get first rank, 
but we are sure that we never get at the foot of the ranks. In the mat- 
ter of attendance at sacrament meetings, that is very good, above the 
average ; and the best part of it is, our young people attend the sacra- 
ment meetings. This is due largely to the work of the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations and our Church school. The teachers are with the 
young people, and they take them with them. They are all engaged in 
the activities of the Church. They participate in the singing of the 
choir ; in fact, they are the choir, and I am sure you, could you hear, 
would bear witness with me that it is beautiful singing. We have as 
large a percentage as, and I think greater than, the average of the 
Church, of missionaries in the world, preaching the gospel. We have 
a large percentage of our young people in attendance at Church schools, 
much larger than the average. 

Our Mutuals have a full equipment, considering the standard of 
the Church schools, as to the enrollment, and more. The activities 
of the priesthood include nearly all the brethren. Forty-seven of our 
brethren who hold the higher Priesthood have been and are now 
on missions. 

In connection with our Church schools, I want to 1 mention our re- 
ligion class. We conduct an ideal religion class every morning, at 
8:45. The religion class assembles for 15 minutes. The children are 
so interested that usually they are there on time, and for 15 minutes 
they are fed upon gospel truth, for five days of every week. It is a 
most splendid help in the education of our children. It fills a much 
needed want in our educational work. 

I want to say to the credit of our neighbors and friends in 
Arizona, that they are exceedingly liberal, and I have not found any who 
thought it was polluting the land to permit us to teach religion in the 
school houses, outside of school hours. The people have appreciated 
what we were doing, and have permitted us to go forward instead of 
being prohibited from the use of the school house at all, for these pur- 
poses, as has been the case in some places in our country. We have had 
the benefit of our school houses every day for a number of years. We 
have seen splendid results from this. Our boys grow up to know 
the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ as naturally as they grow up to 
know the truth of arithmetic. 

Our people are loyal to the temple work. I believe that, of late 
particularly, the Latter-day Saints in our country have been very much 
led to contemplate temple work. That has come, I am compelled to say, 
very much by the work and efforts of ;he Relief Society; but they are 
doing a splendid work, and as suggested oy the Prophet, they are "pro- 
voking the brethren to good works." Our attendance at priesthood 
meetings is very good, though not so good that I desire to make spe- 
cial mention of it. Our brethren and sisters are devoted to the work 
of the Lord. I think we stand very close to the top, in the matter of 
tithing, and offerings. We are not, perhaps, in a wealthy land, but 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

our people would rank as being wealthy, if judged by their tithing per 
capita. It is a barometer at least of their faith in the gospel. 

I rejoice to be associated with my brethren and sisters, and I re- 
joice to bring to you the good feeling and cheer of the people of our 
land, and to tell you that we are engaged in the same great work, 
and that we are all fully expecting that the kingdom of God will be es- 
tablished. There must have been a tremendous amount of faith in the 
hearts of those men and women associated with the Church in early 
days, when a little handful of people declared that they were connected 
with the Church and kingdom of God, and that it would prevail in the 
world. To the world, and even to us now, it looked presumptuous. 
But when we see this tremendous concourse of people on this block 
and know of the faith of the Latter-day Saints which is manifested by 
the people in all of this mountain country, we can partly see the fulfil- 
ment of the prophecy of the early leaders of the Church, and it does 
not require the same amount of faith, it seems to me. But there is op- 
portunity for the same amount of work, and the purposes of the Lord 
will be accomplished exactly in proportion to the efforts we put forth. 

I pray the Lord that what I have said will tend to strengthen and 
stimulate my brethren and sisters to more earnest and more zealous 
works in helping to bring about the blessings of the Almighty. May 
his blessings be with us, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

I trust that you have gathered the spirit of the remarks made by 
the stake presidents to whom we have listened. Remember, this is 
a conference, not merely an ordinary assembly. You are entitled to 
know what is going on in the different parts of the Church. Those 
who were in this building this morning heard reports from the differ- 
ent mission fields, and now you have heard of some of the peculiar 
conditions prevailing in a few of the many stakes of Zion, four out 
of eighty-five now in existence. We find the same spirit prevailing 
wherever we meet Latter-day Saints. I have found that to be true 
in meeting my fellow worshipers in this country and beyond the seas. 
You can recognize them by their spirit, by their manifestation of 
feeling, by their ways and manners. There is a sort of a family like- 
ness prevailing among Latter-day Saints, and you can readily recog- 
nize that if you meet one who is a stranger to you. There is a spirit 
of earnestness manifested in the spirit of the Latter-day Saints. There 
is a spirit of awakening at this time, as T mentioned at the beginning 
of our meeting, and the remarks of my brethren have borne me out. 
But, thank the Lord, his Spirit is striving earnestly with the people. 
But the power of evil is likewise aroused, and is also active among 
the people. Satan knows how little time is left before that day which 
is spoken of as being both great and blessed, and likewise terrible, 
which shall characterize the Coming of the Lord in his glory to take 



ELDER SAMUEL ECKERSLEY 85 

his place as ruler of this earth. With him shall come concourses of 
angels, the blessed ones, and many upon the earth at that time shall 
meet him and his goodly company, and be numbered among them. 
Verily, that day is near at hand. The evil one knows it, and knows 
his time is short, and therefore, amidst our rejoicing over the improve- 
ment that is manifest among the Latter-day Saints, we must beware 
of the evil powers that are at work, that we may not be led away, 
that our children may not be led away, but that they may be firm 
and true to the faith which the Lord has implanted in their hearts — 
the faith of their fathers. 

I am sure that all will join me in the feeling of appreciation, 
which I express for all, to the choir of LeGrand ward for the music 
that has been rendered this afternoon. 

The choir sang an anthem, "Hark, hark, my soul." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder William Robinson. 



FOURTH OVERFLOW MEETING 

A fourth overflow meeting was held outdoors, near the Bureau of 
Information, Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, April 3, 1921. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard, of the Council of the Twelve, presided. 

Music was furnished by the congregation, Elder Clare Reid of the 
L. D. S. School of Music, accompanist. The congregation sang, "High 
on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Oscar Winkler. 

The congregation sang, "Come, let us anew our journey pursue." 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY 

{President of the Wayne Stake.) 

The multitude of people assembled upon this Temple Block today 
is an evidence of the continued growth of the work of the Lord in the 
earth, and of the faith of the membership of the Church. The promise 
made to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the very commencement of the 
work that he was called by the Lord to establish in the latter clays, was 
that notwithstanding the persecution and the opposition that should be 
waged against the cause that he was called to advocate in the world, 
the work would survive ; that the Church to be established or set 
up, and the gospel of the Kingdom that should be preached in the 
world as a witness before the coming of the Messiah, should never be 
overcome, that the Church to be established should never be given 
to another people. When we think of the combined opposition of 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the world to the work that was commenced by the Prophet, and think 
that notwithstanding all the trials and vicissitudes through which the 
Saints passed in their early pilgrimage in the Church, notwithstanding 
the opposition of the world, today our eyes witness upon this 
Temple Block thousands of people, who have assembled from the re- 
motest parts of this state, from surrounding states,- and have gathered 
here to worship the Lord, in evidence that there is still faith in their 
hearts, and that this work will continue, it is comforting, my brethren 
and sisters, to know that God has given this promise that if we are 
faithful in the keeping of his commandments, all things that have 
been promised and foretold by the) prophets concerning the things that 
should happen in the latter days will be fulfilled. 

I rejoice with you this afternoon to be present at this confer- 
ence, to associate with the leaders of the Church, to hear the living 
and burning testimony of the prophets and the apostles of the Latter- 
day Saints, to mingle with the men and women who have received 
the gospel and whose hearts are filled with faith and whose works 
testify of their integrity and of their devotion. 

I rejoice that the principles of the gospel are such that by yield- 
ing obedience thereto, men may obtain for themselves a living testi- 
mony of the divinity of the work which they espouse. The promise 
of Jesus is being fulfilled just as literally today as in the day when 
he made the promise to the people in Jerusalem, that if any man would 
obey the doctrine that he taught, if any man would do the will of God, 
he should know of the doctrine, whether it was of God, or 1 whether he 
spoke of himself. And so today, the person who receives the gospel 
in a good and honest heart, who complies with its precepts, obtains that 
living testimony, and that leads to good works. 

I recall that on one occasion the Prophet Joseph was asked con- 
cerning the secret of his success as a leader among the people, in hold- 
ing them together, and his reply was that he taught the people, cor- 
rect principles, and, having been taught correct principles, they govern- 
ed themselves. This is the secret of the growth of the work of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. This is the secret of the faith, the unity, and the prog- 
ress that is being made in the Church of Christ. This is not a work 
of coercion or of compulsion. The words of the poet are very applica- 
ble in the doctrines that are taught by the Latter-day Saints. God will 
not coerce any human mind : 

Know this, that ev'ry soul as free, 

To choose his life and what he'll be; 
For this eternal truth is given, 

That God will force n,o man to heaven. 

He'll call, persuade, direct aright, 
And bless with wisdom, love and light; 

In nameless ways be good and kind, 
But never force the human mind. 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY 87 

Freedom and reason makes us men, 

Take these away, what are we then? 
Mere animals, and just as well 

The beasts may think of heaven or hell. 

And thus when the elders go forth into the world proclaiming this 
message of truth, they plead with the people to investigate, to search 
the Scriptures, for in them is the truth. In them, by obedience to the 
principles that they teach, there is eternal life. There is no coercion, 
there is no attempt to frighten the people, as it were, into a belief in 
the principles of the doctrines of the Redeemer ; but it is a doctrine of 
love, a doctrine of persuasion, leaving to mankind their agency, the 
power to choose ; and so we receive the gospel and become members 
of the Church. That same principle applies throughout our lives. We 
may, by obedience to the principles of the gospel, one by one, improve 
our lives, be of greater service to mankind ; but there is never at any 
time an attempt to force the observance of any law that God has 
given for the salvation of his children. 

I rejoice in the freedom and in the liberty of the gospel. I re- 
joice in the truth as it has been revealed and restored. I rejoice in 
the knowledge that if men do the will of God, they for themselves shall 
know of its truth, and whether it be of God or whether men speak of 
themselves. I feel, brethren and sisters, this afternoon, that we have 
much to be grateful for as members of the Church of Christ; and I 
pray that we may be inclined to take advantage of the opportunities 
that are within our reach to grow in faith, and knowledge, and grow 
in the love and fellowship of our Father in heaven, and in the fellow- 
ship and love of all good people, that we may foe faithful and true to 
the mission that has been entrusted to us — not only to seek to save 
ourselves and our own immediate families and kin, but that we may 
be willing to make sacrifice in the interest of mankind, that we may be 
willing, as servants commissioned of the Lord, to go forth and declare 
his truth and preach the gospel as we may be inspired, as we are called, 
from time to time. That the blessing of the Lord may continue with 
us, and that we may manifest our gratitude to him for the blessings 
that we enjoy in devotion to his service, I humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER E. FRANK BIRCH 

(President of the Tintic Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters. It is with a feeling of timidity and 
weakness that I try to speak to you this afternoon, but with the help 
of our Father in heaven, I may be able to say something edifying. 

I endorse heartily the remarks of the former speaker; they ex- 
press my feelings exactly. I have felt today a renewal of my testi- 
mony that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true ; 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

that this great work, the Church of God, has been established never 
again to be taken from the earth or given to another people. 

I was greatly impressed this morning, as I am this afternoon, with 
the large attendance at this conference, and with the realization of the 
power and strength of our Church organization today. I thought of 
the First Presidency, the Twelve Apostles, and the different officers 
and organizations of the Church today, with a realization of the power 
and strength they are in the earth. 

I thought, if we could assume that the Church, as we have it, 
were man-made, it would still be the most powerful organization in 
the world today. Assuming that the Master were not the organizer 
or the head, that it were a man-made institution, even then, consider 
its leadership. President Grant, a wonderful leader, a man of great 
experience, who has made mistakes in life, perhaps, because he has 
done things, but he is a man who has profited by his mistakes, and 
a mighty man in Israel today! Consider his counselors, President 
Penrose, a man of great experience, a practical man, a man who has 
shared the joys and the sorrows of the people for many years ; and 
then President Ivins, a practical man, a success in life, both temporally 
and spiritually — an agriculturist, a man educated in many of the 
sciences of life — when I think of these three great leaders, for my 
part, under any condition, I would be willing to trust the Church. 
Then, consider their associates, the members of the Council of 
Twelve, men who lead in the world of affairs, in science, as statesmen, 
as agriculturists, as educators — I have been impressed all day that 
for my part, I am willing to trust the Church in their care. 

When we further consider that our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, according to our knowledge and testimony, is at the head, that 
he is sanctioning and inspiring, with his holy Spirit, their actions, I 
am again perfectly satisfied and content to trust the affairs of 'this 
Church in their hands. To me, a man or a woman who would as- 
sume to dictate, who would assume to set them right, would be ridicu- 
lous, would appear insignificant. Yet, we have such characters in 
the Church today, who attempt to do that, and ask God Almighty to 
inspire them, that they may dictate to the leaders of our Church. I 
say we have them, but you business men, you men of affairs, will 
agree with me when I say that no organization can exist and flourish 
if subordinate officers, lay members, dictate to the ruling authority. 
I am a man in charge of mines, superintendents and foremen, and I 
have learned this, that when a shift boss undertakes to pass over the 
head of his foreman to the management of the mine, he is out of 
order, the organization is immediately in confusion. I have also 
learned that when men holding the high positions undertake to dic- 
tate over the heads of their superintendents, their subordinate officers, 
again the organization is in confusion. So I say that the Church is 
built on natural principles, business principles; and no man should 



ELDER E. FRANK BIRCH 39 

dictate to those in higher authority, nor pass over the heads of those 
who are their immediate superiors. 

I have said before, we have people in the Church who undertake 
to do this, and I believe when they do, there is confusion. We get, 
as people say, our wires crossed ; we get the wrong information ; we 
get "in wrong;" we are understood wrong; and there is confusion. 
I know of people, and have had recent experiences with people, who 
have thought that they could go into the solitude of the deserts and 
pray unto God to help them set the Church right ; who have thought 
that, through fasting and prayer, they could set the Church in order, 
that they could dictate. Much has been said informing us that every 
member of the Church should have a testimony of his own, every 
man stand on his own foundation, that every man should receive in- 
spiration to the extent that he will have a living testimony that the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is true. Men have misinterpreted that. They 
have taken unto themselves the thought that they must receive di- 
rections, revelations, from the higher authority, even from the 
Master, as to the dictation of his affairs on earth. And they have 
done wrong. They have caused confusion, and they have not ac- 
complished what they expected to accomplish. As I say, they have 
undertaken to do this, and so misinterpreting the advice that has 
been given to us that we must rest on our own testimony. As I un- 
derstand it, every man and woman is entitled to inspiration from God 
Almighty for his own welfare, or the welfare of the thing that he 
may immediately control — I would say a father in his home is en- 
titled to inspiration to rear his family, the President of a Mutual 
Improvement Association is entitled to inspiration to lead his associa- 
tion. But they must follow the standards that have been set up by the 
General Authorities! 

The Prophet Joseph told us that God never reveals anything that 
is already made plain and revealed. Therefore we have plenty, and 
we may go to our superior authorities to receive the same. Men 
have misunderstood things and have taken it that they themselves 
shall receive revelation from God Almighty to lead the affairs of this 
Church; and when they do this, when they fast and when they pray, 
and when they insist on revelations, contrary to that which is already 
revealed, the Spirit of the Lord forsakes them and the devil crosses 
them with his wires. I have had recent experience with men who 
were deceived and who thought they were receiving inspiration from 
Almighty God, when they were obtaining it from an evil source. These 
men received "revelations" that they were to sacrifice their dear 
wives, and take other person's wives — somebody else was to sacrifice 
theirs to them! This is the way the devil does things. He puts men 
upon pedestals, and when he gets them there, he kicks them out from 
under them, and then they lose the companionship of our Father in 
heaven and gain the friendship of the devil. 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

I do not feel to speak any longer; but never before in my life 
have I had more confidence that God has instituted his Church in 
the earth, and that we can feel at ease that it is entrusted in good 
hands, and in a perfect organization. My prayer is that we will live 
according to the inspiration given to us from the authorities of the 
Church and to ourselves from the Spirit of God for our own direction, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS 

(President of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion.) 

It seems a long time since 1 undertook to speak on the gospel, 
in the open air. I remember doing so some years ago on the streets 
of London, as well as in Brooklyn. Those undertakings were some- 
what different than this. One very great difference is in the matter 
of furnishing the music. In those exciting experiences, I attempted 
to do the singing and received no assistance from the listeners. They 
came to see what was, the occasion for such a strange and distressing 
noise. I ceased my musical efforts at the first stopping place, and 
started to preach :to them. On this occasion the audience does the 
singing and, by comparison, I am a very grateful and happy listener. 

Another difference was the probability of my being driven from 
the streets, if things didn't go smoothly. Here there is small prob- 
ability of mob violence unless, perchance, one speaks unsufferably 
long, in which case no one can tell what might happen. 

In looking over this great throng of people, assembled as they 
are upon this historical square, one is impressed with the vast area 
from which representatives composing this audience have come. I 
see faces that are familiar to me in the remote quarters of the inter- 
mountain country. There are also many faces of those who live close 
in. This might well be called a "General Conference" because every 
section of the country and every organization of ithe Church is rep- 
resented in the Conference proceedings. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as an organiza- 
tion, is just ninety-one years old this year. Consider the accomplish- 
ments during that period of time and pay full attention to the obsta- 
cles and handicaps that have all the way beset the Latter-day Saints, 
and you will recognize a demonstration of the power of faith unsur- 
passed in history. The achievements! of this people in the field of so- 
cial and industrial, as well as religious, progress are well recognized 
by men of clear vision and true appreciation for the things of real 
value to humanity. These men, some of whom stand high in the 
affairs of the nation, as well as in the world of education and social 
welfare work, are frankly expressing their admiration for the ac- 
complishments of the Latter-day Saints. This people is looked upon 
as a very essential element in our national life, and in some respects 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS 91 

as leaders in the most praiseworthy of undertakings. For one, I will 
admit all these good things which are attributed to us. 

We are conspicuously a people who do things. We may have 
done some things that were peculiar and not understandable to the 
outsider. We may have done some foolish things in the many vicis- 
situdes through which we have passed. Aside from these trivial and 
inconsequential things, we have done really big things in the earth 
during the past one hundred years. The first great accomplishment 
in our history, in Western America, is that of coming here and mak- 
ing a "go" of it in this once undesirable country. That a mighty 
empire should arise in the vales of the Rocky mountains, teeming to- 
day with their millions of people and bounteous crops and products, 
where three-quarters of a century ago a desolate wilderness held 
sway, is an achievement well-nigh bordering on the marvelous. To 
have been the means of such an accomplishment is glory enough 
for any people. This is a very great distinction won by the Latter- 
day Saints. And time will only throw this achievement out in 
more imposing boldness as \ distance and opportunity for comparison 
are given by the improved perspective. 

This is another instance of great things being accomplished under 
the stress and strain of a tragic necessity. Men seldom do very 
great things voluntarily. Circumstances sometimes compel '.them to 
action and the impossible is often accomplished. Had not our neigh- 
bors in Missouri and Illinois made life intolerable to us we would 
have remained among them to this day. Had not the sharp and in- 
cisive argument of thebayonet and the musket been resorted to this 
great western country would have been peopled by others, and in a 
very different manner than that which has occured. ) "We came 
here willingly because we had to," said one naive pioneer, and I may 
add, we remained jhere because there was no other place for us to go 
to. Our erstwhile "enemies" were rapidly migrating to the Pacific, 
and settlement along the coast would have me^nt continued con- 
flict. So we remained here, because we had to. In so doing we 
worked out our own destiny, and, in my candid judgment, made the 
greatest single contribution to our national wealth and well-being it 
will be the destiny of any other people, to make. For an event that 
compares in importance to humanity and this nation, we shall have 
to go back to the Pilgrims and the Puritans of three centuries ago. 
Their motives and service to mankind are in many respects very sim- 
ilar, to those of the "Mormon" pioneers. The latter, however, saw 
the fruits of their sacrificing efforts because they accomplished more 
in a shorter period of time. 

This morning we heard President Grant express his supreme 
pleasure over the cordial and hearty reception given him at Kansas 
City, while there last December, addressing a prominent and influ- 
ential club of busines men who had invited him, as the head of the 
"Mormon" Church to become their guest at a banquet and recep- 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

tion. He was asked to speak on the accomplishments of the "Mor- 
mon" people. In doing so, he recounted the events which led to the 
expulsion of our people from the state in which he was_ then ad- 
dressing a great business organization. He told of the industrial, 
social, educational and religious attainments of our people. His re- 
marks were so well and favorably received by the four hundred 
leading business men who composed the club, that many words of 
sincere commendation were expressed for him and his people.^ He 
was strongly urged to come again and address them on another oc- 
casion. 

This welcome reception was in such remarkable contrast with the 
feelings manifest toward the Latter-day Saints some seventy-five 
years ago that President Grant was profoundly impressed with the 
change of attitude toward us. While we need not solace ourselves 
in the comforting thought that the. world at large loves us, it is high- 
ly gratifying to know that people of dignified positions in the coun- 
try have the vision to see our good works and the candor to admit 
it. If they do not glorify God for these things, we do with all our 
souls. It was the Savior who said to his disciples : "Let your light 
so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify 
your Father which is in heaven." . In the light of these attainments, 
may we not all be profoundly grateful that the Lord has blessed our 
efforts and is beginning to magnify us before the world? 

Greater than the subduing of the desert and the building of a 
mighty empire, is the fact that this people has been true to God and 
has kept his commandments with remarkable fidelity. I wonder if 
the spirit of optimism is running away with me when I think I see 
in these events the prophecy, in course of fulfilment, wherein it 
was foretold that Zion would be as a light set upon a hilltop that 
could not be hidden. I have in mind the special work of the Lord 
and his Church, not the great land of America and its mission and 
glorious destiny. Perhaps the Latter-day Saints are already moving 
toward their place in the world. Their place is in the front ranks of 
humanity, or I have mistaken the destiny of this thing called "Mor- 
monism." 

It required greater time for the world to arrive at a true ap- 
preciation of the Lord and his work in a 'former dispensation than 
has elapsed since he set up his Church in this dispensation. When 
Jesus came to earth he was rejected and despised of men. His dis- 
ciples were put to death with pagan hate and fury. Generations 
passed and the Lord was more generally understood. Then he be- 
came enshrined in the hearts of humanity. His disciples were con- 
sumed by the devouring flames of martyrdom, and torn limb from 
limb by wild beasts in the amphitheatres of ancient Rome and 
Ephesus. Yet a few centuries run their course, and these same fol- 
lowers of their crucified Lord, are denominated Saints, and shrines 
and sacred temples are hallowed by their names, History is full of 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS 93 

such anolmalies and paradoxical reversals of sentiment. Such things 
occurred with respect to the Former-day Saints. It will be so with 
respect to the Latter-day Saints. Diid not Josiah Quincy make that 
very prediction in the year 1844, with respect to' the future position 
of Joseph Smith in History? Read his words: 

"It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for the use 
of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this: What 
historical American of the Nineteenth century has exerted the most power- 
ful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means 
impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: lo- 
seph Smith, the 'Mormon' Prophet. And the reply, absurd as it doubt- 
less seems to most men now living, may be an obvious common-place to 
their descendants. History abounds in surprises and paradoxes quite as 
startling as this. The man who established a religion in this age of free de- 
bate, who was and is accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary 
-of the Most High — such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by 
pelting his memory with unsavory epithets." 

Time will work just such changes as here suggested. It was 
exactly so with respect to the discovery of America. One historian 
has very cleverly put it thus : "America was never sought, but stum- 
bled upon ; that when found it was not wanted ; that much of its ex- 
ploration was due to a persistent effort to find a way around it." To- 
day it is the hope of the world. 

History again repeated itself with respect to this Rocky Moun- 
tain region. No less authorities than Daniel Webster, and Senator 
Dickerson of New Jersey, placed so low an appraisement on this 
whole region of country that the one would not vote one cent from 
the public treasury to place the Pacific Coast one inch nearer to 
Boston ; and the other said the great northwest would never be ad- 
mitted into the Union because of its remoteness from the seat of 
government. To one it was the worthless wilderness of the west, to 
the other it was damned by distance. Today the world may see what 
misconceptions men had on the matter. And precisely in the same 
manner have these two great movements that of the Pilgrims and 
that of the "Mormon" pioneers been underestimated. When the 
Pilgrims and the Puritans left the shores of Europe in quest of a 
land where religious and political freedom might be enjoyed by them 
and their children after them, a bigotted and stupidly blind and self- 
satisfied world said, "good riddance for bad rubbish." So was it 
in the states of Missouri and Illinois, with respect to the "Mormon" 
people. About the only difference was that the thumb-screw and 
the rack were substituted with the violence of mobs and the orders 
of extermination issued by governors. Now the Pilgrims are held in 
veneration, and Americans are proud to trace their descent from 
those European outcasts of three centuries ago. With the steady 
movement of the "Mormon" people to their place in the world what 
will be the verdict of, perhaps, the very next generation? My faith

is that vindication will completely come to them if they hold fast to 
their professions and ideals. 

Already the very states that expatriated our first leaders have 
evinced a desire to have us return to those commonwealths and con- 
tribute to their upbuilding. The Latter-day Saints., have proved them- 
selves to be very successful empire builders. That great quality grows 
out of their belief in the family and the home, the sacred trinity of 
civilization — the father, mother and child. They, like the Pilgrims 
and Puritans, were home-builders. All things come from the home. 
That was the great factor of success in both colonizations, those of 
1620 and those of 1847. 

I well remember sitting in the east end of the Tabernacle gal- 
lery with the late Elbert Hubbard — he of the Philistine and East 
Aurora fame. He said, "Brother Morris, you people beat Denver, 
didn't you?" A little slow to grasp the philosophy of his observa- 
tion, I replied, "No, Denver has nearly twice our population." Then 
came his answer to which I quickly assented : "They borrowed their 
wealth, you dug it out of the ground." Man, soil, labor — the agencies 
of creation. Freedom and the home are the agencies of human prog- 
ress. A steadfast devotion to these same principles, along with in- 
dustry, education, and true religion, are certain to lift a people to an 
exalted place in the world. And on the other hand that nation or 
people that turns against these things, the home, labor, education, re- 
ligion, and human liberty, will rapidly sink into an ignominious 
oblivion. This great truth, affirmed a thousand times in history, is 
the real philosophy of history, as I see it. Where is Egypt? Baby- 
lon? Nineveh? Greece and Rome? Where is ancient Israel? A 
melancholy whisper from the dust. The winds of time have blown 
them all away. Because the -agencies of their progress and eleva- 
tion to splendor and glory were thrown away at the acme of their 
achievements. What a tragedy is the death of a nation. Yet, that 
the race might survive, these tottering empires, full ripe to destruc- 
tion, must crumble into dust. I am reminded of the lines of Byron : 

There is the moral of all human tales; 

'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past. 
First Freedom and then Glory — when that fails, 

Wealth, vice, corruption — barbarism at last. 

And History, with all her volumes vast, 
Hath but one page. 

May not a people some day learn these great truths from history 
and avoid the pit-falls that have completely engulfed and swallowed 
up all there was of national g'lory in the past? May not some nation 
ultimately learn the lesson of life and perpetuity in the earth? These 
questions lie close to the hearts of the Latter-day Sains because of a 
belief they have in their destiny and enduring mission in the earth. 
They believe they represent the Kingdom of God on earth, which 
Kingdom "is never to be thrown down or given to another people." 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS 95 

Other peoples have held similar views with respect to their high 
destiny. The ancient Jews were fondly looking forward to the 
coming of their Messiah. They believed that his coming meant the 
elevation of their race to world supremacy. But when he; did humbly 
come they knew him not. Even the gentile governor evinced more 
faith in him than did they. For Pilate pleaded his cause against the 
Jews themselves. Said he, "Whom will ye that I release unto you, 
ilarabas or Jesus?'' And they yielded to the demands of the rabble 
and cried, "Release unto us Barabas! As for Jesus, crucify, him, 
crucify him:!" Pilate remonstrated with them, saying, "What evil 
has he done ?'" But they cried the more, "Let him be crucified !" 
Then the Pagan magistrate, or governor, said, "I am innocent of the 
blood of this just man." And the answer came back, "Let his blood 
be upon us, and our children after us, release unto us Barabas!" So 
sealed they their doom. History has but one page for Judah from 
then till now. "The wandering Jew." A man without a country; a 
hiss and a by-word among men. Jewish blood has drenched the soil 
of every European and Asiatic country during the two-thousand in- 
tervening years. 

The Jews are still in darkness with respect to their .Messiah. His 
message was turned to the Gentile nations and blindnes was given to 
Judah for a season. "The last shall be first and the first shall be 
last." Centuries past, and the Gentle nations perceived the appeal 
of his message and turned to him. Then as Europe emerged from 
the darkness of the "night time in history" great churches arose 
in the earth and built temples for his worship. Empires are over- 
thrown, in his name ; continents are reclaimed from; heathenism for 
his glory ; and for generations he has been held in his place as the 
Savior and Redeemer of men. Time brought about the change. Truth 
and principle won the inevitable victory. It must always be so-. It 
will be so in the future. The conquest of truth is eternal. He 
who was rejected and despised of men becomes the chief corner 
stone. Ultimately every knee shall bow and every tongue voluntarily 
confess the Kingship and Messiaship of the Man of Sorrows, who 
was crucified between two thieves on Golgotha's hill. But before 
that day shall come the Jews will be gathered in unbelief. In a most 
remarkable manner that gathering has already commenced, as one 
of the outcomes of the great war. Jerusalem is being redeemed 
from the mercilessness of Gentile rule under the unspeakable Turk, 
whose rule has well-nigh been supreme and continuous for a thous- 
and years. The gates of the Ancient City are now thrown wide open 
to the children of the patriarchs of old, and a remarkable migration 
has already set in for that place. The City of David will be re- 
stored to beauty, and the country will again flow as with milk and 
honey. Then will the gospel be taken to them, and a partial con- 
version, at least, will be brought about as they cry out, "Blessed is he 
that cometh in the name of the Lord." Not until that conversion is 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

brought about will they "look upon Him whom they have pierced," 
and ask, "What are these wounds in thine hands?" To which the 
answer shall be, "These are the wounds I received in the house of 
my friends ; I came to my own, and they received me not." Their 
poignant anguish will then draw forth his divine compassion and he 
will be their God and they will be his people. But, O what a price 
shall they have paid for their perversity and unbelief. 

The history of Israel is, in a measure, the history of all other 
races. But shall there not ultimately he an exception to the rule? In 
the light of history, there is little ground for basing such a hope, we 
admit. But the word of the Lord has been spoken concerning his 
people and his purposes. If the end is attained, it will be by the 
simple means of virtue, obedience, industry, and human service of 
the highest order. The Lord has assured the salvation of the earth at 
his coming, providing the hearts of the children of men shall be 
turned to the eternal welfare of their fellows, both 'those who have 
gone before and those who are to come, when men shall seek the well 
being of their fellows and bury selfishness. But the thing of vital 
interest to us is, how shall we avert the disasters that have been the 
fate of other people? The lesson seems to be obvious. Our people 
were taken through a school of experience that ought to make the 
lesson a lasting one. It has been written in blood and tears and in 
sacrifice and patience. The school of experience is calculated to make 
men strong and powerful to resist. 

Emerson set forth this doctrine perfectly in the four lines 
which opens his essay on Self Trust. They are : 

"Cast the bantling on the rocks, 

Suckle him with she wolf's teat; 
Wintered with the hawk and fox, 

Power and speed be hands and feet." 

Men grow strong and powerful as they learn to do things for 
themselves. The administration at Washington seemed 5 cold and 
unsympathetic in its answers to our appeal for help when it said, 
"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you." Yet that is 
similar to the attitude of the Creator, out on the border of time, 
when he drove man from the Garden of Eden and seti him to work in 
the spirit of self reliance and conquest. The fiat of Eden, "Go forth 
and multiply and replenish the earth, conquer it, and subdue it rind 
have dominion," as well as the sentence which soon followed it, vis: 
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," seemed very 
severe and harsh. Time and accomplishment have taught men that 
those were kind words, in the light of the blessings which came from 
the results of their being chosen by the Deity for the training of the 
human race in the beginning. And that there might be no retreat 
back into Eden's Elysian bowers, a Cherubim, with flaming sword, 
was placed at the Gates of Paradise. So, God apparently intended 
that we should he outside of Paradise. None of us will doubt the 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS 97 

successfulness of the Deity, in that intention, and in a wholesome 
confession we will also admit that to the healthy, virile man, con- 
ditions subsequent to Eden were far better for man than Eden it- 
self. His progress was all attained on this side of Paradise. 

These are the things which account for the greatness of the 
Pioneers. But shall wealth, and luxury, and self-indulgenence ef- 
feminize their descendants who have, in a large measure, been de- 
prived of that kind of education? Already there are disquieting symp- 
toms manifest in the present generation. To be like the rest of the 
world would be to the Latter-day Saints a lowering of their stand- 
ards and a repudiation of their ideals. Young men and young women 
of "Mormondom" we have been taught the principles of Everlasting 
Truth. And they will stand for ever. If we wish to stand likewise, 
we must grapple to our souls these true principles. They are, faith 
in God, and obedience to the gospel. No amount of learning, or phil- 
osophy, can take their place. Constant repentance from sin, and a 
successful forsaking of sin. Can a man take fire to his bosom and 
not be burned? The youth of today who takes a compromising view 
on the matter of chastity is playing with fire. Nothing but the prov- 
idences of God will save him from the burning. We must cherish 
virtue as dearer than life, or we are not true to the faith of our 
fathers. We cannot retain that beautiful, Christian spirit, which is 
strength unto victory, if we cease to be a praying people — a people 
who pray always, in public and in private. "Prayer is the Christian's 
vital breath." I have heard groups of boys, and girls of our faith con- 
fess their abandonment of some of these Christian virtues which are 
so essential to their happiness here and hereafter. 

We should hold to the sanctity of the marriage relationship and 
not shun the responsibilities of parenthood. In this sacred institu- 
tion, ordained of God and honorable withal, lies the power of life 
and death to the individual, as well as to the race. Its preservation, 
in unsullied purity, is the supreme duty of every generation. Lives of 
self-Ttstir'aint, and temperance in all things are not only true as the 
word of God to us, but the fate of races proclaims them to be 
everlastingly safe. Service for others is the highest evidence of the 
love of God. What a fine tribute was paid to our people this morn- 
ing in the statement by President Grant that we annually coin- 
tribute by sacrifice, and actual expenditure, two million dollars in 
carrying the gospel message to the world. There is real altruism. The 
preaching of the word to the world is a great duty resting upon us, 
but a still greater duty is to inculcate the principles of the Faith in 
the lives and characters of our children. I am convinced there is 
occasion for concern in this regard. It is my strong conviction that 
the outlines for every class, studying the gospel in the several 
organizations of the Church, should pay attention to the principles 
of our faith in every lesson recital. I find that children, at the time of 
baptism, are in many instances, entirely uninstructed in the mean- 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ing and sacredness of that holy ordinance. These are some of the 
disquieting symptoms that my work in the Church is constantly 
bringing to my attention. I throw out these suggestions in the hope 
that the family and the priesthood and the auxiliary organizations of 
the Church will see to it that the Savior's parting injunction to Peter 
may be carried out in this dispensation, viz: "Feed my lambs." 

May the Lord God of our fathers keep us in his good favor, and 
may we, through steadfast devotion to him, move steadily on to our 
place in the world, not that we may glorify ourselves, but do greater 
service to mankind, and glorify our Father who is in heaven. In 
Jesus' holy n?me I ask it. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Surely time has been kind to the Latter-day Saints. I have be- 
lieved always that time is on the side of right and truth ; and those 
who hold the truth, though misunderstood, can rest contented that 
time will vindicate them. 

I remember an experience in preaching to the public in the open, 

THE KEOKUK DAM FORETOLD BY JOSEPH THE PROPHET. 

I remember an experience in preaching to the public in the open, 
when my soul was thrilled with the evidence that God was vindicating 
his work. It was during the course of some of my early missionary ex- 
periences, I was permitted to visit Nauvoo, Illinois. It was on the oc- 
casion when there was a gathering of the Military Tract Press Associa- 
tion, being the newspaper men of the western part of the state of Illi- 
nois, who met in Nauvoo. They were wearing a badge, upon which was 
a cut of the Nauvoo Temple, and a description of that house. 

I listened to a paper read by one of the editors. He traced the 
gathering of the Latter-day Saints to Nauvoo, from other sections, told 
of the rise of the work in that city, the building of the city until it 
became a city of considerable note, there being twenty thousand people 
in the city of Nauvoo when Chicago, on the north, was but a village, 
and St. Louis, on the south, a trading post ; and Nauvoo, he said, might 
have been the great city of the Middle West if the "Mormons" had been 
allowed to remain there. He told of the prophet's plan to cut a canal 
across the horseshoe bend of the river and make the lower portion of 
that city into a splendid commercial center, with the residences and 
public buildings upon the hill, and the farms extending onto the prairies 
around it. He also called attention to the prophet's project in a peti- 
tion which he sent to Congress, asking that Congress should erect a 
dam at Keokuk, Iowa, to back up the waters of the Mississippi river 
over what was known as the Rapids, and that by reason of the construc- 
tion of the dam, greater water power would be developed, and locks 
could be installed that would enable boats to go over the rapids. The 
prophet estimated, in his petition to Congress, that the dam would cost 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 99 

approximately $7,000,000. And then the gentleman called attention to 
the recent completion of the dam at the identical site where the prophet 
forecast it. And later I had the privilege of going down and inspecting 
the dam, wonderfully built, at the very place, for the purpose of furnish- 
ing the locks that would lift the boats up into the higher water to pass 
over the rapids. And tremendous electric power, power which the 
prophet could only have forecast by inspiration, was there developed 
and disseminated in a radius of 400 miles away from that great power 
site that now is established in connection with the dam at Keokuk — 
and, strange to say, also, the cost of construction was but slightly in 
excess of $7,000,000. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS DRIVEN FROM NAUVOO. 

After reciting the prospects that were before early Nauvoo, he 
then told of the prejudices that drove the "Mormons" from that dis- 
trict, and that after they were driven away, those who came in pos- 
session of their property did not esteem it of sufficient value to protect 
the central building, Nauvoo Temple, and through their vandalism, they 
set fire to it. ' 

But I thought I saw the hand of the Lord in this, and how that he 
has always made the wrath of man serve him. I felt grateful in my 
heart that the Nauvoo temple was destroyed, for, unlike its predecessor, 
the Kirtland temple, it was built for the sacred ordinances of the work 
of the house of God, while the Kirtland temple was built as a place 
where these sacred things might be revealed. There was no vestige of 
any of the interior of the Nauvoo temple left. But, he said, while the 
blackened walls of the building yet stood, steamboats stopped half 
a day at the wharf to allow passengers to go up and view the ruins. 
He remarked that if the building had been preserved, it would have 
been of great value to that city. He then called attention to the fact 
that the city had gone down in numbers from its once beautiful 
Nauvoo of 20,000 people to 1,200 souls, and not a railroad yet. 

THEIR JOURNEY WEST TWO SCENES COMPARED. 

And then he traced the Latter-day Saints across the prairies of 
Iowa into the fastnesses of these mountains, where, he said, wherever 
they went, the favor of God seemed to go with them. They made 
the wilderness to blossom as the rose ; and while their enemies thought 
they would perish in the barren, desolate wilderness, or be destroyed 
by savages or wild beasts, yet they survived and prospered and 
flourished. 

Then he said, when we look at these two scenes, surely we are forced 
to conclude that there was grave doubt as to whether God wanted the 
"Mormons" driven away. "If he did want them driven away," he 
observed, "why doesn't he give today's Nauvoo a broader hint that it 
was all right. Maybe," said he, "God loved the 'Mormons' better than 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

he does bigots and vandals." I heard that statement in the city of 
Nauvoo; and in conversation with many of these gentlemen, they 
said that the only hope of that country was to have the "Mormons" 
return again, and there wasn't anything in the way of our coming back ; 
and in my heart, I am sure I express the sentiment of President Grant 
and the other brethren who have referred to our history and expe- 
riences in those states that we have no feeling of animosity nor bitter- 
ness in our souls. We pity them, we sorrow for their mistakes, and 
they today are the losers, while, as Elder Morris has said, we have 
profited by their action. 

DECLARING THE GOSPEL IN THE ILLINOIS STATE CAPITOL. 

I remember going from Nauvoo over to the capitol of the state, 
Springfield, Illinois, and holding a conference of missionaries from 
northern and southern Illinois. And I remember that two of us, myself 
and companion, who had charge of these two districts, applied to the 
governor of the state. It was considerable nerve, I will grant you ; 
but in my youth I was zealous and was willing to ask for anything — 
and we had the nerve to ask the governor of the state of Illinois to give 
us the State Capitol building in which to hold a "Mormon" conference. 
Well, he happily surprised us by granting us the privilege, and that 
without a dollar's cost to us. We were permitted to use the Hall of 
Representatives; and before large numbers of people, who filled 
that hall, we discoursed upon the principles of the glorious, restored gos- 
pel and bore witness and testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, and that the Book of Mormon was true. My soul was thrilled, 
because, I remember, as I looked about that place and saw on the one 
side of the rostrum a life-sized portrait, full length, of Abraham Lin- 
coln and on the' other side a life-sized portrait of Stephen A. Douglas, 
I could not help but wonder in my soul, What does Stephen think about 
it now? For it was in this identical place that Stephen A. Douglas 
delivered his address on the "Mormon" question, while running for the 
Presidency of the nation, and proposed that if elected he would apply 
the knife to this pestiferous cancer "Mormonism," which was a growth 
upon the body politic, and he would burn it out and destroy it. Well, 
he did not live long enough to do that, and "Mormonism" came back 
to his home, into the very place where he was eulogized by his as- 
sociates for his stand against this work, and yet, here we were, 
peacefully, at the kindness of the officials of that state, permitted to 
declare again the glad news that the God of heaven had spoken to 
Joseph Smith, and that we had a message for all men. 

DECLARING THE MESSAGE ON THE STEPS OF THE STATE CAPITOL. 

I remember that on the Sunday night of that conference the hall 
was not large enough to admit all the people who attended, and so we 
retired to the steps of the capitol, and there were more than a thou- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 101 

sand people seated upon those, steps when we delivered again the 
message to them. And that is the outdoor meeting that I had in my 
mind as I began to speak to you. 

While thus addressing these people, I saw by my side, at the en- 
trance of the building, on the public square, the only remaining perfect 
stone, known as a sun stone, from the Nauvoo temple. There were 
twenty-four of them, weighing above a ton each, placed upon the top 
of the twenty-four hewn pilasters of the temple. I had seen portions 
of these stones elsewhere, but none of them perfect like this, and this 
was the property of the state, preserved by the state, and guarded by 
the state against vandalism. Well, I say, as I saw these things, my 
soul was stirred, and I said, surely God is at work moulding the senti- 
ments of men, altering their will and purpose for the accomplishment 
of his will and his purpose. 

A TEMPLE WILL BE BUILT IN JACKSON COUNTY, MO. 

I remember in the city of Independence, to which President Grant 
made reference this morning, the feeling and the sentiment of the people 
are friendly toward the Latter-day Saints, that one of the prominent 
gentlemen of that city, in the commercial club, said to me that he would 
be glad to see the "Mormons" build their contemplated temple in Inde- 
pendence, and suggested that he thought they could raise $100,000 in 
Independence to help us build it. That temple will be built, as well as 
other things that have been projected by the inspired servants of God, 
for the Lord knows how to work it out. All we need to do, my breth- 
ren and sisters, is to keep on the Lord's side and make him our friend, 
stand in his favor, keep his commandments, and he will work out the 
salvation of Zion and her redemption. It is a glorious thing to be alive 
in this dispensation, to live on the earth today, a glorious thing to live 
in America, a wonderful thing to live up here, where the Lord ap- 
pointed the gathering place of his people in the tops of the mountains. 

THE MERCY OF GOD SHOWN TO TLIE SAINTS. 

These are the last days, days when the judgments of the Almighty 
shall be poured out upon the nations of the earth, and the Lord has 
promised protection to those who would respond to the call — "Come out 
of her, O ye my people, that ye may escape from the judgments that 
are to come." He had in mind the need of protection and security and 
safety for such a people, and so he brought us here, even though it 
were unwillingly, and as Brother Morris suggested, "we came here 
willingly because we had to." But we have not had to wait long to see 
the mercy of the Lord. I thought a few weeks ago, while we were gath- 
ering contributions in our special fast meeting for the aid and relief 
of the distressed in the European nations, how the hearts of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as they gave, should swell with joy to know that the 
merciful Father had brought our fathers away from those lands, away 
from the place of distress and of famine. And I want to tell you 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

that these are but the beginnings of troubles that shall come. O, that 
they might be stayed, that they might not fall upon the children of men ! 
But light has come into the world, and by reason of the fact that light 
is in the world, and men have sinned and are sinning against that 
light, they cannot escape the indignation and wrath of an offended 
Father, who has been long-suffering and patient toward the children 
of men. I am sorry to say it, but it is the truth ; these are but the be- 
ginnings of days of sorrow and distress. We and our children shall 
rejoice in the years that are to come that our fathers and and mothers 
had no place to rest in peace or in security, but they had to come here. 
This is the place ! Thank the Lord that we did not stay down in Mis- 
souri or Illinois. Already we have seen the hand of the Father. 
Surely it was a trial to those who were driven from Nauvoo and other 
places, to which Brother Morris has been calling our attention. Many 
of them, no doubt, thought the Lord had forsaken them, and yet they 
did not have to wait long in their mountain retreat to see behind a 
frowning Providence, his smiling face, having brought them to the 
only place in this country where there was peace, and where there was 
security and safety — for the homes they longed to stay with and the 
habtiation of the Saints in that section became the very battle field 
between the North and the South. And so we are here through the 
mercy of our Father, for protection and safety against the days of 
trouble that are to come. 

I am glad we did not go to Oregon. I have thought of it many 
times while traveling in that section of the country — because the 
Prophet sent a petition to Congress at the time the bill was under dis- 
cussion to which Brother Morris has referred, asking for appropria- 
tions to establish military roads and posts along what was known as 
the Old Oregon Trail; and the prophet said he would furnish men 
cheaper than anyone else, and that when we were discharged, we would 
be near the country we wanted to go to. But the bill was defeated, and 
the military posts at that time were not established, and so the prophet's 
plan was not accepted. It might have perchance landed us in Ore- 
gon. That was not the place the Lord wanted us to be in, although 
Oregon was a good country. There would not have come the de- 
velopment to the Latter-day Saints in Oregon that we have received 
here in this country. It is true we might have become wealthy, for 
there was an abundance that nature had provided. They have today 
two-fifths of all the timber in the United States, in the state of Oregon. 
It has been a source of great wealth. There would have been no 
building of irrigation ditches, because nature provides an abundance 
of water, more than 90 inches of rain falls in the Willamette valley 
every year, enough to drown everybody if it did not run off. The 
streams were full of fish, and today the great salmon industries of that 
country are an added source of wealth not placed there by the hand of 
man. The forests were full of wild game, from which furs were ob- 
tained that established the Astor fortunes and others. And yet that 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 103 

was not the place. We would soon have been surrounded by the old 
enemy, and there would have been conflict and trouble, and maybe the 
Latter-day Saints would' have become rich and forgotten the Lord. At 
any rate, we would not have done the work we have done here. Where 
nature does much for man, man is inclined to do little, or less ; but 
where man has to struggle for his existence, there is the place where his 
physical powers are developed and his faith increased. There is the place 
where there is the possibility of growth such as cannot come in any 
other section of the country. And Theodore Roosevelt, the late honored 
President of the United States, said, in the great building across the 
way here, that it was not so much what the Latter-day Saints did as 
where they did it, that counted. And so it was here that we should de- 
velop physical strength and power, by industry, by labor, by toil, by 
frugality, such as we would not have had to face in any other portion 
of this western country, either in California or in Oregon. Then there 
would not have been those circumstances that called forth faith and 
led us to build a monument like this Sea-Gull Monument that is before 
us as evidence that here the power and mercy of God were given a 
chance, an opportunity to make themselves manifest. We needed 
him here, we had to depend upon him. I will tell you in the midst of 
prosperity, when men thrive, when everything moves well for them, 
there is always a natural tendency for them to forget the Lord, and to 
become self-sufficient and to be confident in themselves. It was so with 
the Children of Israel when they had before them the armies of the 
Egyptians and at their back the Red Sea, when they were in im- 
minent peril and they could not help themselves — it was then in mighty 
faith/they cried unto their Father in heaven, and he came to their de- 
liverance, and the waters of the Red Sea were parted, and they were 
permitted, through his mercy, to 'be saved. And so it 
was in the day of their famine for food and for water in the wil- 
derness. When they were in need he revealed himself, but in the days 
of their prosperity, they were not so near to him. And so in our history, 
in these trials and difficulties, we have gone to the Lord, or at least the 
Lord has provided the opportunity whereby we had to come to him, we 
had to depend upon him; and he has never deserted us nor left us 
alone in any of these times of trial and difficulty. 

OUT OF DISTRESS GREAT GOOD SHALT. COME. 

There are days of trial undoubtedly ahead of the Latter-day Saints, 
days when their faith may be shaken, if it will be shaken. I earnestly 
pray that our Father shall keep such a guard over this Church, over 
the individual membership of it, that we will never be left to a feeling of 
absolute independence of him, that we will never become so prosperous 
that we will feel that we can get along without the Lord's blessing and 
favor; and if we have had days of difficulty — and we have, brethren 
and sisters — the whole world has been through days of stress and 
trouble, financial difficulty and depression, and it is not ended. Great 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

nations that have never in many years been touched by poverty and by 
stress and by internal strife, today are being racked in the midst of 
these distressful conditions. England itself never was in a more serious 
condition than she is today, with millions of her workers on strike. No 
man can tell what the outcome of this trouble shall be. Thank the 
Lord that we live in the land of peace, in the land of security from these 
things, although we have not very much money just now, although we 
have not had a very prosperous season. But, my brethren and sisters, 
I bear witness to you that out of our present distresses, if we are dis- 
tressed financially, great good will come ; lessons that we need to learn, 
lessons of thrift, lessons of economy, lessons of trust, lessons of faith in 
the Lord, lessons that shall take away from our heart a feeling of greed 
and selfishness to want the last dollar, a feeling of sympathy for our 
brethren and sisters ; that we shall be coming toward the point where 
we are to be our brother's keeper, where we may establish universal 
brotherhood rather than to be banded in groups contending against 
other groups, the motive of which shall be pure selfishness in our 
hearts. 

IN THE FALL OF HARD TIMES LET US LEARN THRIFT. 

Now, let us learn from the experiences through which we are 
going, lessons that shall be of value to us. Let us keep out of the bond- 
age of debt; do not get the spending habit, so that if times of short 
years shall come, we will find ourselves in great distress. It is an ex- 
cellent thing to save a little, to conserve what the Lord gives us, that 
if there shall come hard times, we will survive them, for I want to tell 
you we have not seen the last of hard times. The Lord wants to 
humble the earth and bring it to a condition of repentance. He knows 
how to do it ; he has said in one of these revelations to the prophet 
Joseph Smith that days of famine would come, that by fire and hail- 
storm the crops of the earth should be destroyed ; and if the crops 
of the earth for one season were destroyed, there would be such suf- 
fering as we have not dreamed of. And the Latter-day Saints, from 
the beginning have been taught to save a little, to conserve their 
breadstuff, so that they may have in their stores supply for man and 
for beast. 

Now, you Latter-day Saints, rejoice in the habitations that have 
come to us in these mountains, cultivate every acre of ground you 
possibly can, save every head that the Lord gives you, both of cattle 
and of sheep, conserve it and preserve it, for it will be important in days 
that are to come, and do not feel that you won't survive. You will. 
The Lord is just teaching us lessons of thrift and of economy, and 
to listen to the council of those who preside over, us in our wards and 
stakes. 

A KEY TO SUCCESS. 

My advice to the Latter-day Saints who are in debt is that when- 
ever they harvest their crops of grain or shear their sheep, they sell 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 105 

what the Lord puts into their hands and do not speculate upon it, for 
the chances are it will bring you into difficulty. You cannot afford to 
speculate ; it is one thing to know how to raise corn, cultivate the soil 
and tend flocks, and another man's business to know the markets. Now, 
if you will be wise in this respect, and if you are in doubt, I will tell 
you what to do concerning your labors upon the farm and in the busi- 
ness in which you engage and all things with which the Lord blesses 
you. I give you this key — you will find it in the 9th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that you are to study out in your own mind the 
best thing, what you ought to do, and when you have reached your 
conclusion that, "this is the thing I will do about my farm," or sheep, 
or business, or something else — when you have reached your conclusion, 
go to the Lord and tell him what you have decided to do, and if 
that is the thing that you ought to do, he will cause that your bosom 
shall burn within you, that you will have the conviction, a testimony 
within your soul, and you will know that the thing is right. But if it 
is not right, he will take away the feeling to do the thing that you had 
contemplated to do, that you shall have a stupor of thought and will 
not have that feeling to go ahead, but shall reconsider it and counsel 
about it, and go again to the Lord, and go forward when we are sure 
we are right. But we are to get right, and we have the privilege to 
enjoy the spirit of inspiration from God. Keep close to him and he 
will guard us. I testify to you that God Almighty will put into the 
hands of this people all the means and the wealth and the power he can 
trust us with, if we will only keep the faith and keep from apostatizing 
and becoming a law unto ourselves and being selfish. He is just giving 
us today all we can stand. He will not give us more unless we will 
prove to him, that we will serve him no matter what may come. 

AN APPEAL TO THE SAINTS TO PROVE FAITHFUL TO GOD. 

I pray earnestly that we shall go forth from this conference, when 
it is concluded, with a determination that we will show to our Father 
in heaven that we appreciate what he has done for our fathers, what 
he has done for us, in bringing us to this place, and that we will mani- 
fest that we have the same regard for him and his word that our fathers 
had, who served him in faithfulness, and whom he heard, and that we 
shall never lose sight of the fact that we are not here wholly to obtain 
the blessings of the wealth of the hills and of the valleys and of the 
things of this world, that these are mere stepping stones which the 
Lord has placed within, our hands as means for our accomplishing his 
great purposes. 

I want to read to you, in conclusion, a few words from the Book of 
Mormon. Here is a prophecy dealing with our time. You will find 
these words in the 14th Chapter of First Nephi, where Nephi speaks as 
follows : 

"And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken unto the 
Lamb ,of God iin that day that he shall manifest unto them in word, and 
also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away of their stumbling blocks." 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

And among the gentiles who came to this country and their pos- 
terity were many of the house of Israel, and among them there were 
those who did listen and who did serve God, and who formed the 
nucleus of this, his great Church, and the stumbling blocks have been 
removed through the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the 
revelations contained in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. 

"And if they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they 
shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall be num- 
bered among the house of Israel; and they shall be a blessed people upon 
the promised land forever: they shall be no more brought down into captiv- 
ity; and the house of Israel shall no more be confounded." 

O, how wonderful, that he who hath been with us and with our 
fathers, hath vindicated us, hath made us a promise, if we will be 
true to him he will see to it that we shall not be brought into bondage, 
nor be confounded ! O, can we not trust him ? Has he not vindicated 
us? Has he not been our friend? Has he not wrought out, when 
the circumstances made it difficult the salvation of this people ? He 
surely has. Now let us not desert him, nor desert his word, for we 
cannot, in view of the light and the knowledge that have come to us, 
we cannot close our eyes to these things and become a law unto our- 
selves, and obtain the favor of Almighty God. 

"And that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that great 
and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his children, 
that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell; yea, that great pit 
which hath been digged for the destruction of men, shall be filled by those 
who digged it, unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the 
destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath 
no end; 

"For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil, and also 
according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work wickedness 
and abomination before him. 

"And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying, Thou 
hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well with them; and 
thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the house of 
Israel; and thou also hast heard, that whoso repenteth not, must perish; 

"Therefore, wo, be unto the Gentiles, if it so be that they harden their 
hearts against the Lamb of God; 

For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, That I will work a great 
and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which shall be 
everlasting, either , on the one hand or on the other; either to the convincing 
of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the 
hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds, unto their being 
brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and 
spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken. 

"And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words, he 
said unto me, Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto the 
house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea. 

"And it came to pass that he said unto me, Look, and behold that great 
and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose founda- 
tion is the devil. 

"And he said unto me, Behold there are, save two churches only; the 
one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 107 

devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God, 
belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and 
she is the whore of all the earth. 

"And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the 
earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the 
eaith, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God." 

He saw this day. He saw us, here, gathered as we are in the tops 
of the mountains. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, 
and its numbers were few." 

Indeed, we are but few — as the President remarked this morning, 
but a handful in the midst of the mighty hosts that cover the earth's 
surface. 

"* * * And its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and 
abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless I beheld 
that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon 
all the face of the earth." 

And so we are, and in nearly every land of the earth today, or.r 
missionaries — almost back to our original numbers, a little more than 
1700, — are in the various nations of the earth, declaring this day the 
message of life and salvation. 

"* * * And their dominions upon the face of the earth were small." 

Great as they are, still they are small in comparison to others. 

"* * * Small, because ,of the wickedness of the great whore whom 
I saw. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld the great mother of abominations 
did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all 
the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God." 

If we have not been through that experience, with a combination 
against us everywhere, with forces arrayed in our great gatherings such 
as the world's great! Christian Citizenship Conference and others ! No 
matter what else they may disagree upon, on one point they are always 
agreed, to fight the "Mormons." 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of 
God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon 
the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the 
earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of 
God in great glory. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured 
out upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars 
and rumors oi wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth. 

"And as there. began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the 
nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake 
unto me, saying, B«hold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; 
and behold, thou seest all these things; 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

"And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon 
the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the 
earth, whose foundation is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the 
Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his 
covenants, which he hath made to his people, who are of the house of 
Israel." 

We stand in that day, when the favor of Almighty God shall be 
poured out upon his Church in greater abundance than it has ever been. 
We shall make progress which shall far excel the progress and advance- 
ment of the past, if we serve our heavenly Father and do not desert him. 
And all the promises he has made from the earliest day until this time, 
concerning the redemption and establishment of his righteousness in 
the worldd, are to come to pass not only by this power upon his people, 
but by reason of his chastisement that shall be upon those who do not 
serve him. 

CLOSING TESTIMONY. 

This is God's work. He is in it. He is with those who lead it, 
I know. The light is in the ship. The great and glorious caravan, 
the Church of the living God, is moving onward and forward to the ac- 
complishment of its great purposes. And let the dogs bark. They 
amount to little when they fight God, for they are fighting Him when 
they fight this work. And we will not amount to much except we be 
true to this work, for it is God's, and he will not be mocked. When 
we have light and knowledge, there comes responsibility. Let us each 
assume it, do our part, get our homes, and with all our hearts serve 
him, as we never have done before, and set our houses in order and pre- 
pare ourselves that we may be worthy his favor to escape the judgments 
that are yet to come. 

For, as I have already remarked, I wish I could say to you that 
we have seen the end, but I am sorry to say we have but seen the be- 
ginning, and yet, so far as this people are concerned, they shall be 
immune against them, if they will serve God and keep his command- 
ments ; for he who hath delivered us, and who hath been the friend 
of our fathers, he who hath made the wrath of man to serve him, and 
hath vindicated his servants and exalted his work, will be with us to 
our redemption and salvation, if we are willing that he shall do it. 

May the Lord help us, that we may find favor in his sight, continue 
to be his people, approved of him, and escape his disfavor and the 
judgment that shall come upon the wicked and the unrepentant and the 
rebellious, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Junius Romney. 



SECOND DAY 

The forenoon of the second day was devoted to a special priest- 
hood meeting held in the Assembly Hall at 10 o'clock a. m., Monday, 
April 4, 1921. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant called the congregation to order at 2 
o'clock. The building was comfortably filled with representatives and 
Saints from all parts of the Church. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

Prayer was offered by Elder James W. Lesueur, President of 
the Maricopa stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

In common with all the general assemblies connected with our 
great conferences, this meeting is open to the public, to non-members 
as well as to members of the Church; and we welcome the visitor, the 
inquirer, the investigator particularly, and those who are called, con- 
ventionally, the strangers within our gates. But I take it to be a self- 

WIIO COMPOSE THIS VAST AUDIENCE. 

evident fact that the very large majority of this vast assemblage com- 
prises Latter-day Saints, those who have come in at the door, those 
who have received the message of salvation gladly and have availed 
themselves of it, those who have complied with the requirements laid 
down by him whose Church this is and whose name it bears, as con- 
ditions for membership therein. 

These are they who have had and have a living faith in God 
the Eternal Father and in his literal Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and 
Redeemer, and in the Holy Ghost, the third Personage in the God- 
head. 

These are they who have become keenly conscious of the need 
of repentance, and who have in fact become repentant and have of- 
fered unto the Lord that most acceptable of offerings, surpassing all 
the slain bullocks and rams and other bleeding victims on the altars 
of Israel, under the law of Moses, namely, a broken heart and a con- 
trite spirit. 

These are they who have humbled themselves, submitting them- 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

selves to the hands of men holding authority of God, commissioned 
by Jesus Christ, and who have been severally by such a one laid 
beneath the water, and who have come forth out of the water, as 
though resurrected from the dead, 'being thus baptized for the re- 
mission of their sins. 

These are they who have had hands laid upon them in the author- 
ity of the Holy Priesthood, for the bestowal of the right and title to 
the companionship of the Holy Ghost. 

WE REJOICE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. 

We have good reasons to rejoice. What boon of greater worth 
could be offered unto man than the forgiveness of his sins, with the 
innumerable attendant blessings ; to be made eligible for pardon, for 
acceptance by and before the Lord? To such I need not preach the 
gospel of baptism, for ye have been baptized. I need not dwell upon 
the requirements respecting faith and repentance, for ye have mani- 
fested the one and the other; but I address myself, nevertheless, more 
particularly to the Latter-day Saints present, and what I shall say 
to them I am quite sure will hurt none others who may be with us, our 
welcome visitors who have not yet come into the Church, who have 
not yet complied with the requirements laid down by the Lord, our 
Master, as the conditions of citizenship in the kingdom of God. 

Yes, we have been baptized for the remission of our sins. To re- 
mit, in the sense in which we speak of sins being or having been re- 
mitted, is to grant pardon for the offense, and to annul, suspend, or 
render inoperative the penalty which otherwise would have been in- 
evitable. A question arises in my mind. Are we, you and I, Latter- 
day Saints, retaining the remission of our sins which we received 
through obedience to the law of God? 

ARE WE RETAINING THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS ? 

Remission, the pearl of great price, was ours. It is a fit sub- 
ject for individual inquirv — Is it now yours and mine? Is it ours 
still? 

The righteous Nephite, King Benjamin, toward the close of a 
forceful address, which he offered on the occasion of his yielding up 
the authority of kingship unto his son, admonished the people most 
earnestly to retain the remission of sins which they had received 
through their baptism, to make it perpetual. And Alma, prophet, 
high priest, and chief judge, rejoiced when he found that a great part 
of his people had verily retained the remission of their sins. I refer 
you to the Book of Mormon, Mosiah, chapter four, verse twenty-six, 
for the first instance, and to Alma, chapter four, verse fourteen, 
for the second. Neither you nor I will waste time by reading it again, 
nor in pondering upon the principle embodied therein — the retention 
of the blessing of remission of sins. 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE 111 

But perhaps one may ask: Having received a remission, are 
we not forever entitled to it? Is it possible that God can give and 
then take back? Let us rather say, it is possible, and all too commonly 
a reality, for men to receive and then to forfeit. You note that bap- 
tism for the remission of sins is the first ordinance specified and the 
third principle named in our ordinary summary and arrangement of 
the principles and ordinances of the gospel. It has been beautifully 
called the gate to the kingdom, whose keeper is the Holy One of 
Israel. Blessed is he whose sins are forgiven, remitted; but this re- 
mission comes as no capricious act, as no favor in the sense of a dis- 
criminatory gift, even from God ; for he is a just God and he remits 
sins according to the law of God, which combines both justice and 
mercy. 

The mercy of God is extended unto those who make themselves 
eligible to receive the gift. God desires to be merciful to us and oft- 
times we block his way. He desires and yearns to bless us in some 
particular, and ofttimes we make it impossible for him so to do, be- 
cause we do not comply with the conditions that render us eligible for 
that exercise of the divine power. 

THE LORD CAN GIVE AND RECALL, PRONOUNCE AND CHANGE. 

That the Lord can pronounce and change, that he can give and 
recall, is attested by scripture after scripture. There comes to my 
mind the parable spoken by the Son of God while He was in the flesh, 
known to us as the parable of the unmerciful servant, in which we 
find that though one was forgiven, that forgiveness was revoked, be- 
cause he forfeited his right to it. He did not retain it, he did not keep 
it. Not to take time here to read it in full, I commend the parable 

AN ILLUSTRATION FROM ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. 

to you for perusal. You will find it recorded in the eighteenth chap- 
ter of Matthew, beginning with the twenty-third verse. It tells the 
story of a man who was deep in debt. He owed his creditor the 
enormous sum of ten thousand talents, and being unable to pay he 
was greatly disturbed when his lord called for payment, and he 
pleaded for time saying: "Lord, have patience with me, and I will 
pay thee all.'' Now, the lord of that servant was moved with com- 
passion and loosed him and instead of giving him time in wdiich to 
pay, he forgave him the debt, so merciful was he, so full of kindness 
and goodness, almost above that of men. But that same servant went 
out, and, meeting on the way one of his fellow-servants who owed him 
a paltry hundred pence, seized him by the throat and said : "Pay me 
what thou owest," and the fellow-servant fell down at his feet and 
besought him, saying: "Have patience with me, and I will pay thee 
all." One would have thought that the very similarity of the plea of 
the small debtor, in words so like those of the plea he, the greater 
debtor, had made immediately before, would have moved him to re- 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

membrance, but he would not, and he cast his fellow-servant into 
prison, according to the law of that day, whatever we may have to 
say as to the justice of it. When the other servants saw that they 
were sorry, and came and reported the matter unto their master. Then 
the lord of those servants, after that he had called the unmerciful one, 
said unto him : "O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, 
because thou desiredst me: Shouldst thou also not have had compas- 
sion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord 
was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all 
that was due unto him. So likewise shall my Heavenly Father do 
also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every man his brother 
their trespasses." 

The sin of unforgiveness, hardness of heart, cruelty, herein ex- 
emplified, is but a type of sin in general. Let us note the fact that 
though the lord of that servant had forgiven him his debt, had can- 
celed it in fact, yet when he learned that that servant was no longer 
humble, that he did not live so as to be worthy of the mercy ex- 
tended to him, he reversed his act of remission, recalled his forgive- 
ness and demanded of the wicked one payment in full. The blessings 
of the Lord are always conditional, the condition being our living up 
to the requirement making us fit recipients of blessing. 

The act of baptism does not simply blot out the sins of the past 
and enable us to begin with a new start, but it provides that if we 
have submitted to baptism worthily, we are entitled to remission of 
sin, that is, if we try to do our best, so as to be worthy of that boon. 

It is not required nor is it allowed that we shall be baptized over 
and over again with the thought of wiping out our sins up to date ; 
but it is ordained of God that having been baptized, after manifest- 
ing true faith and sincere repentance, if we shall live to be worthy 
of the remission of sins, through continued repentance, through our 
unfailing efforts to overcome,, through our course of good works, 
doing unto our neighbors as we would have them do unto us, and in 
short, through our continued compliance with the commandments of 
God, we shall have our sins remitted, if they be not so heinous as to be 
unforgivable. 

AN ILLUSTRATION FROM MODERN SCRIPTURE. 

The scripture I have cited is ancient ; the parable, while truly as 
applicable today as ever, is nevertheless many centuries old, so far as 
its record is concerned. In this very day in which we live the Lord 
has spoken, and that very definitely, concerning this matter. We 
find recorded in the 56th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants : "Be- 
hold, I, the Lord, command, and he that will not obey shall be cut 
off in mine own due time, and after that I have commanded and the 
commandment is broken." It is necessary to bear in mind, as the first 
paragraph indicates, that this revelation is addressed to the people of 
the Church : 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE •• 113 

"Hearken, O ye people, who profess my name, saith the Lord 
your God." Unto them he declares that the Lord does command, and 
he that will not obey will be cut off in the Lord's own time. Now 
please note the next verse. 

"Wherefore I, the Lord, command and revoke, as it seemeth 
me good ; and all this to be answered upon the heads of the rebellious, 
saith the Lord." 

Only the rebellious, those who will not obey the commandments 
of God are to be thus dealt with, are to have their blessings revoked ; 
only these will forfeit the blessings to which they were entitled. In 
another revelation given shortly after that, Section 58, the Lord takes 
people to task because they were in the habit of saying — and he might 
well take some of us to task, for we still say it — that the Lord doesn't 
keep his word, that he makes promises and fails to fulfil them. The 
Lord makes explanation ; let me read a few verses leading up to 
that particular declaration: 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and 
do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteous- 
ness; 

"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. 
And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth 
a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the 
same is damned. 

"Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guilt- 
less that obeys not my commandments? 

"Who am I, saith the Lord, that hath promised and hath not fulfilled? 

"I command and a man obeys not, I revoke and they receive not the 
blessing; 

"Then they say in their hearts, this is not the work of the Lord, for 
his promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh 
beneath, and not from above." 

THE LORD GIVETH AND TAKETH IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. 

The Lord is guided by righteousness. In righteousness he giveth 
and in righteousness he taketh, and blessed be his name. 

The sacrament of the Lord's supper has been provided as an or- 
dinance whereby at frequent intervals we can testify unto the Lord 
that we are still under the covenant that we have made with him by 
baptism, even witnessing unto God, the Eternal Father, that we do 
always remember his Son, our Redeemer; that we still bear his name; 
that we desire and intend to keep the commandments which he has 
given unto us— and all for this great purpose, that we may always 
have his Spirit to be with us. Thus we may retain the blessings that 
we have hitherto received, making them ours throughout time and 
for eternity. And I cite you to one more scripture which, consisting

of but few lines only, is perhaps the greatest declaration of its kind 
on record, and the best summary that I can possibly give unto you in

connection with this thought, as recorded in the 82nd Section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, 10th verse : 

"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say, but when ye do not 
what I say, ye have no promise." 

Let us keep the commandments of the Lord. Then, by his own 
word, he is bound to give unto us the blessings that have been prom- 
ised ; but when we do not do what he says, when we go back upon our 
covenant, we forfeit. May we retain the remission of our sins I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters : I have the honor, once more, of 
standing before you in the General Conference of the Church, in this 
great building that has witnessed so many gatherings of the Saints. 1 
believe that all persons, making units of this congregation today, have 
come here with a prayer in their hearts that they may receive blessings, 
that they may receive new light and intelligence as a guide for their 
feet and a prompter for their conscience, to lead and direct them in 
the future, in the way of truth and right. 

We have been favored with discourses from our brethren, and 1 
believe that I echo the sentiment of every one, that we have received 
a blessing from the Lord, and the remarks and the sermons given by 
our brethren, leaders of the Church, have found a ready place in our 
hearts, because we are in need of this kind of instruction and in thh 
way proper impressions are made on our lives, from time to time. I 
rejoice in being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I remember very well the day I was baptized, 
when eleven years of age. I missed the opportunity of being 
baptized sooner, or I didn't have an opportunity, for the reason 
that, when my father's family emigrated from the city of Nauvoo, just 
prior to his leaving his home in that city, he took my elder brother 
and my elder sister down to the Mississippi river and baptized and 
confirmed them members of the Church. I was only seven years of 
age and he explained to me that I could not receive baptism and be- 
come a member of the Church until another year. But 1 pleaded with 
him, and he finally yielded the point and took me into the Mississippi 
river and baptized me for my health. And that satisfied me for the 
time. An opportunity for baptism again did not present itself until I 
was eleven years of age. 

I remember very well the day and the person who 
officiated. Doctor Orin P. Lee, was the one that ad- 
ministered to me that sacred ordinance. Just near by the bank of 
the creek where the baptism occurred lived my uncle, Phineas H. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 115 

Young. I returned to his home after baptism, and there I met 
with a man somewhat famous in the history of the Church, namely 
Oliver Cowdery, one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon, 
one who wrote the manuscript of the Book of Mormon as the inter- 
pretation fell from the lips of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Oliver Cowdery 
was numbered as the second elder in the Church at the time of 
its organization, in 1830, on the 6th day of April. He had left the 
Church some years after and had engaged in the practice of law. On 
one occasion an opposing counsel said : "How can you listen to a man 
who has proclaimed that he is a follower of Joseph Smith, the 'Mor- 
mon' Prophet? How can you accept of his testimony, when he is far 
off in his calculations of things that occurred in a most natural way, 
and he looks at things from a spiritual standpoint, so he claims, and 
was at one time an associate of Joseph Smith, the 'Mormon' Prophet, 
and received a revelation, so he states, from the Lord?" Oliver Cow- 
dery, after the gentleman had exhausted his tirade of ridicule, 
arose to his feet and said : "May it please your honor, I 
was once a member of the 'Mormon' Church. I was associated with 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, but through my own weakness I 
have been disfellowshiped by that people, and I am sorry that 
this ever occurred." And with tears streaming down his face, he de- 
clared that if the opportunity ever presented itself, he would again 
ally himself with the "Mormon" Church. When he came up to Kanes- 
ville to visit, at the conference held in 1848, under the direction of 
Apostle Orson Hyde, he stopped at the house of my uncle, Phineas 
Young, and that is where I met him. Oliver Cowdery had 
come to Kanesville for the purpose of asking to be again admitted 
a member of the Church. He had repented, so he declared, and on the 
stand the following day, in making the request to President Orson 
Hyde, said : "I do not ask for place or power or station or any 
responsible position. All I ask is that I may be again admitted a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and die with 
my record a member of the Church." His request was granted and he 
returned to Richmond, Missouri, and in a few months, died and was 
buried there. Early in the 70's another witness, also one of the prin- 
cipal witnesses, Martin Harris, came to Salt Lake valley. He, too, had 
seceded from the Church. He came to Utah with a desire to 
again be identified with this people, and made his request to Presi- 
dent Brigham Young. In bearing his testimony that day, I remember 
that he made these remarks : "I had the honor, said he, "of being 
the scribe for the Prophet Joseph Smith in translating a portion of the 
Book of Mormon, but through my carelessness and through my want 
of foresight, the manuscript that I had written was lost, and never 
regained, and I justly received censure and reprimand from the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Now I have returned to the bosom of the Church with 
the hope and prayer in my heart that I may again be admitted a mem- 
ber. His prayer was also granted. Soon after he moved up to 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Clarkston in Cache Valley and died there, and his body was buried in 
the cemetery of that place. 

The testimony of those two men, I have always remembered, and 
as they bore them personally they seemed overwhelmed with grief and 
sorrow to think they had forfeited their membership in the Church and 
their rank and their standing as they had it at first. Men who 
receive the testimony of the gospel, men who receive the witness of 
the divinity of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, men who re- 
ceive a witness of the divinity of the Savior and his great 
mission, seldom see the way to repent after they have lost the 
faith, .but these two men seemed to be specially favored of the Lord, 
and the gift of repentance had not entirely been blotted out from 
their hearts, and according to their prayers they were restored again 
as members of the Church. 

I remember very well that soon after President Brigham Young 
had returned to Winter Quarters, from his pioneer visit to Salt Lake 
Valley, on the 5th day of December, 1847, the Twelve gathered' in the 
house of Willard Richards, one of the Twelve Apostles, the one that was 
ordained in Manchester, England, in 1840. If you remember the 
history of this good man, he was chosen an apostle before he left for 
England, at the time of President Young's mission to that country, 
but was not ordained until they arrived in Manchester. There 
were five of the Council of the Twelve found in the city of Manchester 
at that conference, and the proposition was made that Willard Rich- 
ards be ordained an apostle, there and then, making him the sixth 
member of the apostles in that old country at one time. 
He was accordingly ordained by President Brigham Young, the pres- 
ident of the Twelve Apostles. On this 5th day of December, 1847, 
the Twelve gathered together and chose and elected Brigham Young 
to be the prophet, seer and revelator to and president of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all the 
world — that was the exact wording. How this last sentence 
thrilled me. President Brigham Young chose for his coun- 
selors. Elders Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards. I 
know that the Saints universally acknowledged President Brigham 
Young as the president and leader of the Church, before he was called 
and set apart by the rest of the apostles, for when Colonel 
Allen, the United States enlisting officer, came up from Fort 
Leavenworth to Mount Pisgah, there were several of the Twelve en- 
camped at that point. He made his errand known to them and asked 
if it were possible for him to get an enlistment of five hundred able- 
boded men from the camps of the "Mormon" people, to go to Mexico 
to fight the battles of our country under General Zachary Taylor. 
The brethren listened to his request and then said : "We cannot de- 
cide this question for you, Colonel Allen. There is but one man that 
can decide it. That man is President Brigham Young. He is at the 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 117 

present time encamped near Council Eluffs, on the Missouri river. If 
you will take the journey with us, we will go to his camp, and you 
may ask him that question and obtain his answer for yourself." The 
question of raising five hundred able bodied men from the camps of 
the Saints thus leaving their wives and children and aged parents to 
the mercy of the camp of the plains, without a supply of food and 
clothing and covering, seemed appalling to everyone ; and, 
as I remember, the majority of the apostles did not take 
the request kindly, but after discussing the matter, President 
Brigham Young said: "This call must be answered. We 
must furnish the men. It is a trial of our faith. It is a test of our 
loyalty, and we propose to furnish the men as the Government re- 
quires." 

Many a test has come to this people, many a trial to their 
faith. In the loss of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Patriarch Hyrum 
Smith, and then finally, as one leader after another had passed away, yet 
this eternal truth and testimony of President Brigham Young has al- 
ways found a ready echo in the hearts of every Latter-day Saint. He said 
when the news of the martyrdom reached him in Boston, "although 
the leader of the Church, the Prophet Joseph Smith, has been taken 
away from us by violence, his blood has been spilled, he has sealed his 
testimony, but he did not take with him the Priesthood of the Son 
of God. That is still on the earth, the Twelve Apostles are still the 
representatives holding that power and that Priesthood, committed to 
them by the Prophet of the Lord. 

And so it has been, from time to time, and today we are honored 
again with having a full organization of the First Presidency of the 
Church and the quorum of the Twelve Apostles. And always the 
Saints have recognized at a glance the leadership of the man that 
has been chosen to lead Israel in every age of the history of the 
Church ; and today, my brethren and sisters, you are assembled here 
in this great conference, rejocing in the fact that the Church is grow- 
ing, is marching on, is increasing in strength and power, commen- 
surate with the humility and the firm, determined action and devo- 
tion of its members. As they devote themselves to the cause, so the 
Lord increases his blessings upon them. So their reward is sure, as 
sure as they work for it unselfishly. Today we are requested! to 
promulgate the principles of truth in our own communities. There 
are many non-"Mormons" living in our midst. The Seventies quor- 
ums have been requested to furnish missionaries to carry the gospel 
to these worthy citizens that have lived in our midst, some of them 
for many years past. I met one of our brethren recently who said : "I saw 
a gentleman who has been a neighbor of mine for years. Said he, T 
have been to your meeting tonight, and I didn't know before that the 
"Mormons" believed in Jesus Christ as the Savior of the 
world, and I did not know that you had any faith in 
Jesus Christ, that you taught that he died, that men might

live.' 'Where have you been? Haven't you attended our meet- 
ings before?' 'No, this is the first time I have ever attended a 
"Mormon" meeting since I lived in your community.' " The neces- 
sity of preaching the gospel here at home became apparent to the of- 
ficers of the wards and the stakes of Zion, and now this movement 
of preaching the word to all of our neighbors and of giving them a 
chance to know of the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph and the 
result of his labors, and the doctrines that we believe in, will reach 
these people who live in our communities, who have not known it here- 
tofore. And this 1 believe is a step in the right direction, and is going 
to result in very much good, and many people will be won to a knowl- 
edge of the truth without cost or without very much sacrifice of time 
and means. A soul here in Zion is just as precious as a soul that is 
saved abroad in the nations of the earth, where it takes many hours 
and days and weeks of time and considerable expenditure of money 
to convert each one. The principles of the gospel are just as accept- 
able to those who are honest in heart, who live in our midst, as those 
who live far away, and the elders seem delighted with the work that 
they are engaged in, and seem intent upon carrying the principles of 
the gospel to their neighbors, evincing, more than ever before, that 
they have accepted of those two great commandments given unto 
them : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul; and thy neighbor as thyself." May this be our 
prompting sentiment continually, that we seek the welfare of others, 
that we seek to serve one another, that we seek to do good to our 
fellow men and to win those who do not know the truth, to a knowl- 
edge of the same, at any sacrifice that we are called to make, devoting 
our time and our best energies to the spread of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that we may stand approved and acquitted all the day 
long, and be acceptable to him, that we may have the spirit of the 
gospel within us continually, and the knowledge of its great truths 
burning within our hearts, desiring only to give these evidences to 
others that they may profit by them. I pray that we may be faithful 
to this end, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

Elder Orson F. Whitney, in the course of his impressive remarks 
yesterday afternoon, very solemnly declared, referring to our faith, 
our Church, and all that we believe and all that we are doing — "This 
is the work of the Lord." Now, is it? .1 wonder sometimes when we 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 119 

say those things, and when we listen to them, if we really gather into 
our consciousness all that that means ; or whether, in many instances 
at ljeast, it takes on the nature of a mere form of speech, and we fail 
to realize all that is involved in a declaration of that kind. I never arose 
before a congregation, perhaps, where I felt less disposed to under- 
take the task of speaking to the people than I do here and now, this 
afternoon. After Brother Young, of the First Council, was called to 
address you, and the likelihood of President Grant continuing to call 
upon the members of the First Council of Seventy to address you in 
the order of their standing, made it likely that I might be the next 
called upon, I have been able to think of nothing else but just this 
declaration that was made by Elder Whitney, and which in some form 
or other, has been expressed, I think, by every speaker in this con- 
ference; and since this is the only idea present in my mind just now, 
I propose to work upon that for the few minutes that I am to speak to 
you. 

And now the question : Is this work we are engaged in the work 
of the Lord? And if it is, then just what is involved in that state- 
ment? Why, this is involved in it, to get over the grounds very 
hurriedly, and touching only the high points in relation to things. If 
this statement of our brethren, made in various forms, is true, then 
God the eternal Father, the Creator of heaven and earth, and of 
worlds and world systems, through Jesus Christ his Son — together 
with his Son Jesus Christ — appeared unto a mortal man, unto a young 
man, Joseph Smith, and the Father introduced 1 , to him Jesus the 
Christ, He who was taken by cruel hands and crucified, as the scrip- 
tures say, for the sins of the world; and as he himself declared over 
here on the American continent, by his own mouth, that He was the 
Redeemer, and had been slain for the sins of the world. These two 
heavenly personages appeared unto this young man and proclaimed 
what they alone were competent to proclaim, that all the religions of 
the world were untrue, that men were teaching for doctrines the 
commandments of men, that they had forms of godliness, but denied 
the power thereof, and for him to follow after none of these, but 
giving him a promise that if he was faithful he would be chosen as 
an instrument in the hands of God for re-establishing the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and restoring the Church of Christ again in the earth. 
Now, if this work that you and I are connected with is indeed the 
truth, then that splendid but awful vision and announcement is a 
reality. 

Next it is declared, as a truth, that a new volume of scripture was 
revealed — a book making known the history of nations that flour- 
ished in past ages upon the American continents, the ruins of whose 
civilization we are more or less acquainted with through its surviving 
monuments in various parts of America. It purports to be a record 
of the hand-dealings of God with millions of people who lived and 
died upon these western continents, among whom God raised up in- 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

spired men to teach and instruct them in righteousness; to tell them 
also of the plan of life and salvation devised from before the founda- 
tion of the world. These prophets held divine authority to teach 
the plan of life and salvation. Also in the Book of Mormon is an 
account of the most splendid vision that is of record, on the appear- 
ing of the resurrected Christ to man. He appeared to the survivors 
of the awful cataclysms and earthquakes and tempests and destruc- 
tive storms that passed over these lands of America during! the 
crucifixion and the entombment of the Christ, and proclaimed him- 
self to be the life and light of the world and the savior of men. If 
what we say in our general testimony be true, then this volume of 
scripture, containing the testimony for God of sleeping nations, is 
a verity. 

In connection with the Prophet Joseph Smith, three other men 
received divine testimony of the verity of that work; for three men, 
namely Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, testified 
that an angel from heaven came down into their presence and showed 
to them the original plates from which the Book of Mormon was 
translated. In their presence he turned over the leaves of this ancient 
record and they curiously observed the engraving and saw that it 
was of fine workmanship. This angel declared unto them that the 
book had been translated by the gift and power of God, and was 
true; while the very voice of God, Creator of heaven and earth, the 
sustaining power of all worlds, who holds them) in exact balance, and 
has the universe under the control of his almighty will — He com- 
manded them to testify of the truth of this record. If our testimony 
that the work in which we are engaged is the work of God is true, then 
the Book of Mormon is true, and all that is in it is true. 

When the young men, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, were 
engaged in the work of translating the Book of Mormon, the question 
of baptism came up in their minds, its purpose, its form, what was 
accomplished through it. That question they referred through prayer, 
to the Lord. Then John, the Baptist, the one above all others who 
would know all about baptism and who would be a perfect instructor 
of that ordinance and doctrine, he whose hands held the body of the 
Christ, the Son of God, when he buried him in the waters of baptism — 
he came and gave instructions on this important subject, and directed 
these men to baptize each other; and conferred upon them the author- 
ity to preach repentance and baptize others. Again, if our testimony 
to this work is true, then Peter and James and John, 'who seem to 
have constituted an inner circle within the college of the Apostles in 
the days of the Christ, who were with the Christ on several special 
occasions and who seemed to receive special attention from him and 
privileges from the Christ — these three men, to on^: of whom the 
Christ had said : "I give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven" 
— these three apostles came and conferred the Priesthood after the 
order of the Son of God, upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 121 

That is a verity if our testimony is true; and being true what an 
important thing it is ! Inspired and instructed by the commandments 
of God, these men, now holding the holy apostleship, proceeded to or- 
ganize once more the very Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth by 
divine appointment and under divine authority. 

Subsequently, when the fulness of times for such things had 
come, then Moses, Elias and Elijah appeared in the Kirtland Temple 
and bestowed upon these men the keys of authority and power they 
held while they were on the earth. Moses restored the keys for the 
gathering of the children of Israel ; Elias, perhaps the patriarchal 
order, together with the keys or authority that unlocked the knowl- 
edge that was to link together the families of men in all nations, and 
that the Lord shall at the last combine into one; family all the children 
of men. Elijah restored those keys of authority that shall turn the 
hearts of the children to the fathers, and doubtless the hearts of the 
fathers to the children. All of these things, and each one of them, are 
true, if our general testimony is true. The renewal of the promises 
and the hopes and assurances of the resurrection from the dead in- 
cluded in the work we call the work of God, is also true. Our hopes 
in Christ Jesus our Lord are not limited to our hopes and visions of 
things in this our mortal life. We have hope anchors within the 
vail that hold. The vail is rent to our vision and we see a race re- 
deemed and raised from the dead, for as in Adam all died, so in and 
through the Christ shall a\\ be made alive. And the race shall be 
united — bound together in the golden chains of God's love and human 
love. The same unity that abounds and holds in the government of 
the universe, will obtain as to the race of men. A unity akin to that 
which unites in one the Holy Trinity — the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost. Now, when we say that this Gospel, Church and priest- 
hood of ours is the work of the Lord, that this is the truth, this is 
what we mean : All these things that I have enumerated, severally and 
collectively, are true. Being true, how splendid, how glorious all 
this is! What strength; what power; what faith; what hope; what 
unity; what benevolence; what love, ought to and will and does 
abound with a people whose faith is founded upon these great truths 
that are involved in our faith and jn our Church ! The world is 
beginning to take note of the effect of a people having such a faith 
as this, as it begins to be manifested in the lives of the Latter-day 
Saints ; and the world is going to take more note and yet more note 
of this as the years pass- The little "all hails," now given to the suc- 
cessful system of the religion that is fostered and advanced by the' 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is insignificant in com- 
parison with that greater "all hail," that shall yet come to the work of 
God of which we testify. 

For a moment let me call your attention to how this work has 
been built up by witnesses for God. When the Lord would com- 
mence this great dispensation of the fulness of times, a dispensation 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

in which all other previous dispensations will come pouring into, as 
streams find their way to the ocean — when he would begin this great 
work of establishing faith in the world, he began by creating a wit- 
ness for himself, one who could testify that he had seen, that he had 
heard, that he had received instructions from the very lips of the 
resurrected Son of God, and that in the presence of the Father — God 
raised up one who could go among men and testify that he had seen 
and heard and had been instructed by the; God of the whole universe. 
God raised up that witness to himself, and though he was young and 
inexperienced, and though persecuted for his testimony, reviled and 
mocked, men could not move by one hair's breadth that witness for 
God from) the truths that he had proclaimed. Unpalatable as it was 
to have to say to the inhabitants of the earth that they were all wrong, 
he did it, though it tested even his strength. He was a good and true 
witness. 

Then when the Book of Mormon was brought forth, the Lord 
found and equipped with knowledge the three men whom he would 
have testify to the truth of the book ; and these! witnesses testified and 
were true to their testimonies. No matter what else happened to them, 
how foolish they may have been, or how stubborn they were as to other 
matters, they remained true to the thing that God had called them to 
be witnesses of. They were good witnesses and I do not know but 
what something of strength has been added to the weight of their 
testimony by reason of the experiences through which they passed, for 
in good report and evil report, in the Church and outside of it, they 
remained true and steadfast to that testimony which, from the nature 
of it, I cannot conceive how it could be possible for men to dare to 
depart from, and they not depart from it. Well, thesfe three 
witnesses were commissioned to go and find twelve other witnesses, 
special witnesses to these great truths that God is unfolding in the 
dispensation of the fulness of times ; and they found the twelve wit- 
nesses who became the twelve apostles of the Church, especial wit- 
nesses of the name of Christ in all the world, holding the keys of the 
ministry of the Church in foreign nations — in all the world ; so that 
when the door of the Gospel is to be opened to any nation, one or 
more of these men holding these keys of authority and power, go 
to these nations and open the door of the Gospel formally, for the 
proclamation of the truth. There is a long list of such openings of 
doors of the Gospel to various nations, and in each case it has been 
done by one of these men holding this divine- commission and author- 
ity. But you begin to see how the work is built up by witnesses. It 
will readily be seen how twelve men are not equal to the task of mak- 
ing proclamation of the Gospel in all the world ; and so assistants are 
provided. Men are gathered into- quorums of seventy, and each quor- 
um is presided over by a council of seven men, a different presidency 
from any of the other quorums of the Church, and doubtless for the 
reason that these quorums need to be well nigh indestructible at the 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 123 

head, so that several of them may be called away and go upon mis- 
sions' for some length of time and yet not disrupt the organization. 
Well, these men are called to be especial witnesses of the Lord Jesus 
Christ in all the world, to testify of Christ as well as the twelve spe- 
cial witnesses, or apostles. They are to testify of his divinity, that he 
is indeed the very Son of God, chosen as the Redeemer of the world, 
in whose name only may the children of men hope for salvation ; also 
they are to testify of the resurrection and the eternal life of man 
through Jesus Christ — that .eternal life which, we are told, God, who 
cannot lie, promised before the world began. Well, these men, the 
twelve and the seventy, are chosen to be witnesses of these things 
which God is unfolding in the world. So, indeed, are we all wit- 
nesses — all have the right to have the witness of God's spirit to 
their own souls that all this mass and volume of truth is true, is the 
word of God; so that in a way all the Saints may receive the wit- 
ness of these things, and stand up before each other and the world 
and say as Elder Whitney and the rest have said here, that this work 
is God's work. 

Now, I happen to be one of the Seventy, one chosen to be offi- 
cially a witness for the Lord Jesus Christ; and having reviewed all 
these developments of the work of the Lord, involving as it does this 
blessed thing to have our sins forgiven, and oh how much that means ! 
It has been my fortune, good or ill, to come in contact with men whom 
I have seen laboring under a very 'agony of mental and spiritual 
distress because of their sins. I have seen them break down and cry 
out in their agony that they would be willing to give a right arm if 
only such, and such things as they had done could be undone. They 
would gladly give their lives if their hands could only be washed clean 
of the crimson stain of human life. I have seen men under the stress 
of agony until I have, in part at least, been led to appreciate how 
blessed the boon is that we may have forgiveness of sins. One other of 
the great gifts, and one of the greatest mercies of God, is to receive 
under the divine authority established here by the revelations of God. 
and existent in the priesthood, the right to be baptized of the Spirit 
that a baptism takes a poor human life up into union with the Spirit 
life of God. Who shall be able to tell how great that blessing is, to have 
God's strength become available to man as strength ; his wisdom for 
guidance to become man's wisdom ; God's strength to resist evil, his 
power to persist in good is given to man. What a boon it is to have 
one's spirit united with the Spirit of God by which we become spirit- 
ually alive, and restored to that blest state that men enjoyed before 
that thing we call the "fall" had happened. Now, in the presence of 
all this, I exercise the office of my calling as one of the witnesses of 
the Lord Jesus Christ concerning these things. Without argument, 
without debate, without even an elaborate statement of the things 
that are true, only having brought before your vision just how large 
a thing it is to say that this is the work of the Lord, and depending 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

now upon the spirit that is within you, and by which you too know the 
truth, with nothing between us, standing more than heart to heart, 
spirit touching spirit, your spirit meeting mine, our spirits congenial 
to the truth and of such nature that when we hear the truth we know 
the truth ; now, in this attitude, I solemnly declare to you that these 
things that make up our history, and make up the development of 
the Church and kingdom of God, as we know it, I say to you that 
each one of the great things, and above that, all of them together, are 
true. And I say it conscious that I am speaking where God hears and 
takes cognizance of things that are said, and will hold men to an ac- 
countability for what they say. I say unto you, in very deed, and out 
of a clear conscience, and with a consciousness of it being approved 
of God — I say to you, these things are true ; and heing true, how 
strong, and noble, and brave, and broad a people the Latter-day Saints 
ought to be ! 

O God, the eternal Father, in the name of thy Son Jesus, the 
Christ, our Redeemer, with all my heart and soul I thank thee for a 
knowledge of these great truths. Seal them upon our hearts. Let us, 
O Lord, gather unto our souls the strength and the power that come 
from thee ; and Thine be the power and the glory forever and ever, 
worlds without end. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

CONCERNING THE JEWS. 

Some of you may be familiar with the agitation that is going on at 
the present time, in the publications, against the Jewish people. There 
should be no ill-will, and I am sure there is none, in the heart of any 
true Latter-day Saint, toward the Jewish people. By the authority 
of the Holy Priesthood of God, that has again been restored to the 
earth, and by the ministration, under the direction of the Prophet of 
God, Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ have been to the Ploly Land and 
have dedicated that country for the return of the Jews ; and we be- 
lieve that in the due time of the Lord they shall be in the favor of God 
again. And let no Latter-day Saint be guilty of taking any part in any 
crusade against these people. I believe in no other part of the world 
is there as good a feeling in the hearts of mankind towards the Jewish 
people as among the Latter-day Saints. 

The congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder William L. Jones, President 
of the Moapa stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. m. Tuesday, April 5, 1921. 



THIRD DAY 

Conference continued in the Tabernacle, Tuesday morning, April 
5, 1921, 10 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant announced the opening of the service. 

The congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Elder Andrew Kimball, President of the St. Joseph stake of Zion, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The congregation sang, "O, say what is truth?" the favorite hymn 
of the late President Anthon H. Lund, as announced by President 
Heber J. Grant. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

"Sweet are the uses of adversity, 
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, 
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head." 

For a good many months w.e have been laboring as a people 
under distressing circumstances. 

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

The financial conditions which have prevailed have brought many 
of us a keener appreciation of our reliance upon the Lord. Every- 
where, so far as I know, throughout the communities that go to make 
up the body of the Church', the situation has been fraught with finan- 
cial difficulty. Men have discovered that they could not continue as 
they had been wont to do, for the last several years, in high living, 
in more or less of extravagance, and sustain their financial positions. 
I have wondered if this lesson has not been brought to us for the pur- 
pose, in large measure, of vindicating the counsel and advice and the 
policies of the Church, extending over many, many years. 

OUR TEMPORAL AFFAIRS TAKE ON RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE. 

It is sometimes said that we have a great economic mission. I 
think perhaps the use of that phrase is not calculated to define quite 
the exact situation, because I take it, the Church has no economic 
mission as such. The function that it plays in the economies of our 
people and of the world is a function that is merely coincident with 
its great purpose, which is to establish the kingdom of God and to 
provide, through the facilities which it offers, opportunities for the 
development of men and women in conformity to the principles and 
the truths of the everlasting Gospel. Our temporal affairs take on 
a religious significance and importance, not merely because they are 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

temporal affairs, but because we interpret our religion in terms of life 
and living. There can be no salvation; hereafter, in our conception of 
things, unless there be salvation here. We hope for the everlasting 
rewards which are to come to those who are faithful^ by the devocion 
of our lives to the service of our Master here on earth. It is because 
we so inextricably interweave our temporal lives with our 1 spiritual 
ones that we regard our temporal affairs as being elemental in our 
spiritual salvation. 

THE ECONOMIC MISSION OF THE CHURCH. 

Having in mind this conception, the Church does have a great 
economic mission in the world and particularly among its people. I 
have had some opportunity in the assignments made to rme by the 
presidency of the Church in the last several years, to make some ob- 
servations with reference to the place and function of the Church in 
the temporal or financial affairs of the people, and I desire to take 
this opportunity to give to my fellow members of the Church the 
benefit of my own observations and my testimony upon this import- 
ant subject — I say important because I recognize the fact that 
throughout the Church, among all men and women, their temporal 
or financial affairs constitute a very important part and feature of 
their lives. 

The Church has always assumed a position of helpfulness. In 
order to render the service which it considers it ought to render, it 
has undertaken to give support to various commercial and economic 
enterprises in order to promote the general welfare of the people. No 
little criticism has been directed, both on the part of the member- 
ship of the Church, or at least a limited portion of the membership 
of the Church, and from outside sources, toward this engagement in 
economic affairs. 

When we are confronted with adverse conditions we come to 
learn the advantage which accrues from the association of the Church 
in the business affairs of the people. I believe that aside from the 
great mission that the Church has performed in stimulating legitimate 
industry and enterprises among the people, the Church does now per- 
form (and it is brought forcibly to our attention in these strenuous 
times), a great mission in stabilizing business of our communities. 
I give it to you as my deliberate judgment that had it not been for the 
influence which the Church has exercised in the fundamental bus- 
mess affairs of our part of the country during these strenuous times 
we would have seen catastrophes that would have made us tremble. 
It is my belief that were it not for the fact that the president of our 
own Church stands at the head of some of the commercial institu- 
tions of our intermountain country, they could scarcely have stood 
under the conditions which these hard times have laid upon us. 

I regard the whole situation as a vindication of the inspiration 
that has come to the leadership of our Church. For my own part, I 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 127 

here and now repent of any thought or criticism: that has ever been 
in my heart for the participation of the Church in the temporal af- 
fairs of the people, and I believe that the present situation warrants 
a similar attitude on the part of any man or woman in this Church 
who may have entertained the notion that it is wrong for our lead- 
ers to concern themselves with these temporalities that offer employ- 
ment, and in a measure regulate and ,serve to provide our business 
opportunities. 

THE ADVICE TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT, NOT GENERALLY LIVED UP TO. 

The advice that has come to the people throughout these many 
years has been to keep free from the obligations of debt. A few have 
accepted the advice. Thousands have not. They find themselves in 
distressing condition at the present time. The vindication of that 
advice lies in the fact that, as a people, we would today be in a posi- 
tion of great advantage, we would be table to extend your economic 
advantage all over our intermountain country, we would be in a posi- 
tion to initiate new enterprises, we could reclaim and! put to use many 
of our resources, if we had only accepted the advice. But we have not 
in the main accepted and lived up to> that advice. In consequence we 
find that as a people, as a community, we are indebted, in sums of 
money that are almost staggering in their contemplation. At the pres- 
ent moment there is, owing to the Federal Reserve Bank, which is lo- 
cated in this district, and which serves the territory in< which our peo- 
ple mainly reside, between thirty and forty millions of dollars, a large 
portion of which represents obligations of our people. We will have 
to pay that great debt. 

WE MUST BE SAVING AND ECONOMICAL. 

We will have to square ourselves with our creditors, and I know 
of only one way in which we can do it, and that is by adopting and 
putting into practice the counsel and the advice that has been' given by 
the leadership of the Church for these many years. We must save, 
we must be economical in our living. We must patronize our home 
industries and institutions. I believe that it will be possible for us 
not only to pay off all the obligations that we owe, if we live ac- 
cording to the standards that have been set for us, but that it will be 
possible for us to continue the development of our resources and it will 
be possible for us to go forward and to initiate and maintain such 
enterprises as shall make for the general welfare of all the people. I 
propose that we take into our living some of the fundamental con- 
ceptions of our faith, and so enable us the better to follow this ad- 
vice and counsel which has come to us from time to time. 

OUR SUBSTANCE NOT TO BE DEVOTED TO SELFISH ENDS AND PURPOSES. 

I am indebted to Brother Rulon S. Wells for a thought that I 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

wish to give to you at this time. I remember upon one occasion his 
presentation of this conception of our faith ; not only is a man obli- 
gated to give one-tenth of his increase to the Church as a tithing, 
but that in the proper conception of his relationship to the Lord and 
his work, he is obligated to devote and to consecrate all of his 
wealth and substance to the work of the Lord. I grant you that 
upon the first consideration that doctrine would seem to entail a 
responsibility to which we could not live, but does it? Is not every- 
thing that we enjoy a gift of God? Is not all the wealth that comes 
into our hands to he used by us for the furtherance of his purposes? 
What man is entitled to say to himself, even if he has paid his tith- 
ing, "All of the remainder of this substance belongs to me? It is 
at my disposal to bp used for the furtherance of my own selfish ends 
and purposes." Is it not by far the nobler, the finer conception to 
say : "All of this substance is mine, as a steward, to be used by me 
for the establishment of our Father's work? I don't need it all just 
for myself, but I do need it for the maintenance of the institutions 
that are necessary to the establishment of the Church and society." 
The man who maintains a good home is devoting his substance 
to the purposes of the Lord. The man contributes to the proper 
environment to his fellows and who uses his means for the mainten- 
ance of institutions which tend to build up the country, is not de- 
voting his substance to ,'selfish ends and purposes. Some incre- 
ment may come to him but he is really building up the kingdom of 
God, he is helping to establish the people, he is making of this the 
Land of Zion which it was intended to be and is intended to be, and so 
in that larger sense, is it not a proper conception of our relationship to 
our Father and to his work to say that all that we have, that every 
grain of substance that comes to us is to be devoted and consecrated 
to the establishment of our Father's work? Furthermore, will not 
that conception bring to us a greater measure of happiness and de- 
votion and contentment? Will we not all feel that in so using our 
means we are in very deed serving our Master? I know of no 
greater contentment and happiness and satisfaction that can come to 
a human soul than to feel that to the extent of his capacity aind 
ability he is indeed serving our Father who is in heaven. 

THE CALL TO THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS IN THESE DEPRESSING TIMES. 

My brethren and sisters, I cannot but think that if we obey the 
counsel that has come to us, if we act in the light of the great truth 
that has been revealed to us, and devote ourselves to the establish- 
ment of our Father's work with all our mind, might, strength and 
substance, that our Father will bless us to the accomplishment of the 
great ends and purposes that we have in view. I have always be- 
lieved that the Lord intended that we should enjoy the material 
comforts that can be afforded to us in this life. I have never felt 
that he intended us to be in poverty. I have believed that he has 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 129 

planned that the earth should yield of her substance and her riches 
to those who are righteous and who keep the commandments. I be- 
lieve that the call to us at this time, in these distressing financial 
conditions, is to keep the commandments of the Lord, to establish 
ourselves in the various lines of industry that are open to us ; to de- 
velop the resources of our country, to live economically; to put into 
practice the great lessons of thrift that have been given to us, and 
to devote our all to the establishment of this great work. I know 
that if we so do, it will bring to us the blessings of heaven and that 
the Lord will give us a greater measure of his Spirit and that in the 
attempt that we make to be self-sacrificing and to be careful and 
economical there will come among our people more of the spirit of 
love and unison and harmony. I believe that there will be less de- 
sire to build up one's self at the expense of others. 

SATISFACTION COMES THROUGH ALTRUISTIC MOTIVES. 

Indeed I think that the time is upon us when we must consider 
our whole economic situation. It is not a time for anyone to pros- 
per at the disadvantage or expense of another. This must be in 
order to have a general economic balance. All men must share in 
the burdens as well as in the advantages. There must be more or 
less of an even distribution of these advantages and these burdens. 
One class of people allied in any common industry cannot hope to 
acquire for themselves wages and conditions that are not consonant 
with the conditions that prevail with other classes of people. 

What we really need is the application of the religious princi- 
ple to all of our living. There is nothing more needed in all this 
world today than the application of the principles announced by the 
Savior of the world. Our great economic problems can never be 
solved with selfishnes dominant in the hearts of men. Men will 
never be satisfied with bigger wages and with bigger properties and 
bigger holdings. The only way that real satisfaction can come to 
people is that they shall be actuated by altruistic motives that give 
them a regard for and an interest in the welfare of their neighbors. 
That is the purpose of true religion. Never was it more needed in 
the history of the world than today. We must set an example to 
the world. My judgment is that all of our preaching, all of our 
books, will never be comparable with the examples that we set in 
our living here at home. The sermon of our own lives will do more 
to convert the people of the world to the principles of truth, than 
any other single force or factor that we possess. 

My humble prayer is that the Lord will help us to conform to the 
advice and counsel that come from the leadership of our Church ; 
that he will establish us in the faith; that he will give us vision and 
conception of the great mission and destiny of this work; that we 
will indeed be led to consecrate all that we have, all that God gives 
us, for the establishment of his kingdom and for the carrying for- 



130 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ward of his mighty work, for the salvation of the children of men. 
I pray for this blessing upon the Latter-day Saints in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My heart is full of gratitude unto my heavenly Father for the 
name and standing which I hold in this Church. I thank him for the 
restoration of his glorious gospel, through the instrumentality of his 
prophet, Joseph Smith. My heart is full of appreciation of that gos- 
pel, for all of its gifts and blessings that we are today in the enjoy- 
ment of. There are many of these blessings to which we have become so 
accustomed that we sometimes fail to appreciate them, and yet if we 
were deprived of them by being separated from the Church, we would 
then feel what a loss it was indeed. The blessings of the gospel are 
felt in the homes of all faithful Latter-day Saints. The power of God 
is manifest in the intercourse which we hold in our family circles and 
in our associations with one another, in our coming together in meet- 
ings, in offering up prayers and feeling the presence of his Holy Spirit, 
in the healing of the sick, and in untold many ways arc we in the en- 
joyment of these splendid blessings which come by reason of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. But there is one blessing that exceeds all the 
others and embodies within it all the blessings of the gospel. It is 
God's greatest gift unto his children — eternal life. And to obtain this 
blessing all members of the Church should be zealously, energetically 
striving with all their might. It is indeed far more valuable to us 
than all other things that we can possibly conceive of, for it means all 
that the name implies, eternal life. And we must not think that this 
is limited to the usual conception of a never ending life, for we have 
a much broader meaning to that term than merely that we shall continue 
to live after we have "shuffled off this mortal coil." No indeed, it 
means coming forth in the resurrection from the dead, crowned with 
immortality and eternal life, and in that term we mean an exalted life 
in the presence of God, for he is indeed the very Eternal One and eter- 
nal life means his life, to live with him forevermore, to receive from 
him, as has been promised, "all that the Father hath" — all this is em- 
bodied in that great and wonderful blessing which we call eternal life. 

How then are we to obtain eternal life, to secure to ourselves and 
to our families that wonderful blessing that is beyond compare? By 
keeping the commandments. We all remember reading in the New 
Testament of the young man who came to the Savior and said: "Good 
Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may obtain eternal life?" 
And the answer was : "Keep the commandments. - ' And when he asked 
which, a few of these were enumerated : "All these things have 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 131 

I kept from my youth up; what lack I yet?" Then the word of the 
Lord came to him: "If thou wilt be perfect, sell that which thou hast, 
and give to the poor, and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven ; and come 
and follow me." And let it be known that eternal life applies to those 
who are made perfect and not to any others, for no unclean thing can 
dwell in the presence of God forever. We are living in this world and 
passing through a probationary period. These are the days of our pro- 
bation, the days when we are to be tried to find out whether or not 
we will serve God or Mammon. 

What did it mean to him, when the Savior said that he should sell 
that which he had, for he was a wealthy young man, and had great pos- 
sessions, and should give to the poor and come and follow the Master? 
If he followed that injunction he would cease to worship Mammon, he 
would serve God, would cease to be selfish and greedy in his nature, 
and, casting all that aside, give proof that; he loved God more than he 
loved Mammon. 

"Come and follow me." What does that mean? Was not the 
Savior tempted just as you and I are tempted, when he had fasted in 
the wilderness and Satan came unto him and offered him all the 
kingdoms of the world and wealth and fortune and all that he could 
get if he would only bow down and worship Satan. We must have 
the strength and power to resist temptations. What was the Savior's 
reply : "It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him 
only shalt thou serve." Likewise we must declare our allegiance to 
God and resist the power of Satan. 

It means this, that if we are to inherit eternal life, or obtain that 
greatest of all blessings that is within the gift of God we must 
sanctify and purify our souls. "The spirit and the body are the soul of 
man, and the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul." 
Then this soul of thine "must needs be cleansed or sanctified from all 
unrighteousness." Why? "That it may be prepared for the celestial 
glory." Does not that mean the same thing? Eternal life, to our way 
of thinking, means the obtaining of celestial glory, and if we attain to 
that glory it will be. because we live according to the law of the celes- 
tial kingdom, and that means that we shall sanctify and purify our 
souls from all unrighteousness. It means that we are to follow Christ. 
His was a life of devotion, a blameless life, a life without sin, without 
corruption, without yielding to the power of the adversary. It there- 
fore behooves us that we shall practice in our lives that great and fun- 
damental principle, that saving principle of repentance from sin ; for, 
unlike the Savior, we are sinners, and have need of repentance. It 
means that we shall give of our substance, and help those that are 
in need. It means that we are to place the kingdom of God before all 
other things. It means more than merely taking the initial steps of 
faith, repentance, and baptism, at the time of our admission into the 
Church. This, of course, is a good start — the right beginning, and 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

through it we obtain the remission of sins and, by the laying on of 
hands, the companionship of God's Holy Spirit. But it also means 
that we must continue to have faith in God, and have faith unto re- 
pentance, as long as we are not perfect in our lives, for the principle of 
repentance has been given to us that we might sanctify our hearts and 
purify our souls, and prepare ourselves to dwell in the presence of God, 
for that celestial glory, for that eternal life that has been promised 
to the faithful. But this we cannot do, unless we shall engage in the 
good fight of faith, resisting temptation in whatever form it may come, 
and not permitting ourselves to be led away by the allurements of 
wealth and its uses for greedy and selfish purposes. 

All that we have and all that we are should be devoted to the service 
of God, and that doesn't prevent us from engaging in laudable enter- 
prises. It doesn't preclude us from the enjoyment of the proper 
pleasures of life, it doesn't hinder us from supporting and sustaining 
our families and educating our children, for all this and everything 
that we do that is right is truly a service to God ; but when we forget 
God and worship at the shrine of the god of this world, even Mam- 
mon, seeking riches for the gratifying of selfish lusts, securing it by 
questionable methods — by cheating, fraud, deception, misrepresenta- 
tion, no matter how, but getting it by fair means or foul ; or, in other 
words, when the devil taketh us up into an exceeding high mountain 
and showeth us all the kingdoms of this world and their glory and 
splendor, and wealth, and sayeth unto us as he is wont to say : "All 
these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me," 
then, O Latter-day Saints, "follow Christ," and set yourselves as 
steel against the fiery darts of the adversary and say as the Savior 
said : "Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the 
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." 

What good thing shall we do that we may have eternal life ? Follow 
the admonition of the Apostle Paul to Timothy : "Fight the good fight 
of faith, lay hold on eternal life," for unto this we have been called 
through our acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ which is the gos- 
pel of repentance, and it enjoins upon all a life of repentance from 
sin, and promises salvation only to him "that endureth to the end." 
We live in a world of sin and are subjected to its temptations. The 
good fight is one of resistance to the arch enemy of God. "Blessed is 
the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive 
the crown of life which the Lord has promised to them that love him." 

Then let us follow Christ, resist temptation, cleave unto his word 
and eternal life will be our sure reward. God grant that it may be 
so. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 133 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the California ' 

Mission. ) 

Tt is certainly a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to 
attend a General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, to have the privilege to listen to the splendid counsels that 
are imparted by the presiding authorities of the Church, and to partake 
of that good spirit that prompts the presiding authorities as they un- 
dertake to expound the doctrines of the gospel and to counsel the peo- 
ple to walk in those paths that will be for their best advantage. It is 
also a very great privilege to have the opportunity of standing up in one 
of these great! conferences to bear testimony to the truth that has 
been revealed for the salvation of the children of men in this great dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times. And with this privilege there is also 
a very great responsibility which causes men to have more or less anxiety 
at the thought of attempting to discharge the duty that is placed upon 
them, when' they are called to stand up in the midst of the people for a 
few moments as spokesmen. 

My labors, my brethren and sisters, as many of you no doubt 
know, are at present in the California mission. When I left Los Ange- 
les a few days ago, the appearance of things in that part of the land 
were about as contrary to what we see around the outside in this stormy 
weather as one could well imagine. Southern California, at this par- 
ticular period of the year, is probably as beautiful a country, in many 
parts of it, as could be found anywhere upon the face of the earth. I 
had the pleasure, just a few days ago, of being in the company of Elder 
Richard R. Lyman, of the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding 
Bishop of the Church, in attending services in San Bernardino and also 
in Los Angeles, and as we were traveling from the city of San Bernar- 
dino these brethren burst out again and again with exlamations of sur- 
prise and joy at the beauty of the scenery through which we passed, for 
we traveled through vast sections of great orange groves ; and along 
the roadway, continuously, I might say, there were great clusters of 
blooming roses and geraniums and other flowers that were indeed beau- 
tiful to lock upon. 

I am very happy to report in this conference that the California 
mission is making fair advancement. I suppose men who are engaged 
in the missionary work in every part of the world would be glad if they 
could make better headway than they do. California, as you know, is 
a land that is given much to pleasure. Thousands, I suppose hun- 
dreds of thousands, of people come to California every year to escape 
cold weather in other sections, and to enjoy and spend the means that 
they have been blessed with, and people who come for such purposes 
are not very willing to listen to the teachings of the servants of God, as 



134 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

they undertake to bring to the attention of men the message that has 
been committed into their care. And yet I am happy to say that we 
continually find a few people who become pricked in their hearts, and 
who do investigate the message of the gospel, and who are brought to 
the waters of baptism and become numbered with the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have been very 
greatly blessed in the California Mission in having occasional visits from 
the President of the Church, and from other prominent brethren, and 
they have always manifested a very ready willingness to go into the 
branches of the Church and to meet people face to face and bear testi- 
mony to them in relation to the truth. We have been blessed in this 
regard to a very great extent. President H'eber J. Grant, during the 
past year, I suppose has visited the branches in Oakland, California, 
and in San Francisco, and at San Jose, in Ocean Park, Los Angeles, 
Long Beach, Santa Anna, San Diego, and San Bernardino ; and a little 
further back, we had him also at Gridley, in the Sacramento Valley, 
where we have a large number of people who are engaged in agricul- 
tural pursuits. 

The California Mission has a membership of about six thousand 
two hundred souls. These people, to a very great extent, are not con- 
verts that have been made in the mission field, but they are men and 
women who have been born and reared in the Church, with their fami- 
lies. We have a great many men in the California Mission who have had 
splendid experiences in the Church, who have been abroad in the world 
as preachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ, who have been in stake 
presidencies_ and in high councils and in bishoprics, and who have occu- 
pied other prominent positions in the Church ; men and women who 
are still established in the faith of the gospel, who love the truth, who 
have come for various reasons from their former homes to make 
homes in the state of California. We have had, during the past year, 
a very remarkable experience, in that a very large number of our people 
have come from the wards and stakes of Zion to make homes in Califor- 
nia. There has been received during the year, something over twelve 
hundred souls, who have come with recommends, and have united with 
the branches in the California Mission, and then there are a great many 
others who have come into the mission who have not brought transfers, 
and a great many that wc haven't met. We have been .trying to 
extend the missionary labors, going into communities where the gospel 
has not been preached, that we know of. to any extent in that section. 
We have never been able to send the missionaries into any locality in 
the state where they have not discovered men and women who claim 
membership in the Church. In every little community wherever the 
missionaries have resided for any length of time, they have come in 
contact with these Church members who have practically been lost for 
a considerable period of time and haven't had recognition in the mission. 
This has resulted in quite a large number of additions in the organiza- 
tions that have been effected in the California mission. It might not 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 135 

be out of place in this conference to call attention to some of these 
increased organizations. In .1918, there were eighty-five Church or- 
ganizations in the California mission. In 1919, they were increased to 
one hundred and fifteen organizations. In 1920 and 1921, they have 
been increased to one hundred sixty-two organizations, which means 
that .there have been seventy-seven additional Church organizations. 
They cover conferences, branches, Relief Societies, Young Ladies' Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations, Young Men's Mutual Improvement As- 
sociations, Primaries, Sunday Schools, and one Religion Class. You 
will reach]}'' discern, my brethren and sisters, that with this increased 
number of organizations, a very large number of men and women, be- 
tween two and three hundred, who have heretofore not had any direct 
responsibility resting upon them as officers in the Church have now been 
brought to feel that they are under an increased obligation to render 
service in the building up of the kingdom of God. Of course, this has 
increased the spiritual strength of the people in these various localities, 
and men and women have been aroused to a better performance of the 
duties' that rest upon them as members of the Church of Christ. I am 
very happy to be able to report that the California mission has played 
its full part in contributing, in a material way, to the tithes that have 
been paid for the advancement and upbuilding of the Church of Christ ; 
and, notwithstanding the financial depression that has been mentioned 
by some of the speakers during this conference, there has been more 
tithe paying during 1920 than has ever been paid in the mission before; 
I think about twenty-six per cent more tithing during the past year 
than was paid during the previous year, and I am also glad to be able 
to report that the California mission, in the amount of tithing that is 
paid per capita throughout the entire mission, stands above the general 
average of the Church, which I think is a very splendid thing to be 
able to report. 

We are feeling some anxiety in that mission in relation to mis- 
sionaries, and I suppose the same feeling is with all of the mission 
presidents. There seems to be disposition to a greater extent than 
ever before, it seems to me, for fathers and mothers and others who 
have representatives in the mission field, to feel that it is a proper 
thing to suggest the release of missionaries, long before the time that 
the mission president would release them. I desire to ask bishops 
and presidents and fathers and mothers that they give attention to 
this matter, and that they be not too ready to recommend the release of 
the men and the women who have been called to preach the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. If you will open the Doctrine and Covenants, 
you will discover again and again in the revelations of the Lord that 
there can be no greater service rendered than the preaching of the gos- 
pel. Many of the brethren, at an early period in the Church, went to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and inquired what they could do that would be of 
the greatest advantage to themselves, and the Lord answered again 
and again that the thing that would be of greatest worth to those men 



136 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

who thus sought counsel at the hands of God, through the prophet 
of the Lord, would be to lift up their voices in the preaching of the 
gospel. I do not know that this has ever been revoked. If the great- 
est thing that men could engage in, at the introduction of the gospel, 
was to cry repentance among the inhabitants of the earth and to ex- 
pound the doctrines that have been revealed for the salvation of the 
children of men, that service is just as great today, as it has ever been 
in the history of the Church, and I think it would be well for fathers 
and mothers, and for men who occupy presiding positions in the organi- 
zations of the Church here in Zion, to counsel that missionaries be per- 
mitted to remain in the mission field until those who preside over them 
feel prompted by the Spirit of the Lord to say that the time has come 
when they should lay down their missionary work and return again to 
their various homes. I realize, my brethren and sisters, when I make 
this statement, that always there can be conditions that cannot be con- 
trolled by fathers and mothers, and that cannot be controlled by others, 
however interested they may be, that may make it necessary for mis- 
sionaries to return, but it is an injustice to any young elder in the mis- 
sion field, who has been there for sixteen or eighteen months, and who 
has made the discovery, perhaps, that God is his Father, that God has 
called him to be his servant, has called him with divine authority, and 
has made him a preacher of righteousness, just when he is being bap- 
tized by the power of God, and when ability is being developed within 
him to expound the doctrines of the gospel — not in the enticing words 
of man's wisdom, but in the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit 
— then to have somebody make a recommendation that he be released 
and be taken away from his missionary work and be brought home, 
disappointed, knowing in his own soul that he had not accomplished 
the work that he had desired to accomplish. And the preaching of 
this gospel is to be continued as it is written in the very first revela- 
tion : "And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the months 
of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. And they shall 
go forth and none shall stay them, for I, the Lord, have commanded 
them." You may read further, I shall not take the time — of the 
marvelous promises that have been made by the Lord God of heaven in 
relation to the preaching of the gospel, and that all men can come to 
an understanding of the truth as it has been revealed, if they will 
hearken to the counsels that are given of God through his servants. 

I desire to say to you, fathers and mothers, and I know whereof 
I speak, for I have been in the very period of missionary work in the 
past that the missionaries who are in California, very largely, are in 
today, and I would rather have had taken from me anything that I 
possessed in the world than to have been robbed in the days of my boy- 
hood of filling, to the full satisfaction of those who presided over me, 
the first mission in which God, in his bountiful kindness, gave me op- 
portunity to labor. I plead with the fathers and the mothers, and with 
bishops and presidents, as far as possible, to encourage men and 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART\ 137 

women to remain in the fields, and let them understand that there is, 
as a general thing, but one opportunity given to a man in a lifetime 
— that is the history of missionary work, just one opportunity in a life 
time, — to preach the gospel ; and do not interfere and bring home from 
the mission field men who are filled with the Holy Ghost, who are 
anxious to cry repentance, who have had a wonderful love come into 
their souls for the gospel of the Redeemer, and who have been made 
to know, just as their fathers and mothers know, that the things that 
they are teaching are true — the power of God unto salvation. I thank 
God that I have that assurance and knowledge in my soul, and I 
praise God that he has given me this assurance, and bear testimony 
to its truth with all my soul, in the name of Jesus Christ, my King.

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I take it as a compliment to my father, James H. Hart, rather 
than any slight to myself, that I should be invited to the stand under my 
father's name. 1 recall an incident in his life, suggested to me during 
this conference, of his being lost with a companion in a fog or storm. 
They wandered for hours without reaching any known landmark, 
until night settled upon them and the situation became serious. 
They knelt in prayer for their deliverance, and shortly after arising 
from their knees in the snow of that cold country, the clouds broke 
away for a few minutes, they beheld the North Star and received 
their bearings. So in this conference there have been presented 
guiding gospel principles, foundation stones upon which.' we may 
safely anchor, and to which we may look for guidance. In the con- 
stitution of this commonwealth, framed under the presidency of the 
late President John Henry Smith, it is declared that "frequent re- 
currence to general principles is essential to the security of individual 
rights and the perpetuity of free government." By parity of reason- 
ing, a frequent recurrence to the fundamentals of religion are essen- 
tial for individual guidance, and for the well-being of the Church. 
I rejoice in the fundamental instructions and the solid satisfaction 
of the spiritual feeding, given us during this conference. The 
injunction of the opening speech was to keep the commandments of 
the Lord. I am reminded in this connection that the Ten Command- 
ments form the very foundation of the laws of all civilized nations. 
One of our most learned jurists in the civil law, that is, the Roman 
law as distinguished from the common law, said of the civil law, 
(and it is in keeping with the Book of Mormon quotation made by 
Elder Whitney in this conference) that "the spirit of man, divinely 
inspired, has wrought from the beginning. The roots of the tree of 
life strike down into the remotest past" ; that a system had been 
developed which reigns by reason after the authority which pro- 



138 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

mulgated it ceased to reign. If it be true that inspiration to the 
law-giver, can produce a system of such strength and reasoning that 
it prevails long centuries after the authority which promulgated it- 
has passed away ; how peculiarly true it is of the gospel that these 
divine principles, these foundation stones, lower than which we may 
not be able to go, will be a stay to us and a strength and a guide 
to us. 

I always enjoy that hymn that we sang yesterday, Ex-President 
Roosevelt's favorite symn, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent word." We have 
been reminded of this firm foundation by the teachings of this con- 
ference. When in the tribulation, turmoil and temptations of life, 
there is danger of losing our bearings, if we can keep sight of these 
guiding principles, these foundation truths of our religion, we are 
more secure. I did not refer to the incident of prayer followed by 
a view of the polar star as an argument for prayer, although I am 
sure as I live, as sure as I desire to be, that God can and does hear 
the prayers of faith of his children. 

I Rejoice greatly in looking in the faces of these my faithful 
brethren, into whose stakes it has been my great privilege to go 
during the past fifteen years, and to see them working with love 
for the good of their fellow men, giving loving service to the point 
of great sacrifice in many instances ; and, by the way, that covers 
three of the cardinal principles that our Reedeemer stood for and 
taught — love, service and sacrifice. I have seen that manifested so 
abundantly in the lives of my brethren, that in being in their presence 
I have felt reassured, reinforced, and renewed in strength and deter- 
mination. 

I think perhaps no more important principle was given to us 
during this conference than the reference which our president made 
to some matters in the 43rd Section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"And this ye shall know assuredly, that there is none other 
appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until 
he be taken, if he abide in me" . . . referring to the Prophet 
Joseph. 

"And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teach- 
ings of any that shall come before you as revelations or command- 
ments," other than the president of the Church, because there is 
"none other appointed" to receive revelations for the Church except 
the president of the Church. 

"And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that 
you may know they are not of me." And if that principle were 
known and understood in the Church, some individuals would stand 
upon safer ground than they now stand, upon. Their compass would 
work and it would point to the North Star, to the source from which 
the Church is entitled to receive guidance. 

In listening to the remarks of Elder Richards on the necessity of 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 139 

example, and teaching the gospel by example, I thought of the 
reverse condition of those who may cast reflection and bring dis- 
grace, not only upon themselves but upon the Church, by not setting 
an example that is worthy of emulation ; by failure to adhere to 
fundamental principles, by listening, perchance, to some lying voice, 
some lying spirit of evil that may direct them away from foundation 
principles and truths, persuade them to violate the commandments 
of God, and lead them off on a tangent of evil. 

This is a time in the history of the world when a new resolve 
should be made in favor of obedience to law. The proclamation 
has been made throughout this conference of the reign of law in the 
universe. The general principles which apply, as we read in the 
130th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants are: 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foun- 
dations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated; 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to 
that law upon which it is predicated," compliance with the conditions 
upon which it is predicated. That is fair and safe to everyone, that 
we are governed not by caprice nor by whim, nor by changing laws, 
but upon principles irrevocably established from the foundations of 
the earth. 

President Lincoln in his day had some sound advice for the 
people, which should be reiterated throughout- the earth. I suppose 
there has never been such a lawless period in all the history of the 
world as we are passing through in the United States today, never 
a time when life has been held at so low an estimate, nor a time 
when greed and the ambition for unjust gain, have been more rampant. 
He said: "Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well- 
wisher of his posterity, swear by the .blood of the Revolution, never 
to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to 
tolerate their violation by others. Let reverence for the laws be 
breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles 
on her lap ; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries and in colleges ; 
let it be written in primers, in spelling books and in almanacs; let it 
be preached from the pulpits, proclaimed in legislative halls, and 
enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political 
religion of the nation ; and let the old and the young, the rich and 
the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors 
and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars." 

The fact that one may not like a law does not justify him in 
disobeying it. Will elders of Israel be unmindful of the rule pre- 
vailing in the United States against the manufacture or distilling of 
liquor. Will they feel at liberty to violate the law because, perchance, 
they may think it can be done in safety? If they do so, there is a 
harvest of sorrow for them to reap. By the violation of law they 
reap the whirlwind they sow in disobedience to law. We have had 
some pathetic cries from individuals in this nation who have taken 



140 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

false steps and have cried out as a warning voice to their sisters to 
avoid the evils that have come upon them. On their death bed they 
have sobbed: "It was wine, wine that did it. Tell girls to heed me, 
for I know. Tell them that in the wine cup lies death." Others at- 
tribute failure in life to a lack of appreciation of the value of a home 
and a loving companion and the establishment of a home under 
lawful wedlock and the companionship of a husband who would be 
true. There may be other laws than that for the enforcement of 
temperance throughout the United States that an individual here and 
there may not fancy, but let all support the law ; let all be guided by 
the general principles that are established for the guidance, not only 
of citizens of the United States, but citizens in this great Church of 
ours. 

I copied from some author words of advice and warning to 
our girls in reference to modesty. The thought was expressed more 
beautifully than I could express it myself and therefore I desired to 
read the exact language, but I do not seem to have the words with 
me. In substance it was that cultivated communities have come to 
make modesty the supreme grace of woman. That it is to her a 
garment of strength and beauty and a witness to her womanhood. 
That she has no need to assert what all concede or to demand rights 
which no one question. That the costume or the action which sug- 
gests immodesty is a voluntary descent from the position which the 
com ( munity gladly assigns to a woman. That it is an accepted degra- 
dation and choice of unloveliness and a challenge to impurity; and that 
it is well to remember that the only protection is in oneself and 
the only safety in resisting the beginning of evil 

May the Lord bless and help the efforts of those who are striv- 
ing to establish the youth of Zion, to keep in the paths of righteous- 
ness, rectitude and right, young people in the Church who are growing 
up and who will take the places in a few years of these their older 
brethren and sisters. There has been many testimonies of the truth 
of the Gospel presented during this Conference. The few statistics 
given by President Grant was an eloquent witness to the divinity 
of this work. A deathrate of nine, a birthrate of thirty-eight, and 
a marriage rate of fifteen and one-half. Those things could not flow 
from an evil tree. The tree may be judged by its fruit, and "the 
poisonous tree, though watered by nectar, can produce only the fruit 
of death ;" and likewise, the good tree will bring forth good fruit. 

I have rejoiced in the testimonies of my brethren, in the instruc- 
tions which they have given, and I desire to continue with them to 
be faithful in promulgating this great cause, which confers honor 
upon any man who has any part or work therein. May the Lord 
bless us and give us glimpses from time to time of the grandeur and 
the magnitude and majesty and worth of this great work and of its 
value to the children of our Father, whose souls are very precious 
in his sight, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 141 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

APPRECIATION OE STEPHENS' "THE MARTYRS." 

I want to express my unbounded approbation and delight with 
the very splendid cantata that we had here of "The Martyrs" last 
night. I am sure all who were here were very much delighted and 
pleased, and that all feel grateful to the Lord for the inspiration to 
our beloved brother, Evan Stephens, in furnishing us such a won- 
derful piece of music, and such a splendid tribute in poetry to our 
beloved dead. 

THE SCHOOL OF ART AND MUSIC. 

Perhaps you have noticed in the papers that the magnificent 
McCune residence, which would probably cost over half a million 
dollars, and which was presented to the Church at our last Confer- 
ence, has been set aside by the Presidency for the use of a School 
of Art and Music. And I am pleased to say that this disposition of 
the property has met with the very hearty approval of A. W. Mc- 
Cune and his wife, the donors of the property ; in addition to having 
given this imposing structure, when they learned it was to be used 
as a School of Music and Art, they presented to us the two mag- 
nificent pieces of statuary that are now in that home, which would 
probably cost something over twenty thousand dollars, as a begin- 
ning for art collections that may go there. I trust that the people will 
call and partake of the hospitality of the School of Music. Of 
course, as to this designation for the use of the place, I do not know 
exactly that it will always be permanent, but we are inclined to 
think it will be. i I 

There have been a great many people, of course, who have urged 
me to move there and use that magnificent house as the official 
residence of the President of the Church. I appreciate the compli- 
ment and the many expressions of good will and desire for me to 
occupy such a magnificent structure; but I consider it would be a 
vast waste of the money of the good people to maintain me in any 
such an elegant place, for the reason that if I went there I would 
want everything to be in keeping with the house, and it would be 
in direct opposition to what Brother Stephen L. Richards has said 
here today, all of which I endorse with all my heart. For the time 
being I shall be perfectly satisfied to live in my little bungalow, one 
story and a half high in about the nicest spot in all Salt Lake City. 
During the first six months of my residence there, I don't believe I 
missed a half dozen times sitting up in bed every morning and taking 
a view of the whole valley and singing President Charles W. Pen- 
rose's hymn, "O ye mountains high." 

I endorse with all my heart the excellent remarks that have 



142 .GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

been made here this morning, and if time would permit, would like 
to add a few comments, but we aim to start on time and to close on 
time, barring the musical selection after twelve o'clock. May the 
Lord bless us, and may we have a time of rejoicing this afternoon 
and on the morrow in our conference, is my prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder George T. Hyde, of the 
1'ortneuf stake of Zion. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

Conference meeting was opened at 2 o'clock by President Heber J. 
Grant, who presided. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Joseph Reece, of the 
Nebo stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "Come, thou glorious day of promise," by 
Alexander Neibaur, a Jew. The hymn was read in full by President 
Heber J. Grant, and is found on page 246, of the Latter-day Saints' 
Hymn Book. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I trust that the inspiration of our Heavenly Father that has 
rested upon those who have spoken before, may be with me while 
] stand before you. 

I wonder if the early pioneers of Utah, the founders of the 
Church, the Prophet Joseph Smith and others, in! their fondest 
dreams and hopes, comprehended the rapidity with which this Church 
would grow. With some friends of mine, relatives in fact, daugh- 
ters of the late Patriarch John Brown who, with Orson Pratt, was 
first of the Pioneers to look into Salt Lake Valley, I say, with his 
daughters, I drove over the boulevard above Salt Lake City a few 
nights ago. There were clouds in the heavens so that the stars could 
not be seen. The whole valley seemed to be thickly dotted with elec- 
tric lights. And as we gazed we wondered what the pioneers would 
have thought if in their dreams they could have seen the valley un- 
der similar conditions. 

ARE WE WORTHY SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE PIONEERS? 

As I have looked into the faces of the people assembled at this 
Conference, I have thought with admiration and wonder of this 
great structure in which we are assembled ! Of its magniture, and 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 143 

of the unusual factor of safety that has been used in its construction. 
I, have thought also of the great Temple cast of us, with its tre- 
mendous foundations and massive walls. There is an edifice like the 
rock of ages. What rare inspiration rested upon that great Pioneer 
and Prophet, Brigham Young, when, under his direction, the Lord 
laid the foundations for this great commonwealth ! 

Are we, sons and daughters of these great Pioneers, playing our 
part in this great work as well as they played theirs? In this house 
last night a tremendous multitude listened to the music of a product 
of the Church and were thrilled with the stirring; strains of song 
and music in honor and praise of our martyrs. At the same time 
in the Salt Lake Theatre, another building erected under the direc- 
tion of that great Pioneer, President Brighami Young, his grand- 
daughter was the leading performer in a grand opera production. Are 
we, I ask, even under these conditions, worthy sons and worthy 
daughters of these great Pioneers? 

.THE ANTI-CIGARETTE CAMPAIGN RATIONAL, NOT HYSTERICAL. 

Since the last Conference, six months ago, Mutual Improvement 
workers and others, in and out of the Church, have waged a rather 
intense campaign against the use of the cigarette in the State of Utah, 
and wherever else the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
has members. 

In conducting this campaign I regret that we have met with 
some opposition. I am sorry that in these efforts we have come into 
rather vigorous conflict with some of the leading business men of 
our State. If in this undertaking, we have been in error, we have 
not been alone in our mistaken judgment. Doctors and educators 
generally encourage such undertakings. Were Andrew D. White, 
a great president, and an important factor in founding Cornell 
Lniversity, still living, I would write to him and say: "In the sum- 
mer of 1902 you gave me a mission. You asked me, as I sat in 
Cornell University, in company with teachers from various other 
sections of the country, to go home and to carry to the young people 
I came in contact with a message from Andrew White, to call 
the attention of young people to the fact that the use of the cigar- 
ette is one of the most positive means of taking from people their 
chances of success." I would say: "President Andrew D. White. I 
am proud to have helped to secure the following- result : The State 
of Utah has passed a law prohibiting the sale or the giving away of 
cigarettes or cigarette paper. The State of Idaho has also, by law, 
provided strict regulations intended to decrease the use of these two 
objectionable articles." 

This work has not been a matter of hysteria. With us it is not 
a mania. We have proceeded deliberately. We feel as if with math- 
ematical certainty we have done something for the lasting benefit 
of the young people of our communities. 



144 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

WHY THE ANTI-CIGARETTE QUESTION? 

Since my life has been devoted to the study and teaching and 
practice of mathematics and of engineering, I think I have stamina 
enough not to be wafted about by mania, or hysteria. I belong to 
the fifth generation of members of the Church. I desire while I 
speak, that I may do so as a worthy son of the grand old pioneers. 
Have we been unreasonable, have we worked too hard in this anti- 
cigarette campaign? We are determined, in fact it is our mission 
and duty, to produce a generation of young men and women better 
than the world has ever known. And this is why we fight to keep .the 
cigarette from our young men and our young women. 

I have here a copy of an article that appeared in the Denver Post. 
March 21, 1921. I wonder if in this state, where we have the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, where we have the Priesthood and the power and 
the authority to speak in his name ; in this community where we 
are putting forth effort to rear young men and young women who 
are worthy, do the conditions: described as prevailing in Denver 
exist here? I will read a part of the article: 

"Almost any night you may see the downtown streets crowded with 
boys and flashily dressed, scarlet-lipped, loose-mannered girls — moths flut- 
tering around the searing candle of 'pleasure.' You may see them in auto- 
mobiles, riding up and down the main thoroughfares of the city. You may 
see unescorted girls — children who should have been tucked into bed by 
their mothers. They appear to be without shame. They do not hesitate 
to trade modesty and virtue for what they think is pleasure. 

"All Denver is aroused, and rightly, too. Who is to blame for this 
appalling condition? Who is responsible for the absolute lack of morals 
in these boys and girls who are to be the men and women and parents of 
tomorrow? Why are boys and girls permitted to gad about the streets at 
ail hours of the night, allowed to joy-ride in their parents' automobiles un- 
til the wee small hours of the morning, suffered to go where they will, and 
however they choose, to satiate a perverted appetite for pleasure? 

"Juvenile Judge Lindsey, clergy, school authorities, welfare workers — • 
all say the blame for this deplorable state of affairs rests upon the parents." 

It is against conditions like these that we are fighting. If we 
have been too intense in this anti-cigarette campaign, may we be for- 
given. But I say to Mutual Improvement workers, to the Governor 
of the State of Idaho, and the Governor of the State of Utah, to 
the legislators and tol all who are responsible for this anti-cigarette 
legislation, God bless you. I predict that thousands, yea, tens of 
thousands among the generation to come will rise and call you 
blessed. 

LIVE WITHIN YOUR l MEANS AND SO KEEP OUT OF DEBT AND TROUBLE. 

I was very greatly interested in what Stephen L. Richards said 
this morning on the subject of economy. No man has the right to 
live! beyond his means. It is the duty of every man to keep accounts. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 145 

He who does it will have the reins in his hands, he will be master of 
the situation, he will not be driven into bankruptcy. 

I visited the home of a prosperous farmer a few weeks ago. 
His is an unusually comfortable home. I noticed hanging on the 
wall a beautifully framed motto. As I looked at it he said: "Proba- 
bly that motto is not quite so appropriate hanging on this wall as it 
was on the wall of the little log cabin in which my wife and I lived 
during the early part of our married life. The words were words of 
the late President John R. Winder: "Live within your means, keep 
out of debt, and you will keep out of trouble." 

NOTHING SHOULD INTERFERE WITH SACRAMENT MEETINGS. 

President Grant referred yesterday to a slogan of the Mutual 
Improvement Associations adopted about two years ago : "We stand 
for spiritual growth through attendance at sacrament meetings." It 
is our desire to avoid the conditions that have been described as 
existing among the young people in tne City of Denver. One 01 tne 
means of avoiding conditions of this sort is the partaking of the 
sacrament of the Lord's supper. A man in the Priesthood meeting, 
yesterday, said to the President of the Church : "President Grant, may 
we hold a meeting in our stake, once a month, at two o'clock on the 
Sabbath day. It will be interfering with our sacrament meeting but 
once each month?" The President very promptly replied: "We de- 
sire to have nothing interfere with our sacrament meetings." It is 
when partaking of the sacrament sincerely and worthily that we 
come into unusually close communion with our Father in heaven. It 
is then our hearts are filled with a prayerful spirit and we acknowl- 
edge before our iheavenly Father our weaknesses. It is then and 
there we desire to be forgiven and firmly we resolve to be stronger 
and better. Oh, that I had the power to say something to induce all 
the people to put forth their best efforts all the time. We will not be 
judged by the sermons we preach or the sermons we hear. We will 
not be judged by the number of meetings we attend. Nor will we 
be judged by the prayers we utter or those we hear. Tf we are satis- 
fied with these things only, we are like the tree that is satisfied with 
being cultivated and irrigated and with putting forth leaves but bear- 
ing no fruit. Partake of the sacrament, or in the language of Tsaiah : 
"Seek ye the Lord while he may be found ; call ye upon him while 
lie is near." Brother B. H. Roberts said yesterday he has seen men 
whose hands were scarlet with sin, appeal in anguish for forgive- 
ness, and for the days of their youth to return thus giving them an- 
other opportunity to make their lives better. Among us are thous- 
ands of young men and young women whose lives are pure, whose 
hearts are clean. To these I appeal, "Seek ye the Lord while he 
may be found ; call ye upon him; while he is near. 

Wherever here or elsewhere there is anything virtuous, lovely, 



146 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

or of good report, or praiseworthy, these are virtues for which we 
seek. 

SPECIFICATIONS FOR A MAN. 

I have before me a copy of the prayer of an engineer. Shall I 
call it a prayer? This man was a product of my owh Alma Mater, 
Cornell University. The principal business of his life was to write 
specifications, specifications for bridges, specifications for buildings, 
for trestles, for railroads, etc. For preparing such specifications he 
was well paid. Here is his prayer or specifications he wrote for him- 
self. For so doing he received no money. They were not prepared 
for publication, but simply for his own private use. They were found 
among his papers, after his death, and were entitled : "Specifications 
for a Man." 

"To respect my country," [and this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, this 
is the thing for which we stand] "to respect my country, my profession 
and myself. To be honest and fair with my fellow men as I expect them 
to be honest and to be fair with me. To be a loyal citizen of the United 
States, to speak of the United States with praise and to act alwa}'s as a 
trustworthy custodian of the good name .of my country. To be a man 
whose name carries prestige wherever it goes. To base my expectation 
of reward on a solid foundation of service rendered. To be willing to pay 
the price of success and to pay this price in honest effort, To look upon 
my work as an .opportunity, to be seized with joy and to be made the most 
of, and not as painful drudgery to be painfully endured. To remember 
that success lies within my own self. To expect difficulties and to force 
my way through these difficulties. To turn hard experience into capital 
to be used in future struggles. To believe in my profession both heart and 
soul. To carry a ray of optimism in the presence of all whom I meet. To 
dispel all temper with cheerfulness. To kill doubts with strong convictions 
and to reduce action with an agreeable personality. To make a study of my 
business, to know my profession in every detail. To mix brains with ef- 
forts and with system in my work. To find time to do every needful thing 
by not letting time find me doing nothing. To hoard days as a miser hoards 
dollars. To make every hour produce me dividends, either in increased 
knowledge or in helpful recreation. To keep my future unencumbered with 
debt. To save as well as to earn. To cut out expensive amusements until 
I can afford them. To steer clear of dissipation and to guard my health 
of body and peace of mind as a most precious stock of trade. Finally, to 
take a firm grip on the jars of life, to play the game and to play it like a 
man. To fight against nothing so hard as I fight against my own weak- 
nesses. To be a gentleman and a Christian so I may be courteous to men, 
faithful to friends, and true to God." 

Let us, I pray, make our lives conform with these exalted speci- 
fications, and all the glorious principles of the perfect . gospel of 
Jesus Christ, I humbly pray, Amen.

THE NECESSITY OF THE CIGARETTE LAW. 

I believe that Brother Joseph W. McMurrin first called my at- 
tention to an article published in the Scientific American and repro- 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. HOLDEN 147 

duced in the Literary Digest, announcing that for fifty long years 
no young man in Harvard University had ever graduated at the 
head of his class, as the principal student, who was a user of tobac- 
co, nothwithstanding the fact that eighty-one or two per cent used 
tobacco and only nineteen or eighteen didn't use it — so that, taking it 
man for man, for those many years, the tobacco users had not be- 
come the head students of that great institution. I don't think any- 
body, with an ordinary, common, every-day head on him, needs any 
greater evidence than that of the necessity of passing anti-cigarette 
and other laws of this kind. 

INTRODUCING PROF. PERRY G. HOLDEN. 

We have with us today Professor Perry G. Plolden of Chicago, 
a man with a national and international reputation as an extension 
worker. I have been handed one or two statements made by Pro- 
fessor Holden that I will read before we have the pleasure of hear- 
ing from him : 

"Every American ought to have his own home, and every fam- 
ily ought to have an acre of ground. Men don't fight for their board- 
ing houses — they usually fight in them." And we might add, with 
their tongues, mostly. 

"Men who own their own homes don't go out on riotous strikes." 
That reminds me of a man who was a socialist, over in France, work- 
ing for a very wealthy man. He went out two or three nights a 
week to his socialistic meetings, advocating the dividing up of all 
the property. Finally he quit going, and the wealthy man for whom 
he worked asked him why he hadn't gone. "Why," he said, "at the 
last meeting which I attended some months ago, there was a cal- 
culation which had been made, and they read how much each family 
would have after we got all the property divided up, and lo and 
behold, I have more in the savings bank already than would be my 
share." 

"If the community will take care of its boys today, its boys will 
take care of the community tomorrow." 

To his son leaving for the army : "My son, keep your standard." 
On his return: "Have you kept your standard?" "Yes, father." 

"Money spent on education is not a tax. It is an investment." 

"Ami I a better man today than I was yesterday?" 

I have very great pleasure in introducing Professor Perry G. 
Holden. 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. HOLDEN. 

I am not a "Mormon," but I am a good friend of the "Mormons." 
Perhaps only one other man in these United States has said more 
things outside of Utah, in behalf of the "Mormons," and the Q'reat 



148 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

work which they have accomplished, than I, and that is Doctor A. E. 
Winship, whom many of you know. 

I am reminded at this time of a little incident. Some 
years ago it was my pleasure to be at a great Sunday School conven- 
tion at Waterloo. They had had a great meeting and had listened to 
some marvelous addresses, and as the boys thought they were about 
through they ran for their hats, but the presiding officer said: 
"I have a friend here, boys, and I want him to say a few words to 
you." And they settled back with some discomfiture, and he stepped 
before them and he said: "Boys, I don't know just what to say to 
you this afternoon." And a boy way back in the back part of the 
room didn't want to take any chances. He stood up atad flung his 
hand a little and said: "Say, Mr., I can tell you what to say. Say, 
'Amen,' and sit down." 

Now, good people, for the few moments that it is my privilege 
and supreme pleasure to be before you, I hope that you will have the 
Spirit of God in your souls, and that you will listen to what I say 
in the same spirit that I present the few things that I may be able to 
present at this time ; and I am sure you will, because I have met you 
people everywhere throughout this and other states, and it is a plea- 
sure and a privilege that I cannot describe to- you at this time to have 
this opportunity of talking for a few moments with you. 

I want to say Amen, from the bottom of my soul, to the ad- 
dresses which I have heard today, and this last address is such a 
wonderful thing that I wish that in some way it could be heard 
throughout the length and breadth of this land, as something that 
helps to dedicate and consecrate us to the great things which we can 
accomplish, if we but will. 

I want to refer to a little poem to illustrate a great principle 
upon which all progress depends. Samuel Walter Foss wrote many 
beautiful things. You know he wrote the wonderful little poem 
entitled : "Let me live in my house by the side of the road, where 
the race of men go by, men who are good and men who are bad, as 
good and bad as I." And then he wrote another wonderful little 
poem with a very common name, entitled : "The Calf Path." He tells 
the story of this calf that went out to pasture one morning from 
Boston, when it was a little shack of a town. At night the caif came 
home as all good calves do, but it made a very crooked trail, all bent 
askew, winding in and out and round about through the brush. The 
next day the old bell wether sheep took up this same trail and all 
the other good sheep followed, and a path was miade through those 
primeval woods. Then the people followed this little path, winding 
in and out and round about through the brush over to a neighboring 
settlement, and then they built little homes by the side of this path, 
and they cleared off the land and it became a road, and then they 
built houses and stores and it became a street. Then thev built 
great manufacturing plants by the side of it. and it became the avenue 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. HOLDEN 149 

over which the commerce of a continent has passed. Samuel Walter 
Foss then falters, and says : "But you know that was three 
centuries ago, and I infer that the calf is now dead." The good 
people of Boston cannot straighten that calf path today. You people 
are building, have been building and are building a great empire. The 
religion, the calf paths of home-making, and the calf paths of 
humanity-making — those calf paths that you have been making and 
will make for the next twenty or thirty years will be the calf paths 
that our children's children's children must tread for the thousands 
and the tens of thousands of years to come. Building so, putting the 
very best that we have into our lives at this time, that we may help 
to make those calf paths straight, that it may be said a thousand 
and ten thousand years from today: O, they builded better than they 
knew. I wonder if we begin to realize the, tremendous responsibilities 
that rest upon us at this hour and' this clay. People, I am wondering if 
you will lose your great birth-right ; and what a birth-right you have ! 
Men and women like these who came here, came over this great 
continent, years ago and suffered as they suffered, lost their dear 
ones, as they did, and endured that they might come here and build 
up an empire that should represent their principles ! They sacrificed 
much. 

And now, you know, people, I am wondering if you and I are 
willing to cross a continent today, as they crossed a continent in those 
days that have gone by. If we are not willing to suffer as they 
suffered, if we are not willing to go through what they went through, 
then we are losing our birth-right. I fear there are many of us 
younger people that would not endure, would not think of going 
through all that they have gone through; and don't you think for a 
moment that there isn't just as much need of suffering today for 
principles, for rights, for our boys and girls, for our homes, and 
for America as there was in those days. The question is whether 
we are consecrated, whether we are dedicated, whether we have a 
vision ! In my estimation your Church illustrates better than any- 
thing I have ever known in all America, the great principle of vision. 
Where there is no vision the people perish, and today you are blessed, 
because the people before you had a vision, and not only had a vision, 
but were willing to live and die for it if necessary. That is what 
made you great. I admire your great buildings, I admire your tem- 
ple, I admire your fine buildings and schools that I find everywhere, 
all over this land of yours ; but, people, more than all, do you know 
what I admire most? It is your people whom you have reared under 
this religion of yours. When I said to you I was a friend of the 
"Mormons," I meant all that could be said in those words. It was 
not to please you. It was because I believe in it. A religion that 
will do what your religion has done, not only for the temporal things, 
but for human beings, for God, is certainly a great religion, and you 



150 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ought to be proud of it. I want to say to you that the time is coming 
when your religion is going to be understood as it should be under- 
stood, in this world, and I want to say that through some of the 
things that you have been doing, you have come into more favor- 
able attention over the United States, within the last two or three 
years, than in all the time put together before. 

You have thought of your boys, of your girls, of your homes, and 
it is the outgrowth of religion that made it possible to put through 
your legislatures that wonderful bill that prevents the use of cigarettes 
in this state, and I say it should go out to all of the states of this 
Union. It is wonderful what your religion has done. Let me say to 
you, that I fear sometimes that the people who enjoy it, who live 
here and have not been out, as some of us have, over all this great 
world, do not appreciate the greatness of what you have. I wish 
that, some way, I could say it to you. 

I wonder if you will pardon me for saying one or two little 
things? They may seem entirely out of place, but I couldn't help 
but think of it as those words were uttered here by the! former 
speaker. Last year, as I was in your state, I went out over it with 
the hope of holding a large meeting with the one motto in mind 
that a state is made of men and women, and not of houses and fac- 
tories and wealth. So, I went out. I was telling them of your schools 
and your education, and as I was leaving Provo for a trip through 
to Ogden, where I was to speak, some of the people from the east 
with me on that commission, said: "Mr. Holden, these people look 
very much like other people." And I said : "Why, yes," but I said 
that there is a good deal of difference in some respects, and I want 
to tell you of one or two of the things I have noticed, as I have been 
out here working among these people. I will demonstrate it to you 
— and I said, do you know anywhere through Colorado or Illinois or 
Iowa, or everywhere you stop at a depot, that there you find young 
men about the depot, leaning up against the wall or railing, smoking 
and chewing and passing remarks about the people that get on and 
off the train? Now, I have gone up and down this state, and it 
has been peculiar to me that I haven't observed that anywhere. And 
they said nothing, and we got through to Ogden, and one of them 
turned to the other, and then they turned to me, and said: "Mr. 
Holden, we thought we would take you up on that statement," and 
they said, "We have made a good many stops" — I don't know how 
many, twenty or thirty stops — "and we have yet to see the first young 
man standing by the side of the depot smoking, on our trip through." 
Now, I was glad that it didn't happen that there were any boys 
smoking while they were in my company. 

The other night, at Rexburg, at that wonderful little city — and 
I want to say to you that you have a little city up there that is 
setting an example to the rest of the world — throughout the year, 
every year, all the program: which you are putting over there, and 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. HOLDEN 151 

which you have been putting over there, is wonderful. It is helpful. 
It must go through all the United States, and you people are setting 
the example to us. As Mr. Ryan came down the street he was telling 
this little incident: By the front of the town hail, there were a 
bunch of young people gathered, and he went away first, then came 
back and walked back and forth two or three times, that he might 
observe. During the time that he was there not a cigarette was in 
evidence, not a cigar; neither was there any profane language, or 
any language that wouldn't be proper before the father and the 
mother, and he told that incident there ; and that has been my obser- 
vation. Now people, your principles are right, but are we realizing, 
are we living up to them fully, or are we drifting away just a little 
bit? 

Now, I want to say, as I said to some people over at Payson the 
other day. "There are two kinds of audiences I like to speak to. 
One is a penitentiary audience and another is a 'Mormon' audience; 
for," I said, "you know that no matter what happens or how late it 
is you know they will all be there until you get through." And you 
know, good people, that one of the things that impressed so much 
those eastern people, as they came here last year, was that when 
you open your meetings you open with a prayer, and ask that the 
people might have open hearts and willing souls to gather from what 
the speaker may say something to take home; and then they closed 
with prayer that we shall take home some of these things and put 
them into our lives and into our practices. I hope you will never 
give up those little customp, because they are wonderful. Another 
thing that you are different in, the little courtesies, which you always 
have, that of your seeking to put respect and dignity into all things. 
I must compliment you upon those things because they belong to 
you. And there are a good many things that stand for education ; 
and you stand for the boys and the girls, as was said in these words 
by the President, that if you will take care of the young men of the 
Church today, and the young women, the young men and the young 
women will take care of the Church tomorrow. 

Now we must do our duty in our homes. If the spirit of the 
Lord is in your souls to such an extent, I may tell you of an 
experience and not be misunderstood, for it is not egotism. It is 
just my wish to help to put into your souls and hearts those things 
that you can take back with you to make better homes, better educa- 
tion and a better Church, and so I want to tell of this little thing. 
When growing up in our own home we had to work. It was so new, 
we were one hundred and fifty miles from the end of the railroad, 
and we grubbed the stumps and worked; and they had a ball game, 
and we wanted to go to the ball game on Saturday afternoon. Father 
didn't seem to think that was worth while, and we got a notion into 
our heads that we were going to the ball game, and we would run 
away from home. We were passing from the barbarian stage, I 



152 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

think, at that time. But that was, nevertheless, the situation. So, 
we decided we were going down to the house and tell father we 
wouldn't work like this all the while, unless we had a chance to play 
a little bit. So, finally, it was decided to do it, and then the question 
came as to who should go ; and that was different ! But finally, my 
brother gave a suggestion, that may be, if all went down he wouldn't 
lick all of us. So we all started and went pretty fast for a ways. 
Finally, we got to going a little slower, as the importance of the case 
dawned upon us ; and, by the time we got pretty near to our house, 
we saw father go out towards the barn. We let him go, and went to 
the house and told mother instead of father. Father was one of 
those stern, New England people who always said: "Boys, I guess 
you had better do so and so, now," — he never guessed but once, and 
so you see how it was we told mother about it ! I will never forget 
as we came into the house, and my brother began to tell how we 
wasn't going to work like this, she turned and looked at us and then 
she rubbed out the piece of dough in her hand, looked down the side 
once or twice, and when she was through she turned around and 
with a smile, she lined us up by the crack in the floor of the old log 
cabin — and then she stood back and looked us over and she said : 
"Boys, you're not working too hard," that is not what is ailing you, 
it is work that will make you. If you don't work you will be tramps, 
you will be beggars and will be in the penitentiary somewhere." She 
said : "No, I know what is the matter with you, you want to go down 
to that ball game on Saturday." She had just touched the spot. 
Now, I don't know how we got away from that place. I can't remem- 
ber a thing about it. I think we just evaporated, but anyway on this 
next Monday morning the thing happened in our home that trans- 
formed it and transformed our lives. I think father and mother had 
had a consultation over our difficulties, over Sunday, and as Monday 
morning came and breakfast was over, father stood around a little 
and by and by — he didn't know what else to do — he went out and cut 
an armful of wood. 

While he was out, mother spoke up and said: "Boys, why don't 
you sit down and talk with your father a little while? May be you 
can arrange to go to that ball game Saturday." Father came in. 
He threw the wood in the box, and then he stood around again for a 
little while, and we all stood around. By and by mother saw the 
situation, and I sometimes think that mothers have a little longer 
vision than fathers, and she said : "Father, it's raining this morning 
a little, why don't you sit down and visit with the boys ? I guess they 
would like to talk to you." He sat out the chairs and mother started 
about the work, but he said : "No, mother, we want you to sit down 
with us for a few minutes." When we were seated he raised up his 
hand like this, two or three times, and he said : "Boys, your mother 
and I have been trying to get a little together so that you wouldn't 
have quite as hard a time getting started in the world as we had, 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. H OLDEN 153 

but it is all for you. We can't take it with us. Now," he said, "I 
want you to help plan the work for this farm for next year." 

I want to say to you, fathers and mothers, that that was the 
richest, and I think the best, thing ever said in our home. "I want 
you to help me plan the work for this farm for next year!" The 
sun was brighter, the grove was greener. My, I got through early 
that day, and came around the corner to get the mail, but really 
to tell the boys all about what we were going to do on v the farm 
next year. On next Monday morning, when breakfast was over, 
father said: "Boys don't you think it would be a good thing for us to 
sit down for a few minutes and plan the work for the week?" So 
from that 'lay until my father's death, we sat down for a few mo- 
ments, about fifteen to thirty" minutes every Monday morning, and 
there we planned and talked over together the things we were to do. 

The idea of us boys helping father plan the work ! I remember 
thi. Monday morning, when we were through, father said: "Well, 
boys, I have no criticism only this, you planned too much." He said, 
"it might rain, or perhaps you would like to go to the ball game Sat- 
urday afternoon." And now I want to say another little thing. He 
said : "Boys, remember that when we agree to do certain things we 
must do them, if it takes all night." And I have been glad a thous- 
and times over what he said, and through all the years after, father 
never carried out anything else that wasn't agreed on, unless we had 
a meeting and settled it. 

And I want to say, folks, if we are to have great men and 
women, with richness in their souls, truth in their lives, and relia- 
bility and dependability, we must make them in the home primarily. 
It must not be turned over to the school alone, because it is a task 
that they can not handle alone, as much as they can do. And I have 
been thankful that through all these years, no matter how trivial a 
thing was promised, that thing was granted. 

One of your good citizens, you would know his name if I men- 
tioned it, at Logan the other day came to 'me and said: "Mr. Holden, 
I am sorry that I cannot hear you in the tabernacle today, because I 
promised my pupils that I would go up the canyon and eat dinner 
with them, and I mustn't disappoint them." You know how proud 
I was of that citizen who was keeping faith with these dear boys and 
girls ! That is one of the grandest things that could possibly be done. 

Now people, just one other thought, and I must close. I want to 
refer to a little thing that has had a great influence on me through- 
out my life, and that was a great teacher. I was a good deal of 
trouble to all of the teachers that came to me, and they troubled me 
a good deal. They seemed to think that, some way, they had to lick 
me in order to settle everything for the whole school, and I guess 
that was all right, as I think about it, though I didn't at that time ; 
but the time came when we had a great teacher come into our midst, 
and that teacher wasn't looking for the bad that was in us. He was 



154 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

looking for the good that was in us. I want to say to you people if 
we go through this world looking for the bad, we find it everywhere, 
but if we go through this world looking for the good that is in it, 
we find it everywhere ; and this teacher was looking for the good 
in it. One time as I leaped out of the door of the school house, at 
recess, I landed in his hands. I went out with a whoop and yell. You 
could hear me half a block away, and he got me, and I thought my 
time had come, but instead of that I felt him pulling away at my 
chin, and he was smiling, and that was an event in my life, because 
no teacher ever smiled on me before. And as he pulled, tugged away 
on it, he made a little remark. The great railroad had been built 
into Traverse city, and we had been down to see the great iron horse 
that pulled the train — he said: "My boy, you have lots of energy, 
haven't you?" and I agreed to that all right. He said: "Do you 
know, my boy, it is the same steam in an engine that makes it go 
ahead that makes it go backward. It all depends on which way you 
pull the lever." Further he said: "Do you know, my hoy, it is the 
same energy in you that will make you go ahead and do something 
worth while in this world or perhaps send you back into the peni- 
tentiary? It all depends on which way you pull the lever." And you 
know, good people, up at Rexburg, as we went over to that indus- 
trial school, that little saying of that great teacher came into/ my mind, 
■and at other times, that they had pulled the wrong lever. Your 
Mutual Improvement association, nobody, or any thing, no father 
or great teacher had taken a hold of the very life of that very 
boy or girl at the right time, so they pulled in the wrong direction. 
You know over in Chicago that seventy-three per cent of the crimes 
and murders are committed by our young men, from the ages of 17 
to 23 years — just the time when we lose so many of them, just the 
time when they are full of the ambition to do something in this world, 
and they simply pull that lever in the wrong direction. Well, this 
teacher didn't stop there. He said : "My boy, I would like if you 
will do a little thing for me for thirty days and then if you like it, 
follow it all of your life." And do you know what it was? It was a 
very simple little thing, but it has just made a wonderful difference 
in my life. He said : "When you get up in the morning, and look 
out in this great, great world again, instead of getting up dreamy like, 
with your hands in your pockets, with a grouch on ready for trouble, 
just swing those good arms of yours a little and look out and see 
what a great day it is, the best day of all creation, because you have 
back of you all that humanity has accomplished, you are heir to it 
all." And he said : "It is the greatest day of all creation* because 
you have ahead of you all of the things yet to be accomplished," and 
then he continued. "Stop just long enough to hold up your right 
hand and say: "This day I will beat my own record. I will put 
the best I have in this day's work." - 

Why, Mr. President, there is power enough in this organiza- 



PROFESSOR PERRY G. HOLDEN 155 

tion gathered here, to go back of certain fundamental things that you 
are to put over for this year's work and accomplish it, no matter 
what the obstacles are ; and when you put it over, it means that it will 
go throughout the length and breadth of this land, and among the 
nations of the world. It is wonderful what you can accomplish when 
all have the spirit of co-operation, have the spirit of working together. 

I want to give just one little illustration, and that is this, to show 
what it means to co-operate and to aid at the same thing and at the 
same time. You have that opportunity in greater degree here than in 
any other organization thai I know of in these United States. One 
morning as I went down to my office, in Chicago, a great plate glass 
window had been broken in, and the furs stolen out, and I looked a 
little farther and. there I saw a gunny sack filled with about two pecks 
of sand. The burglar had gone across Michigan avenue and scooped 
up a little sand, and then come over and slung it through the window 
to break it. I couldn't help but think had he had a train full of sand, 
taking up a handful of sand at one time, he could have been throwing 
sand yet and he could not have broken the window ; and yet, when he 
organized a peck of it, it went through easily. People, are we too 
much divided, a little there and here, and over yonder, throwing 
sand, little handsful of sand? Oh, if we can unite, then set out to 
work at it, like you have with the anti-cigarette law ; after you ac- 
complished what you did with your cigarette law, there is nothing 
that cannot be accomplished that is good. 

Now, people, it has been a pleasure to me to talk to you. I wish 
there was something I coidd say that would stimulate you, that 
would make you want every morning to put the best you have into 
the day's work, and into the years of your work. Let us remember 
that no matter what the troubles are that come to us, if we 
solve them they are for our own benefit, and remember that there is 
a worst place in every road, and we have struck it perhaps now, but 
that is no reason why we should lay down and give up. We must 
go through those worst places, we must measure up to it, and I have 
noticed them through all my work, throughout my life, that the peo- 
ple who have done things for this world are the people who have car- 
ried a burden, are the people who have crossed a continent for their 
principles and their religion. I thank you. 

The congregation sang, "Come, come, ve Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I feel gratified for the very splendid compliments that have been 
paid to our people by the previous speaker, and on behalf of the 
Saints here we thank him, particularly for the words of praise that he 
has spoken regarding us, azvay from Salt Lake City. T feel, as he has 



156 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

said, that we are coming into our own. It was. like an oasis in the 
desert, a few years ago, to find anybody who was willing to say anything 
good about the "Mormons ;" but some of the finest and most energetic 
and most faithful men in all America today, educationally and in other 
lines, are beginning to say good things of the Latter-day Saints. I 
want to say to Professor Hold'en that the Latter-day Saints sang "Come, 
come, ye Saints," as they crossed the plains, with all their hearts and 
with all their souls, feeling every word of the lines : 

"And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 
We then are free from toil, and sorrow too, 
With the just we shall dwell," 

The young men and the young women of the "Mormon" Church 
who live up; to the principles of their fathers, are as loyal and as deter- 
mined and as willing to sacrifice today as were their fathers, their 
grandfathers, and their great grandfathers, for that which we know 
and proclaim to all the world to be, in very deed, the plan of life and 
salvation, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. 

A baritone solo entitled, "The Golden Pathway," was sung by 
August Glissmeyer. 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

{Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 

The responsibility of speaking to a congregation like this is a 
task from which I naturally shrink, but I feel honored, nevertheless, in 
being asked to occupy the short time that is left for our afternoon meet- 

I am one of those who sang this hymn, "Come, come ye saints," 
often around the camp-fires as we journeyed across the plains with 
our ox-teams, in the year 1860. Many and many a night around our 
camp-fires did we sing it. I was eleven years at that time, so I re- 
member the incidents and circumstances of that long journey very well, 
and of our early settlement here in these valleys. We outfitted at 
Florence, just above Omaha, on the Missouri River, and started from 
there in June, and arrived at Salt Lake City in September ; so we were 
just about three months in making the journey. It was a wild, Indian, 
desert country in those days, and on the bluffs along the upper Platte 
River, the buffaloes covered the ranges in great abundance. 

Arriving here, we didn't know what to do nor where to go. Some 
friends or ours told us there was quite a colony of Scotch people who 
had gone up into Cache Valley that spring, and they thought that 
might be a good place for us to go. We didn't know in the least where 
that was — whether it was north or south or east or west. We 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 157 

didn't know anything about the elevation — whether it was too cold or 
too dry, or what it was. Indeed, we knew nothing about it. We simply 
went where there were some people whom my parents had known in 
the Old Country. There we settled. We lived in a dugout the first 
winter. A good many of you people, Latter-day Saints who are 
here today, hard y know what a dugout is, but we older ones know. 
I know very well about it, for we lived in the dugout, and lived there 
in extreme poverty. 

The first work I did there as a child was to help my mother glean 
heads of wheat from the wheat fields, which had been cut with the scythe 
or cradle, for there were no mowing machines or reapers and self- 
binders in those days. After we had gleaned this wheat, the heads being 
tied in little bundles, we took a wash-board and rubbed the heads on it, 
and thus thrashed out the wheat. This was our thrashing machine. 
Of course, there was the chaff and some smut mixed in the heads of 
wheat, and I had to spread the wheat on a wagon cover and take a tin 
plate and throw it up in the air, and the little breeze that was blowing 
would blow the chaff from the wheat. This was our fan mill. We 
then ground this wheat between two millstones, for there was nothing 
to the grist mill at that time except two millstones; and being ground 
in that way, the flour was quite dark and it made a black bread, but a 
very wholesome bread, after all. We had that flour made into porridge 
for breakfast, baked into cakes or scones for dinner and supper. That, 
with baked or boiled potatoes, was pretty much all the food we had 
to eat. 

Soon I had to act as herd boy and was sent out to watch our two 
cows to see that they didn't stray off, and to bring them home at night 
to be milked, for one of the chief parts of our living was the milk from 
the two cows. My suit of clothes, which my mother had made for 
me after we arrived in the valley, consisted of a shirt and a pair of 
pants, both made out of the tent cover that we had used in crossing 
the plains. It was pretty stiff and hard cloth, t for it was weather- 
beaten, but it was all that I had — that and a rope around my -waist to 
keep the suit together. That was the extent of my wardrobe. 

Everybody who has crossed the plains will recall that after we got 
to the valley and began to get potatoes and a slight variety of food dif- 
ferent from what we had had on the plains, that naturally we were 
quite hungry. My mother used to put me up a little lunch as I went 
out to herd the cows, and generally I would have it eaten before I got 
half a mile from home. Then I didn't have a thing for dinner. I 
simply had to tighten my rope for dinner. Now, it is all very easy to 
laugh and joke about it ; and, to tell you the truth, I didn't realize the 
hardships that we were passing through, because I was not yet old 
enough. But my parents did suffer and sacrificed and endured very 
much. My heart bleeds as I think of the sacrifices they made so that 
I might have it easier to get on and that the path might be made more 
easy for me and mine. But the extreme poverty that we lived in is 
fresh on my mind to this day, and I repeat with pleasure the words of 



158 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Shakespeare that Brother Stephen L. Richards quoted this morning, 
when I recall all those experiences, and I say, in truth, and with all 
my soul : "Sweet are the uses of adversity." The best lessons that I 
ever had, came through those hardships and through being compelled 
to practice the strictest economy and thrift, such as our children 
nowadays don't know anything about. In those days, it seems to me, 
we were more willing to render service and to sacrifice for the Church 
than we are today. Why, in those days, the people were called on 
to send their teams back to the Missouri river to help gather the poor 
— those who could not bring themselves to this country — and the people 
willingly responded and sent their oxen and wagons back to the Mis- 
souri river, year after year, without money and without price, to help 
gather the poor. My parents were of those who had saved enough, 
through Scotch thrift, so that they were able to buy two yoke of cattle 
and a couple of cows, and came in what we called' an independent 
company; but there were thousands and tens of thousands of people 
helped to immigrate to this country by the Saints here sending back 
their teams and their men to gather up the poor and bring those who 
couldn't help themselves. 

This work called "Mormonism" has been a great work of co-op- 
eration — a work of sacrifice and of helpfulness to others. We forget, 
sometimes, in our abundance and even super-abundance of means, about 
the conditions in which the early settlers existed when they were sub- 
duing the wilderness and making it "blossom as the rose." I know very 
well that we have our financial troubles today, and many of us, no doubt 
feel that they are about all we can stand ; and yet, when we look around 
us and see our multitude of blessings and compare them with all the 
poverty and the sacrifices that our parents made for this work and 
for our blessing and salvation, we should be led rather to glorify our 
Father in heaven for his mercies to them and to us. 

I am glad to hear such testimonies as we have heard this after- 
noon from Professor Holden, with respect to the good work that 
has been accomplished by the Pioneers and by the people who now in- 
habit these valleys. We hear quite often now from thinking people, 
a good word spoken of the "Mormon" people and what they have ac- 
complished ; but what has been accomplished is nothing in comparison 
with what will be our achievements, if we will only continue in the 
same spirit that our parents exhibited in the founding of this country 
and in laying the foundations of this great institution called "Mormon- 
ism." We cannot conceive of what power, union and strength will give 
us and how glorious and mighty this work will become if only we con- 
tinue willing to give it the service and sacrifice that it merits. 

On every hand we see evidences of disintegration, or disorder, of 
anarchy, and of the lack of the cohesive qualities that hold society 
together. The great moral principles, love of one another and obe- 
dience to law and order, are greatly lacking these days. One almost 
trembles for the condition one sees abroad in the world today. In Ger- 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY 159 

many, in France, in Russia, and even in England itself, old England, 
the most glorious of the old countries, which I hope and pray will live 
as a nation and prosper for centuries to come, because of the great 
good she has done to all the world, in being the cradle of liberty, and 
in breaking down oppression and misrule and tyranny for hundreds of 
years ; and yet in England today, it is just a question of whether the 
government can stand at all or not. Obedience to law and submission 
to the orderly procedure of civilized society are being broken down 
and there arises something above all that — the unions, the secret socie- 
ties, the pledges that men make that they will abide by their unions and 
obey them, rather than obey the law of the land ; and so, right at this 
very hour, it is a question as to whether the government of England 
shall stand or whether the unions shall rule, or whether society and 
civilization shall not be utterly broken down. The other great coun- 
tries of Europe, we know, alas, too well, something of their condition. 
In a financial way, it seems, they are well nigh on the verge of ruin, 
when we see the German mark, which should be worth twenty-three 
cents, quoted, as you can read in the Dcseret News, tonight, at one and 
six-tenths cents, which means that it is not worth six cents on the 
dollar in the markets of the world. Imagine a man or corporation 
composed of business men issuing due bills or notes until the paper 
they issue becomes worth less than six cents on the dollar. You would 
hardly expect that man or firm to ever pay out. And so it seems that 
the elements of disintegration and disorder are abroad in the world to 
such an extent that the scripture, which hath foretold of the perplex- 
ity of nations, is now being fulfilled. Even our own beloved nation, this 
nation which the Lord himself has been the means of founding, as we 
believe, and as we read in our Doctrine and Covenants, the word of 
the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, wherein he says : 
"I, the Lord, raised up wise men for this very purpose;" that is, to 
found this Government — and even this nation today has its perplexities 
so that we hardly know where to turn. 

Now, in the midst of it all, notwithstanding our small perplexities 
here at home, we have peace, the peace of the gospel ; a peace that no 
other people have ; a peace that passeth understanding. Men cannot 
understand it, but it is here — the peace of God; the peace that comes 
only through the gospel of Jesus Christ. "My peace give I unto you." 
Although we may be in more or less distressed circumstances, yet that 
we have, and we know that the Lord is at the helm ; we know that this 
is not man's organization. It is the Lord God Almighty who revealed 
himself to the Prophet Joseph Smith ; and through those revelations, 
through those instructions, this organization has been founded, and 
the power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Priesthood of the Son of 
God, has been given to this Church, and that is what holds it together 
and makes it great, and will continue to hold it together and make it 
great, and it is not the power of man, nor do we glory in man. We do 
not say, we do not allow it to be said, that Brigham Young has built 



160 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

up this Church. Brigham Young was the honored instrument, in the 
hands of God, who brought that scattered, mobbed, robbed, people to 
this land and declared that "This is the place ; here we will stay," when 
it was a most desolate, desert-looking place; for this is indeed the 
place. He didn't know, at the time, the marvelous riches of this land, 
but you can draw a circle around Salt Lake City three hundred miles, 
making this city the center, and there is more of gold, of silver, of 
iron, of coal, of lead, of copper, and of all the precious metals ; more 
variety of grains and vegetables and fruit and flowers ; more of every- 
thing that is needful for the use of man within that circle than in any 
such area in all of the known globe. This is the place. The Lord God 
Almighty, through his prophet, spoke it. Here is peace ; here is abund- 
ance, here is the power which the Lord gave, and which he alone has 
given, and which no other people in the world have. Read in the 
same Doctrine and Covenants, the book of revelations, that the prophet 
Joseph Smith gave, that the rights of this Priesthood are inseparably 
connected — connected so that they cannot be separated from the powers 
of heaven — then we are as nothing, and we, too, will disintegrate and 
break in pieces and go down and become as nothing. 

But it is true, and everlastingly true, that the rights of the 
Priesthood of the Son of God are inseparably connected with the pow- 
ers of heaven. That being true, there is a power, there is a virility, 
there is a cohesive strength that holds this people together. I have 
seen the power and demonstration of the spirit manifested in the past 
few months down in the' California mission. I have wondered some- 
times when I have heard brethren, and some who are not our brethren, 
say : "Well, you wait a little while ; wait and see the third generation, 
the fourth generation, and so on. You will see this thing going to 
pieces." Why, I recall when I was a boy eighteen years of age, work- 
ing in a little hotel at Brigham City, that Governor Stanford, and the 
great men with him who were building the Pacific Railroad at that 
time, stayed at this hotel. I was active around the place as a young- 
ster and had my ears and eyes open, and I recall hearing them discuss 
in that hotel, one evening, what a wonderful man this Brigham Young 
was ; how he had gotten the people together here, how he could guide 
them, order them, manipulate them, and do as he pleased with them, 
and so on. But Governor Stanford and the other wise men with him 
said : "Wait until Brigham Young dies, and they will be broken and 
go to pieces." They didn't know what they were talking about. I 
have seen, in the California mission within the last two months, where 
I have traveled with President McMurrin and President Grant, the 
same potency, the same virility, the same strength, the same power 
of the Holy Ghost that my father saw seventy-seven years ago when 
he joined the Church in Scotland. 

It is right here in the Church today, under the Presidency of 
Heber J. Grant, just as much as it ever was under the Presidency of 
Brigham Young, or Joseph F. Smith, or any other. Is it Heber J. 
Grant's power that is doing it? No. Is it man's power at all? No. 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 161 

It is the power of Almighty God ; it is the power of the Holy Ghost ; 
it is the power of the Priesthood of the Son of God, inseparably con- 
nected with the powers of heaven ; and that is what is giving guidance, 
and that gives guidance and direction and cohesion and strength to 
this great organization, and not the power of man, nor do we honor 
man for it. No, not to men is the honor. Thine, O God, is the honor, 
and the power, and the glory forever, through Jesus Christ. • Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The time is far spent, there is little re- 
maining." 

Benediction was offered by Elder Adolph Merz, President of the 
North Sanpete stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until Wednesday, 10 o'clock a. m., April 6, 
1921. 



FOURTH DAY 

Conference was opened in the Tabernacle, Wednesday, April 6, 
1921, at 10 o'clock a. m., by President Heber J. Grant who pre- 
sided. 

The congregation sang, "Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad 
morning." 

The invocation was offered by Elder James Wotherspoon, Presi- 
dent of the North Weber stake of Zion. 

Miss Colton sang a solo entitled, "O rest in the Lord." 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Our attention has been called repeatedly, by various of the 
brethren, during this most excellent conference, to the purposes of 
the Lord in gathering the Latter-day Saints in one place, and particu- 
larly the advantages which he had in view for our settlement in this 
particular place ; and I have been thrilled in my contemplation of this 
glorious prospect, and should like to read a few passages from the 
revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith on this subject. 

PURPOSE OF THE GATHERING. 

First, 1 direct your attention to the Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 
29 :7 and following, referring to the elders of the Church and the 
Saints : 

''And y>e are called to bring to pass the gathering" of mine elect, for 
mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts; 

"Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father, that they shall 
he gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their 
hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and 
desolation are sent forth upon the wicked; 

"For the hour is nigh, and the day soon at hand, when the earth is ripe: 
and all the proud, and they that do wickedly, shall be as stubble, and I wall 
burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon 
the earth; 

"For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles 
must be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass; 

"For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with 
all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thou- 
sand years, and the wicked shall not stand." 

I now ask you to consider this passage from Section 101, reading 
at the 39th paragraph : 

"When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with 
an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth, and the 
savor of men; 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 163 

"They are called to be the savor of men. Therefore, if that salt of the 
earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing, only to be 
cast out, and trodden under the feet of men." 

Still another passage in Section 103, seventh verse: 

"And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their 
God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the king- 
doms ,of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto 
the saints, to possess it for ever and ever. 

"But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not 
to observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against 
them. 

"And inasmuch as they are not the saviors of men, they are as salt 
that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast 
out and trodden under foot of men." 

And still another passage from Section 86, reading at the eighth 
paragraph : 

"Therefoi e, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the Priesthood 
hath continued through the lineage of your fathers, 

"For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from 
the world with Christ in God; 

"For they were set to be >a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of 
men; 

"Therefore your life and the Priesthood hath remained and must needs 
remain through you and your lineage, until the restoration of all things 
spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began. 

"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto 
the Gentiles, and through this Priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel. 
The Lord hath said it. Amen." 

These inspired utterances, full of great promise, and yet guarded 
with caution and warning from the Lord, are blessings that shall be 
ours through faithfulness — these things, I say, are an incentive and 
an inspiration to all Latter-day Saints. When I think of their import, 
what the prospects of the future are, as one of the brethren remarked 
yesterday, great as have been the achievements of the past, they are 
but the beginning of glorious things that shall be sung of Zion. Not- 
withstanding the glory of the past, the future is more splendid than 
the past possibly could have been, because this work, the work of 
God, is to roll forth until its power, its glory, its influence, shall fill 
the whole earth, and not be confined to a few valleys up in the tops 
of the mountains. 

THE WORLD'S OPPOSITION TO THE GATHERING. 

Brethren and sisters, I am; sure as we read the history of the 
various movements on the part of the Church to assemble, to establish 
themselves in one place, we have discovered that surely the enemy of 
this work, who is the devil, has been opposed to the gathering of the 
Latter-day Saints. We were not permitted to remain in the place 
where, ninety-one years ago this very day, the Church was organized. 
The powers of evil were arrayed upon all hands, and the result was 



164 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the Church had to move. Their gathering at Kirtland again was op- 
posed, and the powers of evil were arrayed against the movement to 
gather in the Saints from the various parts of the world. Again a 
move was made under pressure and force. Their gathering at Inde- 
pendence, Missouri, was fraught with the same kind of danger and 
difficulty, mob violence, people fleeing before their enemies, their 
homes consigned to the, flames. Their other effort to establish 
themselves in another section of Missouri met with the same kind of 
opposition. Do you recall the individual who harangued the Saints 
during the time that the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were 
prisoners incarcerated in one of the foulest dungeons that has dis- 
graced the footstool of God? They were told never to expect their 
prophet to return ; that "his die was cast, and his doom was sealed," 
and the voluntary advice given was that if they wanted to live at 
peace and be| happy, never to gather any more, but to scatter and not 
to organize wards and stakes but to be like other people. That is 
what the devil has desired from the beginning — that we should be like 
other people ; but the Lord has decreed that this people should be a 
peculiar people unlike other people. The answer of President Young 
and his associates, to this advice, was that they would not desert one 
another but would enter into covenant to stay by one another until the 
poorest Saint was brought out of Missouri. Again they had a sim- 
ilar experience in their gathering at Nauvoo. Though they grew here 
to larger proportions and established themselves on a more firm 
basis, nevertheless, it was the same spirit of opposition to scatter this 
people, to divide them, to send them forth, and not to permit them to 
gather and to organize. The great movement into the west was 
undoubtedly for the purpose of giving this people the chance to be 
gathered and established in peace, in security, until they should be- 
come strong enough, their works understood well enough, to find 
favor in the sight of good men who would no longer lend their in- 
fluence and power to the breaking up of this people and their being 
scattered any more. And transplanted here in this place, we had the 
opportunity to take root and to grow, and still in the time of our 
thriving, behold the enemy was again alert. Through the tongue of 
lying individuals, misrepresentations were made that brought upon 
this people an army. No matter what the purpose and motive was, 
on the part of those who sent them, in their hearts, many of those 
who came here in what was known as Johnston's Army came for the 
avowed purpose of again breaking up the foundation of this work. 
Thanks be to God that they did not succeed, and that the Lord used 
them as a means to further establish his work, and that the day of 
animosity that would seek to disturb us and drive us hence has passed 
and gone, and at last we have earned, in the estimation of the lead- 
ers of our country and a great majority of our fellow-citizens, the 
righc to exist as organized bodies. Thank the Lord for that day of 
triumph. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 165 

But do not suppose, my brethren and sisters, that the enemy is 
satisfied or that he is content to leave us alone, for he still is opposed 
to the gathering of this people, and if he cannot break them up, 
root and branch, and drive them forth, he will lay siege against us 
in devious ways, with cunning craftiness. He will seek by all of his 
power to nullify, as far as possible, the great blessings the Lord had 
in view in the gathering of the Latter-day Saints, and to wean away 
Our sons and daughters, to make paths here and there that shall 
divert them: away from the gathering place and away from the pur- 
pose of the Lord in! bringing this people together. 

OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS A HERITAGE OF REAL WORTH. 

We heard some excellent advice yesterday from Brother Stephen 
L, Richards, on the question of the financial salvation of this people, 
all of which is important, of course, and I desire to speak of another 
phase of this work wherein we must exercise conservation to the 
accomplishment of the great purposes of the Lord in our assembling 
here. Valuable as are the material things of this world, neverthe- 
less, more valuable are the sons and daughters of God. Our boys and 
our girls, as Doctor Holden said yesterday, arq our heritage that is of 
real worth. They are worth more to us than the land, and all the 
wealth of the hills and the valleys, and it is to the conservation of 
these sons and daughters of the Latter-day Saints that I desire to 
direct the attention of my brethren and sisters this morning. One 
of the means which the adversary has employed to nullify the bless- 
ings of the gathering may be noted in our several communities in the 
disposition that many of our daughters have, particularly, and some 
of our sons, to consider their birthright lightly, to treat it as a thing 
of small consequence, and to jeopardize it by forming alliances in 
marriage with those who do not belong to our faith. My brethren 
and sisters, when I think of the value of these precious boys and 
girls, I see also the future of Zion in them. Our baptisms! in the mis- 
sion fields, last year, were the largest in the history of many years, if 
not in the history of the Church, and from that source, of course, 
in years that are past, we have drawn great strength to the Church, 
but while these baptisms shall undoubtedly continue to bring into 
the fold countless thousands of the honest in heart from the various 
nations of the earth, nevertheless the source from which we shall 
draw our greatest strength shall be in the conversion and salvation 
of our own sons and daughters, because last year, for example, there 
were more than three times as many children born to Latter-day 
Saint parents as all the baptisms that were accomplished in the world. 

WE MAY LOSE OUR HERITAGE BY WRONG MARRIAGE. 

So that, the future growth of this work depends upon saving 
these boys and girls, that is, so far as numerical strength is concerned ; 



166 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

and one of the most fruitful means of losing them, of causing loss to 
the community purpose and interest, and weakening the organiza- 
tion of the Church, dissipating our forces, is the movement that 
would have us enter into marriage with those of unbelieving faith. 
Then I know, because I have had the opportunity, and not many men 
have had a better opportunity, to study this situation as I have ob- 
served it while presiding over the Northwestern States Mission, for I 
saw hundreds of our Latter-day Saint girls and many boys living in 
Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and on visits to California, 
and President McMurrin could also testify to this thing, for he has 
seen it in that section — hundreds, I say, of these Latter-day Saint boys 
and girls who have, married out of their faith who have drifted away 
— this movement does not look to the concentration and building up 
of our communities nor the establishmient of this work, but it works 
to" the very opposite. It is scattering, it is dividing, it is dissipating 
our forces. 

THE EVILS OF BEING UNEQUALLY YOKED TOGETHER. 

I have no quarrel, nor shall I engage in any quarrel, with those 
who do not belong to us, who have sought our daughters or our sons 
in marriage. I do not blame a non-"Mormon" for trying to get a 
"Mormon" girl, because he would not find anybody better if he went 
all over the world ; but 1 do seriously question the wisdom of that 
boy or girl who jeopardizes the glorious purposes and privileges the 
Lord had for them, who, through much tribulation, brought their 
parents to this place, where they might provide the .opportunity for 
believing sons and daughters to marry believing sons and daughters ; 
where the opportunity might be provided for them to grow up, like 
calves in the stall, as the ancient prophet said, to inherit these bless- 
ings. I believe there was wisdom in Paul's statement, indeed I know 
it, for I have heard tales of sorrow and distress too long for me to 
repeat here, that would make a volume, that have come from those 
disobedient sons and daughters who have disregarded the desires and 
wishes of their parents and who have made an alliance wherein they 
are not evenly yoked together, and Paul's advice was good, that you 
should not be unevenly yoked together. I recognize that we are 
not the only Church which believes in this doctrine. We accord to all 
men the same privilege, to preach this doctrine and to hold their own 
within their own circle. This is not selfish. We are asking only that 
which we accord to others, and that which others, many of them, 
claim for their own ; but in asking this we are asking it for the 
peace and the blessing of our boys, and girls first of all. Is there hap- 
piness in the home of those who are unevenly yoked together? My 
experience is that it is utterly impossible for a Latter-day Saint girl, 
trained and reared in a "Mormon" home, with "Mormon" ideals of 
the right relationship of husband and wife, parents and children, the 
very family institution itself, the care of children, their education, 



ELDER MELVIN /. BALLARD 167 

their training, their care in times of sickness and in death — there is 
no possibility for that boy or girl to enjoy to the highest and the 
fullest extent peace on earth, joy and happiness in this present time, 
&&d salvation and glory in the celestial kingdom of God, under this 
arrangement ; it is not possible. 

AN ILLUSTRATION. 

I remember receiving a letter recently from a young man on a 
mission, who disregarded the advice I gave him, not to take this step. 
He said ten me that he now regretted it, because, he said, "We do not 
pull together, my wife and I do not have the same kind of ideals nor 
ambitions for our children, and when I ,would go ahead she holds 
back." He said it reminded him of an experience he had on the 
farm. They had a team 1 of mules, and one day one of the mules took 
sick, and in order to let the work go forward, they 1 substituted a 
blooded horse. When the blooded horse was ( hitched up with the 
mule, the horse being faster and more willing to go forward, every 
time he would get a little ahead of the mule, the mule would stop, and 
so, he said, it was nothing but a seesaw ; they did not get anywhere. 
He said, "Now, that mule would have been a very good mule hitched 
up with another mule, but it wasn't a good thing to hitch it up with 
a blooded horse." The implication is again ,that you canjnot work 
successfully unequally yoked together. I do not mean to imply, of 
course, that the Latter-day Saints are the only ones that are blooded 
horses, and all the rest are mules, not at all, but I do mean tot say that 
you do not work successfully under that combination, and I have re- 
ceived from more than one girl the plea to please convey to the 
daughters of Israel their experience and their advice not to take the 
step they took. Now, so much for the individual blessing. 

UNEQUAL MARRIAGE IS A LOSS TO THE CHURCH. 

Then again, let me say that there is a loss to the Church. How 
many of those born under these circumstances remain within the 
fold ? Not many. There is a loss that we cannot afford to have 
constantly dissipating our forces and running away from us. 

THE APPROVED AND APPOINTED WAY OF MARRIAGE. 

My brethren ,and sisters, again, not only do we desire that our 
sons and daughters shall marry within the fold, but we desire that 
they shall come into the house of the Lord and enter into the sacred 
and holy obligations of matrimony in the Lord's approved and ap- 
pointed way. We desire it again for their peace, for their salva- 
tion. Our records show that the divorce rate amiong those who en- 
ter into marriage in this holy, approved way is very much lower in 
the Church among that g'roup than among the group who marry for 
time only. And why? Of course it is significant to all of us that 



168 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

those who enter into these holy bonds of matrimony for time and 
eternity do not begin to' plan to separate and to part, but they begin 
to plan to live together not only in time but in eternity, for we are 
not building for time, we are building for eternity also. And there 
are connected with these blessings certain privileges, of course, that 
except men shall enter into them in this life, or they are performed 
in this life for men and women, those who fail to receive these bless- 
ings cannot come into the celestial kingdom of God where God and 
Christ dwell. It is a "Mormon" truism! that is current among us and 
we all accept it, that as man is) God once was and a(£ God is man may 
become. That does not signify that man will become God. I am sorry 
to say, and yet it is a truth, that not many men will become what 
God is, simply because they will not pay the price, because they are 
not willing to live up to the requirements ; and still all men may, if 
they will, become what God is, but only those who are heirs of the 
celestial glory shall ever be possible candidates, to become what God 
is. We desire, therefore, that these boys and girls shall have the 
safety and protection of this kind of marriage. 

TEMPLE MARRIAGE A PROTECTION TO WOMEN 

There are some states that have regulations providing for the 
physical examination of men and in some instances women before 
certificates of marriage are issued. I lived for a long time in a 
state where that practice was in vogue and still is in vogue, and I 
have wished that this were true everywhere. But even if it should 
be extended to all the states of the Union, still I say to the daughters 
of Israel there is a better protection for you than this, and a better 
protection than ever will be provided by any law of the land, in that 
you have the privilege of requiring the man who proposes marriage 
to you to put himself in condition so that he can pass muster before 
his bishop to ascertain and to know — that that man is not only phy- 
sically clean but he is morally clean and that he has faith in God, that 
he has honored the holy Priesthood and that he is worthy to go into 
the house of God. That protection is the best that possibly can be 
provided for the daughters of Israel, and it is yours. Will you not 
embrace it? Do not jeopardize your happiness, your future success 
in time and in eternity, by! ignoring this great and wonderful privilege 
that has been given to the daughters of Israel. Then many a boy 
who has entered into that solemn and holy obligation in this, the 
Lord's appointed way, has kept pure and clean by the covenants 
which he makes that he will be true to his wife, and he has stood in the 
hour of temptation many a time and resisted it because of the ob- 
ligation which is upon him. Is that not a strength to the boy as well 
as a protection to the woman? For I want to tell you that no hap- 
piness can come to men or women where confidence is gone, and 
where there is not absolute trust in one's companion. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 169 

NO DOUBLE STANDARD WITH THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

Oh, thank the Lord that in this Church we have no double stand- 
ard. We have heard it, I have, from my childhood. I received from 
my mother and from, the organizations of the Church this admoni- 
tion. She taught me to live as clean and as chaste anck, as pure as the 
girl I married and asked to be my wife, the mother of my children. 
She taught me that she would rather hear of my death than that I 
had been immoral and, had debauched myself. Thank God for thai 
advice, and that I had the courage and the strength to keep it and to 
live up to it. 

So, by reason of this provision, there is safety and protection and 
happiness to the sons and daughters of Zion that cannot come when 
they go out of their faith and mingle and associate in these relations 
with those who have entered into no such covenant and have lived 
no such life as this. And yet I do not wish to imply for a moment 
that there are not those who are clean, who are chaste and who are 
pure, who live in the world; I do not imply that at all, but I do say 
that here are the institutions and organizations that require such a 
iife of Latter-day Saint boys and girls. 

THE EVILS OF DIVORCE AND CHILDLESS MARRIAGES. 

One of the great sources which brings sorrow and trouble in the 
marriage state and that is distressing this country is the divorce evil. 
I notice that at a great gathering of women recently, in Washing- 
ton, this problem was discussed and it was suggested that the women's 
vote must come forward to save America or else we shall be on the 
highway to moral degeneracy, because the divorce rate in this coun- 
try has been mounting until it is announced that we now excel Japan 
in the number of divorces in this country and Japan has been 
leading the world. What is the answer to it? I thought, as I heard 
Dr. Holden yesterday, there is no problem that now distresses the 
world, of a moral character, of a financial character, of a social 
nature, except the key to solve it is in the hands of the Latter-day 
Saints, even as the Lord said he would make his people a light unto 
the world. We Lave just begun to solve these problems; we are go- 
ing to go forward, and w,e will solve that problem also. The great 
contributing cause to divorces in this country are childless marriages, 
wherein men and women live to themselves the selfish life and pan- 
der to make these glorious bodies, with their divine endowment, 
mere harps of pleasure, and they will reap disgust, discomfiture, 
and condemnation, when they come to stand in the presence of Him 
who gave to man as his first great commandment, "Multiply and 
replenish the earth." 

My brethren and sisters, boys and girls who enter into marriage 
in the Latter-day Saints Church, in the Lord's approved way, enter 
in properly instructed, and if they live up to their obligations to one 



170 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

another they will keep, by all the power God has given them, that 
great and holy commandment, and reap for themselves joy, peace, 
happiness and blessings, in this life, and blessings of an eternal char- 
acter in the world to come. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE NOT TO BE ABSORBED. 

Brethren and sisters, we are not to be absorbed. The Lord has 
decreed it. He knows how to keep us where we ought to be, and 
when we get straying off the track he knows how to bring us back, 
for he will not desert this people. His promise was that this work 
should never be overcome nor given to another people. He may 
chastise us, he may correct us, but he will not let us go astray. If we, 
therefore, keep his commandments, we not only shall escape chastise- 
ment, but we shall come into our glorious heritage, and the light of 
Zion shall continue to rise, for behold, her day has come, her light shall 
shine, the glory of it shall be reflected to the uttermost ends of the 
earth, and the men of all nations shall come and say, "Let us go up 
to the mountain of the house of the God of Jacob, so that we may 
learn to walk in his; paths," and the attention of the angels of heaven 
shall be called to the earth, and unto this people ; and behold, the 
King shall come and he shall receive his people and reign with them 
a thousand years. 

God speed that day, for Zion's future is as sure as the sun shines, 
if we will only keep the commandments of the Lord, ajnd all these 
glorious things shall come to pass. May the Lord find us. and our 
children, and children's children, identified with this glorious work in 
the day of its triumph, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A solo entitled, "O Lord, remember me," was sung by Mrs. Ruth 
Brewerton. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters: I have been very greatly impressed with 
what has been said from this stand during the sessions of this con- 
ference, and I believe, with all my heart, that youi and I will go to our 
homes with a resolution in our hearts to live nearer to God than we 
have ever done before. This is the desire of my heart, and I trust 
that we will be able to retain, to a very marked extent, the greac 
spiritual feast that we have enjoyed during the last three or four 
days. 

Yesterday afternoon when some of the brethren were speaking 
of the pioneers to this state, certain thoughts came to me, and I too 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 171 

was impressed with a greater realization of the fact that the Latter- 
day Saints have always placed their faith in God and in his Son Jesus 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world. With the faith in God, in Christ 
Jesus and in the Holy Ghost, they have approached their daily lives, 
and their lives through all the years, and they have retained that im- 
plicit faith to this day. If there is anything in the world that is 
needed at this hour the world over, it is the simple faith in God and in 
his Son Jesus Christ. 

Not long ago I walked into a school room in southern Utah, and 
while sitting listening to a recitation in western history, the school 
teacher of that grade made this remark to the boys and girls of the 
sixth grade: "The 'Mormon' pioneers who came to these valleys be- 
fore the railroad were a good people, but they were uncultured and 
unprogressive ; we are thankful that the generation of today is be- 
coming cultured and realizing the day of progress." 

"The 'Mormon' pioneers were a good people but uncultured and 
unprogressive" — that to come from a person who posed before those 
children as one who knew something about the history of America 
and the western part of this continent. I want to go on record here, 
holding, as I do, the Chair of Western History, at the University of 
Utah, and say that a finer type of people never lived than the "Mor- 
mon" pioneers who settled these valleys of Utah, and they were a 
cultured and progressive people ; I sometimes think they were more 
cultured and progressive than we. are today, but this is not true, if 
the generation of today is realizing the great power and light of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. ' 

The "Mormon" people were brought from different nations of 
the earth. They became convinced in those very early days of the 
truthfulness of the gospel by the revelation of God to them individ- 
ually. They became an inspired people. God never called upon 
cowards to do work for him, but he has given the work invariably to 
high types of people, high minded people, a highly spiritual people. 
You Scandinavians that have come from the Scandinavian countries, 
you English, you Germans, and all who have come from the different 
nations of Europe, did not accept the gospel of Jesus Christ because 
of your ignorance. You accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ because 
of your intelligence, your high mindedness ; and though you were 
poor in worldly goods in your native lands, you were rich in spiritual 
endowments. The peoples of the world that have been gathered to 
these valleys from the nations of Europe are the highest types of 
those nations, because of the fact it takes a high type of man or 
woman to understand this gospel of Jesus Christ and to obtain a testi- 
mony of its truth. 

The Latter-day Saints came to these valleys but a few years after 
the organization of the Church by a few men who were not edu- 
cated in the sense that they had been to the great schools of America, 
but they were educated in the greater laws of righteousness, men who 



172 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

had communed with God, men who had opened their souls to the light 
of heaven. Those men assembled, and by the gift and the power of 
God, organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then 
began their historic march from the Atlantic seaboard to the far West, 
to these mountains, and wherever they went, the Latter-day Saints 
were first imbued with the wonderful testimony that they had to 
bear to the world, namely, that God had spoken from the heavens. 
Could there be any greater ideal for; which to work? With that ideal 
they came into the far west, they developed the lands ; they were a 
progressive people. In 1840,, at the time of the invention of the mod- 
ern farming implements, the modern plow, the modem threshing ma- 
chine, mowing machine and sewing machine, they took those ma- 
chines, and adapted them to their work, to their daily lives; they 
brought those inventions to the valleys of Utah, and used them in de- 
veloping the soil. But not only were they progressive from an econ- 
omic viewpoint, but those " Mormon" t pioneers thought tfirst and 
foremost of the intellectual and spiritual development. In a study 
of seventy-two towns in the history of the Great Basin, we have found 
that invariably the "Mormon" pioneers, wherever they went, not only 
built their cabins but they built their school and meeting houses; they 
had their teachers, and the first school in Utah was opened less than 
three months after the advent of the pioneers to this valley. In 1850, 
by an act of the first legislative assembly of the State of Deseret, the 
first university west of the Missouri river was inaugurated; the fac- 
ulty in the year 1850 was organized, and that university still lives on 
the hill that in 1850 was picked out by Governor Brigham Young and 
the legislature for a higher institution of learning. I know the criti- 
cism has been given that it was not a real university. It was a real 
university for that day, for we recall the fact that in 1845 to 1850. 
Harvard, Columbia and Yale universities were only high schools ; in 
fact their curricula would not equal the curricula of the high schools 
of America today. The ideal of university training was indelibly 
stamped on the hearts of those pioneers. They developed the schools. 
They had their different educational organizations, their philosophi- 
cal societies — Wilford Woodruff was the president of the Scientific 
Society, here in Salt Lake City. They held meetings, and had their 
various meetings of the priesthood for intellectual training. Finally 
the different auxiliary organizations were formed, and the youth of 
the Latter-day Saints invited to attend the meetings of those organ- 
izations. 

When you come to study this great educational movement in the 
Great Basin, you will find that the "Mormon" people fostered every 
factor possible for the development of the youth. They built a theatre 
in the wilderness, and the sole purpose was that the people might have 
amusements of the proper kind. After they built this theatre in the 
wilderness, the master of the English language, Shakespeare, was 
studied, his plays were produced, and I remember not long ago of 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 173 

having the opportunity of taking Sir Johnston Forbes Robertson 
into the old Social Hall here, now called the "Little Theatre;" we 
walked in there three or four years ago during a very stormy day, 
and as we went down the aisle, that greatest actor of all English 
speaking people looked above the stage and saw the bust of Shake- 
speare. He took off his hat and said, "That tells the story as to 
whether or not your pioneers appreciated art and the finer things of 
life." 

True, those pioneers did not have what we have today, and I 
know that Professor Holden, when he stood on this stand yesterday 
and spoke to us, realized the fact they were essentially agricultur- 
ists. They had to get down to the soil and conquer it to lay the 
foundation for the institutions of today; but in conquering the soil, 
they loved it and realized more than any other people that agriculture 
is the basis of our whole civilized life. Many were the times when 
the farmer plowed, planted his seed, and went forth to water the dry 
land, some weeks later, but there was no water. Many were the 
times that the pioneer farmer saw his wheat field dry up. Many' were 
the times he went forth to harvest but 'there was no< harvest. And 
yet he did not move to another clime. His prophet had said, "This 
is the place," and in those words he had faith and his faith sustained 
him. There was an altruism developed among those pioneers that we 
do not find today — a right altruism, a real spirit of co-operation. The 
altruism, the love of neighbor, which is fundamental to the love of 
God, has never been surpassed since that day, if it has been equaled. 

Each town of early-day Utah was an ecclesiastical unit, with so- 
cial and political tendencies. The ecclesiastical unit was based on the 
idea, of individual power and self-development through religious prin- 
ciples. Each individual was responsible in this religious scheme to his 
God; each was independent to grow intellectually and morally in the 
sense that man is in the image of God. It is necessary to say this 
in order that we may understand the democracy of the town govern- 
ment of early-day Utah. Politically and socially, all rights were in- 
herent in the people. 

The power that held the people together was the religious feel- 
ing; and with this the economic interests common to all. In these 
social groups, the desire was to live and let live. The people were in- 
tensely practical ; the physical conditions of he country made them 
so. They were compelled to apply their 1 religious idealism to the 
immediate problems in hand. 

The two ideals fundamental in traditional American thought are 
the ideal of individual freedom to compete unrestrictedly for the re- 
sources of the country, and the ideal of democracy, where the gov- 
ernment is for all the people and by all the people. American democ- 
racy has always been based on free lands. Such ideals were always 
present in the colonizing of the valleys of Utah. But we must not 



174 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

forget that the "Mormon" colonists were always religious in their 
organization in form as well as in purpose. 

I am glad to say that Dr. Turner of Harvard University has re- 
cently said in a lecture before the students there : "The 'Mormon' 
people, in the far west, developed the finest type of New England 
town government that was ever developed outside of New England." 
That alone stamps the "Mormon" people as fine types of Americans, 
and when they came here they plunged into the wilderness with the 
Constitution of the United States as their fundamental organic law. 

Were they cultured? Yes; because they were men and women 
of ideals, because they had implicit faith in God; the faith that is 
needed in the world today. Where they cultured ? Yes ; because 
those "Mormon" pioneers planted here, I believe as no other people 
planted in the history of America, the five great institutions of all 
civilization ; namely, agriculture, the home, the church, the state, and 
the school ; and in a study of these five institutions of civilization 
will you find the splendid history of the "Mormon" pioneers who 
settled here in those early days. The teacher who spoke as she did, 
spoke in ignorance. 

I pray God that we may retain that old-fashioned, implicit faith 
in God that our fathers and mothers had. 

This is what has been writtern about those pioneers and has gone 
from this state to some of the universities, not only of America but 
the world, and it was the paragraph that closed a recent lecture at 
the University of California : 

"Side by side with the development of the natural resources of Utah," [our 
temporal history] "Utah has constantly cultivated those things that make for 
culture. The growth of the Church has been brought about by the virility and 
vision of its leaders, and it has been a'ble to solve the new problems of civiliza- 
tion. In the process of expansion the 'Mormon' people have won distinction 
not alone in industrial enterprise, but in the fine arts as well; in fact, more 
than in the fine arts, more than in industry, the 'Mormon' people have won 
distinction as the finest type of religionists living today. The bond of sympathy 
between the practical and the esthetic, between reality and vision, between the 
temporal and the spiritual, the Latter-day Saints from the beginning have ever 
regarded as the secret of present strength and the measure of enduring achieve- 
ment." 

The late Judge C. C. Goodwin once paid the following tribute 
to the "Mormon" pioneers in the columns of the Salt Lake Tribune : 

"It is good to see the Saints bring their children in to conference. We 
wonder if many of them stop to tell their children the beautiful story of the 
evolution that, the full history pictures, since the day that the first weary 
company came down the eastern mountains and halted there. 

"That was Salt Lake's first moving picture ; there has been none like it 
since. Contemplating it, the temple, the hotels, theaters, churches, hospitals, 
great business houses and stately homes, the temples to religion, to learning, to 
industry, to justice and mercy, all vanish away; the roar of business becomes 
still; the silence which the desert broods comes back; gardens vanish, the flow- 
ers all fade; there is nothing as now seen save the surrounding mountains, the 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 175 

lake shimmering in the distance, the sun shining from above and the desola- 
tion that wrapped all this region round like a burial robe. Even the branches 
on the few stunted trees hung drooping like funeral plumes, while the sough of 
the breeze coming down from the hills, or up from the lake, was as mournful as 
is the requiem chanted on the shores of the Styx. 

"The way a state is carved out of a wilderness and rounded into form is al- 
ways an interesting theme. The way the first stakes of civilization were driven in 
Utah was drarnatic enough to be set to words for the stage. In their penury and 
distress the first act of the Utah pioneers was to sink upon the earth ; not in 
prayer for help, not in lamentation and despair, but in glad praise service in 
thanks to the power that had led them through the wastes and over the trans- 
fixed billions of the everlasting hills to a place of rest. 

"Then their work began. They were not dreaming of fortunes. 

"The struggle before them was to live and that struggle continued almost 
without abatement to the end. Often only the barest necessities were vouch- 
safed ; few comforts, no luxuries. In that rough friction their youth was worn 
away; the men surrendered their ambitions, the women folded fond dreams and 
a thousand innocent longings in their hearts and drew the silence of self-sacrifice 
over them forever. 

"But then the miracle commenced. The desert began to transfer the wrinkles 
and sadness from its somber face to theirs, while in turn it began to absorb the 
splendor of their youth, and to cause it to be reflected in flowers and fruits and 
golden grain and vines in which the birds made their nests and filled all the soft 
air with their songs. 

"Later still, as though touched with pity, the irresponsive mountains began 
to swing back their adamantine doors, revealing the treasures within, where they 
had remained secreted, waiting until the time should be ripe for the coming of 
progress and enlightenment. The overwearied eyes of those pioneers have 
mostly all closed : their hands, gnarled by labor, are nearly all folded, but the 
miracle is still being performed. More and more fields are annually rescued from 
the desert; more and more flowers are blooming; more and more birds are 
singing; wider and wider fields grow golden under the harvest sun, recalling the 
old legend, that artist angels, in the long ago, came here from Summerland and 
with divine pencils, dipped in the dyes where light is brewed, left it all as a 
frame for a city beautiful which man was to build ; we may believe that the 
building of that city has been begun and is progressing toward perfection. 

"This is the story that should be told the children when they are brought 
in to conference, and then they should be told to listen and note if they cannot 
still hear the echoes of that first praise service, with which the fathers dedicated 
this soil to the enlightenment which comes through devotion to duty, through 
the omnipotence of patient labor, and through faith in God." 

God grand that we may see these great things in our history, and 
that the truth of the faith and the development of the Latter-day 
Saints and their great message may yet become known to the honest 
in heart and to all the world. T ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

To one not accustomed to occupying this position and one whose 
mission is to labor in helping to care for the temporal affairs of 
the Church, this is indeed a task. However, I rejoice in this op- 
portunity that I have to address you, for I have discovered in my 



176 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

short ministry that, through service we grow best and develop most. 
Never in my life have I felt the responsibility that rests upon me more 
than I feel it at this time, and never in all my life have I had in my 
heart a greater desire to "keep the commandments" than I have 
now. 

I could not help but think yesterday, while Bishop Nibley was 
addressing us, of the contrast in his life and my life. The seventh 
son, thirteenth child in order of birth, a comfortable home, a mother 
whose every thought was for the welfare of her children, a father 
whose life stands out as a shining example in service, a grandfather 
whose life was given in an attempt to help establish this work upon 
earth. 

It has-been my privilege to know intimately (if it can be said 
that a boy through having the opportunity of being in the presence 
of such men almost constantly, can be intimate), four presidents 
of this Church, with their counselors; I have seen one complete 
change in the quorum of the Twelve, and have known personally all 
of these men. Under such influences and conditions, I have grown 
to manhood, and when called to the Presiding Bishopric, if I had 
been asked what my equipment was, I perhaps would have answered 
that it had been my privilege to hold every office in the priesthood, 
from that of deacon to high priest ; that under the direction of good 
men, faithful and true, I have been encouraged to function in each 
office. It has been my privilege to labor in the Sabbath school, as 
a student, as a teacher in the class, and as an aid in the stake or- 
ganization. In the Mutual, as a student, as a class leader, as an of- 
ficer in the ward, and as an officer in the stake. What a wonder- 
ful blessing has come to me. And yet, well do I remember, soon 
after having been called to this position, being sent to one of our 
stakes with a message to deliver to the bishops of that stake, upon 
going into the room where they had assembled, and seeing before 
me men whose hair was gray, or turning gray, there came upon me 
the feeling of fear. It seemed to me absurd, for me, a youth, to 
stand there before those men tried in the service, and attempt to 
instruct them in their duties. My first thought was to retire ; how 
could I get away from this responsibility? And oh, how I prayed 
that God would bless me and give me strength equal to that re- 
sponsibility. It came, but not with words of logic, not with the 
power of oratory to convince them, but, as I attempted to form my 
thoughts in words, I found, as I uttered them, that they fell upon 
ears_ long trained to patience, upon hearts that breathed forth the 
spirit of charity, upon souls that had faith in God and honored his 
Priesthood. I went from that meeting with a new vision, a new 
sight. I saw the bigness of the work in an entirely new light. I 
found that this equipment which I thought I had was only the 
foundation upon which I must build, and I made a survey of myself. 
Where must I start to improve? T found that it was much easier 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 177 

for me to tear down, much easier for me to find fault and to criti- 
cize, than it was to build up, than it was to construct. I found 
that it took no effort whatever to tear down, but it took strength, it 
took courage, it took the power of will to build up. And from that 
day to this, I have tried ; God knows I have tried. I have been 
encouraged very much fromi time to time in reading the scripture. 
One passage that I have had on my mind, since the opening remarks 
of this conference, I will read, and perhaps comment upon. And 
let me say that this was uttered by one of the apostles of old, and 
I think applies in this day with the same force that it did at thac 
time : 

"Wherefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and 
envies, and all evil speakings." 

And I hope I will be permitted to add to that the remarks of Pres- 
ident Penrose, in which he says avoid speculations, for in this Church 
there is no need for speculations, no room for lying, or for the man 
who indulges in it ; there is no place for malice or for him who has 
malice in his heart. He who has guile cannot live properly his re- 
ligion, and be a true servant of God. Hypocrites are undesirable 
and cannot become useful in the sight of God. To envy is to take 
a step downward and lessen our power to do good. Evil speaking of 
our brethren, of our neighbors, of those who are in authority, is the 
first step to apostasy. 

"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk ,of the word, that ye may 
j;row thereby: 

"If so be ye have tasted that the Low is gracious. 
"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but 
chosen of God, and precious, 

"Ye also, as lively ston.es, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priest- 
hood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 

"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion 
a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall no) 
be confounded. 

"Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which 
be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made 
the head of the corner, 

"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which 
stumble at the word, being disobedient : whereunto also they were ap- 
pointed. 

"But ye arc a chosen generation a royal priesthood, an holy nation, 
i peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the prais.es of him who hatfc 
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 

I repeat: 

"Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priest- 
hood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 

"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a 
peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath 
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." 

I stand before you at this time, my brethren and sisters, with 
Joseph Fielding Smith and Hyrum G. Smith, a living testimony to 
the fulfilment of the promise of God to his servant, Hyrum Smith. 



178 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

My greatest desire, and my fondest hope are that, I shall prove 
faithful to the Priesthood which has been conferred upon me 
through God's servants, that I shall prove to these men who hold the 
fulness of that Priesthood, that I shall prove worthy of you, my 
brethren, and my sisters, from, whom I gain so much strength, that 
I shall prove true to my God, to whom I owe all that I have and my 
very existence. God grant that when I shall have finished my work 
here upon earth, he can say of me, "Well done, thou good and 
faithful servant," and I ask it through his Son Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am delighted to have Elder Golden Kimball here ; he has been 
in poor health, but we are glad that he is able to be with us at this 
conference, and I am very much pleased to have him talk to us. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters, 1 have been hanging on the hook so 
long during this conference that 1 am nearly exhausted. I have had 
some wonderful thoughts, but you waited so long they have nearly all 
oozed out of me. 

When I came in the Tabernacle yesterday afternoon, I was met 
by one of my old missionary friends. He said, "Hello, Golden, I 
thought you were dead." Now, I want to notify my friends, and 1 
have some good friends — I have tested them out, 1 know — not to 
worry about me; that when I am dead — and it is an awful job to get 
there, I have found that out, when I die, I have made arrangements 
for a brass band. I like the idea of lots of noise and confusion, 
people inquiring, "Who is that?" "Why, Kimball's dead." Then the 
people won't worry any more about me. 

My brethren and sisters, I attribute my partial recovery, and I 
hope I will continue to improve, very largely to the kindness and sym- 
pathy of my brethren, the presidency of the Church, the council of 
the Twelve, and to the First Council of the Seventy and other friends. 
1 came home last October to attend conference and was taken sick, 
and remained at my home nearly two months. When I got around 
and thought of my brethren and their kindness and sympathy for 
me, I want to tell you, brethren, T felt this was a mighty good world. 
1 have repeated hundreds and hundreds of times, while I was sick, 
the words of Frohman when he went down to his death. He said, 
"Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure of life." I want 
to tell Frohman I have not got that in me yet. T think this is a pretty 
good world. I think I am safer here among my brethren who know 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 179 

me, although we have had an awfully hard time getting acquainted. 
Brethren, I have learned a number of lessons. I have had several, 
to me, quite serious experiences. I remember thirty-seven years ago 
I was secretary for Brother Roberts who presided over the Southern 
States Mission. After I had traveled for a year without purse or 
scrip and had tested God thoroughly, I found the Lord's word good. 
He never failed me. I traveled in the state of Virginia. I went on 
one trip with a young elder, and I say it with a good deal of pride, 
six hundred miles, without purse and without scrip and without 
friends. No man had ever heard the voice of a "Mormon" elder 
where we traveled. We left a trail behind us, a trail that other 
elders have traveled, and at no time during that three months did 
I sleep outdoors, but I came mighty near it a lot of times. I thought 
the Lord surely had forsaken us, at times, but when it came to the 
last test, someone's heart was softened, and they fed us and they 
gave us a bed so we had no use for money. 

During my labors in Chattanooga with Brother Roberts, as it 
was in the early history of that city, I was thoroughly poisoned with 
malaria. I was drunken, but not with strong drink, but with malaria. 
1 was as yellow as a parchment. As I went along the streets one day 
in Chattanooga, a stranger met me. He happened to be a physician. 
He said, "Young man, I don't know who you are, but if you don't 
do something for yourself you will die." "Well," I said, "I will not, 
as I'm a 'Mormon,' you can't kill them." When Brother Morgan 
came down and relieved Brother Roberts, I was still in the office, 
looking worse than ever. Brother Morgan looked me over carefully. 
He said, "Brother Kimball, you better! go home. The mission is 
very hard run for money. It will only cost twenty-four dollars to 
send you home alive, but it will cost three hundred to send you home 
dead." It was' a matter of business in that office ; they had no money. 
I think maybe that was all I was worth. "No," I said, "Brother Mor- 
gan, I don't want to go home. I believe I was called on this mis- 
sion by revelation ; at least they told me so in my blessing. Now God 
has been good to me and he has been faithful and true,"and I want 
to test him out, and if he can't take care of me, when T have been 
as faithful and true as I have, and made the sacrifices I have, then 
he is not the God of my fathers." So Brother Morgan let me stay, 
and I filled my mission. I have my release. It is the only release I 
have ever had, and I prize it very much. When I was released he 
said, "Brother Kimball, now you'd better go right straight home." 
I said, "Brother Morgan, I can't. My mother suffered the pain of 
death to give me life. She has watched over me from my childhood 
to manhood, and she loves her people. She heard Brother Jedediah 
M. Grant, President Grant's father, preach in Philadelphia, when she 
was a girl twenty years old. She heard only the one discourse, and 
she embraced the gospel, and she took the Church works and 'went 
(o her people, a good people, an honest people, a wonderful people 



180 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

she had, but they all rejected it, and she had to leave, and it broke her 
mother's heart. She went back to Philadelphia, and in company with 
President Jedediah M. Grant and his wife traveled by teami to Nau- 
voo and married my father, and that is how I happen to be here to- 
day. My mother watched me grow to manhood. You know the one 
great vision and dream she had? It was that her son, her eldest son, 
should grow to manhood and go back to her people and let them see 
what 'Mormonism' had done." And I went, and God kept me alive, 
and I visited them for five weeks, and I preached in their church, and 
my mother's relatives told their old minister, who had preached there 
for thirty years, that unless he let Christine Golden's son preach, 
they would leave his church. So I got to preach. He was a clever 
old fellow, too. I thought I would ease up on him a little and get 
another chance. So I preached in his splendid church building, and 
when I got through he said to his people, "This man has told the 
truth. I have preached it to you for thirty years." Well, I said, 
"I'll fix you the next time," but I never got another chance. At 
any rate, while I was there I secured the names of over one hundred 
and fifty of my mother's people, and I brought them back to her, 
and her dream was fulfilled ; and in the winter of 1834 my brother 
Elias and I accompanied our mother, and we did the temple work 
for the Golden family, and I am still alive. 

Brethren, I have had a pretty lonely time. I have had a pretty 
hard struggle. I haven't suffered much pain. I have got a pretty 
good brain, but it has not been big enough to handle my body; I have 
tried to direct and control my body, but it wouldn't obey. I have 
been administered to by some of the best men in this Church ; no 
better men ever lived than the men who have administered to me, 
but I am sorry to say, and ashamed to say, I did not have the faith 
to be healed. There is not a man in this Church who knows any bet- 
ter than I do that God the Father and Jesus Christ the Redeemer are 
the great physicians. I have unfaltering, unwavering faith in God 
the Father and in his Son Jesus Christ, but you cannot be healed 
without faith ; you have got to have the faith. I have got the gift 
to heal others. I have seen wonderful healings. Few men have seen 
more, unless they were better men. I have witnessed all kinds of 
diseases healed, but I could not get the faith, I failed. I just had 
enough faith to keep alive, that is all. I talked with President Grant, 
and I thought climate would help me ; I was a little short on faith, 
so I tried climate for nine months. As I told you, I came back last 
October sick, and I went back again and tried climate again. Now 
I am on my feet. I went to a specialist; I have had an X-ray taken 
of my lungs ; I was scared to death he would find something, but I 
thought I would test him out. My family wanted v to know what was 
the matter. Well, I found one of my batteries somewhat damaged, 
that is, they told me so. Then he shot me full of serumi and full of 
iron and strychnia, at five dollars a shot. That pretty near broke my 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 181 

heart when I got through with that specialist. I did not want to 
go to him, but to please my family I went. They are very anxious 
for me to live, for some reason. I hardly know what it is. I have 
been awfully neglectful of them. My family has been secondary 
in my work. I hope the brethren will be awfully careful what they 
Fay about families. I hope they will be very tender of men's feelings, 
when they talk about our children and about parents being responsi- 
He for their children — that their sins will rest upon them. God 
knows, I have got all I can carry without packing anyone else. Now 
you want to be awfully careful and awfully tender of those things, 
because in the wisdom of God he will gather our children together. 
They are God's children. My children are God's children. God is 
just as much responsible for my children as I am. 

• Now, brethren, I want to say to you — I do not know whether 
you know it or not — there is a lot of things you do not know that, you 
ought to be told — if there are any people who are neglected in the 
Church of Jesus Christ, it is the families of the leaders of the Church. 
They go out and tell, you how to take care of your families, and they 
are away from home and their families take; care of themselves. You 
want to be careful. 

Brethren and sisters, when I am satisfied, everybody is satisfied. 
I can see a hole in a doughnut. I have- always grieved over a dough- 
nut. My mother was a doughnut maker. When she showed me 
those doughnuts, I grieved over the hole. Some of the people say 
there is no hole in a doughnut, but I never could agree with them. I 
always see the hole and forget about the doughnut. I think we have 
some faults and some failings. I have been worried a little. While 
I have been absent I was afraid that we might get too material. I 
have been a little afraid for God's people and myself, afraid that we 
would trust too much in money and forget God, and I came to this 
conference hungry, hungry for the word of God. While in San 
Francisco I attended the Latter-day Saint Church on Sundays, I took 
part in the worship of the people. I have watched those young elders 
carefully, for over a year, off and on, and have seen them develop 
and grow and become men. But I was hungry for the word of God, 
and I have come back to my people. I think of the words of Ruth. 
I never quoted them before ; maybe I cannot now, but she said : 

"Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy 
people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 

"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried." 

That expresses my feelings. God save the people. 

I never felt better, I never felt surer, in all of my ministry for 
over twenty-eight years in this Church, that we are God's people, 
that God is sustaining President Grant as prophet, seer and revelator. 
He is sustaining his counselors and the twelve apostles. 



182 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

By the way, in conclusion, I would like to admonish you people 
not to pray only for the Presidency and, the Twelve, but once in a 
while pray for the First Council. I don't know of any other council 
that needs it worse. We need your help, we need your assistance, we 
need your faith to prepare that great body of priesthood to fulfil 
their appointment in this Church. I know as well as I know that is 
my right hand, if you will call that body of priesthood to the foreign 
ministry they will go, but we have advised them not to go until you 
call them, and I have told them hundreds of times, not to go until 
they were sent. If you will call them and get behind' them, I promise 
you in the name of the Lord they will go. I know. God bless you. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Thomas E. McKay, 
President of the Ogden stake of Zion. 



CLOSING SESSION 

Conference convened at 2 o'clock. President Heber J. Grant pre- 
sided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day 
of salvation." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Lemuel H. Redd, President of the 
San Juan stake of Zion. 

. A sacred solo, "Fear not ye, O Israel," was sung by Margaret 
Merrill. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

{Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

1 am grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the privilege of be- 
ing in this gathering today, and for having the privilege of standing 
and bearing my testimony to the goodness of the Lord unto me, as 
one of the younger sons of Zion, in these the last days, arid one of 
the younger members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

I have recently had a privilege which I have dreamed of ever 
since early boyhood — the privilege of going over at least some of the 
ground, visiting some of the places visited by the prophet Joseph 
Smith, and by the early members of the Church. Through my teach- 



ELDER II Y RUM C. SMITH 183 

ings, from my infancy, I have never doubted in the least the divinity 
of the mission of the prophet Joseph, but 1 have often desired to visit 
some of the early points of history, and just recently that privilege 
was granted me. From that historic town of Palmyra, New York, I 
visited the house or place in which the first edition of the Hook of 
Mormon was published. 1 also visited the old bank at Palmyra; I do 
not know how long it has been used as a bank, but it looks as if it 
had been used for many years. It is today being occupied, and bus- 
iness is being conducted very much, I suppose, as it was nearly a 
hundred years ago, without any of the so-called modern improve- 
ments. At that bank I was permitted to view what is claimed to 
be a copy of the first edition of the Book of Mormon, or the print- 
er's copy. In that little town, I also noticed four distinct churches, all 
facing one another, one upon each of the four opposite corners of 
an intersection of two streets ; and from residents there I learned 
that those churches still maintain their names and their practices, op- 
posing one another, of course, until they all unite to oppose the "Mor- 
mons" — a very impressive lesson in Church history to me, because 
I had always believed, and believe today, the testimony of Joseph, 
the prophet, that he went to those churches and saw their contentions 
in his day, when he was a boy. He heard them crying', "Lo, here is 
Christ," "Lo, there is Christ," "Come into this church, for this is the 
right church," and he wondered how all four of those churches, and 
others perhaps, could be the right church when they were all claiming 
it and claiming it differently. And so, I could not help but think how 
natural it would be for him to go back to his home, only five miles 
distance, and wonder in his own heart where he could find the truth, 
and, with the earnestness of his soul, he sought refuge in the scrip- 
ture, as it had been taught to him. 

I was also permitted to go into that sacred grove where the boy 
sought an answer to his prayer, and I instinctively felt the very 
spirit that one would naturally suppose would be in that place from 
its sacred history, and the entire time that I was in the grove I felt the 
very presence of the Spirit of the Lord. It seemed to me to have a 
care for everything about the grove. 1 also had the privilege of g'o- 
ing into the old jail where the prophet and his brother, my great- 
grandfather, gave their lives in testimony of this great principle and 
the power of the everlasting gospel. I also visited that city beautiful, 
Nauvoo, which today is only a very small place, but I could imagine 
the love that those Saints must have had for that place when they 
could look toward the highest point from all the surroundings and 
admire the workmanship of their hands as was manifest in the tem- 
ple which they had erected to their God, equidistant in three direc- 
tions from the river on a general slope. The river, the great Mis- 
sissippi river, surrounded it in a sort of letter "D" equidistant from 
the temple on three sides, (north, west and south). Today those 
landmarks are fast passing back to their mother earth ; and I was im- 



184 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

pressed with the thought that in a very few years to come, very little 
but history and perhaps the photographs and paintings of these be- 
loved homes will be about all that will be left. There is no mark to- 
day of the temple, except a few of the stones that were once in the 
walls, and a little part of) an old barrel that marks the place of a well 
from which the water was taken to supply the temple. Very few 
marks of that wonderful history are left today. A city where once 
was housed and homed twenty thousand Latter-day Saints, today 
only about fourteen hundred people make their homes. 

I am grateful for the privileges that I have enjoyed and for the 
testimonies that I have received; and the experiences through which 
I have passed only make me more determined in my efforts to serve 
the Lord.; As it has been said in this Conference, this is the work of 
the Lord, and I pray that God will bless his people and bless me as 
one individual member, that we altogether may go on! serving him and 
accomplishing the great work which he gave to the prophet Joseph 
Smith and his associates when this Church was organized ninety-one 
years ago today. I desire, my brethren and sisters, to so live that I 
may merit the blessings, and carry the responsibility that is desired of 
me from my Father in heaven, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, who 
is at the head of this great work. 

I desire also to leave one word of admonition beside a word of 
blessing. It is natural for many of us to follow extremes, or to look 
for extremes. There is always danger in extremes. Therefore, I 
say, beware of extremes, beware of extremes. I think that nearly 
all of us can apply this principle in our lives. I should like to apply 
it as it appeals to me, as one of the officers of the Church, in a parti- 
cular direction. There are many in the Church who never get a 
written blessing for their guide or their comfort. This is an extreme. 
It is the privilege and right of every faithful member in the Church 
to receive a written blessing, for his guide and his comfort, at the 
hands of certain officers in the Church, and there is little or no ex- 
cuse for anyone going without this privilege. On the other hand there 
are others who get a multitude of written blessings, and I have dis- 
covered that some have even lost regard for, or faith in, their bless- 
ings, because they have received conflicting blessings. They have 
received a multitude or many, and they have discovered a conflict. 
Therefore, their faith is lost, or they are discouraged, and they lose 
regard for their blessings. Therefore, I say again, beware of ex- 
tremes. 

Now, to make myself plain, it is the right of every faithful mem- 
ber of the Church to receive a written blessing for his guide, either 
at the hands of a stake patriarch or at the hands of the presiding 
patriarch, who are authorized to pronounce and seal blessings by the 
laying on of hands, which is an ordinance in the Church. Now I 
believe that the Lord knew what he meant when he required, through 
revelation, that these blessings should be written for the purpose of 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 185 

refreshing our memory and aiding us to put them into practice rather 
than going back at every opportunity or every few months or weeks 
or so, to get another blessing. I have thought, and have been im- 
pressed, that this was one of the great reasons why the Lord required 
us to make a record of all of the patriarchal blessings that are given 
by his patriarchs in the Church. And I should like to admonish my 
brethren and sisters to read their copies carefully and not to be 
easily discouraged and think that because their blessing is short it, 
is incomplete, or because it contains only a few promises, that there 
is something else that has not been written or has not been prom- 
ised. Yet, it is true that all the blessings and all the promises that 
the Lord has in store for us are not embodied in one written bless- 
ing ; why, surely, but that written blessing is a guide, and it is a key in 
a way, through your faithfulness, to the blessings which are prom- 
ised unto thq faithful, and may be an index to your whole life. And, 
it isn't a good thing to go without a blessing, that is one extreme that 
I wish to warn you of j and the other is to beware of getting a multi- 
tude of blessings, in the fear of your losing your faith in the one 
you have already received, and as long as you get those blessings 
according to the rules that have been established in the Church for 
our guide, there will be no danger. At the present time officers of 
this order in the Priesthood are placed in nearly all of the stakes of 
Zion. These officers are authorized to officiate only for members of 
the stake in which they reside and their kin, and when we go to mak- 
ing little side rules from that, to accommodate certain individuals, 
then we discover that someone else wants a special order, a special 
blessing, a special favor, and so we have to make exceptions to the 
rule, and sometimes the exception becomes the rule. 

Brethren and sisters, let me admonish you to follow the rule or 
rules of the Church pertaining to your written blessings. Every mem- 
ber of the Church has access to his blessing, either at the hands of 
the presiding patriarch or at the hands of the patriarchs in the stake 
where he resides, and not here and there and everywhere, because 
there is order in the work of the Lord. 

I am grateful, grateful indeed, my brethren and sisters, for the 
privilege of laboring in this wonderful ministry. There are a num- 
ber of men who have been called to this great position in the stakes 
of Zion, who, I suppose because of their study and their experience, 
have feared to go ahead and exercise their callings. I also have 
feared. Sometimes I tremble with fear, because I feel the responsi- 
bility of officiating in this sacred calling. Nevertheless, I feel to trust 
in the Lord, and if I am deceived, it is due to the weakness of the 
flesh and not to the willingness and the humility of the spirit. And 
so I have often wondered out of the hundreds and hundreds of 
promises that have been written and made by the patriarchs, how 
many of those wonderful promises the Lord will be able to make come 
true. I am astonished at the testimonies of the Latter-day Saints 



186 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

as they come back, declaring that those promises have been fulfilled 
and are being fulfilled all over the Church ; and I am grateful to be 
permitted to officiate in this sacred work. I see hundreds of young 
men as they go out from their homes into the world, to carry the 
message of life and salvation to the world. Under the duties of my 
office I am enabled to admonish these young men, to give them a 
blessing, which, with their faith and their works, the Lord is able to 
bring to pass a fulfilment of the promise or promises, and they go 
out to all the world, in all the nations of the world where the gospel 
door is open, they have faith in the promises given and they live by 
them, and they come back and testify, that the blessings have been a 
source of strength and power to them. Others go out into the world 
without the blessing ; and many of them have written to m,e in this 
manner, "Brother Smith, here am I, away over in Liverpool ; I am 
on a mission ; I was unable to get my blessing when I went away from 
home, and now I am over here in the service of the Lord ; my com- 
panions have blessings and they receive comfort from them ; can't you 
send me a blessing, I need a blessing, can't you write one, and send 
it to me?" Well, I have to send word to them that I can pray for 
them, and when they come home, then I can officiate for them in 
the regular way and give them a blessing. And so I admonish the 
young elders, the missionaries, both men and women, to get their 
blessings before they leave home, so that they will have these com- 
forts and guides in their missionary experiences abroad. 

I also have the privilege of officiating for many young people 
as they start out into the great battle of life, and they receive com- 
fort, consolation and guide, because they have faith in these prom- 
ises. And I am grateful to the Lord for the privilege of officiating 
for them, because they frequently come back and testify that the 
Lord has blessed them, and that their promises have come true, and 
they have been a source of great strength to them in hours of trial, 
in hours of doubt, and in hours of sickness. 

I also have been permitted, and am permitted, to officiate for 
many fathers and mothers in Israel, and they have testified to me 
that they have received comfort and consolation in their responsibil- 
ities of parenthood. And so I am grateful for the privilege of of- 
ficiating for them in this sacred work. 

Brethren and sisters, beware of extremes. Tt is not necessary 
that you go without a written blessing ; neither is it necessary that 
you burden our records with your simple desires of perhaps wanting 
only a question to be answered rather than a desire for a written 
blessing at the hands of the patriarchs in Israel today. 

T pray God to bless this people and those who preside in Israel 
today. I frequently hear my brethren pray very much as Elder Kim- 
ball hears them praying, for the leading authorities of the Church, 
naming only, of course, the first ones, and when T hear the remark. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 187 

"And then all the rest of the authorities," I always come in for my 
share, because I need the blessings of the Lord. 

I pray the Lord to bless the Priesthood of God, and those who 
are called'to bear it in the earth, even from the greatest to the least, 
and I pray God to bless the faithful members of the Church, both 
old and young. I pray God to bless our lands, that the destroying 
elements may not interfere with our blessings. I know that there 
are a great many people now wondering how much danger this won- 
derful storm is going to cause. Brethren and sisters, it may cause 
some danger, and some damage, but the Lord is not sending this won- 
derful storm to crush us nor to interfere with our blessings. This 
wonderful storm is a blessing to the multitudes of his children in 
these valleys of the mountains, and while it may interfere with some 
of us, in slight ways, the great end of this storm will be a blessing 
to us. 

I pray also that drought as a destroying element may not inter- 
fere with the blessings of this people, and if the brethren and sisters, 
the members of the Church, will hearken unto the counsel they have 
received in this conference, as they have done unto the counsel that 
was given six months ago, in a like or similar manner, the Lord will 
continue to multiply his blessings upon us ; and that his blessing may 
be upon us, and his name be honored and glorified forever, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I read here last evening at the priesthood meeting some items re- 
garding our missionary work, and I thought they would be interesting 
to all the Saints, so I will read these items again : 

MISSIONARY STATISTICS. 

The mission membership of the Church at the close of 1920 
was 99,870. 

Tithes paid in all missions of the Church, $456,699 ; an increase 
of more than a hundred thousand over any previous year. 

Value of mission property, $1,467,571. This does not include all 
of the Hawaiian property. 

Spent for charity in all the missions, $34,532. 

Baptisms in all the missions last year, 5,087. This is the highest 
record in many years. 

There were 1,727 missionaries in all the missions on January 1, 
1921, an increase of 574 over January 1, 1920; while the average ex- 
pense of the missionaries of the Church was $37 per month in 1920, 
or $10 per month higher than in 1919, and that is the highest expense 
per elder in the history of the Church. 

The number of baptisms per elder in 1920 was about three. 



188 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Calls of the missionaries were answered at 2,926,416 homes, and 
the elders had 2,617,345 gospel conversations. They sold 34,703 copies 
of the Book of Mormon, and distributed 7,023,378 tracts and held 
135,532 meetings. 

AUDITING COMMITTEE REPORT. 

The report of the auditing committee was then read as follows : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 1, 1921. 
To Presidents Heber.J. Grant, Charles W. Penrose, Anthony W. Ivins, 
First Presidency, and to the Saints in Conference assembled: 
Dear Brethren and Sisters: The Church Auditing Cotamittee desire 
to report that they have carefully examined the receipts and expenditures 
of the Church for the year 1920, as the same appear from the books and 
vouchers in the office of the Trustee-in-Trust, and in the office of the Pre- 
siding Bishop. We find them correct and fully accounted for. 

The usual care has been exercised in having the records disclose every 
detail of every transaction, besides which, during the past year, the auditing 
and examination has been emphasized by having the financial transactions 
of the Church submitted to a monthly check. 

Along the lines of securing Church statistics, we think there should 
be some consolidation of effort; and your Committee shall take an early 
opportunity of submitting their views upon this subject to the First Presi- 
dency. 

Your brethren in the Gospel, 
W. W. RITER, 
HENRY H. ROLAPP, 
PETER G. JOHNSTON,

vacancy had been caused by the death of Jesse Knight. 

ALL THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES HEARD. 

President Grant said: We have had the privilege of hearing 
from this stand, at this conference, from each and all of the General 
Authorities of the Church, without having to tell any one of them 
how long he could talk, which has been really a pleasure to me, because 
it is anything but pleasant to limit our brethren in their remarks. Quite 
frequently in our late conference meetings we have had to ask our 
brethren to speak three, five, eight or ten minutes, at most, in order to 
have time to hear from all of the General Authorities. We have an 
hour and five minutes left, and I have concluded to ask my counselors 
to make some remarks, and when they finish I will make some myself. 



190 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

I suppose that one, reason for our having a little spare time is that we 
have had one extra meeting during this conference, the general ses- 
sions of the conference lasting three days and a-half. 

Brother John Wells is at home sick. If he had been here, he 
would have been asked to speak. I forgot to mention that he had not 
spoken. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

"And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles who was separated 
from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit 
of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth 
upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the 
promised land. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought 
upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many 
waters. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles 
upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon 
the, seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles, and 
were smitten. 

"And T beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, 
that they did prosper, and obtain the land for their inheritance ; and I be- 
held that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful, like unto my 
people before they were slain. 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had 
gone forth out of captivity, did humble themselves before the Lord; and 
the power of the Lord was with them; 

"And 1 beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon 
the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them; 

"And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that 
the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against 
them to battle. 

"And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity 
were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations." 

WE BELIEVE IN REVELATION. 

The Church, in its very incipiency, declared to the world, among 
other fundamental doctrines of its creed or belief, that it believed all 
that God had revealed, all that he does now reveal, and that he 
would yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the 
Kingdom of God. Revelation is the revealing or making known that 
which was not previously known or understood. The Church has 
always claimed that gift. It is indispensable. Tt must exist in the 
Church. 

REVELATION BELONGS TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE CHURCH. 

It belongs to every member of it. The Lord has declared, in this 
same book from which I have read, that when the doctrines which are 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 191 

contained in the book are made known to the peoples of the world 
the truth of its contents shall be manifest by the gift of the Holy 
Ghost to all of those who seek God in faith with a desire; to know the 
truth. 

BUT IN AFFAIRS PERTAINING TO THE CHURCH, AT LARGE, THE KEYS ARE 
WITH ONE MAN ONLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE. CHURCH. 

So that revelation, the gift of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, who 
manifests the truth and leads us into it, is given to all of the mem- 
bers of the Church, but in affairs which refer to the Church at large, 
its doctrines, its policies, its purposes, the keys remain with the man 
who has been chosen, whom we have sustained here, by our vote, to 
occupy that special calling and to speak in the name of the Lord for 
the Church at large, and revelations for the benefit of the Church, its 
government, its doctrine, must be so confined. They will never come 
through emotional women ; they will never come through men whose 
right it is not, and never has been, to receive them. That is what we 
mean when we say that they key of authority vests in and belongs to 
the president of the Church. It has no application to other people. 
It applies only to the Church. 

MANY NOTED CHARACTERS OF HISTORY HAVE RECEIVED REVELATIONS. 

The doctrines of the Church just as fully recognize that from the 
beginning of time God's Spirit has striven with man and his will has 
often been revealed to man, just as this scripture which I have read 
declares that it was revealed to Columbus, who was the discoverer of 
this country. That fact is as fundamentally a part of the faith of 
the Latter-day Saints as is any other doctrine. The Church has al- 
ways believed and taught that those men who came to America, 
guided by God our Father, inspired by him, men who sought asylum 
where they might worship God according to the dictates of their 
conscience, did come moved upon by his Spirit and his revealed will 
to them, that they were so established here, that they were so pro- 
tected, and that it is because of the inspiration of God which] has come 
to men that we live today under the constitution which forms the fund- 
amental law of this government. The thought that this gift should 
be enjoyed by us and by us alone has never been a part of our faith. 

Let me read here, but let me go back just for a moment before 
reading. We believe, and it is a part of the doctrine which we have 
always taught, that those men who in early days broke away from 
the mother Church, which had degenerated until all kinds of wicked- 
ness were permitted to be committed in its name through license and 
written permission given by the bulls of the Pope, against which 
Luther protested, against which he stood firmly when his very life 
was at stake as he stood there before the Diet of Worms and de- 
clared that except he be convinced by reason and by the scripture, 



192 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

he could not retract anything — acted under the inspiration of God. 
It was the power and Spirit of God which prompted the man to 
begin the opening of a better and greater dispensation. We believe 
that John Wycliffe, whose body was burned and the ashes of it 
scattered upon a river of England that it might float down to the 
sea and be obliterated, was raised up of the) Lord to publish the 
Bible and make it, as he said, so common that the plow boy in the 
field would understand it as well as the Pope. He gave his life for 
it. God inspired him to do it. He inspired Tyndale, burned at the 
stake because he dared to raise his voice in defense cf the simple 
truths contained in the scripture. The Lord was with him. The 
spirit of revelation was upon him. It marked and blazed the way 
which we have followed after. Now, that is the doctrine of the 
Church. Let me read here briefly again from the Book of Mormon : 

"Behold, that which is of God, inviteth and enticeth to do good con- 
tinually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, 
and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God. 

"Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge 
that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God, to be of 
the devil. 

"For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may 
know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know 
with a perfect knowledge, as the day-light is from the dark night. 

"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that they may 
know good from evil; wherefore, I shew unto you the way to judge: for 
everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, 
is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with 
a perfect knowledge it is of God, 

"But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in 
Chi-ist, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a per- 
fect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, 
for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one ; neither do his angels ; 
neither do they who subject themselves unto him." 

WE WISH GODSPEED TO GOOD MEN AND WOMEN 1 EVERYWHERE. 

It appears to me, my brethren and sisters, that this doctrine is 
made so plain in the scripture which I have read that there need be 
no doubt regarding it. I only wish to say to good men and women 
everywhere that we pray for them and wish them Godspeed and co- 
operate with them and bless them in every effort which they put 
forth for the accomplishment of that which is good, that which will 
uplift, that which will enlighten, that which will make better the lives 
of men and women, that which will draw men towards Christ, who 
is the Redeemer of the world, and away from the influences of the 
evil one, which are so dominant in the world today. 

THE CHURCH DICTATES NO CREED OR; POLICY TO ANY OTHER BODY. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never as- 
sumed nor desired to dictate the creed or the policy of any other 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 193 

religious denomination. We grant to our fellow workers who stand 
and speak in the name of the Lord, the right to receive the inspiration 
of his Spirit for the control and government of their own congrega- 
tion; and if they lack that, if there is a church in which the man 
chosen to represent it is not endowed with the spirit of revelation 
that he may communicate it to his congregation and thus lead them 
in the way of the Lord, woe be unto them ; they need to seek after 
it and get it, for only by the inspiration of that Spirit can the will 
of the Lord be done. So we stand here not to restrain, not to with- 
hold support, help, or blessing, from any man or woman under heaven 
who is seeking to do the will of God and bring other people to do it. 
The Lord bless them, and bless us and help us to understand that this 
right does belong to the Church and it cannot be taken from it, for 
without it, confusion and dissolution would immediately occur. 

THE SHEEP KNOW THE VOICE OF THE) GOOD SHEPHERD. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the blessings of this con- 
ference. I felt that I would like to say just this much before its 
conclusion. 1 pray that you may understand the spirit and meaning 
in which I say it, as I believe you do. I have been just as thoroughly 
converted to this truth all my life aa to any other, that I cannot stand 
before a congregation of Latter-day Saints and declare that which 
is not true and in harmony with the will of the Lord and make them 
believe it. The sheep know the voice of the good Shepherd, and a 
stranger they will not follow. Cultivate the spirit of revelation, every 
one of you ; plead with the Lord for greater endowment of his Spirit. 
That it may direct us in the walks of life and help us to live in har- 
mony with the plan which he has . given us in the organization of 
the Church, is my prayer for us all, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I believe that the remarks that have been made to us by Brother 
Ivins have been understood and appreciated and believed in by this 
congregation of Latter-day Saints in general conference assembled. He 
has enunciated the doctrine in great plainness that most of us have 
heard almost all our lives. It has been taught from this stand not 
only at conference times but in many discourses that have been de- 
livered by the servants of the Lord. It was the doctrine of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith made plain through him by revelation from God. As 
quoted or read by President Grant last Sunday morning, it was pro- 
claimed by the prophet and the president of the Church, Brigham 
Young. He was a great leader. He was a man of very strong mind 
and will and expression, and he always taught this doctrine in plain- 
ness — that while there was but one man at a time on the earth to re- 
ceive revelation from God for the Church, for the whole Church, the 
spirit of revelation rested down on the members of the Church as well 



194 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

as upon men holding the Priesthood of God. So with those who suc- 
ceeded him in the presidency. I do not believe there has been one of 
them who has not taught that doctrine. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' VIEW OF REVELATION. 

There has been associated with that revelation read by the presi- 
dent on Sunday as to the right of the man who stands at the head to 
receive revelation for the Church, the doctrine and theory and practice 
that three men holding the presidency of the Church preside over it 
in all its departments, and that when anything was to be introduced of 
a new character or kind for the government of the Church, it would 
come from that presidency and would be submitted to the quorums of 
che priesthood and to the Saints generally. This was followed by 
President Wilford Woodruff when what is called the "Manifesto" came 
from him to the Church. It was presented to the Church and voted on 
by the Church in conference assembled as doctrine for the Church. A 
resolution was passed to that effect, offered by President Lorenzo 
Snow. We should' understand this. Brother Ivins has made it very 
clear that the revelations spoken of by the president on Sunday morn- 
ing for the government of the Church were for this Church, not for 
other churches or; societies ; and at the same time that which was said, 
that which we have believed in, that which we have practiced, is not 
confined entirely in all respects to the one man ; that the spirit of revela- 
tion is for all of the Church, every member thereof, but for the govern- 
ment and guidance of the Church as an organized body, that authority 
is vested in the one man that stands at the head. And it seems to me 
that a little common reason would show the value of it. The Lord 
said we were not to receive as revelations for our government that 
which came from anybody but the man whom he had chosen to be at 
the head, and if he transgressed he should not have power except to 
appoint another, nominate or name another, in his stead to be at the 
head of the Church. Now we can see very quickly, if we will use our 
common sense, that if every man of prominence in the Church could 
introduce a revelation we would be, as Brother Ivins said, at once 
in confusion. There is none in the Church who has the right to in- 
troduce as divine revelation something that is new and different from 
that which has been revealed before, but the man who is appointed to 
do that, so that we might all come to the unity of the faith, and when 
that is received by the Church, and adopted as part of our creed, it be- 
longs to the Church, just as much as anything that has preceded it. 

AS TO MISINFORMATION. 

Some time ago we were afflicted by false reports, sent out 
from this city by telegraph generally speaking, to the world, pretend- 
ing to give sentiments expressed by the leader of the Church. Lately 
there has been some reformation in that respect. I am glad to know 
that the telegraphic wires are not now as they were at that time under 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W . PENROSE 195 

the domination of men animated by the spirit of falsehood. When 
I was editor of The Deseret News, my time was largely taken up by 
making or giving refutations of statements of that kind sent over the 
wires from Salt Lake City by the Associated Press. I became acquaint- 
ed some time after with the president of that association, Mr. Stone, a 
fine, splendid, able and fair-minded man, and had the pleasure per- 
sonally to talk with him on this subject; and since the time when he 
became fully acquainted with the manner in which dispatches were sent 
from this city, he saw to it as far as possible, that these false reports 
were not circulated. Now, I am glad to say there is a change of spirit 
in that respect ; but, at the same time, sometimes things are published 
and very often talked about without being published, which are filled 
with misinformation. 

I have heard considerable about this now, concerning the remarks 
made by President Grant last Sunday morning. It is represented that 
he stated that there was no man living but him who had any right to 
receive a revelation from God. He did not say that. You who were 
here know very well that he did not make any remark of that kind. 
What he tried to make clear and did to my mind, and I believe he did 
to all the congregation, was that fundamental doctrine concerning the 
revelations of God to this Church as an organized religious body ; that 
only the man who stood at the head could be authorized Revelator, the 
end of controversy ; if there were any controversy arising, he could seek 
by revelation from God to be able to correct error as well as to pro- 
claim truth. 

MEN WHO PRETEND TO BE CALLED OF GOD TO RECEIVE REVELATION. 

Now, I just mention the fact, not that perhaps it is of very much 
importance, but it is associated, too, with some things that have been 
done in some quarters of the Church. Men have started up pretending 
to be called of God to receive revelation from God to the Church. I 
knew one man of that kind some years ago, who came to the president 
of the Church and demanded the keys, for he was "the man mighty and 
strong sent to set in order all things in Zion." Well, he did not make 
much of an impression, but he came two or three times, and at last 
he was ordered out of the office and he stumped off on one leg — be- 
cause he had only one good leg, the other was a wooden one — and he 
went off as the "mighty and strong" one, and we heard nothing more 
about it. That is not a fair sample, perhaps, of the men who have ar- 
rogated this position to themselves. Lately there have been some 
members of the Church who have claimed to have revelation from God 
to organize a United Order, without calling it that at first, but latterly 
they did, and so they threw in their possessions and placed them in 
the hands of one individual, and he received what he called revelations 
from God, and the people joined in with him and were induced to pray 
that they might find out whether it was true, and they have been led off 
by a false spirit. Some of them have repented, and others who did nut 



196 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

repent but continued in their bad works of darkness, have been excom- 
municated from the Church. Now here is simply a warning voice from 
the man that stands at the head, of the Church that people shall not be 
led astray either by ideas of that kind which I have just mentioned, 
or in regard to other matters that affect their condition in time and 
eternity. 

MEN WHO HAVE ARROGATED TO THEMSELVES THE RIGHT TO MARRY. 

Some men have arrogated to themselves the right to marry when 
it has been shown very clearly during this conference they have no such 
right. The right to marry for time is vested in certain officers of this 
Church, and the right to marry for time and eternity can only be 
solemnized and celebrated under the direction of the Church authori- 
ties, and there is but one man at a time, the revelation itself says, 
that holds the keys of this authority. And how in the world men of 
brains, men of standing in this Church, can be led off to the right or to 
the left into works of wrong and darkness by persons having no such 
authority, and who cannot have it, under the revelation itself on this 
subject — how they can do that has been very perplexing to me. But 
when I read in the revelations of God, as the Apostle James puts it, 
that "God is not tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man, but 
every man is tempted when he is led away by his own lust," that ex- 
plains the thing clearly to my mind. 

Now I have made these few remarks in regard to this subject be- 
cause I am fully desirous, with all my soul, that our people should un- 
derstand, and that the world, if they want it, may understand, and 
that our friends who are not of our faith may not misunderstand our 
position, and if they choose to misinterpret and to twist and turn about 
the words that are uttered from this stand and proclaim them to the 
world as the words of our leader, why they must take the conse- 
quences. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS BELIEVE IN ANCIENT AND MODERN 
REVELATION. 

It has been a doctrine, as Brother Ivins has said, from the be- 
ginning, that we believe in revelation, and the trouble with our pre- 
tended friends, who are misinterpreting this matter, is they do not be- 
lieve in modern revelation at all, and our conflict has been with them 
from the beginning. They have made the conflict. Joseph Smith re- 
ceived, a revelation from God, and the great heads of the Christian 
churches and the ministers of the various conflicting denominations 
have declared that the doctrine of revelation in these times is false, 
that God does not now reveal anything for the children of men, that 
all the revelation that we have now that is of any account is to be 
found between the lids of the Bible, and they quote the last chapter of 
Revelation, a few words there, that if "any man shall add to these 
things God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book." 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 197 

They leave out the other part, generally, strangely, "if any man shall 
take away from the words of the prophecies of this book, God shall 
take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city 
and from the things that are written in the book." And they do not 
dwell much upon the saying in it that "all liars and they that love 
and make a lie shall have their part in the lake which burnetii with fire 
and brimstone." 

THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE REVELATION IS COMMON TO ALL. 

President Grant did not claim that he was the only man that could 
receive revelation from God. He has taught from the beginning, as all 
the leaders of this Church have, that to receive revelation is the gift 
of all men who seek for it. "Draw near unto me and I will draw 
near unto you, saith the Lord of hosts." That was the doctrine of the 
ancient seers and prophets. That is the doctrine of the latter-day 
prophets, and of the Latter-day Saints' Church. The right to receive 
revelation from God is common to every one. Christ taught: "If 
ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children : 
how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to 
them that ask him?" That Holy Spirit is the spirit of revelation, that 
which makes clear, that which reveals ; whether it be something new or 
something old does not matter, if it is true. It is the spirit of truth, and 
that is the spirit of life and the spirit of light that he has given to every- 
one born into the world. Every sensible, every sane person, has a right 
to the guidance of that spirit if he will seek for it in the right way and 
be obedient to its whisperings and its teachings. The beneficial inven- 
tions received by leading minds come from that source. Now, it is not 
the right of every person to teach things that he may consider he has 
received by revelation, to others. I have had manifestations to me 
from the time when I, as a boy, went out into the world to preach the 
gospel without purse or scrip or means, for my personal benefit. I 
received them from the Lord ; they were my guiding stars. I am 
thankful to know that I received this inspiration in my labors and 
duties, and there are many things I have never talked about to others, 
and I know just as well that they are true as that I am standing here, 
but it was not given me to teach them to the world or to anybody 
else. It was for me. Every inspiration that I have received from the 
Almighty has strengthened my faith in this work, this organization, this 
Church of Jesus Christ, for it is his Church, and I know that it is 
of God, and that it will prevail. 

ALL REVELATION FOR THE CHURCH COMES THROUGH THE HEAD OF THE 

CHURCH. 

There have been some persons who have been led away by an evil 
influence, which has caused some of them to lose their standing in the 
Church, and it was pertinent and timely for our president to allude to 
this doctrine as shown in the forty- third section of the Doctrine and 



198 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Covenants, and what he said is true and it is the word of the Lord to 
the Church ; it was then and it is now, and anything that the Lord has 
to reveal for the Church for its guidance and government in doctrine 
and principle and discipline will come through the head, and we will 
have the opportunity, if it is new, to pass judgment upon it. In the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants we have a number of revelations, all 
of which have been received by the body of the Church as the word of 
the Lord. I was present when that was done, when we were all or- 
ganized in the Priesthood in our various quorums. The Bible, the 
Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great 
Price were voted upon by the priesthood of the Lord and also by the 
congregation in conference during the time of President Taylor. If 
the Lord has anything further to reveal, it will come through the 
head, and then the body responding will make it the doctrine of the 
Church. That is the order of heaven. God reveals, God orders, God 
presides, and the heavenly hosts willingly and gladly receive his guid- 
ance, and his word becomes their word and they are like Jesus, they do 
his will, but they do it because it is the will of the Father and they know 
that the Father is true. And so when we get the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands and we walk in its light, we know for our- 
selves concerning the work, concerning all our duties as we are called 
upon to perform them. 

WOMEN AND THE PRIESTHOOD. 

One other remark I want to make, and that is this : There seems 
to be a revival of the idea among some of our sisters that they hold 
the Priesthood. President Clawson sat down on that in his remarks 
on Sunday. He said "No, the sisters do not hold the Priesthood." 
Well, is that right ? Yes ; but then there is a little qualification to it, 
perhaps, very slight. When a woman is sealed to a man holding the 
Priesthood, she becomes one with him. Sometimes the man is the one 
and sometimes he is not, but she receives blessings in asso- 
ciation with him. The glory and power and dominion that he 
will exercise when he has the fulness of the Priesthood and becomes a 
"king and a priest unto God," she will share with him. Sisters have said 
to me sometimes, "But, I hold the Priesthood with my husband." 
"Well," I asked, "what office do you hold in the Priesthood?" Then 
they could not say much more. The sisters are not ordained to any 
office in the Priesthood and there is authority in the Church which they 
cannot exercise ; it does not belong to them ; they cannot do that prop- 
erly any more than they can change themselves into a man. Now, sis- 
ters, do not take the idea that I wish to convey that you have no bless- 
ings or authority or power belonging to the Priesthood. When you are 
sealed to a man of God who holds if and who, by overcoming, inherits 
the fulness of the glory of God, you will share that with him if you are 
fit for it, and I guess you will be. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 199 

AS TO WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ADMINISTER TO THE SICK. 

iThere is another thing connected with that. I have had sisters 
visit me and ask me if they did not have the right to administer to the 
sick. "Well," I have said, "yes, you have in one way; Jesus Christ 
said, 'These signs shall follow them that believe — in my name shall 
they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall lay 
hands on the sick and they shall recover.' " As I say, there are 
occasions when perhaps it would be wise for a woman to lay her hands 
upon a child, or upon one another sometimes, and there have been 
appointments made for our sisters, some good women, to anoint and 
bless others of their sex who expect to go through times of great per- 
sonal trial, travail and "labor;" so that is all right, so far as it 
goes. But when women go around and declare that they have been 
set apart to administer to the sick and take the place that is given to 
the elders of the Church by revelation as declared through James of 
old, and through the Prophet Joseph in modern times, that is an as- 
sumption of authority and contrary to scripture, which is that when 
people are sick they shall call for the elders of the Church and they 
shall pray over and officially lay hands on them. 

It is the prayer of faith that saves the sick ; faith in God not in 
some particular man, although some men seem to have more of the 
gift of healing than others, that is true, but the authority in the Church 
is vested in the elders. True, a priest, of course, can, a teacher can, and 
so can a deacon, although neither a teacher nor a deacon can exercise 
the power in the lesser Priesthood which is for the remission of sins 
through baptism ; he cannot do that, he has not the authority, but he 
may lay hands on the sick and pray God to heal them ; so can a mem- 
ber. So can people out of the Church, and so they have done. Having 
faith in God, they have asked God in the name of Jesus Christ to 
heal the sick by the laying on of their hands, and some of them have 
got well, and a good many others have died, like it is with all of us. 

NO MEETINGS TO BE HELD WITHOUT CONSENT OF PRESIDING 
AUTHORITIES. 

These sisters, too, claim the right to go around and hold meetings 
of their own and speak in tongues and interpret the same and to 
prophesy. Now they may have the gift of tongues ; that is just as 
much for the sisters as it is for the brethren, and seems to be a little 
more so. One good sister said to another, "Oh, you may have the 
gift of wisdom, I don't say you haven't, but I have got the gift of 
tongues." She thought she was ahead of her sister who had wisdom. 
Sisters, it is not your right to organize meetings either for the sisters 
or for the brethren in your respective wards without the regulation 
and permission of the presiding authorities of the ward. Some sisters 
not very far from this spot used to meet together, relate visions, speak 
in tongues and had a glorious time, and the' president of the stake was 



200 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

appealed to as to the right to do that. He said, "Sisters, you must 
not hold any meetings of that kind unless you get permission from 
the bishop," and they have never asked permission of the bishop 
nor held such meetings since that time. What does that show? It 
shows that they were not acting under proper authority. The Lord 
has declared "my house is a house of order." 

DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND LOOK TO THE LORD FOR HISl WORD. 

Let us do that which is right ; let us avoid that which we have no 
right to do. Do not let us presume to hold Church meetings in our 
own authority. That is under the direction of the ward authorities 
and they will say when meetings are to be held ; the quorum meetings, 
of course, are under the direction of the quorum authorities. Let us be 
wise in our generation, and let us look to the Lord for his word, through 
the appointed channel. And when we sing, "We thank thee, O God', 
for a prophet," let us do so in faith. Many Saints sing that song, but 
they do not want to do or believe what he says. That is the way with 
some folks ; not with you, of course ; we know better or ought to know 
better. Let us follow in the ways the Lord has pointed out, and' let 
us not get very angry at what the wicked do. The wicked will not 
cease from troubling, liars will not cease from lying, unless God 
convents or compels them, and they will go on in their evil way ; some of 
them, until they find they are with the wicked in that punishment which 
is figuratively called fire and brimstone. 

CONCLUDING TESTIMONY. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. I am thankful to the 
Lord today for his mercies to me ; I am thankful for his goodness to 
me all my life long. God be praised for the revelations of the latter 
days, and for the revelations of ancient days that have been handed 
down to us ; only a few have come to us, but we are living now in the 
full blaze of the gospel of the last dispensation. The Holy Ghost, 
the Comforter, is with this people ; Jesus Christ the Son is at the 
head of the Church, and God the Father is above all, and we will find 
out when we learn the fulness that Providence is indeed over all, and 
that we are to acknowledge his hand in all things, in adversity as 
well as in riches. In all conditions in which we find ourselves, we will 
praise the Lord and give thanks to him and serve him with all our heart 
and might and mind and strength, and will try to love our neighbors as 
ourselves, as far as we can, and if we can say, "O Lord, they 
don't know what they do," we will say also, "Father, forgive them." 
I am afraid some of them do know what they are doing ; that is, they 
are not telling the truth, but are purposely perverting it. They, too, are 
in the view and the hands of the Almighty. 

God's peace be with you all, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 201 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

A revelation was given to the Church ninety years ago last 
February from which I have read during this conference, and I 
will read from it again. This revelation is to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the elders in it. 

A VERY IMPORTANT REVELATION. 

"Oh, hearken, ye elders of my church, and give an ear to the words 
which I shall speak unto you. 

"For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a com- 
mandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed 
unto you, to receive commandments and revelations from my hands." 

I want to emphasize once more, "A law unto my church." 

"And this ye shall know assuredly that there is none other appointed 
unto you," [Who? "my church,"] "to receive commandments and revela- 
tions until he be taken, if he abide in me. 

"But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed 
unto this gift except it be through him, for if it be taken from him, he shall 
nov have power except to appoint another in his stead; 

"And this shall be a law unto you," [and who is this law unto? "Unto 
my churdh,"] "that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come be- 
fore you as revelations or commandments; 

"And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may 
know they are not of me. 

"For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come 
in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those 
revelations which you have received, and shall receive through him whom 
I have appointed." 

And I said that anybody who taught contrary to that was a plain, 
simple, every-day liar. That is what I said ; that is what I mean. The 
idea that any man claiming to believe the teachings of this revela- 
tion saying that he has today the right to perform plural marriages, is 
utterly absurd. We have cut such men off from the Church. 

CONCERNING PLURAL MARRIAGES. 

Perhaps I owe an apology — in fact I will make one — for speaking 
with anger in this building last Sunday night. As I came to the 
meeting Sunday night, I was told that a person had said that neither 
Heber J. Grant nor any other man had any right to say that an 
individual could not perform a plural marriage; that God had re- 
vealed plural marriages, and therefore that I had no right to say that 
they could not be performed, and that one party had remarked that it 
would take an angel from heaven to convince him, even if I did say 
it. In my remarks on Sunday evening I had no thought of referring to 
anybody outside of this Church, or that I ever had any right to 
undertake to say that I had anything to do with directing any other 



202 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

people than the Latter-day Saints. But I branded as plain, simple liars 
those who undertake to say that anybody, aside from the President of 
the Church, had an}' right to give revelations to this people. I had 
just heard that one more pretended plural marriage had been performed, 
and after all the teachings from this stand, and all the declarations, and 
after excommunicating, as we have done, within the last year, one 
man for marrying — or pretending to marry — a plural wife, I confess 
I was angry and "rebuked with sharpness." 

NO PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO PERFORM PLURAL MARRIAGES. 

But I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that no man upon the 
face of the earth has any right or any authority to perform a plural 
marriage, and there are no plural marriages today in the Church of 
Christ, because no human being has the right to perform them. There- 
fore, any person pretending to have that right is attempting to exer- 
cise an authority that he does not have, and therefore he does not 
perform a marriage and there is no marriage covenant when such 
ceremonies are performed. 

SEVERAL PERSONS EXCOMMUNICATED FOR PERFORMING PRETENDED 
MARRIAGE CEREMONIES. 

We have excommunicated several patriarchs because they arro- 
gated unto themselves, the right, or pretended right, to perform these 
ceremonies, and after our having excommunicated several patriarchs, 
another one, so I am informed, has committed the same offense. I an- 
nounce to all Israel that no living man has the right to perform 
plural marriages. I announce that no patriarch has the right 
to perform any marriages at all in the Church. We have delegated, 
at the present time, to the presidents of stakes and to the bishops of 
wards, the right to perform lawful marriages, and there has been 
delegated to some elders who held positions as county clerks, the 
right to exercise the authority of the Priesthood to perform legal 
marriages for time. And it was in view of the lie that was going out, 
and a desire to protect virtuous, noble, good girls who were being de- 
ceived and entrapped into doing what, under the law of God today, 
and under the law of the land, is adultery, that I was branding the liar. 



CONCERNING INSPIRATION. 

I want my friends to know that the doctrines of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declare that God inspires men. We 
heard Elder Whitney read to us the twenty-ninth chapter of Alma. 
When I was the junior member of the council of the twelve apostles, I 
knew that chapter off by heart, and I used to repeat it, time and time 
again, in my public addresses. 

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that 



PRESIDENT HEBER 1. GRANT 203 

! might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the 
earth, and cry repentance unto every people!" 

This same chapter further states that men are inspired, and 
are given all that is wisdom in God that they should have, and 
Alma says that he ought to be content with the things that were al- 
lotted unto him. And the thing allotted unto him was to declare re- 
pentance to the people, and he had had great joy in that many men, 
because of the word he had declared, had come unto God. Perhaps there 
is no other passage, no single chapter, in all the Book of Mormon, 
that I have preached from as often as I have from that twenty- 
ninth chapter of Alma. We believe absolutely, as has been said here, 
that God inspired Columbus. I commend to all Latter-day Saints 
when the conference pamphlet is, published, to read what Elder Orson 
F. Whitney said about the inspiration of God being given to men in 
all parts of the world. We endorse his remarks. 

One of the fundamental articles of faith promulgated by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was : 

"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to 
the dictates of our own conscience ; and allow all men the same privilege — let 
them worship how, where, or what they may." 

But we claim absolutely no right, no prerogative whatever, to 
interfere with any other people. We desire the good will of all man- 
kind, and we desire the advancement of all mankind, and w,e pray 
God to bless every man that is striving for the betterment of human- 
ity in any of the walks of life; and we say of every man who be- 
lieves that Jesus is the Christ and who proclaims it : O God, bless 
that man. But we cannot pray for those who pretend to preach the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and deny the atoning blood of Jesus 
Christ, and who proclaim that he was only a man. Jesus is the Re- 
deemer of the world, the Savior of mankind, who came to the earth 
with a divinely appointed mission to die for the redemption of man- 
kind. Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God, the Only Begotten in 
the flesh. He is our Redeemer, and we worship him, and we praise 
God for every individual upon the face of the earth who worships 
our Lord and Master as the Redeemer of the world. 

I rejoice in the blessings of the Lord that have come to us dur- 
ing this conference. God bless the Latter-day Saints. God bless 
every honest-hearted soul all over the world, all who are striving to 
do good, striving to benefit mankind. I thank the Lord for the rich 
outpouring of his holy Spirit during our conference. May we all go 
home and take the Conference spirit of love and of fellowship and good 
will to all the congregations of the Saints, and thus inspire them to 
serve God and to keep his commandments is my prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



204 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

I want to read just one more thing : 

"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and mag- 
isuates; in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law." 

The law provides that any person performing a marriage shall 
record the marriage, and I haven't heard of this last marriage T 
referred to being recorded; and there should be a license issued also; 
I haven't heard of any license. 

A solo was sung, entitled, "The mighty God has spoken." 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

The Conference was adjourned until October, 1921. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Orson F. Whitney, of the 
Council of the Twelve. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing in the Taber- 
nacle. Professor J. J. McClellan played the accompaniments and in- 
terludes, etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. Kimball and 
Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Tab- 
ernacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Elders Clarence Cramer 
and Clyde Rasmussen ; in the Assembly Hall, by Frederick E. Barker 
and Fred J. Barker.

Clerk of the Conference 



Strength of the "Mormon" Church 

{See Conference Record, April, 1921, p. 23) 



{From the "Coast Banker," San Francisco and Los Angeles, March, 1921.) 

Glimpses From Its History, With Reference to Its Trials, Travels, Be- 
liefs, Achievements, and Plans for the Future, as Shown in an Address 
Delivered by Invitation at the Banquet of the Knife and Fork Club at 
Hotel Muhlebach, Kansas City, December 16, 1920, by Heber J. Grant, 
President of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints. 

One of the greatest forces, in temporal and religious affa'irs of the 
United States is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, com- 
monly known as the "Mormon" Church. Its head is Heber J. Grant, who 
officiates under the title of President. Mr. Grant possesses the character- 
istics of a real leader — strength of purpose, nobility and humility of char- 
acter, enthusiasm for all causes in which he enters, and indefatigable in- 
dustry. He is well known and respected by the business men of the west- 
ern third of the United States, regardless ,of their religious affiliations. For 
years he has been a banker, and he holds the office of president of the Utah 
State National Bank, and of the Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, 
Salt Lake City, and for many years he has been strongly identified with the 
insurance business as well; so that when, on the death of President Smith, 
he succeeded to the headship of the "Mormon" Church, he brought with 
him an equipment that fully qualified him to take up the leadership in the 
various corporations in which the "Mormon" Church either holds a dominant 
position or is interested in a lesser degree. 

The important place the "Mormon" Church occupies, not only in Utah 
buc in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Arizona, and other parts of 
the Western Hemisphere, is told by President Grant in a most thorough 
study and analysis; therefore we recommend to our readers, the financial 
people of the western third of the United States, that they read this address 
by him, because it will explain to them, not alone his plans, but those of 
the organization which is so great a factor in their territory. — The Editor. 

I consider it a very distinct honor indeed, gentlemen, to be invited 
to speak here tonight to this representative body of business men in your 
wonderful city. It is remarkable, to me, that your bank clearings 
should exceed the showing of St. Louis, although you have only one- 
half the population. Utah is one of the most enterprising 
of all the enterprising states in the United States, and 
the reason I consider it an honor to speak here is the fact 
that early "Mormons" were driven from this section of the 
country. (Laughter.) I am grateful for this opportunity of address- 
ing a body of representative men in the very place from which our 
people were expelled by an exterminating order of Governor Boggs. 
This is a good illustration of the wonderful change of sentiment in the 
United States regarding the people with whom I have the honor to be 
associated. My mother was cast out as a thing of evil, by some of the 
Ivins family of the East, when she became a member of the Church of 



206 . GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Forty-two years later, when I took 
her back to Philadelphia to meet her relatives and friends, her brothers 
and sisters having passed away, the nephews and nieces fell in love 
with the "very fine old lady." 

Many people imagine that the "Mormons" have no faith in what 
is known as the Bible. You will pardon me for taking a little of your 
time to correct a few erroneous, impressions of this kind, and to refer 
briefly to the travels of our people before the pioneers reached Utah. 
The "Mormons" accept the Bible as the word of God, but they also be- 
lieve in the Book of Mormon. Comparatively few people know what the 
Book of Mormon purports to be. It is the sacred history of the fore- 
fathers of the American Indian. 

The Latter-day Saints started in New York, where the Church was 
organized in 1830. They later located at Kirtland, Ohio, where they 
built quite a large temple, which is still standing. The opposition and 
ill will which they encountered were so great that they decided to move 
to Missouri, there locating in and around Far West. Previously they 
had established a colony at Independence, a few miles from this city, 
where they met with much opposition and were forced to leave. After- 
wards, as I have stated, they were expelled from the State of Missouri 
under the exterminating order of Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. Later 
they were invited to locate at Commerce, Illinois, where there were very 
few people. They built a city known as "Nauvoo, the Beautiful," in 
which within a few years there were 20,000 inhabitants. Here, too, they 
met much opposition. The prejudice against them caused them to be 
bitterly persecuted, and the prophet Joseph Smith crossed the Mississip- 
pi River, intending with a chosen body of men to explore the Rocky 
Mountains for a place of 'settlement and gathering for the people. A 
short time before that he had uttered a prophecy "that the Saints would 
continue to suffer much affliction, and would be driven to the Rocky 
Mountains ; many would apostatize, others would be put to death by 
our perecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or dis- 
ease ; and some would live to go and assist in making settlements, and 
build cities, and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of 
the Rocky Mountains." At the time this prophecy was delivered, one 
of the foremost statesmen in the United States, Daniel Webster, is 
quoted as having made a remarkable statement with reference to the 
western part of our country, in which Joseph Smith had predicted the 
Saints would become a mighty people. Said Webster : 

"What do we want with this vast, worthless area? This region of 
savages and wild beasts, of deserts, of shifting sands and whirlwinds of 
dust, of cactus and prairie dogs ? To what use could we ever hope to 
put these great deserts or those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable 
and covered to their very base with eternal snow ? What can we ever 
hope to do with the western coast of three thousand miles,' rockbound, 
cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it? Mr. President, T will 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH, 207 

never vote one cent from the public treasury to place the Pacific 
Coast one inch nearer Boston than it now is." (Laughter.) 

Even statesmen, it appears, sometimes make mistakes. There are 
some very fine harbors on the Pacific Coast, and the whole section 
west of the Missouri River certainly has developed into a very mar- 
velous country. 

THE MARTYRDOM AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. 

Joseph Smith had foreseen that his people would be forced again 
to leave their homes, and, as I say, he had started West with a picked 
body of men to find a place of refuge. But some of the people in 
Nauvoo accused him of running away and deserting his flock. He there- 
upon returned to Nauvoo, remarking that if his life was of no value to 
his people, it was of no value to him. He surrendered to the Governor 
of the State of Illinois. He, with his brother, Hyrum Smith, John 
Taylor, and Willard Richards, was incarcerated in Carthage jail, with 
a pledge of protection from the Governor. On his way to Carthage 
he said : "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter ; but I am calm as a 
summer's morning ; I have a conscience void of offense towards God 
and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of 
me, 'he was murdered in cold blood.' " He and his brother were 
killed by a mob. John Taylor, who afterwards became president of 
the Church, received four gunshot wounds and carried in his body some 
of the rifle-balls to his grave. Brigham Young, as leader of the stricken 
people, then entered into an agreement that the latter would move to 
the West. He, with others, began exploring the country, and the mi- 
gration started. Quite a number of the people located at Council 
Bluffs ; but that winter, after many of the able-bodied men had left, the 
mob drove the remnant of the "Mormon" people from their beloved city 
of Nauvoo, which was then the largest city in the State of Illinois. It 
was a beautiful and populous town of twenty thousand souls when Chi- 
cago was a mere trading post ; and they deserted that city willingly, 
because they had to. (Laughter.) The first detachments of the people 
crossed the Mississippi River on the ice, in the dead of winter, and 
during that terrible night nine babies were born with no shelter save the 
rude tents and wagon covers under which their mothers were huddled. 
No tongue can tell, no pen can paint the sufferings and the hardships of 
the "Mormon" people in these drivings from Missouri and Illinois. 

They next located at Council Bluffs, moved across the river and 
built Winter Quarters, now known as Florence. In the meantime, 
a state of war had grown out of difficulties between the United States 
and Mexico, and a government recruiting officer was sent to the "Mor- 
mon" camps at Council Bluffs soliciting five hundred men for mili- 
tary service to march against Mexico. The leaders of our people had 
previously petitioned the President of the United States, Martin Van 
Buren, for a redress of wrongs, only to have the President announce: 
"Your cause is just, but T can do nothing for you," a pusillanimous 



208 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

remark, to say the least. Yet now five hundred men were demanded' 
from whom ? From a people who were being expatriated, a people who 
had been driven from Missouri under circumstances of indescribable 
cruelty, a people who had also just been expelled from Illinois in the 
dead of winter. Yet Brigham Young said: "Captain Allen, you 
shall have your battalion ; and if we haven't enough young men, we will 
give you old men." An American flag was hoisted, recruiting started, 
and in three days the five hundred men were furnished. I maintain 
that you will search the ..history of the world in vain to find elsewhere 
such evidence of patriotism ! In spite of their expatriation, in spite of 
the fact that in order to save their lives they had been compelled 
to abandon and flee from their homes, they responded to the call of their 
country. And as to the nature of the service rendered by the heroic vol- 
unteers, the gallant commander, Lieutenant Colonel St. George Cooke, 
said in his general order announcing the completion of their march : 

"History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry. 
Half of it has been through a wilderness where nothing but savages and 
wild beasts are found ; or deserts where, for want of water, there is 
no living creature. There, with almost hopeless labor, we have dug 
deep wells which the future traveler will enjoy. Without a guide Who 
had traversed them, we have ventured into trackless tablelands where 
water was not found for several marches. With crowbar and pick and 
axe in hand, we have worked our way over mountains which seemed 
to defy aught save the wild goat, and hewed a passage through a chasm 
of living rock more narrow than our wagons." 

I might incidentally remark, as a further instance of the service 
of the Mormon Battalion in making the West, that some of its members 
were among the discoverers of gold in California, which! subsequently 
enriched our nation many millions of dollars. 

THE GREAT MIGRATION TO UTAH. 

Crossing to the west bank of the Missouri River, as I have said, 
the "Mormon" camps established Winter Quarters, and here many 
log houses were built, and a frontier settlement was made. In this 
place Brigham Young planted a cottonwood tree, under which I had 
the honor of standing two weeks ago last Sunday, with some of my 
companions ; and a snapshot was taken of us, which by the way did 
not come out very well. (I hope we did not spoil the camera.) It is a 
large tree, with its branches extending a hundred feet, and its trunk 
about twenty feet in circumference. It is distinctive, historically and 
otherwise, among all the other trees in the park where it stands. A 
short distance from that spot many hundreds of the early "Mormons" 
are buried ; and from there, in 1847, Brigham Young started with his 
pioneer company of 143 men, three women, and two children to explore 
the unknown West, and find an abiding place for the homeless people. 

I shall not relate the many incidents of peril and anxiety on that 
memorable trip, which required many weary weeks in traveling from 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 209 

the Missouri River to the Salt Lake Valley, which was then prac- 
tically an unknown country. Nor was the prospect pleasing when they 
reached the spot where our chief city now stands. "Weary and worn 
as I am," said one of the three women, "I would gladly go another thou- 
sand miles rather than stay in such a desolate place ;" and another, her 
sister, echoed the same sentiment. But Brigham Young had said, "This 
is the place," asserting that he had seen the valley in vision some time 
before, and that it was the spot where the Latter-day Saints should lo- 
cate. He had been taken sick just before reaching the valley, and a 
small advance company was sent out two days ahead of the main 
body of pioneers to look over the country and if possible prepare a bit 
of land for planting. They had brought some plows, but found the 
ground so hard that several plowshares were broken. They finally 
turned the water of a small stream on the parched and baked soil, and 
the first day succeeded in planting a few acres of crops. So far as I 
know, this was the beginning of that system of irrigation which has 
meant so much in the development of the United States of America, a 
system which has reclaimed millions upon millions of acres of land, and 
has led to the, expenditure of very many millions of dollars by the gov- 
ernment in reclamation projects in Idaho, Arizona, Utah, and other 
sections of the country. 

The pioneer company later returned to Winter Quarters, where in 
the meantime the work of outfitting and preparing for the general 
migration to the West had gone on apace. Large trains of ox teams 
were organized that took several months to cross the plains. My own 
father had the privilege of commanding one of those companies — the 
third company of emigrants that went to Utah that first season ; and by 
the fall of 1847, there were 1600 people in the Salt Lake Valley. They 
had built a log fort with extensions, and a number of log houses. Their 
industry was prospectively to be rewarded with fruitful harvests in 
1848, when myriads of crickets appeared, devouring everything before 
them. Immigration had continued meanwhile, and now the people 
felt that ruin and starvation stared them in the face, because they 
were a thousand miles from anywhere, so to speak, and it appeared that 
the crops would be utterly lost in spite of all they could do. Unless that 
harvest could be saved, there was nothing for them to look forward to 
but absolute starvation. As a people they believe God came to their 
rescue; that it was His providence that from the islands in the Great 
Salt Lake the flocks of gulls came which devoured the crickets. In 
commemoration of this deliverance there has since been erected a 
very beautiful monument, and I shall take occasion to get from Secre- 
tary Tufts a list of the members of your club, and when I return home 
will mail to each of you a booklet entitled "Utah," on the front cover of 
which is a picture of the monument, erected in remembrance of the 
mercy of God in saving from starvation the many hundreds of early 
pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. Our Legislature has enacted a law 
prohibiting the killing of gulls : and the birds are so tame that they will

come into our fields, and follow the plowman to feast on the worms 
that are uncovered by his furrow. 

PIONEERING THE INTERMOUNTAIN COUNTRY. 

In the next few years the "Mormons" redeemed the valleys for 
a hundred miles north and three hundred and fifty miles to the south. 
Originally, Utah included all of the present State of Utah, all of Ne- 
vada, part iof Colorado, and part of Wyoming and Idaho ; but pieces 
have been sliced off from time to time, until it is small in area 
compared with what it was in the early days, perhaps no more than one- 
half its original size. 

The "Mormon" people have been not only the pioneers in settle- 
ment and in irrigation and reclamation in Utah, but they were the pio- 
neers also in Idaho. A little settlement that was once in Utah is now 
in Idaho, and it is the city where the pioneers of the 1 Gem state meet 
once a year to celebrate "Idaho Day," being the starting point of civi- 
lization in that section. In the other direction, the San Luis Valley in 
Colorado was considered altogether too high in elevation to be of any 
value for agriculture until a "Mormon" colony went there and re- 
claimed the locality. They proved that it was a good country for 
.raising crops, notwithstanding the fact that it was seven thousand feet 
in elevation. The "Mormons" were also among the very first pioneers 
to go into Arizona. There was a great deal of prejudice against 
them, but it has practically all disappeared. Today there is perhaps a 
better feeling toward our people in Arizona than in any other section 
in which they are located. As an illustration of the goodwill existing 
there regarding the "Mormon" people : when a novelist by the name 
of Winifred Graham came over here from England, telling a lot of 
unconscionable lies about the "Mormons," a Senator from Arizona 
stood up in the Senate of the United States and voluntarily and 
emphatically branded her statements as the falsehoods which they were. 
The ex-Governor of the state also said that no better class of people 
could be found anywhere than the "Mormons" of Arizona, adding that 
in one respect they were being robbed of between 2500 and 3000 per 
cent of a certain class of taxes in Arizona — because, according to popu- 
lation, they were entitled to have twenty-five or thirty inmates in the 
state penitentiary, and they had only one (laughter) ; also) that we were 
entitled to 700 or 800 per cent more of the taxes set aside fon the sup- 
port of the insane, being entitled, according to population, to seven 
or eight inmates in the insane asylum, whereas we had none. 

We ask people to judge us by the standard laid down by our 
Savior : "By their fruits ye shall know them." I was reading Jast 
Saturday, in Chicago, from Phil Robinson's book, Sinners and Saints, 
in which he states that he is at the defiance of any man to find a single 
book, with one exception, written on the "Mormon" question, that is not 
absolutelv untrue, because practically all the books on that subject were 
written by the enemies of our people, and are unfair. In the book I 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 211 

refer to, Mr. Robinson gives the "Mormons" a fine certificate of char- 
acter, and among other things says that he nearly choked to death for 
"a d'rink" among the "Mormons" while traveling 350 miles to the south 
and a hundred-odd miles to the north, until after inquiring for a "back- 
slider" he was successful in finding a demijohn. After that he got along 
very well. He said he had always supposed water was for the cleans- 
ing of the body until he arrived in Utah, and there he found it was 
used for drinking purposes. Mr. Robinson also refers to the fact that 
although we had 80-odd per cent of the population in Utah, the re- 
maining 17' per cent (as I recall) furnished 80 per cent of the inmates 
of the territorial penitentiary. 

The first great commandment is to "multiply and replenish the 
earth;" and Utah's best crop is babies. (Laughter.) We feel very 
proud of the record of our people in that particular. We can not be- 
gin to compare with other people in furnishing divorces. 

Before we divided on party lines in Utah as Democrats and Re- 
publicans, I heard a Congressman say, while making a campaign 
speech in Salt Lake City, that hanging on the wall in one of the houses 
of Congress in Washington there was a map showing the states and 
territories of the Union. The map was black originally, but as educa- 
tion grew, it was painted white; and he stated that there were only 
four whiter spots upon that map than Utah. At that time Utah was 
a territory and we had no public lands to sell to help us in education ; 
we had forged to the front without receiving one single, solitary dollar 
from the sale of public lands from the United States. We have been 
branded as an ignorant lot, and yet for ninety-odd years we have 
been sending our young men to Harvard and other universities to get 
an education, and they have made a record of which we are proud. 
While I was presiding over the European mission of our Church, I 
read in the newspapers that we have overtaken and equalled one of the 
states in the Union for second place in literacy. Doctor Winship, one 
of the great educators of our country, has given us credit, in recent 
lectures, for having the finest laws on education of any state or terri- 
tory in the Union. 

TEMPLE BUILDING AND HOME INDUSTRY. 

As I have already told you, the early "Mormons" erected a temple 
soon after they reached Ohio,. and considering the small number of 
people that were there, it was a wonderful accomplishment. They erect- 
ed a large temple at Nauvoo, which was destroyed by the mob, after 
the expulsion of the people. The second day, after the arrival of the 
pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young walked to the spot 
where the great temple was later erected, drove his cane into the 
ground, and said, "Here we will build the Temple of our God." The 
corners were laid forty years, to a day, before the temple was com- 
pleted. For forty long years the people contributed of their means 
toward the erection of that temple. As a' child I contributed fifty cents 



212 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

a month ; later as a boy I gave a dollar a month, then five dollars, 
and finally made a contribution of several thousand dollars to aid in its 
completion. In the meantime the pioneers were redeeming a country 
which was considered absolutely worthless before they undertook its 
reclamation. The noted trapper, Jim Bridger, had told Brigham 
Young and his pioneer company that he would give one thousand dol- 
lars for the first ear of corn ripened in the Salt Lake Valley; it was 
quite generally considered a worthless wilderness. Yet, when years 
later the United States government offered a handsome prize for the 
best five acres of wheat raised in any part of the United States, Salt 
Lake Valley carried off the prize. The temple which, as I have said, 
was forty years in building was erected at a cost of over four millions 
of dollars. I imagine it could be built today, even at the high prices of 
labor and material, for a million and a half. But in those days it took 
an ox team several days to go to the mountains and bring one solitary 
stone for the structure. It took several weeks of work by 
hand to cut that stone. The footings of the building are 
sixteen feet ; the walls are eight feet thick ; and it was 
built, as Brigham Young advised everybody to build, "to last a 
thousand years." He erected, at that early day, a theatre in Salt Lake 
which still stands, in which all of the leading companies that visit 
Utah put on their plays. It' was built when I was a child. Every nail 
in it was carried a thousand miles from the frontiers at the Missouri 
River, when nails were a dollar a pound. Those were the days when 
sugar was selling at one hundred one dollars a bag — one hundred for 
the sugar and one dollar for the sack. When people went to the theatre 
they took their molasses in a can, or brought a squash or something 
else to pay the price of admission. Fortunately there was no war tax ; 
for they could not have paid it ; they had no money. Within twenty 
years after the arrival of the piooners, the "Mormon" Tabernacle was 
built, with a seating capacity of eight thousand. On special occasions, 
when the building has been crowded, more than ten thousand people 
have been counted. The Tabernacle was erected without the use 
of nails, the roof being pinned together with wooden pins and tied with 
rawhide thongs. At the time of its completion, although a thousand 
miles from civilization, it was the largest auditorium in the United 
States of America without a center support to the roof ; and it is today 
the largest except where steel girders have been used to support the 
roof. 

A concert was given in the building, by our Tabernacle Choir of 
five hundred voices, for the relief of the sufferers from the Johnstown 
flood. The net receipts, at a $1 a seat, amounted to $7500, which 
was remitted to the sufferers. Yet under those conditions our people 
built some splendid irrigation projects. Some of them would cost 
today millions upon millions of dollars, and they were built by the co- 
operative labor of the people and the exchange of their products. Brig- 
ham Young taught the people to sustain home manufacture, to be eco-

nomical, to avoid extravagant habits, and not think of getting this, 
that, and the other which would not add to any actual comfort. In those 
days we were clothed in what was known as "homespun." In nearly 
every home the wife would take the wool and prepare it for spinning, 
she would have in her home a loom on which she would weave the rag 
carpets. When we built a canal, the only money we needed was for 
the purchase of plows and scrapers and for powder to blast the rocks. 
Most of our early, great enterprises were made possible by co-operative 
labor. I know of one little canal on which the settlers worked each 
winter for twelve long years, and reclaimed the ground where now 
stands a little settlement of eight hundred or a thousand people. The 
accomplishments of Utah have been brought about by pulling together, 
by "teamwork," by absolute unity, and co-operation, which I believe 
existed there to a greater extent than in any other community. 

Brigham Young has the honor of having established in Utah the 
first department store in our country — Zion's Co-operative Mercantile 
Institution, of which I am now president. This list of companies 
(pointing to program) of which I am credited with being president 
fails to mention those which come my way accidentally, one may say, 
because I became president of the Church, all of which are of more 
importance than the ones on the list here published. One of the insti- 
tutions over which I have the honor to preside, and over which my 
predecessors from Brigham Young to Joseph F. Smith have presided, 
is Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution, established in early days 
to prevent excessive profits and to protect the people by giving them 
fair goods at a fair profit. That institution now does a business of 
some twelve million dollars a year. 

ESTABLISHING BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY. 

Another institution 'that I have the honor of presiding over is the 
Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. I wish to say to you gentlemen here 
that we have the honor of having erected the first beet-sugar factory 
ever built in the United States of America with American machinery. 
There had been several factories built with imported machinery ; in 
fact, away back in 1862, the "Mormons" sent John Taylor (who after- 
wards became president of the Church) to France to bring machinery 
from there to try to establish the beet-sugar industry in the Great Basin. 
To my mind, perhaps one of the most substantial illustrations of the 
loyalty and of the co-operative work of the "Mormon" people is seen 
in the following: In 1891 when Baring Brothers failed in London, 
with their investments largely in the Argentine Republic, that failure 
reached clear out to Salt Lake City ; and as there was very little money 
in the country it made it very hard indeed for our people. Many of those 
who had subscribed for stock in the sugar company were unable to pay 
their subscription ; but the president of the Church said' : "We will build 
that factory if it breaks the credit of the Church itself ; we must build 
it, because it will make an increased product from the soil and there- 



214 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

fore be beneficial to the people." The president sent me East, West, 
North and South, all through the country, as his agent, to borrow money 
with which to build that factory. After we had failed in New York 
and other Eastern centers to get money to finish it, I went to San 
Francisco and appealed to Henry Wadsworth, then manager of the 
Wells Fargo Bank, to loan the last hundred thousand dollars that 
we needed. In my appeal I said to him : "Mr. Wadsworth, when you 
were in Salt Lake you believed in me as a boy when I worked for you ; 
you gave me $100 as a New Year's present, and stated that no one 
else in the bank should have a dollar because all the others watched 
the clock, to see how soon they could get out of the front door after 
3 o'clock, whereas I came back occasionally and worked at night. Now 
that I am one of the leading officials of the 'Mormon' Church I ask 
you to believe in me and to furnish the hundred thousand' dollars neces- 
sary to complete this factory. I have just succeeded in getting fifty 
thousand dollars from the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company of 
San Francisco ; they know me well. But I must have a hundred 
thousand dollars more, and I must have it from you." I pleaded with 
him to deposit the money in Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, 
in Salt Lake City, and told him we could convince that bank that our 
securities were good. His reply was that "banks were failing every- 
where and he could not let me have the money." Finally I said : "Mr. 
Wadsworth, the beet-sugar industry must and shall be established. I 
have no authority to offer you the note of the Church, but I pledge you 
four notes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — twenty- 
five thousand due in six months, twenty-five thousand in a year, twenty- 
five thousand in eighteen months, and twenty-five thousand in two years, 
with twenty indorsers, individually and severally liable for the ob- 
ligation ; you to write out twenty-five names of the strongest financial 
'Mormon' men in Salt Lake City, and I will guarantee to get twenty 
indorsers out of the twenty-five." He said : "My boy, that is an im- 
possibility ; no twenty men on earth would guarantee, individually and 
collectively, one hundred thousand dollars for any church." "Well," 
I replied, "we are a little different from any other church ; I will get 
you the notes and indorsers all right." He insisted that it could not 
be done. "Then you don't need to give me the money," I said at last ; 
"all I ask is that you give me the opportunity." Then he said : "I will 
go you one better ; I will write thirty names, and if you can get any 
twenty out of the thirty, it will be satisfactory, and you can have your 
money." He wrote five or six names, tore up the paper, and said: 
"Heber, you were my office boy fifteen years ago. Many a man has 
gone broke in fifteen years. I will just write up to my successor in 
Salt Lake and tell him to write the names." When I got back home, 
his successor wrote a list of names, and as he looked at them he said : 
"Those names remind me of an incident in early days in a California 
mining camp. There was a saloon-keeper who had on his front door 
a list of names of the people who owed him for whisky. One day his

wife in a streak of cleanliness scrubbed the floor and even washed the 
door, and when the man discovered it he exclaimed : 'Good heavens ! 
you have ruined me ; give me a pencil quick, and maybe I can still make 
them out.' Then he studied out the names as best he could, and rewrote 
them, and stood and looked at the list. You know some people say that 
'damn' is only emphasis ; and with emphasis he said : 'That is the best 

lot of ■ names that was ever on that door.' " So this banker said : 

"This is the best lot of names I ever saw." 

a financier's faith and aid. 

I got twenty- four indorsers out of the thirty men on his list ; three 
of the thirty were out of town, and one man volunteered to sign whose 
name was not on the list, but who happened to hear two of the gentle- 
men that were on the list refusing to sign the note, these taking the 
ground that it was not good morals for a church to borrow money to 
loan to a private corporation. I said to them : "I will agree, when you and 
I meet the Lord, if we ever do, to absolve you from all trouble if you 
will put your name on the back of these notes. (Laughter.) It will 
be time enough for you, or me, to decide the morals of the question 
when we become members of the presidency of the Church. The presi- 
dency have signed the notes, and they will have to answer to the Lord 
for the moral part of it. Will you sign the notes, or will you not?" 
They declined. Then I had this conversation with the voluntary 
signer to whom I have referred. He lived in Ogden and was worth 
more than any ten men who had signed the note — when he died his es- 
tate was worth fifteen to twenty millions of dollars. He had been 
writing a letter and after the two men declined, he said: "Heber, I 
have heard your story. Is my name on the list?" "No," I replied, 
"there are only Salt Lake men on the list." He said he would like 
to look at the notes. I handed them to him, and he wrote his name 
on the back of each one without even reading the notes. He handed 
them back, with the remark : "I don't think my name will hurt them." 
Then he said to me : "Heber, tell the president of the Church that any 
time he wishes those notes paid, if he will notify David Eccles thirty 
days ahead : — I always keep from one to three hundred thousand dol- 
lars in bank, on certificates of deposit, so that on thirty days' notice I 
can draw it out — I will be glad to pay these notes, and the Church 
can pay me in one year, or five years, or ten years, or when convenient." 
Maybe you think I did not want to hug this man about that time. 
( Laughter. ) 

Then Mr. Eccles added : "Tell the president of the Church that 
if he wants my name on another hundred thousand dollars of notes, just 
to send you up to Ogden. You have never been in my house. I will 
give you supper, bed and breakfast ; and we have pen and ink." By 
the way, I went up there some time later, and got his signature for 
another $100,000. (Laughter). When he told me the street on which 
he lived, I said : "Don't tell me what street you live on. Step across 



216 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the road to my office and I will show you, a plat of your house. I 
have it insured." (Laughter.) 

I have referred to some of the buildings erected by the Latter-day 
Saints, among them the great Salt Lake Temple. When I was a 
boy they erected a temple also at St. George, three hundred fifty miles 
south of Salt Lake City, at a cost of several hundred thousand dol- 
lars. Later, when I was a young man of twenty-six, they completed' 
a temple in Logan, costing several hundred thousand dollars. Some 
three or four years later they erected another temple, just as large, at 
Manti, Utah. Last November, on my birthday, I was in the Hawaiian 
Islands and dedicated a temple there which cost over two hundred thou- 
sand dollars. This coming summer we will dedicate, in Canada, a 
temple costing over six hundred thousand dollars. We have spent 
millions of dollars in the erection of ward chapels and district meeting 
houses, also millions of dollars in erecting Church-school buildings, 
from Canada to Mexico. During the present year we will supply, for 
maintenance of Church schools alone — to say nothing of erection of 
buildings — three-quarters of a million dollars. 

Time will not permit me to speak in detail of the part the Church 
has played in establishing and fostering institutions for the good of the 
people. I have referred to Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution 
and to the beet-sugar industry. The latter, the first year produced only 
one million one hundred thousand pounds of sugar. The Dyers of 
Cleveland, Ohio, who built this factory, left Utah after two or three 
years, believing that the sugar industry in Utah would be a failure ; 
but among the "Mormon" people there is a considerable percent of 
Scotch, Dutch and Scandinavian blood, and they are somewhat stubborn. 
You know it is said there is nobody on earth quite as stubborn as a 
Scotchman, except a Dutchman. I happen to be Scotch on my father's 
side and Dutch on my mother's. Our people have been brought together 
from all sections of the country ; in fact, we have converts from all parts 
of the world. They did not allow difficulties to discourage them; they 
did not give up; and in 1920, the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company will 
produce over two million one hundred thousand bags of one hundred 
pounds each of sugar, instead of one million one hundred thousand 
pounds as in the first year. There are other sugar companies in Utah 
and Idaho and their combined product will be equally as much as ours. 
So that the beet-sugar industry in the intermountain section will pro- 
duce this year over four million bags of sugar. It is true that Colorado 
has outstripped us in the beet-sugar production ; but the original people 
who went over into Colorado and built the first factory, received their 
education in the first factory built in Utah. 

"mormon" pioneer hymn. 

Some day a story will be written about the sufferings and hard- 
ships of the "Mormon" pioneers while crossing the plains. I feel 
disposed to tell at least one little incident in connection with the 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 217 

pioneer journey. When the "Mormons" were at Winter Quarters, 
preparing to outfit their cmpanies to travel by ox team to Utah, Brig- 
ham Young turned to a man named William Clayton and said : "Be- 
fore the first company starts for Salt Lake Valley, I want you to write 
a hymn that will inspire and comfort and cheer and bless the people 
on their long journey." William Clayton went away, and is reputed 
to have returned the same day with what is known as the great "Mor- 
mon" pioneer hymn. 

When I arrived in Liverpool to preside over the European mission, 
as successor to the father of Doctor Richard R. Lyman, who is here 
with us tonight (a professor of engineering in the University 
of Utah and graduate from Michigan University), President 
Lyman said: "We will sing your favorite hymn tonight." 
I replied that I hadn't any favorite. "All the leaders of the 
Church ought to have a favorite song," said President Lyman; "my 
favorite is, 'School thy feelings, O my brother ; train thy warm impulsive 
soul.' The favorite of my bosom friend John Henry Smith, is 'Up, 
awake, ye defenders of Zion.' " And he named the favorite hymns of 
about a dozen of our Church leaders. Finally I said : "Hold on ; I can 
choose my favorite in a quarter of a minute — 'Come, come ye Saints.' " 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
"Tis better far for us to strive 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this, and joy your hearts will swell 
All is well! All is well! 

Why should we mourn, or think our lot is hard? 

'Tis not so; all is right! 
Why should we think to earn a great reward, 

If we now shun the fight? 
Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 
Our God will never us forsake; 
And soon we'll have this tale to tell — 
All is well! All is well! 

We'll find the place which God for us prepared, 

Far away in the West; 
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; 

There the Saints will be blest. 
We'll make the air with music ring, 
Shout praises to our God and King; 
Above the rest these words we'll tell — 
All is well! all is well! 

And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too; 

With the just we shall dwell. 
But if our lives are spared again 



218 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

To see the Saints their rest obtain, 
O, how we'll make this chorus swell — 
All is well! All is well. 

PATHETIC INCIDENT OF THE PLAINS. 

One day my father-in-law said to me : "Heber, for twenty long 
years I have listened in vain for our choirs to sing the fourth verse of 
'Come, come ye Saints.' I believe the rising generation know noth- 
ing whatever of the comfort and cheer which we received, while cross- 
ing the plains, from singing that pioneer hymn or they never would be 
guilty of leaving off the fourth verse, which we looked upon as a 
prayer." In one of the revelations to our Church we are told by the 
Lord : "For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart, yea, the song 
of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a 
blessing upon their heads." My father-in-law said that hymn was a 
blessing to every one who sang it, and particularly the last verse, which 
they sang, and meant every word of it : 

And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too; 

With the just we shall dwell. 

Then he related the following incident : "One of the men in our 
company crossing the plains was late coming into camp one night. (In 
those early companies they traveled a day and a half or two days apart, 
and had three companies going practically together, so that in case of 
Indian trouble, having a few horses with each company, men with 
guns could go back or forward.) As this man had not reached camp, 
and it was getting late, we organized a volunteer company to go back 
to see if he had been waylaid by Indians. Just as we were ready to 
start, we saw him coming in the distance. He explained that he had 
been sick, and as he happened to have the last wagon in the company, 
he was alone, and had to lie down by the road for a few hours' rest. He 
was very feeble when he came into camp, so we unyoked his oxen, and 
got his supper ready. After supper he sat on a large rock by the 
campfire and sang 'Come, come ye Saints.' It was the rule of the 
camp that whenever any one started to sing this pioneer hymn, all the 
others should join in ; but in this case it happened that none of us joined 
in the song. When he had finished, I looked around and I did not 
see a dry eye. The next morning, noticing that he had not yoked up his 
oxen, we went to his wagon and found that he had died during the 
night. We dug a shallow grave, buried his body, and to the head 
of his grave we rolled the stone on which he sat the night before, 
while singing, 'And should we die before our journey's through, happy 
day ! all is well ! We then are free from toil and sorrow too ; with the 
just we shall dwell.' " My father-in-law started to tell me something 
else, but stopped and said:' "Never mind." Years later the Burlington 
railroad, while surveying its line through Nebraska and Wyoming, 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 219 

found a broken wagon tire sticking out of the ground, on which there 
had been chiseled the words : "Rebecca Winters ; age 50 years." The 
surveyors with delicate kindness and consideration went back three or 
four miles, and changed the line of the road in order to miss that 
lonely grave. The railroad company fenced the spot and wrote to Utah 
to find out if any one knew Rebecca Winters. She was my wife's 
grandmother. No doubt my father-in-law had intended to tell me 
during the conversation above quoted, that when he came to Salt 
Lake City from his home in another part of the territory, to meet an 
immigrant train on which he expected to find his beloved mother, he 
learned that she, too, had died before her journey "was through." We 
have erected a little monument at the grave, inscribing on one side 
the history of Grandma Winters, and on the other side the fourth 
verse of "Come, come ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear." 

AS COLONIZERS AND NATION-BUILDERS. 

It is this spirit among the "Mormon" people, of co-operation, 
this willingness to stand one by the other, and to build up the com- 
munities, that has helped to redeem the desert, that has enabled 
them to make a record in Canada, in Mexico, as well as in our own 
country — that has given them the splendid standing and reputation 
they enjoy. They were regarded as the foremost colonists of all Mexico, 
in the estimation of that great leader of the republic, the late General 
Diaz. No one would suspect that that iron character would be guilty 
of shedding a tear, and yet on the last trip he took to Chihuahua to 
visit the state fair, when he saw the exhibit of industry and frugality, 
the saddles and the harness, the canned fruit, the bottled fruit, the 
exhibits from the "Mormon" academy and the pictures of the "Mor- 
mon" Church schools in Juarez, the old warrior wiped his eyes and 
said : "What could I not do with my beloved Mexico if I only had more 
citizens and settlers like the 'Mormons.' " 

Wherever we have gone, .we have made a success. The "Mormon" 
people believe in education ; they believe in art, in literature, in science, 
in advancement. They sent their tabernacle choir of two hundred fifty 
voices to the Chicago Fair in 1893, and won the second prize in compe- 
tition with all the world, for the best choir of that number of voices. The 
choir that won first prize, I understand, had hired the best fifty voices 
from Wales to help them out. (Laughter.) We put in a little protest, 
but the protest did not work. One of the producers of operas, con- 
certs, and lectures, a great theatrical man of New York, told me that 
he was at the fair and heard the choirs sing ; and his verdict was that 
those fifty voices did not help the other choir, their strength and power 
destroyed perfect harmony ; "but, of course," he said, "it never would 
have done to give you miserable 'Mormons' the five-thousand-dollar 
prize, although if I had been the judge you would have received' it." 

Tt was my intention to speak from notes on this occasion, because 
this is my first attempt at talking to an audience like this. The first 



220 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

thing I had intended to do was to read a poem, but I forgot all about 
it until I looked at these notes. Now that I see my time is about up, I 
am going to close with what should have been the beginning and use 
the remaining few minutes in reading this poem and a statement re- 
garding Joseph Smith. Some four years ago I happened to buy 
this book, and since then I have given away over five hundred copies. 
I have just ordered something over a thousand to send out, at the ex- 
pense of the Church, to our missionaries in the United States. 

I am very grateful to be here, as I said in the opening of my 
remarks, and I hope you will get acquainted with me. This poem is 
from the pen of Edgar A. Guest, and is entitled : 

WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW A FELLOW. 

When you get to know a fellow, know his joys and know his cares, 
When you've come to understand him and the burdens that he bears, 
When you've learned the fight he's making and the troubles in his way, 
Then you find that he is different than you thought him yesterday. 
Then you will find his faults are trivial and there's not so much to blame 
In the brother that you jeered at when you only knew his name. 

You are quick to see the blemish in the distant neighbor's style, 

You can point to all his errors and may sneer at him the While, 

And your prejudices fatten and your hates more violent grow 

As you talk about the failure of the man you do not know, 

But when drawn a little closer, and your hands and shoulders touch, 

You find the traits you hated really don't amount to much. 

When you get to know a fellow, know his every mood and whim, 

You begin to find the texture of the splendid side of him; 

You begin to understand him, and you cease to scoff and sneer, 

For with understanding always prejudices disappear. 

You begin to find his virtues and his faults you cease to tell, 

For you seldom hate a fellow when you know him very well. 

When next you start in sneering and your phrases turn to blame, 
Know more of him you censure than his business and his name; 
For it's likely that acquaintance would your prejudice dispel 
And you'd really come to like him if you knew him very well. 
Then :his faults won't really matter, for you'll find a lot to praise. 
When you get to know a fellow and you understand his ways, 

(Applause.) 

TRIBUTE TO THE FOUNDER. 

Brigham Young, some day, will be acknowledged as one of the 
greatest leaders and pioneers that the world has ever known, and yet I 
want you to know that all that has been accomplished, by so-called 
"Mormonism" and by our people, was built upon the broad foundation 
laid by the man who was martyred in Carthage jail. He gave the 
Church a book of revelations of hundreds of pages. Brigham Young 
gave but one revelation pertaining to the organizing of the pioneer com- 
panies. John Taylor gave but one revelation during his presidency; 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 221 

and his successors promulgated no new revelations. The foundation 
was laid by the prophet Joseph Smith for all that has been accom- 
plished. He gave his life, in Carthage jail, sealing with his blood the 
divinity of his testimony, and credit is due to this wonderful leader 
for what has been accomplished. I desire to read a testimony given 
by Josiah Quincy, a man who knew Washington and others of the 
country's great founders, a man who was once Mayor of Boston, and 
a man who was on the reception committee to welcome Lafayette 
when he came over here from France. In his book, Figures of the 
Past, he says : 

"It is by no means improbable that some future textbook for the 
use of generations yet unborn will contain a question something like 
this : What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted 
the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? 
And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory 
may be thus written: 'Joseph Smith, the 'Mormon' Prophet.' And 
the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living, may 
be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History deals in 
surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The man who es- 
established a religion in this age of free debate, who was and is today 
accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary from the Most 
High — such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his 
memory with unsavory epithets. Fanatic, impostor, charlatan, he 
may have been ; but these hard names furnish no solution to the prob- 
lem he presents to us. Fanatics and impostors are living and dying 
every day, and their memory is buried with them ; but the wonderful 
influence which this founder of a religion exerted and still exerts 
throws him into relief before us, not as a rogue to be criminated, but 
as a phenomenon to be explained. The most vital questions Americans 
are asking each other today have to do with this man and what he has 
left us. * * * A generation other than mine must deal with these 
questions. Burning questions they are, which must give a prominent 
place in the history of the country to that sturdy self-asserter whom I 
visited at Nauvoo. Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher, 
faced adversity such as few men have been called to meet, enjoyed 
a brief season of prosperity such as few men have ever attained, and, 
finally, forty-three days after I saw him, went cheerfully to a martyr's 
death. When he surrendered his person to Governor Ford, in order 
to prevent the shedding of blood, the prophet had a presentiment of 
what was before him. 'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter,' he is 
reported to have said, 'but I am as calm as a summer's morning. I 
have a conscience void of offense and shall die innocent.' I have no 
theory to advance respecting this extraordinary man. I shall simply 
give the facts of my intercourse with him. 

"A fine-looking man " 

[Incidentally, my mother tells me he was the finest looking man 
she ever saw; he stood over six feet high.] 



222 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

"A fine-looking man is what the passer-by would instinctively 
have murmured upon meeting the remarkable individual who had 
fashioned the mold which was to shape the feelings of so many thou- 
sands of his fellow mortals. But Smith was more than this, and one 
could not resist the impression that capacity and resource were natural 
to his stalwart person. I have already mentioned the resemblance he 
bore to Elisha R. Potter, of Rhole Island, whom I met in Washington 
in 1826. The likeness was not such as would be recognized in a pic- 
ture, but rather one that would be felt in a grave emergency. Of all 
men T have met " 

[Remember the writer had met Washington, he had been private 
secretary to John Adams, and he had met Lafayette and the great 
men of his day] 

NATURAL LEADER AND STATESMAN. 

"Of all men I have met, these two seemed best endowed with 
that kingly faculty which directs, as by instrinsic right, the feeble or 
confused souls who are looking for guidance." 

In passing, I may remark that you can read in one book written 
against the "Mormons" that Joseph Smith got all his inspiration and 
revelations while he was having fits. (Laughter.) 

"We then went on to talk of politics. Smith recognized the curse 
and iniquity of slavery, though he opposed the methods of the aboli- 
tionists. His plan was for the nation to pay for the slaves from the 
sale of the public lands. 'Congress,' he said, 'should be compelled to 
take this course, by petitions from all parts of the country ; but the pe- 
titioners must disclaim all alliance with those who would disturb the 
rights of property recognized by the Constitution and which foment in- 
surrection. It may be worth while to remark that Smith's plan was 
publicly advocated eleven years later by one who has mixed so much 
practical shrewdness with his lofty philospohy. In 1855, when men's 
minds had been moved to their depths on the question of slavery, Ralph 
Waldo Emerson declared that it should be met in accordance 'with 
the interest of the South and with the settled conscience of the North. 
It is not really a great task a great fight for this country to accomplish, 
to buy that property of the planter, as the British nation bought the 
West Indian salves.' He further says that the 'United States will be 
brought to give every inch of their public lands for a purpose like this.' 
We, who can look back upon the terrible cost of the fratricidal war 
which put an end to slavery, now say that such a solution of the diffi- 
culty would have been worthy a Christian statesman. But if the re- 
tired scholar was in advance of his time when he advocated this dis- 
position of the public property in 1855, what shall I say of the political 
and religious leader who had committed himself, in print, as well as 
in conversation, to the same course in 1844? If the atmosphere of 
men's opinions was stirred by such a proposition when war-clouds 



STRENGTH OF THE "MORMON" CHURCH. 223 

were discernible in the sky, was it not a statesmanlike word eleven 
years earlier, when the heavens looked tranquil and beneficent? 

"General Smith proceeded to unfold still further his views upon 
politics. He denounced the Missouri Compromise as an unjustifiable 
concession for the benefit of slavery. It was Henry Clay's bid for the 
presidency. Doctor Goforth might have spared himself the trouble of 
coming to Nauvoo to electioneer for a duellist who would fire at John 
Randolph, but was not brave enough to protect the Saints in their 
rights as American citizens. Clay told his (Smith's) people to go to 
the wilds of Oregon and set up a government of their own. Oh, yes, 
the Saints might go into the wilderness and obtain the justice of the 
Indians, which imbecile, time serving politicians would not give them 
in the land of freedom and equality. The prophet then talked of the 
details of government. He thought that the number of members ad- 
mitted to the lower house of the National Legislature should be reduced. 
A crowd only darkened counsel and impeded business. A member for 
every half-million of population would be ample. The powers of the 
President should be increased. He should have authority to put down 
rebellion in a state, without waiting for the request of any Governor; 
for it might happen that the Governor himself would be the leader 
of the rebels. It is needless to remark how later events showed the 
executive weakness that Smith pointed out — a weakness which cost 
thousands of valuable lives and millions of treasure. . . . 

"Born in the lowest ranks of poverty, without, booklearning and 
with the homeliest of all human names, he had made himself at the age 
of thirty-nine a power upon the earth. Of the multitudinous family 
of Smith, none had so won human hearts and shaped human lives as 
this Joseph. His influence, whether for good or evil, is potent today, 
and the end is not yet. 

"I have endeavored to give the details of my visit to the 'Mormon' 
prophet with absolute accuracy. If the reader does not know just what 
to make of Joseph Smith, I can not help him out of the difficulty. I 
myself stand helpless before the puzzle." 

I thank, you, gentlemen, for your attention.

Elegant New Edition of the 
BOOK OF MORMON 

Just off the press — a new edition of the Book of Mor- 
mon! It now appears in new and attractive dress, with 
acceptable innovations in make-up and typography. Only 
mechanical changes have been made, of course; the text 
remains the same, in all its sacred completeness of detail. 

This edition of the Book of Mormon is designed for 
popular use, and will surely be in large demand in the 
home libraiy. Its eight-point type will make reading de- 
lightfully easy. 

It is set in double-column pages, after the general style 
of the Bible. An advantage of this arrangement is a shorter 
line, which greatly facilitates reading, reducing eye-strain 
and fatigue. 

An interesting feature is a "Brief Analysis," which 
emphasizes vital points and clarifies certain details of ar- 
rangement that would be otherwise obscure. The volume 
abounds in foot-notes, which are a very helpful key to the 
chronological sequence of the history. The chapter head- 
ings present in terse, yet comprehensive form, the principal 
contents of the respective chapters, and show at a glance 
whose words follow. These headings, in somewhat ex- 
panded form, are compiled in the after-part of the volume 
as a "Synopsis of Chapters." 

A glossary of words distinctly of Book of Mormon 
origin, will be a great aid to pronunciation of proper names 
and other words. But the greatest help of all is afforded 
by a comprehensive index, which fills 34 pages. Stibjects 
are indexed and cross-indexed; while striking passages, 
telling epigrams and choice gems of thought are indicated 
in a way that readily leads to their source. 

It is printed on high grade paper, has wide margins, 
and is bound in several styles, as follows:

Prophecies by Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment 

A Valuable Book, by Nephi L. Morris 

Was Joseph Smith a Prophet? What answers come from the cen- 
tury that has rolled by since he beheld his first vision? Have the Lat- 
ter-day Saints misplaced faith in him? After the progress of a hundred 
years, what has Time done with his claims to the title of a Prophet. 

In order to make plain the outcome of Time the author has dug up 
old and forgotten manuscripts and prints which he lays before the 
readers. 

Did you know that Joseph Smith foretold the War of the Rebellion, 
stating exactly where it should begin? Did you know that he foretold 
in the same prophecy exactly when the World War should occur? 

Did you know that he foretold the fate of Judge Stephen A. Douglas, 
the man who contended with Lincoln for the presidential chair? 

Did you know that he prophesied that this great Intermountain 
Empire should arise here as a result of the persecutions of the Saints at 
the hands of their enemies? 

Did you know that he placed the Garden of Eden in America and 
that today many great scientists agree with him? 

Did you know that he placed the date of the birth of the Savior 
as April 6th and probably the date of His crucifixion as the same date? 

Does the Book of Mormon chronology of these events agree with 
his statements? 

Did you know that the United States has faithfully pursued the path 
pointed out for her by the Book of Mormon Prophets thousands of 
years ago? 

Did you know that Apostle Orson Hyde foretold the part that Eng- 
land should take in the restoring of Jerusalem to the Jews and that his 
prophecy was published in 1842 — seventy-five years before the event

2 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

FIRST DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

The opening session of the conference began at 10 o'clock, Friday, 
April 6th, 1928. 

The great auditorium and galleries were comfortably filled with 
people from all parts of the Church. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Richard C. May, Pres- 
ident of the Minidoka Stake. 

Brother J. H. Wood sang a solo, "Behold, I stand at the door and 
knock." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is certainly an inspiring sight to see this magnificent audience in 
attendance here this morning at the ninety-eighth anniversary of the 
birth of the Church. When I contemplate the fact that just a handful 
of people were in the Church ninety-eight years ago (the organization 
was effected with six members) and that now there are over a half 
million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
I am reminded of the very wonderful revelation given to the father 
of the prophet over a year before the organization of the Church : 

"Now behold, a, marvelous work is about to come forth among the children 
of men. 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, .might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day. 

"Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work; 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth 
in his sickle with his anight, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not. 
but bringeth salvation to his soul ; 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God. 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask and ye shall receive ; knock and it shall be opened unto you." 

This audience testifies to the fact that a marvelous work and a 
wonder has been established. It testifies to the diligence of those who 
have gone forth by the thousands and tens of thousands during the last 
ninety-eight years, proclaiming the gospel in all parts of the world. 

I had not the slightest idea of reading this revelation when I first 
stood up. 

It has always been customary at our annual conferences to give 
a little account of the activities of the Church during the past year.

During the last six months the clerk of our general conferences, and 
the editor of the Improvement Era, Elder Edward H. Anderson,

God-fearing man has ever been engaged in the service of the Lord 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Brother Hugh 
J. Cannon, now presiding "over the Swiss and German mission, has 
been selected to succeed Brother Anderson as the editor of the Im- 
provement Era — a most splendid successor to a most splendid man. 

I feel that we have great cause to be grateful for the blessings of 
the Lord to us as a people. 

IMPRESSED WITH HYMN 

I was profoundly impressed this morning in listening to the congre-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



gation sing, "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." T am sure 
that whenever we as Latter-day Saints sing this hymn our minds go 
back to the time when it was written, and we think of the marvelous 
and wonderful work accomplished by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
am going to take the time, although you all know it by heart, perhaps, 
to read this hymn. I do not think I have ever done so before in 
public in my life: 

We thank thee, O God, for a prophet 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank thee for sending the gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays : 
We thank thee for every blessing 

Bestowed by thy bounteous hand ; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve thee, 

-\nd love to obey thy command. 

When dark clouds of trouble hang o'er us 

And threaten our peace to destroy, 
There is hope smiling brightly before us. 

And we know that deliverance is nigh ; 
W e doubt not the Lord nor his goodness, 

We've proved him in days that are past : 
The wicked who fight against Zion 

Will surely be smitten at last. 

We'll sing of his goodness and mercy, 

We'll praise him by day and by night. 
Rejoice in his glorious gospel, 

And bask in its life-giving light; 
Thus on to eternal perfection 

The honest and faithful will go, 
While they who reject this glad message 

Shall never such happiness know. 

THE PROPHET JOSEPH 

Speaking of the Prophet Joseph, an eminent writer refers to him 
in the following language: 

"Yet he being dead yet speaketh. The work he began has never ceased. * * 
"Who can explain Joseph Smith? What are 'revelations from God'? What 
is their test? Is it not beyond all reason that a lad, born of poor parents, devoid 
of any save the commonest education, too poor to buy; books, should have ac- 
complished what he did in less than forty years, unless there were some great 
reason for it? 

"Let anyone, even a literary genius, after forty years of life, try to write 
a companion volume to the Book of Mormon, and then almost daily for a number 
of years give out 'revelations' by the score that internally! harmonize one with 
another, at the same time formulate a system of doctrine for a new church, 
introduce many new principles, resuscitate extinct priesthoods, and formulate a 
system of church government which has no superior on earth. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"Would he succeed in making the system coherent? Could he influence 
scores of intelligent, wise, thoughtful, educated, religiously trained men, like 
John Taylor, Dr. Richards, and scores of others, besides attracting thousands 
to the fold of his church, as did Joseph Smith ? Even if one were assured 
that the prophet was an imposter, that does not lessen the marvel. The mvstery, 
the riddle, the problem, is even greater, than before. * * * 

"I offer no explanation. * * * 

"To deny such a man a wonderful power over the human heart and intellect 
is absurd. Only fanatical prejudice can ignore it. However he may be accounted 
for by the reasoning mind, Joseph Smith, the 'Mormon' prophet, was one of the 
wonders of his time. That he is not an enigma to his followers (as he certainly 
is to his critics) is only another proof of his wonderfulness." 

I will read a part of section 135, Doctrine and Covenants : 

"To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce 
the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith, the patriarch. 
They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844. * * * 

CITES ACHIEVEMENTS 

"Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus 
only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived 
in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, 
which he translated by the gift and power of God and has been the means of 
publishing it on two continents ; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, 
which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brught forth the 
revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the 
children of men; gathered .many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a 
great city, and left a fame and a name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and 
he died great in the eyes of God and his people ; and like most of the Lord's 
anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own 
blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in 
death they were not separated ! 

"When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended 
requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said : 
'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; 
I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall 
die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me — he was murdered in cold blood'." 

THE ARIZONA TEMPLE 

I rejoice in the testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. During the last year it has fallen to my lot to have the priv- 
ilege of visiting from here to New York, and in the northern section 
of the country, and to have the blessed privilege of going into Arizona 
and there dedicating one more temple to the Most High God. I rejoice 
in the rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord that was enjoyed 
by those of us who had the opportunity of attending the dedicatory 
services of that temple. I rejoice exceedingly in the remarkable publicity 
that was given to us by the newspapers of Arizona. Never in the 
history of the Church has there ever been manifest a more friendly 
feeling toward the Latter-day Saints by those not of us than was 
exhibited by the good people of Arizona. They devoted page after 
page of their papers to an account of the erection of the temple, 
in publishing a sermon upon the vicarious labor for the dead, by Elder 
Joseph Fielding Smith, in giving illustrations and having interviews

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of a favorable character. In addition the president of the Church and 
some of those who were at the dedication services were invited to meet 
with the legislature that was then in session, and the president of the 
senate made some very complimentary remarks regarding the splendid 
edifice — one of the finest buildings in Arizona. He also complimented 
the people themselves on their integrity and their remarkable accom- 
plishments in that section of the country. I could not help but contem- 
plate the difference in conditions as compared with the time when 
there was a feeling of animosity, almost of hatred, existing in the" 
minds of the people of the state of Arizona, regarding the Latter- 
day Saints. I rejoiced in being able to pay tribute, in answer to the 
speech by the president of the senate, to the senators of the United 
States from Arizona and their defense of the "Mormon" people, and 
their uniform testimony of the integrity and devotion of our people. 

PURCHASE OF HILL CUMORAH 

Within a short time the Church has purchased the Hill Cumorah. 
The purchase embraces the farm where the hill stands, and the ad- 
joining farm, which together with one that we had already purchased, 
including a part of the hill, gives us now the entire possession of the 
Hill Cumorah. I know that the hearts of the Latter-day Saints thrilled 
with pride when the announcement was made that we had secured this 
property. We now have the home where the prophet was born, and 
have erected a monument there. We now have the house and farm of 
Peter Whitmer, where the Church was born. We now have the Palmyra 
home. We have nearly all of the spots that are sacred in the history 
of the Church; and we rejoice in the financial condition of the Church 
whereby we have been able to accomplish these things. 

TEMPLE WORK 

I rejoice in the temple work that is being done, and I wish to ask 
the Saints to try to shape their affairs so that they can occasionally go 
to the temple. For years I felt that I was too busy to find a day or 
an evening in which to go to the temple. A little over a year ago I 
made up my mind that by planning my affairs, by staying away from 
lectures or concerts or theatres or operas, that I could go to the temple 
at least once every week and have ordinances performed in behalf of 
some of my loved ones who had passed away. By making up my mind 
that I could do this I had no difficulty whatever in going through 
the temple once a week during the entire year. Starting this year I 
felt that by a little extra effort I could go twice a week, and I have 
had no difficulty in doing this. True, I have had to miss, perhaps, 
an opera or theatre or some other function at which I should have liked 
to be present, but I have had no difficulty whatever during the past 
three months, in going to the temple twice a week, and when I can 
do so I go more than twice a week, so as to make up for the time 
when I am absent from the city. Up to the first day of April I had 
endowments to my credit of more than two a week for this year. We 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 9 

can generally do that which we wish to do. A young man can find 
an immense amount of time to spend with his sweetheart; he can ar- 
range his affairs to do that. We can arrange our affairs to get exercise 
in the shape of golf and otherwise ; we can arrange our affairs to have 
amusements ; and if we make up our minds to do so we can arrange our 
affairs to do temple work, judging from my own experience of the 
last fifteen months. 

I pray that the Lord will inspire each and all of us to greater dili- 
gence in performing to the full extent of our ability the duties and 
the. labors that devolve upon us in doing vicarious work for our dead. 

A WONDERFUL DECLARATION 

A very wonderful declaration was made by Moroni to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith one hundred and five years ago this coming September : 

"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the 
prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." 

And the priesthood with all its powers, rights and privileges, has 
been restored to us. Elijah has come. I will not take your time to 
read from the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which de- 
clares that the Savior appeared to Joseph Smith and to Oliver Cowdery, 
and that Moses, and Elias and Elijah also appeared and conferred 
upon them all the keys of all the dispensations of the gospel that 
have ever existed upon the earth. 

"And he shall" plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the 
fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. 

"Tf it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming." 

No more wonderful thing has ever been accomplished in the his- 
tory of the world than the turning of the hearts of the children to 
their fathers. From the day this message was declared by Moroni to 
the Prophet Joseph, men and women all over the world have been or- 
ganizing societies, hunting up their ancestors, and compiling genealog- 
ical records of their families. Millions of dollars have been expended 
for these purposes. I have spoken to and heard many times of men 
who have spent large sums of money to compile a record of their 
forefathers, and after it was compiled, when asked why they did it, 
they said : "I do not know ; I was seized with an irresistable desire to 
compile that record and to spend money freely to do it. Now that it 
is compiled I have no special use for it." The Latter-day Saints value 
books of that kind beyond price or money, and when we seek earnestly, 
year after year, to gain knowledge regarding those of our family 
who have passed away without a knowledge of the gospel, I am sure 
the Lord blesses us in obtaining it. There is a little account of a 
remarkable and wonderful blessing bestowed in connection with the 
ancestors of my wife which is contained in the last issue of the Gen- 
ealogical Magazine. 

That the Lord may bless you and me and every soul that has an 
abiding testimony of the divinity of the gospel in which we are engaged, 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

to whom he has given a knowledge that he lives and that Jesus is the 
Son of the Living God, the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph 
Smith was his prophet, to so order our lives that our light shining 
forth through the example of our lives may bring those who know 
not the truth to a knowledge of the gospel, is my humble prayer, and 
I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I feel very grateful to the Lord, my brethren and sisters, that 
through his mercy all of us who are assembled here this morning enjoy 
the opportunity of meeting together in general conference, upon the 
ninety-eighth anniversary of the organization of the Church. 

Reference has been made by the president to the acquisition by the 
Church of the spot of ground in the state of New York known as the 
Hill Cumorah. It appears to me to be an event of such importance 
that I desire to devote the short time which is at my disposal this 
morning to a discussion of that subject. There have been some dif- 
ferences of opinion in regard to it, and in order that I might be correct 
in the statements which I make I have this morning finished a short 
manuscript which I would like to read — the first time, I believe, in 
my experience, that I have ever addressed a congregation in this 
manner, and I do it for the purpose stated. 

OF MORE THAN ORDINARY IMPORTANCE 

The purchase of this hill which President Grant has announced, 
is an event of more than ordinary importance to the membership of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The memories of the 
remote past which cluster round this sacred spot, its close association 
with the opening of the present gospel dispensation, which has resulted 
in bringing together this congregation of people, for without it this 
tabernacle would not have been erected, nor would we have been 
gathered here in worship today, and the thought which we entertain 
of the possibilities which its bosom may unfold, make the acquisition 
of this hill almost an epochal accomplishment in the history of the 
Church. 

If our Bible chronology is correct, and it is at least the best we 
have, it was in the year 599 before the birth of Christ, our Lord, that 
Zedekiah was chosen to be king of Judea. His reign was of short dur- 
ation, extending over a period of only eleven years. He was in rebel- 
lion against the Babylonian kingdom, and Nebuchadnezzar, king of 
Babylon, with his armies overran Judea, made Zedekiah prisoner, put 
out his eyes, killed his sons, and carried the king away captive to 
Babylon. 

It was during the reign of this king that Lehi and his family, 
Ishmael and members of his household and Zoram, who had been a 
servant to Laban, left Jerusalem and began the journey which in time 
brought them to the American continent. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



11 



As a guide to their spiritual life these people brought with them 
that part of the Holy Scripture known to us as the Old Testament, 
which contained the first five books of Moses, the prophecies of Isaiah, 
Jeremiah and others of the ancient prophets. These records were en- 
graven upon plates of brass. 

TWO SETS OF PLATES 

Soon after the arrival of these people and their establishment upon 
this continent, Nephi, the son of Lehi, was commanded to make other 
plates, on which a record of the history of his people was to be written 
Two sets of plates were made from metal which was smelted from 
ores that abounded in the new world to which the Nephites had come ; 
upon them Nephi commenced to record the history of his people. Both 
of these sets of plates which were made were called the plates of Nephi. 
Upon one set, which was called the larger plates of Nephi, the secular 
history of the people was kept, the reign of their various kings, their 
system of democratic government under the judges who were chosen 
by the voice of the people, and their wars and contentions. 

A smaller set was made on which the religious history of the people 
was kept a record of their faith in God and the service rendered to him, 
their idolatry, the hand-dealings of the Lord among them, the predic- 
tions of their prophets and the persecutions which they suffered because 
of their faith in, and adherence to the doctrines taught by their fathers. 

CAREFULLY PRESERVED 

It was principally from these latter plates that Mormon made 
the abridgment which constitutes the volume known as the Book of 
Mormon. These records were carefully preserved, and passed through 
the hands of many different custodians before the history closed, 
which was more than four hundred years after the birth of the Re- 
deemer of the world. 

Besides these two sets of the plates of Nephi, and the brass plates 
which were brought from Jerusalem, there were twenty- four plates of 
gold, upon which was recorded a brief abridgment of the history of a 
people who came from Babylon to this continent long before the 
arrival of the Nephite colony. They left the old world at the time of 
the building of the Tower of Babel, about 2,200 years before the birth 
of Christ. It was from these latter plates that Moroni, the son ot 
Mormon, transcribed that portion of the Book of Mormon known as 
the Book of Ether. 

It was three hundred twenty-one years after the birth of Christ 
that all of these records came into the hands of Ammaron, who re- 
ceived them from his brother Amos, who was the son of Nephi, who 
wrote the Fourth Book of Nephi, which appears in the Book of Mor- 
mon, as the following shows — I am quoting here, as I shall continue 
to quote, from the Book of Mormon itself: 

"And it came to pass that when 320 years had passed away, Ammaron, being 
constrained by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred — yea. 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to 
generation, which were sacred — even until the three hundred twentieth year from 
the coming of Christ. 

"And he did hide them up unto the Lord, that they might come again unto the 
remnant of the House of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the promises of 
the Lord. And thus is the end of the record of Ammaron." 

AMMARON TO MORMON 

One year later Ammaron called Mormon to him and gave him 
the following instruction : 

"And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen 
and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon. 

"And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he 
came unto me, (1 being about ten years of age, and I began to be learned some 
what after the manner of my people) and Ammaron said unto me : I perceive 
that thou art a sober child, and art quick to observe ; 

"Therefore when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye 
should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people ; and 
when ye are of that age go to the land Antum, unto a hill which shall be called 
Shim; and there have I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings 
concerning this people. 

"And behold ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself, and the re- 
mainder shall ye leave in the place where they are ; and ye shall engrave on tht 
plates of Nephi all the things that ye have observed concerning this people. 

"And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's name was 
Mormon) I remember the things which Ammaron commanded me." 

Fourteen years after this charge had been given to Mormon he 
writes as follows: 

"And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had de- 
posited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold 
i had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, 
and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron." 

It will be observed that at this time only the plates of Nephi were 
removed from the hill Shim, by Mormon. 

YEARS OF CONSTANT WAR 

It was forty years later, as near as we are able to fix the date that 
Mormon again visited this hill, under different circumstances, as the 
following shows. Forty years had passed, forty years of constant 
war and bloodshed between the Nephite people and their enemies the 
Lamanites. The Nephites were fleeing before their enemies, taking 
all of the inhabitants with them when Mormon says: 

"And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to overthrow 
the land, therefore I did go to the Hill Shim, and did take up all the records 
which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord." 

Mormon, after taking possession of the records, returned to the 
command of the Nephite armies. The sacred records, which had lain 
in the hill Shim for more than fifty years, were now in the custody of 
Mormon, and the Nephite people were fleeing before their enemies. 
Ten years later, ten years of hopeless struggle, Mormon again writes 
as follows : 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS

"And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle to the king of the Lamanites, and desired 
of him that he would grant us that we might gather together our people unto the 
land of Cumorah, by a hill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give 
them battle. 

"And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did grant unto me the 
thing which I desired. 

"And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of Cumorah, and 
we did pitch our tents round about the hill Cutmorah ; and it was a land of many 
waters, rivers and fountains ; and here we had hoped to gain advantage over 
the Lamanites. 

"And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away, we 
had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the land of Cumorah. 

IN THE HILL CUMORAH 

"And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one 
to the land of Cumorah, behold, I, Mormon, began to be old" — this man, at this 
time was, past 70 years of age and was still the commander-in-chief of the 
Nephite army ; "and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and having 
been commanded of the Lord that T should not suffer the records which had 
been handed down by our fathers, which were sacred, to fall into the hands of 
the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this 
record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in the Hill Cumorah all the 
records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were 
these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni. 

"And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their children, 
did now behold the armies of the Lamanites marching toward them ; and with 
that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked, did they 
await to receive them." 

THE FINAL DISPOSITION 

So far as we have information this was the final disposition which 
was made of the records given into the custody of Mormon, from the 
plates of. Nephi. This latter, with the addition of the Book of Ether, 
and the few chapters written by Moroni, constitute the record con- 
tained in the Book of Mormon. 

All of the remaining records, Mormon tells us, were deposited 
in the Hill Cumorah. 

That the Hill Cumorah and the Hill Ramah are identical is shown 
by the following: Moroni, in the Rook of Ether, says: 

"And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press upon the armies 
of Shiz" — he is telling the story now of this first people who came to the 
American continent from the Tower of Babel — "that they beat them, that they 
caused them to flee before them; and they did flee southward and did pitch 
their tents in a place which was called Ogath. 

"And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by 
the hill Ramah ; and it was in that same hill where my father Mormon did hide 
up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred." 

The passages which I have quoted from the Book of Mormon and 
the more extended discussion of this subject by Elder B. H. Roberts 
which was published in The Deseret Nezvs of March 3, 1928, definitely 
establish the following facts: That the Hill Cumorah, and the Hill 
Ramah are identical; that it was around this hill that the armies of 
both the Jaredites and Nephites, fought their great last battles ; that 
it was in this hill that Mormon deposited all of the sacred records 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



which had been entrusted to his care by Ammaron, except the abridg- 
ment which he had made from the plates of Nephi, which were delivered 
into the hands of his son, Moroni. We know positively that it was 
in this hill that Moroni deposited the abridgment made by his father, 
and his own abridgment of the record of the Jaredites, and that it 
was from this hill that Joseph Smith obtained possession of them. 

PART OF THE RECORD SEALED 

Only a portion of the record which came into possession of Josepb 
Smith was translated, and is contained in the present edition of the 
Book of Mormon. Part of the record was sealed, which he was for- 
bidden to translate. The first Nephi, foreseeing that which would 
occur among the descendants of his father, has this to say : 

"And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth, to you the 
words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered. 

"And behold the book shall be sealed ; and in the book shall be a revelation 
from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. 

"Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which 
are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations 
of the people. Wherefore the book shall be kept from them. * * * 

"And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be 
read upon the housetops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all 
things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among 
the children of men, and which ever will be, even unto the end of the earth." 

FROM THE BOOK OF ETHER 

The footnotes concerning that which I have read refer us to the 
book of Ether from which I desire to read a few paragraphs. 

"And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the 
mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen : 
and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men, until after he should 
be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that 
they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto 
his people. 

"And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he commanded 
that they should be made manifest. 

"And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and there is none, 
save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of Christ; therefore 
1 am commanded that T should hide them up again in the earth. 

"Behold I have written upon these plates the very' things which the brother 
of Jared saw; and there never were greater things made manifest than those 
which were made manifest unto the brother of Jared. 

"Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them ; and I have written 
them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath 
commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have 
sealed up the interpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord. 

"For the Lord said unto me : They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles until 
the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the 
Lord. * * * 

"And now I, Moroni, have written the words which were commanded me, 
according to my memory; and I have told you the things which I have sealed up; 
therefore touch them not in order that ye may translate : for that thing is 
forbidden you, except by and by it shall be wisdom in God."

AWAITING THE TIME 

This sealed portion of the record which came into the hands of 
Joseph Smith but was not translated by him so far as we are aware, 
the abridgment made by Mormon, the record of Ether, and the 
other sacred records which were deposited in the Hill Cumorah, still lie 
in their repository, awaiting the time when the Lord shall see fit to 
bring them forth, that they may be published to the world. 

Whether they have been removed from the spot where Mormon 
deposited them we cannot tell, but this we know, that they are safe 
under the guardianship of the Lord, and that they will be brought 
forth at the proper time as the Lord has declared they should be, for 
the benefit and blessing of the people of the world, for his word 
never fails. 

According to the Book of Mormon many hundreds of thousands 
of people fell in battle around this hill, and the immediate vicinity. 
It was here that two once powerful nations were exterminated so far 
as their natural existence was concerned. It was here that these nations 
gathered together for their last great struggles. 

UNTIL THE LAST 

These people were human, as we are; they carried with them 
their most precious possessions until the last, and when the end of the 
mighty struggle came, and the result was in doubt, they hid them 
away in order that they might not fall into the hands of their enemies. 

Without doubt these treasures lie concealed today, some of them, 
at least, to be brought forth in the not distant future. How soon this 
will be we do not know, but this is certain, we are more than a century 
nearer that time than we were at the time when Joseph Smith took 
from their resting place in the Hill Cumorah, the plates from which 
he translated the contents of the Book of Mormon. 

All of these incidents to which I have referred, my brethren and 
sisters, are very closely associated with this particular spot in the 
State of New York. Therefore I feel, as I said in the beginning of my 
remarks, that the acquisition of that spot of ground is more than an 
incident in the history of the Church; it is an epoch — an epoch which 
in my opinion is fraught with that which may become of greater 
interest to the Latter-day Saints than that which has already occurred. 
We know that all of these records, all the sacred records of the 
Nephite people, were deposited by Mormon in that hill. That incident 
alone is sufficient to make it the sacred and hallowed spot that it is 
to us. I thank God that in a way which seems to have been providential 
it has come into the possession of the Church. 

I bear witness to you that the words which I have read here, 
quoted from the Book of Mormon, which refer to the future, will be 
fulfilled. Those additional records will come forth, they will be pub- 
lished to the world, that the children of our Father may be converted 
to faith in Christ, our Lord and Redeemer, through obedience to the 
doctrines which he taught. May God our Father hasten that day, is 
my humble prayer, and I ask it through Jesus Christ. Amen.

SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

Tt is a surprise to me, my brethren and sisters, to be called upon 
this morning to address this great congregation. I rejoice with you, 
however, in the privilege of being present and of listening to the testi- 
monies, the instructions and the inspiring remarks made by those who 
have spoken. I appreciate the fact that this work is the work of the 
Lord and that it is growing. I was reminded while President Grant 
was speaking, that in examining the statistics for some years past, I 
notice that the membership of the Church today is over four times as 
great as it was fifty years ago, and in other respects the work of the 
Lord is growing and prospering. 

Yet I realize, also, that there is great room for progress and im- 
provement in every line of activity. If it were not so we would not 
be the people of the Lord, because he expects of his people that thev 
shall improve and increase in good works and in activity continually. 
We are told that the Savior said to his disciples upon one occasion : 
"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect." 
I appreciate the fact that this life is a life of progression, of improve- 
ment, of learning, and of the application of that learning to the prob- 
lems of life and to the bettering of conditions among humanity. 

We have heard this morning the statement from President Grant 
of the work that has been done in a financial way in the benefiting and 
the blessing of the people of the Church and of mankind. As to 
the money expended from the tithes during the past year, considering 
the membership of the Church and the conditions of the people, T 
venture to say that there is no other organization in the world that 
disburses such an amount of money as does this Church. I venture to 
say, also, that there is no other organization that is expending it a^ 
efficiently as the Church is doing. This is because of the fact that 
practically all of the money employed for charitable purposes, for 
missionary work, and for the construction, operation and maintenance 
of the meetinghouses and chapels throughout the Church, is expended 
in a very economical way. largely through the voluntary, cooperative 
effort given by the people. 

I am reminded of a statement made in a government census 
report iust received at our office a few days ago, of one of the or- 
ganizations in this country — a national organization of a charitable 
nature — wherein it is shown, as I remember it, that less than 25% 
of the money expended by that organization was used for benevolences. 
The remainder of it was used for salaries and for other purposes 
Some was used for building construction and maintenance, but a 
large proportion of it was used for other than benevolent purposes, for 
which it was primarily raised. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

We have had in this state recently a Community Chest drive. 
The Community Chest is an organization that is recognized as being" 
necessary, and more efficient and helpful than is the case where indi- 
vidual drives are undertaken by various agencies. The result of the 
drive has been to accumulate funds amounting to about $150,000, for 
something like nineteen agencies, and for the administration of that 
organization. The members of the Church appreciate the fact that 
this is a desirable thing for the community needs. 

I would like to call your attention, however, to the fact that, in 
addition to what has been done by the Community Chest this year and 
last year and the previous year, the members of the Church living 
in these city stakes, and the Church itself, have given directly for 
charitable purposes in this city each year an amount equal to that raised 
for the Community Chest. In addition thereto there has been spent 
something like $30,000 for other purposes for which various agencies 
of the Chest are instituted. In other words, over $180,000 was given 
and expended in this city by the Church last year for such purposes 
as the agencies which the Community Chest is undertaking to support. 
And, of the money donated for charitable purposes every cent of that 
which was given, went directly for the purpose for which it was in- 
tended. A great volunteer effort was given by the people of the 
Church. 

I think there is no other organization in the world that is willing 
to give the service or to make the sacrifices manifest by the people of 
this Church. This is not to be ascribed to the people of themselves, 
but to the influence of the Gospel upon them. I would like to read a 
word or two from the scriptures. Jesus in teaching his disciples on 
one occasion said : 

"Tf any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his 
cross, and follow me. 

"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose 
his life for my sake shall find it. 

"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his 
own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" 

In another place the Savior gave a parable in which he describes 
a man who has acquired means : 

"The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully : 

"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have 
no room where to bestow my fruits? 

"And he said, This will T do : I will pull down my barns and build greater ; 
and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 

"And I will say to my soul. Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many 
years ; take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry. 

"But God said unto him, Thou fool ! this night thy soul shall be required 
of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? 

"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God." 

I think that one of the most objectionable conditions which pre- 
vails in the world today is that of selfishness and greed. It has caused 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



more hatred, strife, bitterness and warfare among men than almost 
any other thing, so far as my understanding goes. Even today in 
this nation we are experiencing evidences of such conditions and ac- 
tions on the part of men in endeavoring to build up their own fortunes 
at the expense of the welfare of the community. The people of the 
nation are aroused, I think, to a certain extent at least, to an appre- 
ciation of the seriousness of this condition. Prosperity tends' very 
often to lead men away from a spirit of unselfishness. As they acquire 
means they tend to become, very often, greedy and selfish, and con- 
cerned only with their own welfare. I believe it was the Apostle Paul 
who said that the love of money is the root of all evil. Surely, when 
men set their hearts and their minds solely to the acquirement of 
wealth, there is great danger of their losing the perspective of things 
that are more important in life. 

In contrast to the excessive desire for self-aggrandizement which 
is all too common in the world, is the spirit of charity and sacrifice, 
of love and consideration, which is the spirit of the Gospel of Christ. 
The Latter-day Saints are a people who have been trained to sacrifice. 
Thev have been trained to understand the principles of the gospel which 
the Lord has established, which requires sacrifice. There is no prin- 
ciple that is invoked today in the Church, or that is to be found any- 
where, that is more equitable, more efficient, or that helps more to 
promote the spirit of humility, faith and stewardship on the part of 
men, than does the principle of tithing and of offerings. 

The Lord has given these principles to us that we may learn to 
sacrifice, that we may learn to overcome selfishness, and that we may 
learn to appreciate the fact that the things which this earth possesses 
and the things which we have in our possession are the Lord's. We can 
use them only during this life, and we ought to be willing to cultivate 
the spirit of giving one-tenth, at least, of our increase, for the welfare 
of his work. I can think of no other organization, or no other possi- 
bility of cooperation in so efficient a manner as that which is possible 
in this Church, through the paying of tithes and offerings whereby 
the means obtained through cooperative effort can be employed most 
effectively for the welfare of the people. 

I do not know of any other organization that is engaged to the 
same extent as this Church, comparatively, in the building of temples, 
chapels, and recreation places, where the people can enjoy the spiritual, 
social and recreational features that are afforded bv the Church. T 
visited one ward recently — a little ward comprising four hundred 
people — which, with the help of the Church, had erected a meeting- 
, house that cost, I think, $70,000. The four hundred members in that 
ward, almost all of them, had lost their homes largely because of 
adverse conditions in the farming industry and the lack of a markel 
for their farm produce. Yet they had themselves donated in money 
and in labor nearly one-half of the amount I have stated. Can you 
appreciate what a sacrifice is made by those people? Sometimes I think 
we are inclined because of our desire to build fine meetinghouses, to 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



19 



possibly overreach ourselves and put a greater strain upon the people 
than is desirable or necessary. But the people seem willing to do 
these things. 

There is no premium on poverty. The faithful observance of the 
law of tithing does not impoverish those who practise it. On the 
contrary, it is a principle of blessing and increase. The Lord desires 
that his children shall prosper temporally as well as spiritually. But 
prosperity, whether temporal or spiritual, need not prevail at the ex- 
pense of the other. Tithing is the most important principle now to be 
obeyed for the building up of the work of God in a financial way. 
It is the first donation expected of us in the advancement of his work. 
If all men and women throughout the Church who are earning would 
faithfully pay their tithes, the Church would have the means to do the 
things which are required without some other donations. In other 
words, the people would not have to donate additional means for 
meetinghouses if the members generally would observe the principle 
of tithing. 

. Now, as I stated, this principle is one that develops in men faith 
in God. It develops spirituality. Strange as it may seem to some, it 
is one of the most potent means by which we evidence our real faith 
in the Lord and in his work ; for we give evidence of our faith by our 
works. We realize the fact that we are his children, that we are here 
but for a time, and that we can take none of the goods that we possess 
away from this earth. It is important that we should employ the 
means we may possess in a most effective manner for the welfare of 
our fellowmen as well as our own good. 

Finally, observance of the law of tithing develops in us a spirit 
of economy and thrift, and of care in the handling of our own affairs. 
It helps us to overcome selfishness, and to be considerate of our fellow- 
men. It promotes the spirit of cooperation. It develops greater faith 
in the Lord and his work. And it will make this a land of Zion to us. 

I have noticed repeatedly, and I think it is generally true, that 
those who are conscientious tithepayers are the ones who are able 
to meet their obligations fairly, and to make steady progress.. They 
are blessed sufficiently at least to fulfil their obligations and to get 
ahead. The Lord blesses them and thev enjov spiritual as well as 
temporal blessings. I pray that the Lord may help us as Latter-day 
Saints to so live that we may be worthy to receive his blessings, 
through the development of the spirit of sacrifice, and the observance 
of this and every other principle of the Gospel. With all the prosperity 
that we may enjoy, and the general improvement in our financial 
conditions, may we still continue to maintain faithfully that principle, 
and may we go forward and cultivate in our hearts the feeling that 
we are stewards of all we possess, and that we hold it in trust for 
the Lord and his work. Mav we develop the spirit of dedicating that 
which we possess for the building up of his work! I pray the Lord 
to bless us to this end, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance at 
this conference, and to have the opportunity of adding my testimony to 
those that have been borne and that will be borne to the divinity of the 
work in which we are engaged. 

While listening to the opening remarks of President Grant, 
my mind reverted back over the history and the accomplishments 
of the Church in the years that have passed, since it was organ- 
ized in this dispensation in which we live. Truly, it is marvelous 
to contemplate the work, the development and the faith of our 
people. It is marvelous to note how the Church has extended, and 
how rapidly the stone that is destined to fill the whole earth, spoken 
of by Daniel the prophet, is rolling forth. It is marvelous to contem- 
plate the wonderful foundation that was laid through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith for the Church to build upon. Accurately was it all laid 
out and designed. It would seem that there might have been some 
things instituted in the beginning that would have needed correction as 
the work proceeded. That certainly would have been the case, had 
not this work been established through and by the inspiration of our 
Heavenly Father to his chosen prophet. There has been laid for the 
Church and this people a foundation upon which they have builded 
without wavering, a foundation of faith that has withstood all of the 
trials and the tribulations and the persecutions and the drivings to 
which the Church has been subjected. The hymn that propounds the 
question, "How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, is laid 
for your faith in his excellent word," is answered by the growth and 
the development and the continuity of the Church that was established 
through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. I rejoice in this founda- 
tion of faith that has held our people together, and that has kept us 
going through all these years that have passed. I read with marvel in 
my heart the deeds of valor and of heroism enacted by our pioneer 
parents who came to this land. I stood again, the other day, on the 
site where Brigham Young made that memorable remark : "This is 
the place!" I had just grossed a desert country, overland from 
El Paso, passing through parched and barren lands, and through 
sections that were inland seas in years long passed, the ground parched 
and cracked, and as I stood there I thought that I could visualize what 
this country must have looked like at that time. Yet, by the vision 
that was given, through the inspiration of the Lord, his prophet was 
able to say: "This is the place." And the foundation of faith laid in 
the hearts of the people of the Church was sufficient to make them 
believe it and to build upon it, so as to withstand the privations, the 
trials and the hardships incident to the conquering of this land. 
What a miracle has been wrought! This is a veritable garden spot; 
a beautiful city has arisen on that wasteland. 

I recalled, this morning, hearing my father tell me of his boy- 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



21 



hood days, when grandfather was away on a mission, and grandmother's 
meager earnings as a dressmaker were not sufficient to supply 
what was necessary to eat. They roamed these barren hills to 
gather segos, thistle tops and red root, and from those things, many 
and many times, made out their meager meal. It is marveolus to 
contrast those conditions with what we see today. But I maintain, 
my brethren and sisters, that men would not have done that without 
vision; men would not have done that without a foundation of faith 
that made them know, beyond all doubt, that this is the work of the 
Lord, and that they were in his service. They knew that out of their 
labors would grow the very things that we, their children, witness here 
today. 

The question to me, my brethren and sisters, is, How firm a 
foundation is there laid in the work of the Lord for my faith? Will 
I be able to endure to the end? Will I be able to meet the changing 
conditions that I find in my life? I am not called upon now to do 
those things that I had to do as a boy, for I went into a new land and had 
to make fences, build ditches, kill snakes, ride the cattle - range, and 
do many things that neither I nor my children are called upon to do 
now ; but I meet conditions, my brethren and sisters, that test and try 
my faith. Will I be able to live and maintain my integrity and con- 
tinue to build upon the faith of my fathers? Will I continue to build 
upon the broad foundation that is laid for our faith in the work of the 
Lord? We are living in an age of skepticism. We are living in an 
age of doubt. We are living in a day when men in all parts of the 
country doubt even the existence of our Father in heaven. Statistics 
reveal the fact that in these United States half of the population, 
practically, are without organizations in a religious way. They 
are unchurched ; they have no particular affiliation with any 
religious denomination. I do not say, nor do I believe from 
my contact with them, that they have no faith in God, but they are 
not anchored, they are wandering, stumbling, as it were, at noonday,' 
feeling for the wall, as does the blind man. This, my brethren and 
sisters, is because of the skepticism that has grown up, because of the 
false teaching in regard to Christ and his mission, and in regard to the 
gospel that was established as the means of salvation to our Father's 
children in the world. Will we be led away by the teachings of these 
men who are teaching false doctrine, or can we maintain our faith 
and our integrity in this glorious gospel? We have a marvelous 
mission, my brethren and sister.s, to carry this work into the world. 
There are thousands and thousands of people, millions of them, who 
are not conversant with the principles of the gospel. As I have said, 
they do not believe that there is a religion upon the earth which is 
divine, and still there is something in their hearts, something within 
them that reaches out, and they are longing for something tangible, 
for something real, that they might know where the word of God is. 
Within our keeping is the responsibility of carrying this great message 
of the restored gospel to them. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I bear you witness, my brethren and sisters, that we have 
the truth. I am satisfied, beyond a doubt, that the Book 
of Mormon was found in the Hill Cumorah, which hill has 
been acquired by the Church. I rejoice in this. I knew long before 
last summer that the Book of Mormon was true. I have studied it, 
I have pondered upon it, I have read it again and again in two 
languages. I have taught the people among whom I have been called 
to labor that it is true; but last July, for the first time in my life, I 
had the opportunity of standing upon that hill, and I endeavored to 
visualize what transpired there one hundred years ago. In my heart, 
I prayed to the Lord that I might have a witness there that the 
book is true, that the record had been taken from that sacred ground. 
I bear you my testimony that I know, as well as I know that I am 
looking into your faces, that the angel Moroni stood there with the 
boy prophet and handed to him those records. I bear you my testimony 
that I know that that boy, by the inspiration of the Lord, translated 
that record, and we have it as a witness for God in the earth today. 
The gospel; in its fulness, is contained in that sacred record. I would 
that the people of the Church would study it more than they do. I 
had occasion to make frequent inquiry, during the last year and a 
half, among our missionaries who came into the mission field as to 
their having read and studied that book before they came out. I find, 
my brethren and sisters, that there are far too many of them who 
have not given it serious consideration, and have not studied it. I 
rejoice in the fact that there is in the Church a disposition now, among 
the auxiliary organizations, to get the youth of Zion to read the Book of 
Mormon. You cannot read it without believing it is the word of God, and 
that it has been given to us for a purpose. I rejoice in the Opportunity 
that has come to me to labor with the people whose ancestors wrote it. 
I bear you my witness that the Lamanite people are of Israel. I bear 
you my witness that they are descendants of those men who wrote that 
book, and I wish to do my part in their behalf. I wish to be in- 
strumental, in the hands of the Lord, in bringing back to them the 
glorious knowledge that gives such joy to me, — that the Book of 
Mormon is true, that it contains a record of their forefathers, that 
it will teach to them the principles of the everlasting gospel, and that, 
by following those teachings, they may be saved in our Father's 
kingdom. 

We have the Bible, a wonderful record which we all appreciate, 
as well as the Book of Mormon. But J wonder, as is propounded in the 
29th chapter of Second Nephi, whether we have reflected whence we 
obtained the Bible ? We obtained it through the Jewish nation. It was 
the Jews who wrote it, and the Book of Mormon asks the question : 
What credit do the Gentiles give to the Jews for the Bible that they 
appreciate so highly ? Do we esteem them as we should ? Do we reach 
out to them, as we should, in an endeavor to make true and to bring 
to pass the glorious promises of restoration for the Jews, as con- 
tained in the Bible? Likewise, do we, as a people, realize, to the 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



23 



full extent, our obligation to the children of those who wrote the 
Book of Mormon? Do we always feel inclined to reach out to them 
and endeavor to make possible and to bring to a reality and to fulfil- 
ment the promises of the Lord made to those people, as recorded in that 
book? 

I rejoice in the testimony that I have, that the gospel is true. My 
desire is to serve, in my humble and weak way, so long as the Lord re- 
quires my service. I desire that my family shall be found employed and 
engaged in service to our Father in heaven and to his Church. There 
is nothing else in all the world that I love so much as I do my family, 
my children. To me they are very dear, and I desire them to grow up 
in an environment where they shall have this same faith, and where they 
shall have this same testimony. I desire them to have fin opportunity 
to serve in our Father's kingdom also. I love the young men and the 
young women whom the Lord has sent out to labor with me, during the 
past twenty-one years, in the missionary field. I feel a kinship to 
them, almost equal to that which I feel toward my own boys and girls. 
I rejoice when I see them go home in faith, and engage actively in the 
ministry there; and I rejoice, beyond measure, to have an experience 
such as I had just the other day, when a young man walked into my 
office, for I had not received word that he was coming or why he had 
come. When I asked him, "How long are you going to stay?" he said, 
"I have come to serve again as a missionary, for six months, in this 
mission." Twenty-one years ago he served as secretary in the Mexican 
mission. He has grown and has developed during those twenty-one 
years. He is more efficient today than he was then. I rejoice to 
see them come back, not only with their spirits as bright as when they 
left, but with renewed energy, with renewed intelligence, and better 
qualified to deliver the great gospel message. 

Let us assume the responsibilities that are ours, my brethren and 
sisters, in the spread of the gospel. Let us be mindful of the fact 
that we must teach by example as well as by precept. The Lord help 
us to do so, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There will be held, the first of next week, in San Francisco, the 
annual convention of the Boy Scouts of America.- I promised myself 
the pleasure of being there, but circumstances prevent me from going. 

As most of you are aware, the states of Utah and Idaho have taken 
a very active part in this movement, as a great many of our boys belong- 
to the Boy Scouts of America. 

We are honored today with the presence of Dr. Roy O. Wyland, 
who is the Director of Education of the National Council of Boy 
Scouts of America. We will now have the pleasure of hearing Dr. 
Wyland. 

MR. ROY O. WYLAND 

Director of Education, National Organisation, Boy Scouts of America 

President Grant, my fellow countrymen, and brothers in Christ : 
As I came upon this platform I breathed a prayer that God would 
give me words of wisdom that I might speak to you a message which 
will help to further the splendid work that you have been doing and 
that you are now doing for the youth of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

I am exceedingly happy to stand upon this platform and to bring 
you greetings from the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America; 
and, if possible, to give you in part, a vision of the vitality, of the 
rapid spread, and of the effectiveness of the work of an organization 
which is great because other people throughout the world are mani- 
festing the same definite interest, though probably not in so wide a 
degree, as you are here in Utah and throughout your magnificent Church 
in the work of this movement as a means of service to their boyhood. 

Behold a modern movement of the knighthood of youth which 
enrolls in its membership each year more than a quarter of a million 
boys who never were Scouts before; a movement which, in eighteen 
years, has enrolled approximately three million boys, and three-quarters 
of a million men who have given volunteer leadership to make possible 
a larger service to the youth of the nation ; a movement which, in the 
year 1927, had an enrollment of about four million boys and 186,000 
men ; a movement which reaches out into the open spaces to serve the 
boy upon the farm with a Lone-Scout program, which he receives 



DR. ROY O. IVY LAND 



25 



through the mail, through the Lone-Scout Patrols which are carried 
on in the homes of the farmers (his neighbor boys gather with him 
around the fireside during the long winter months) ; a work which 
reaches unto our colored boys in the South, in a division which has 
recently been established with the colored youth of the nation ! It is 
a program which reaches into the life and thought and feelings of 
every class and type of people, of every political and religious party 
in the United States, and is universal in its scope. 

I do not know whether you can appreciate what four-million mem- 
bership looks like. T cannot see that many people. The truth of the 
matter is, I never before in my life looked into the faces of an audience 
so large as this. This is the largest inspiration that has ever come into 
my life in facing a group of representative men and women. But 
imagine, if you will, a group of four million boys and men. If you 
would gather that great group of boys and men on Long Island and 
march them, in single file, across Brooklyn Bridge and up Broadway 
and along the Storm King Highway to Albany and to Buffalo, on to 
Toledo, Chicago, Omaha, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City and San Francisco, 
when you had gathered two hundred thousand Scouts at the Golden 
Gate, at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, with a marching column 
three thousand miles across this continent, you would still have more 
than two hundred thousand on Long Island that had not yet crossed 
Brooklyn Bridge. That is the membership of a movement, a crusade, 
a modern knighthood of youth that has spread throughout this land 
in the brief space of eighteen years, which adds to its membership 
a little more than one hundred thousand each year. 

Scouting is not con finer! to America. In the eighteen years it has 
been saturating this country. Scouting has reached out to the civilized 
world, and today we have a membership in the other nations which 
totals about four millions. Forty-three of our leading civilized nations 
have national Scout associations. Every four years they send rep- 
resentatives to the international jamboree, where a great concourse 
of boys (some fifteen to sixteen thousand) meet on the same common 
field, not a battle field, thank God, but on the field of friendly en- 
deavor, to demonstrate the achievements of Scouting, in the forty-three 
civilized nations, which forms an international brotherhood, reaching 
out beyond the points of our mother-land, and gripping the hand of 
our brother Scouts in our brother-lands around the world. These 
Scouts of all nations are learning to be brothers, to understand one 
another, to respect one another, to sympathize with one another, and 
to look through the eyes of a brother Scout into the problems and lives 
and sympathies and rights of other Scouts and other nations the world 
around. 

We believe that we are laying the foundation and furthering a 
movement of world brotherhood in this splendid, magnificent boy move- 
ment which has swept the nations of the world. 

But Scouting is not confined to the forty-three nations. There 
are Scout troops in some twenty or more other nations, where there has 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not been sufficient organization, as yet, to establish a national organ- 
ization, but Scout troops are there organized and are carrying out their 
method of Scouting in their own way, looking forward to the time 
when they will be sufficiently strong to organize a national association 
and to become part of the international fellowship of Scouting. So 
the sun, in all its course, never ceases to shine upon the uniform of the 
Roy Scout of the nations of the world, and that is a picture of this 
movement of Scouting throughout the world. 

We have just produced a new handbook for boys, which went to 
the press in the first week in November, 1927. We ordered a half 
million copies as the first part of a million order. The printers were 
so much surprised at the size of the order that they looked into the 
records to find if any other order of its size, had ever been given, and 
they found that it was the largest single order of any book or form 
that had ever been given to any publisher. We have already sold five 
hundred thousand copies, and the other day, before he left New York 
for San Francisco, Mr. West placed an order for two hundred thou- 
sand more copies of the new handbook, to satisfy a need that is evident 
within four months from the time that the book was given to the 
public. The old handbook went through thirty-seven editions in 
seventeen years, and three million one hundred thousand copies were 
circulated. There is only one other book in print that has had as wide 
a circulation among the people of any civilized land as our handbook, 
and that is the Christian Bible, the circulation of which is many times 
more than that of our handbook, but we hold second place. 

I have indicated these high spots in the power and influence 
and rapid spread of Scouting, only to impress your mind with the 
vitality of this movement. You have been aware of the vitality of the 
Church. I have also been aware of the vitality of the Church. I have 
read several of the books on "Mormonism." I have been impressed 
with your method of organization. I have been impressed with your 
rapid spread. I have been more impressed by what I have seen and 
felt here today than by anything I have ever read or seen of the vitality 
and power and onward sweep of the great Church of which you are 
a part. 

I should like you to have a vision of the vitality of the Church 
and the vitality of Scouting tied up together in one union for the 
service of the youth of this nation. I should also like you to feel 
the power that can be carried forward through the combination of 
religion in the life of adults tied up with the program of vitality in the 
life of youth, so that the leadership and the power and example of 
adults can be brought to bear and made effective in the life of youth. 

Scouting vitality may be accounted for on three counts : First, its 
appeal to the boy because of the great out-of-doors that it brings into 
his life, the skill, the information, the fun and the fellowship and 
all that goes into it, and its romance and friendship that makes it appeal 
to the boy. Scouting vitality is accounted for secondly on the basis 
of its appeal to men because of the physical benefits and vocational 



DR. ROY 0. WYLAND 



27 



guidance, the clean recreation, the clean reading program, the citizen- 
ship training, the character building, the initiative, the courage, the 
manhood and the recognition that bring into the lives of boys those 
principles which make reliable citizens. There you have two appeals. 
But there is a third one, which many people do not see, and that is 
the appeal which Scouting makes to the institutions which carry on 
this program as a part of their programs ; for you must realize that 
Scouting does not go out to the world to propagate itself. It is 
propagated by those who believe in it, and those who believe in it and 
carry it forward, in a great majority of cases, are those who make 
up the churches of America. It has been my responsibility and supreme 
opportunity to be the liaison between the Boy Scout movement and the 
churches of all states in this land, and I have had a delightful fellow- 
ship with men of all religions and all faiths and creeds and have been 
able to help tie into the program of the various church bodies the 
activities which Scouting offers in better service to their boyhood. 

We believe that Scouting has succeeded in America. We not only 
believe but we know it has succeeded in America far beyond its 
success in any other country; so much so that we can match the entire 
Scouting population of all the races of the world with our Scouting 
population, because of the fact that the churches of America have taken 
Scouting and made it a part of their program in the service to youth. 
More than sixteen thousand of our twenty-seven thousand Scout troops 
are in churches. The church furnishes the leadership ; it furnishes 
the places in which to meet ; it furnishes supervision ; it names the 
troops ; it names the Scoutmasters, and the local church controls the 
Scout program through its own leadership. They administer the leader- 
ship ; they sponsor and carry on that program. The Boy Scout move- 
ment has started out to carry on a program gathered around a certain 
ideal, a beautiful conception of an ideal, — a soul ; and that soul is 
expressed in the Scout oath involved, and will make the movement live. 

The churches of America have supported our movement because 
they feel that the soul of Scouting, as expressed in the Scout oath and 
law, is thoroughly in line with the objectives of the church. For 
example, at the north pole of the Scouting compass, we have placed, 
duty to God ; at the point of the rising sun, we have placed, duty to 
country ; at the point of the genial south, we have placed, duty to our 
fellow-men; and at the point of the setting sun, duty to self. And 
these are the words of the Scout Oath : 

"Upon my honor I will do my best — 

"1. To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law. 
"2. To help other people at all times. 

"3. To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight." 

Between duty to God and duty to country, a Scout is trustworthy, 
loyal and helpful. 

Between duty to country and duty to others, a Scout is friendly, 
courteous and kind. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Between duty to others and duty to self, a Scout is obedient, cheer- 
ful, and thrifty. 

Between duty to self and duty to God, a Scout is brave, clean and 
reverent. 

And there you have, swinging around the Scout compass, the 
sixteen points, beginning with duty to God, and coming back again 
to duty to God, in the twelve Scout laws. So the ideal of Scouting 
and the objective and aim of the church are one. And so the church 
has taken Scouting to its bosom to carry forward its program. 

There are four or five reasons why the church offers the best 
home to the Boy Scout troops. I should like to name these and 
further impress upon you the responsibility you have, as leaders of the 
church, to carry out in the lives of these boys in the church the spiritual 
program you have for your boys, and supplement the activities program 
which Scouting offers to them. 

The church is the best home for a Scout troop, first, because it 
has the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which boys should grow up. 
As no other institution, it has the soul and spirit life which surrounds 
the place and which surrounds the boy whose life centers in the church. 
Then again the church has the man power with the right character, the 
right spirit, the right vision, who are worthy to be leaders of boys : and 
that character and that spirit and that vision are more important to 
the boys than are all the skill and information you can ever get over 
through the Scout handbook or any other handbook you may find. In 
the third place, because of the spiritual atmosphere and the right ex- 
ample of men, the church in the community has the confidence of 
fathers and mothers in the community as no other institution has that 
confidence; and, because of that, it will have the support of fathers 
and mothers in a community as no other movement will have. In the 
fourth place, the church can complete in the lives of these boys a 
program of religious education which Scouting cannot give. We deal 
with the great body of the Catholic church and are officially represented 
in their circles, and our program is carried forward under the super- 
vision of their cardinals, archbishops and bishops. We are represented 
also in about thirty or forty of the protestant denominations in America, 
and our program is carried forward by them to their groups. We 
are also represented in the Jewish groups of America by their com- 
mittee, and so on. We cannot let the Boy Scout movement pass out 
anything of a definitely religious program to these groups, but expect 
these groups to take up our program of activities and carry it along- 
side, and tie in with it, and bring to bear upon the lives of their own 
boys, the spiritual message, the spiritual ideals, the spiritual life, the 
religious life of the church of which the troop is a part. 

But there is another reason why we want our Scouting tied into 
the church, and that is because of the thought, that no matter how 
effective a Scouting program may be in the lives of boys, we know it 
is a temporary program, which may serve the boy in the period of his 
youth and early adolescence, as he grows to manhood, but it is only 



DR. ROY O. WYLAND 



29 



a brief period. You know, if you take a man along that period, ever 
so well, for two or three years, and leave him there without support and 
without foundation, without anything to help him to carry on, you have 
not done him any more service than if you started to carry a man 
across the country, to a town beyond, and lost him in the prairie or in 
the woods, or marooned him on a desert island. That is not helping 
a man to attain his destiny. 

But what has the church ? The church has a program that ministers 
for the boyhood under its mother arm, that carries on through his 
growing period of life to manhood and maturity and old age and down 
to the grave. The church has a program that ministers all the way 
along. Scouting is brief in its period with the boy. If we can tie 
up Scouting with a boy, we will tie up the boy with his church and 
with his God, and then this program will carry on in his life, and the 
church will be there to sustain and bless and support him to the end 
and out into the life to come. 

One last word and I am through. I am happy to bring you 
word that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is using the 
Boy Scout program in a larger way than any other church in existence. 
I am happy to tell you that there are 846 troops among the Latter- 
day Saints ; that you have a larger per capita of Scouts in your member- 
ship than any other religious body on record. I am happy also to tell 
you that, in the State of Utah, you have a larger percentage of Scouts 
in the boy population than any other state. And I am happy also to 
tell you that the reason for this is because you have a closer tie-in and 
community correlation with Scouting in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints than in any other church as a church body. You 
have absolutely correlated and included Scouting with your program 
for young boys. I am happy to say also that a large part of that success 
is due to the fact that you have had a leadership in your Church, in the 
personality of Mr. Oscar A. Kirkham and Mr. Datus E. Hammond and 
other executives, sponsored by your able President and members of the 
Council of Twelve, sponsored also by your local bishops, and carried 
on by your local wards and stakes throughout this country, that has 
given a volunteer and a loyal leadership and support that is unequalled 
by any other religious body in America. And I say that because I 
know, because I study the records of all of them. I close by saying that 
I pray God that, through our Lord Jesus Christ, the work of Scouting 
and youth in this Church may be carried on and live forever. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I am sure that we all rejoice in the encouragement and satisfaction 
which we have just received. Wip could well say to the eminent gentle- 
man who has just addressed us that nothing could be said to give us 
greater and more lasting satisfaction than that our youth are learning 
principles of righteous conduct and are being trained in the Gospel of 
Christ, preparatory for duties as citizens of the country, and for their 
service to fellowmen, and God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A MESSAGE OF JOY 

1 do not know that I can adequately convey to you a message 
that is in my heart today. I have felt that we have a duty, a paramount 
duty to all the world and to the Church to interpret the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ in a manner which shall appeal ; to reveal the joy of it. 

Today is Good Friday, a day which is set apart in Christendom 
in memory of the crucifixion of the Savior of the world. I have seen 
several representations of the personality of Christ portrayed on the 
stage, and more recently portrayed on - the moving picture screen. 
I cannot remember that in all these representations I have ever seen 
the Christ made to appear happy. I have seldom if ever seen him 
appear to smile. All of the representations have brought a message 
of gloom, sadness and final death. It may be that certain good is 
accomplished by such representations. I take it that it is desirable that 
we should remember the sufferings of our Lord and Savior. We are 
called upon by the Lord himself to commemorate his broken flesh and 
his spilled blood. His remarkable, incomparable sacrifice should never 
leave our minds, for it is by and through that sacrifice that he did 
become our Savior and our Redeemer. Yet at the same time I do not 
look upon the Savior of the world as a man of gloom, nor do I regard 
the Gospel he gave to the world as one of despair, or one which is 
intended to kill the joy in humanity. 

All the natural world bids us have joy. The flowers that bloom, 
the sweet perfumes that greet our senses, the colors that enliven our 
environment, are all calculated to bring to us joy, to enliven us with 
a sense of beauty, richness and fulness of life. 

Christ did not come to take the color out of life, and I attribute 
the large measure of indifference to his word, indeed the resistance 
which is set up against it, in no small part to the erroneous interpre- 
tation of his cause, of his life and his service under which the world 
has suffered for centuries of time. 

"Men are that they may have joy." It is as natural to long for 
joy as it is to live, and it would be a perversion of the fundamental 
philosophy of things if religion were to be interpreted as an imposition 
upon life, to take out its joy and its gladness. 

PRINCIPLES OF GOSPEL A STABILIZING FORCE 

I am thinking of the host of young, of these armies of Boy Scouts 
of whom we' have just learned. I am thinking of their attitude and 
I am delighted that the Doctor reminded us that the program which 
the Boy Scouts' organization provides for these young men is of 
temporary and partial character only. These young men, a million 
strong, need something to stabilize their lives. They need a force to 
guide and direct them. They need to realize the richness and the beauty 
of life, not only during their youth but all through their maturity, and 
we hold out to the world blessed, beautiful, cheerful life-giving prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Christ to supply that vital need. It is incumbent 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



31 



upon those who teach the youth to interpret the Gospel for them in 
such terms that they may see its joys, its encouragements. 

PROVISION FOR IMPROVEMENT AND PROGRESSION 

Every man loves to improve. Progression is the very law of life 
itself. The Gospel of Jesus Christ, as interpreted by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, is the embodiment of eternal progression. Improvement 
is constantly advocated and provision for it is made. Men seek today 
to improve their temporal condition. It is a day when men have been 
able to harness the forces of nature, and by the inventions which 
have been devised more liberally enjoy the resources of nature than 
ever before. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is in no sense incompatible with such 
important improvements. It recognizes the intelligence in man. It 
seeks through education to develop that intelligence, to expound the 
principles of life, to investigate and understand the secrets which 
nature and the universe hold. 

MATERIAL PROSPERITY NOT CONDEMNED 

Material prosperity is not repugnant to the spirit of the Gospel. 
Indeed it is regarded as being an accomplishment worth while to be 
able to so accumulate or organize an industry or enterprise as to 
improve the conditions under which people live. It is selfishness and 
■personal aggrandizement at which the Gospel directs its injunctions. 
But when one who has the true spirit of the gospel at heart, one who 
has consecrated himself to the service of God and his fellowmen, has 
been able to acquire property or to organize materials or forces for 
the improvement of conditions, he in no sense comes under con- 
demnation. The spirit of consecration, devotion to the cause, to 
altruistic interests, is of the very genius of the Gospel. 

JOY THROUGH SACRIFICE AND SERVICE 

When Christ said to his disciples that they should take up the 
cross and follow him, I have never interpreted that to mean that they 
were to load upon themselves gloom and despair. He said, "I am come 
that ye may have life, and have it more abundantly." He engaged 
his disciples to disseminate the glad tidings of great joy which he 
taught. It is true that he made sacrifice, it is true that his life was 
filled with many wrongs to him, and that he suffered inexplicably, and 
yet I cannot but think that in all his sufferings, indeed even in the 
giving of his life he experienced a joy that transcends the compre- 
hension of the finite mind. He knew of the vitality of the work which 
he did. He knew he was the Savior of mankind. He knew of the 
beneficent results that would follow his supreme sacrifice, and that 
knowledge could not have failed to transport him with a joy that no 
one can fully appreciate and realize. The joy of service, the joy of 
spreading his great work, is the only comparable joy that we may have. 

I want the youth of Zion, as well as the youth of all people, to 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



know that to believe in Christ and to live his gospel is to bring the 
supreme joy and happiness into their lives. There is no other royal 
road to the happiness of mankind excepting the path which Jesus set. 

OUR OBLIGATION 

And so, my brethren and sisters of the Church, having these 
wonderful interpretations of the life of Christ and of the purpose of 
his ministry given to us by the Prophet of the latter days, it becomes 
incumbent upon us to so live and so teach that the world will long 
for the gospel of Christ as it longs today for pleasure and the grati- 
fication of appetite. 

"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bring 
glad tidings of great joy!" These glad tidings are entrusted to us to 
give to the world, and to give to our youth. I pray God that we may 
have the vision, the strength, and the love to give them faithfully, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

There has been, this afternoon, a very great and deserving com- 
pliment paid to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its 
work with the boys of the Church as they have become associated with 
the Boy Scout movement. 

PRACTICAL VALUE OF SCOUTING 

I believe in Boy Scouting. It has come into my home. The past 
few days my seventeen-year-old boy has been attending a Scout pow- 
wow that has been conducted at the University of Utah. This after- 
noon, as I was about to leave for meeting, my boy sat at the table 
working with his papers. I suggested that T should be pleased if he 
felt like coming to conference with me. He said, "Father, I am work- 
ing on these merit badges. I do not see how I can very well leave 
them." And realizing that this was a consummation of what he had 
been working on during the past three days, I felt to excuse him. This 
boy has earned and obtained seventy merit badges. He is not satisfied 
yet. 

One evening as we sat in our home, one of my sons-in-law, who 
has had much experience in the handling of cattle and horses said 
he would like to know what my son had to learn in order to obtain 
a merit badge for horsemanship. So the boy proceeded to tell him, and, 
when he was through, my son-in-law remarked that he had been with 
horses and cattle all his life, but that he had just heard things about 
horsemanship that he had never known before. 

I have thought that what is required to obtain the merit badges 
presented by the Boy Scout organization, would make a splendid junior- 
college course, and I know that the influence of the organization is 
wholesome and good. T believe that if our boys were to become good 
Scouts, they would be better deacons, teachers, and priests and better

Church members; so I desire to lend my influence to the Scout move- 
ment. 

GOD TO RAISE UP A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS JOSEPH 

The beautiful tenor solo that 'was rendered here this afternoon 
impressed me very much. The prediction made by Joseph who was sold 
into Egypt, looking down through the vista of time, and seeing that a 
man of God would be raised up for the accomplishment of a mighty 
work in the last days, contained a very specific declaration, to the 
effect that as his own name was Joseph, so should be the name of this 
individual whom the Lord would raise up, and not only that, but that 
the name of this individual's father also should be Joseph. The com- 
ing forth of Joseph Smith as a prophet of the last dispensation fulfils 
that prediction beautifully. His coming forth and the visitation of 
the Father and the Son and the message delivered to the boy, Joseph, 
in answer to his earnest prayer, were most beautifully presented in that 
solo this afternoon. 

EVIDENCE OF TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL 

As I was thinking of these things, I thanked the Lord in my heart 
for the many evidences that he has given to us of the truth of the 
gospel, as it has been revealed to us through the instrumentality of 
Joseph Smith. And I said to myself, I know that this is God's work, 
1 know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and I can prove 
it to my own entire satisfaction. It does seem to me that what is 
satisfying to my soul, in the way of evidence, should be satisfying to 
the souls of other men and women who are honestly seeking for light 
and truth. 

WITNESSES TO TESTIFY 

It is not unusual that witnesses should be raised up to testify of 
God and his Son Jesus Christ and of the truth. We read in Acts, 
first chapter and eighth verse: 

"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and 
ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in 
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." 

With the disciples of the Master, that was one important part 
of their calling, to be witnesses of the Lord. In John twentieth chap- 
ter and thirty-first verse, in speaking of the things which were written 
and preserved in the New Testament, we read : 

"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son 
of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name." 

And so, in this day and time, the Lord has raised up witnesses for 
him. His prophets are bis living witnesses and the oracles of the 
Church. After Joseph Smith had received from the angel Moroni the 
plates from which the Book of Mormon has been translated, and after 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the translation, the Lord provided witnesses, and he did this that men 
and women who are seeking for light and truth might be convinced 
and that those who believe not might be left without excuse. 

TESTIMONY OF BOOK OF MORMON WITNESSES 

You know the nature of the testimony of Oliver Cowdery, David 
Whitmer and Martin Harris. They testify that an angel of God came 
down from heaven and laid before their eyes, that they beheld and saw 
the plates and the engravings thereon; that they heard a voice from 
heaven saying that they had been translated by the gift and power of 
God; and that they were commanded to bear record of that fact, 
which they did. 

Eight other witnesses, reputable men, men of character, testified 
that Joseph Smith showed to them the plates, which had the appearance 
of gold, and as many of the leaves as he had translated they handled 
with their hands, and they declared that the characters on those plates 
had the appearance of ancient work and of curious workmanship, and 
they gave their names to the world as witnesses of these facts. 

In the Book of Ether (Book of Mormon), 5th chapter, 3rd and 
4th verses, we have a declaration, that the Lord would raise up these 
witnesses, in words like this : 

"And unto three shall they [the plates] be shown by the power of God; 
wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true. 

"And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established ; and 
the testimony of three, and this work, in which shall be shown forth the 
power of God, and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost bear record — and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world 
at the last day." 

In one of our modern revelations, as contained in section 20 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith said : 

"Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them shall the world be judged, 
even as many as shall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work. 

"And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a 
crown of eternal life ; 

"But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn 
to their own condemnation." 

TESTIMONIES THAT JOSEPH SMITH WAS A TRUE PROPHET 

Applying a little reason to these testimonies, and I am sure that 
the Lord intends that we should, I conclude that these evidences, these 
testimonies of the three and eight witnesses to the truth of the Book of 
Mormon, are just as strong testimonies that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God as that the Book of Mormon is true. The Book of Mormon 
could not be true, having come through the instrumentality of Joseph 
Smith, had he not been a prophet of God. 

We may take the test which our Savior gave by which we might 
know a true or false prophet. He said: 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



35 



"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit. * * * 

"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." 

prophet's STORY MUST BE TRUE 

There can be no question about the Book of Mormon, as it is 
given us today, with the fulness of the everlasting gospel contained 
therein, being the fruit of this tree, Joseph Smith, in that it was given 
to. us, of the Lord, through him. Then, if Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of God, the story that he tells of the visitation of the Father and the 
Son to him must be true, and, being true, God the Eternal Father is a 
glorified, immortal being, having a body of flesh and bones and spirit, 
and his Son like him. Joseph Smith being a prophet, this visitation 
being true, the things that were told to the Prophet Joseph by the Son 
of God must also be true — that there had been a falling away. That 
did not mean that just a few apostatized from the Church. It has 
always been that way ; in every dispensation there are some that fall 
away. There had been a general or universal apostasy from the truth. 
That is the word of our Lord and Savior to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and the testimony of these witnesses is a testimony of that fact. 

A FALLING AWAY BEFORE A RESTORATION 

We stand for a restoration of the gospel. But how can there be 
a restoration of the gospel without there first be a falling away? The 
scriptures tell us that "known unto God are all things, even the end 
from the beginning." They also tell us that no prophecy of the scrip- 
ture is of any private interpretation, but that the prophecies came not 
in olden time, by the will of man, but that holy men of God spoke as 
they were moved upon by the power of the Holy Ghost. That is the 
means of communication between the heavens and the earth. 

And again, we are told that the Lord doeth no thing, but he 
revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets. And I think we may 
add to that, no great thing is done, affecting the human family, except 
it has been revealed to his servants the prophets. If there was to be 
a universal falling away from the truth, he would have made it known 
through his prophets. He has done so, and made it very clear. Many 
scriptural declarations, concerning an apostate condition are to be found 
in the Old and New Testaments. History tells us that there has been 
this falling away. 

KEYS OF THE PRIESTHOOD RESTORED 

The Lord has sent John, the Baptist, who died in the primitive 
days, holding the Aaronic Priesthood, and the keys of that Priesthood 
were conferred by him upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, with 
authority also to confer it upon others who are wortjiy. That was in 
the spring of 1829. A little later, Peter, James and John, who held the 
keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood in the primitive days, came and 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



visited Joseph and Oliver and conferred the keys of that priesthood 
upon them. 

If Joseph Smith had not been a prophet of God, these witnesses 
could not have testified as they did; he being a prophet of God, what 
he said and what Oliver Cowdery said, in regard to the restoring of 
the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods upon them, must be true. It 
happened just about the time that these witnesses bore their testimony, 
in the spring of 1829. It was on the 15th day of May that John, the 
Iiaptist, conferred the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood. 

I say these witnesses, the like of which no other religious organiza- 
tion can provide for its comfort and conversion, are witnesses of the 
truth of the restoration of the everlasting gospel. 

FORESEEING OF RESTORATION PROOF OF FALLING AWAY 

John, the Revelator, as recorded in Revelation, 14th chapter, 6th 
and 7th verses, when his vision was opened to see the many things that 
were to transpire before the great and glorious event of the coming 
of our Lord in the last days, towards which the eyes of all religionists 
are directed today, said : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour 
of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea, and the fountains of waters." 

Would there have been any occasion for an angel to deliver the 
everlasting gospel to the nations of the earth if the gospel, recognized 
of the Lord, and the authority of the Lord to administer the ordinances 
of the gospel had been here? Reason answers that question for us. 
There would have been no occasion for it. 

John's vision completely fulfilled 

The visitation of the Angel Moroni fulfilled, at least partly, the 
vision of John upon Patmos, when he delivered to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, 
containing the fulness of the everlasting gospel as taught by our Savior 
to the ancient inhabitants on this continent. If there need be any further 
administration to make a full and complete fulfilment of what John 
saw, we find it in the visitation of John, the Baptist, conferring the 
keys of the Aaronic Priesthood, and the visitation of Peter, James and 
John, conferring the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood, conferring the 
power and authority to build up the Church and kingdom of God upon 
the earth, to establish the Church of Christ, to restore the gospel, and 
administer the ordinances unto the children of men who are prepared 
to receive them. 

All these and numerous other evidences come up before us, prov- 
ing the truth of this work and that Joseph Smith was a divinely in- 
spired man of God, a prophet in very deed. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



37 



NOT ALL ACCOMPLISHED AT ONCE 

And now, carrying the thought just a little further, if I may, all 
that we see in this mighty work of God, the admiration of the world, 
because of the beauty and perfection of its organization, the efficiency 
of its workings — have not been accomplished in the days of Joseph 
Smith. Only one of these great auxiliary associations of the Church 
had been organized in his day, but they have been organized since, under 
the leadership of those who have succeeded to the presidency of this 
Church. These great auxiliary associations, our Church school system, 
our seminaries, these stakes of Zion throughout the valleys of the moun- 
tains, ninety-nine in number, and a thousand wards and branches, are 
evidences to me, conclusive and convincing, that those who have suc- 
ceeded to the Presidency of this Church have been recognized of the 
Lord. His power has been with them in administration, and those 
who have been associated with them, and this work has grown and 
prospered until it has arrived at its present condition. 

HEBER J. GRANT A PROPHET OF GOD 

I know that Heber J. Grant is an inspired man of God, the right 
man at the head of this work, a prophet, seer and revelator, just as well 
as I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I uphold and 
sustain him as such. This people do also. Were it not so, he could 
not accomplish the work the Lord has for him to accomplish, and that 
which he is accomplishing with the means that the Lord has given him. 
So that I know that we are the people of God, that this is the Church of 
Christ, the power of God unto salvation, and I do know that it will go- 
on to triumph. The truth will, ultimately, prevail throughout this 
world, and the purposes of our Father in heaven will be consummated, 
his Son will come to reign over this his kingdom, as King of kings and 
Lord of lords, forever and ever. 

This is my testimony ; I bear it unto you in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Commissioner of Education 

My brethren and sisters: This is the first time in my life thai 
I have been called without previous notice, to this position. T do not 
know what I can say. I came today wholly in a receptive attitude. 
Perhaps I can do no better than to give you a confession of my faith. 

I believe that I have been called to the finest and the best edu- 
cational position in America. I think that for two reasons primarily. 
One because of the character of the people with whom I have been 
brought in contact, and the other, because of the nature of the work 
itself. j i 

Bishop Cannon this morning spoke of the quality of selfishness 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that was dominant in the lives and conduct of many people. May I 
say that I have learned that the people with whom I labor are devoid 
of that quality. Without a single exception every individual with 
whom I have been brought into contact has looked at our problems 
from the standpoint of what is best for the whole. I have talked with 
ambitious college presidents, with ambitious teachers, with ambitious 
chairmen of boards, with respect to their problems. Without a single 
exception they have said that what is best for the whole is what we 
will cheerfully accept. That spirit makes the work extremely pleasant. 

Again may I say that I believe there is no kind of education in 
the world that is so fine and so elevating and so good and so im- 
portant as religious education. And I believe that nowhere in the world 
is there a system of religions education that is equal in its quality, in 
its thoroughness and in its comprehensiveness to the system of educa- 
tion that is being undertaken in this Church. The time will come, I 
verily believe, and before very many years, when week-day religious 
education will be offered to every high school boy and girl, to every 
college and university boy and girl in this Church. 

The seminary movement is progressing rapidly. It is doing an 
extremely good work. We have recently received testimonials from 
all of the school superintendents in the districts where we have either 
schools or seminaries located, testifying to the value of this work. 
They have used such expressions as these, when speaking of the 
nature of that work : 

"Most highly satisfactory." 

"Exerting the highest moral and ethical influence." 

"It is the finest thing that has come to this school." 

You understand of course .that in all of our system of education 
we are not trying to get into, we are not trying to dominate, we are 
not trying to influence improperly, we are not trying to interfere 
in any way with the public school system of education. All that we 
are asking is that the members of the Church may voluntarily go 
during school hours into our buildings, and our own property, and 
receive religious education. And this religious education was given 
daily last year, as President Grant announced this morning, to more 
tban 14,000 who were in daily attendance at high schools and colleges. 
This year more than 15,000 high school and college students arc 
attending week-day religion classes. 

With respect to my faith in this work may I say that long years 
ago, before ever I left my home for collegiate training, I received a 
testimony of the existence of a divine power, who could reveal him- 
self to men. And so in all of my life since that time I have never 
once doubted the existence of such a power, of a revelator who can 
give knowledge to an individual, and who can hear and answer prayers. 

In my boyhood days, for seven long years, I prayed daily for 
certain knowledge, for a certain blessing. Once during that time I 
was greatly encouraged by attending an evening entertainment in 
which a group of young people sang, "Keep on asking; God will 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



39 



answer by and by." I kept on praying. And finally when the answer 
came I did not know that shortly I was to leave my home for ten 
years of college and university work. Hence I did not know the 
significance at that time of the message that came to me, of how it 
would stabilize me in my faith in the years immediately before me. 
One night between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, after a hard 
day's work, there came to me a revelation from on high that was most 
glorious in its nature, that has been from that moment to this an 
absolute testimony to me of the existence of a higher power, of the 
existence of a God who will hear and answer the prayers of a humble 
farmer boy. Further, since that time I have had two critical periods 
in my life, when I did not know how to turn, and there came to me 
at each of those times a revelation from on high that directed me, 
that told me what was to come to pass, and how I should perform. 

And so I care not, my brethren and sisters, what the philosophy 
of men may be, how they may question the existence of divinity, how 
they may question the existence and power of a being who will hear 
and answer prayers, and will direct in the affairs of men. I know 
of my own self that God lives, that he does reveal himself to men, 
that he does direct men. And so I have such confidence in God, I 
have such confidence in this as being his divine work, that I stand 
ready to welcome investigators, research workers and truth seekers 
in every field of human thought and human endeavor, feeling assured, 
independent of what they may say or what their explanations may be. 
if they find truth in any field of endeavor whatsoever, that truth 
will be in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ as we understand 
it. And so I feel that there is absolutely no reason for us to be afraid 
that our young people, if they are rightly led and taught in gospel 
truths, can ever be won away into infidelity by anything that men may 
teach that is contrary to the truth, because all truth is in harmony 
with truth. 

In my early boyhood I learned this couplet : 

"Truth is truth wherever found, 
On heathen or on Christian ground." 

And I believe it thoroughly. 

To me there stands today at the head of this Church in President 
Heber J. Grant, the personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and there sits surrounding him today men who have been called as 
special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I want to testify to 
you that I do know of my own self through revelation that has come 
to me, that these men are what they claim to be, and that this Church is 
what it claims to be, and that if we are true to our professions ; if 
we are true to ourselves, we shall eventually attain to the goal for 
which we have started out. 

May the Lord give us strength and help us to do this, I ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



40 



. GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

It is the pure testimony of the Spirit that reaches the hearts of 
the children of men. As I listened this morning to the President of 
the Church and the other speakers, I recalled the words which the 
haughty and wicked king of Babylon addressed to Daniel, the Hebrew 
prophet. The king said to him : 

"And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve 
doubts." (Daniel 5:16.) 

Could a more eloquent tribute be paid to the prophetic office of a 
man of God than that? Is it not wonderful to dispel darkness and to 
dissolve doubt ? It is the truth, as the Savior said, that makes us free. 

With all my heart I believe that the gospel is a dissolver of doubt. 
One of the greatest editors that this country has ever produced lost 
his boy, five years old, by death. Friends endeavored to console him 
in this great bereavement. The man of letters said : 

"Now, all that deeply concerns me is the evidence that we shall live here- 
after, and especially that we shall live with and know those we loved here, 
(f T felt sure on the point of identifying and being with our loved ones in the 
world to come," etc. 

The gospel answers this question. The Apostle Paul said : 

"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, 
who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through 
the Gospel." (2 Timothy 1 :10.) 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, the founder of this Church, through 
the will of God, was given a most comprehensive and inspired defi- 
nition of truth. 

"And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they 
are to come." (Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 93:24.) 

This choice seer "gazed on the past, the future, too, and opened 
the heavenly worlds to view." 

This religion of which I am proud, this religion designated by the 
world as "Mormonism," brings the consolation of divine comfort to 
the hearts of stricken parents, that their babies laid away in death, their 
youth who have been called to the other side, shall be restored to them 
in the resurrection, and that parents shall have the joy of rearing in- 
fant children, in the resurrection, to manhood and to womanhood, for 
"God will finish what he hath begun." 

"Mormonism" dissolves doubt as to the origin of man. We believe 
in the immortal origin of men and women : that God is the Father of 
our spirits — that we had a royal ancestry. And the Latter-day Saint, 
whose path is lighted by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, will 
never say to the Almighty, as he said some people would say: "Thou 
formed me not." No, "Mormonism" gives the answer, vouchsafed 
to us in holy writ and modern and ancient revelation, that the Almighty 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



41 



is the Father of our spirits, that we lived as individuals in spiritual 
form before we came to this earth. 

Another thing: "Mormonism" dissolves any and every doubt 
concerning the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Book of Mor- 
mon, which is another witness for God, testifies (and that is one of 
the main purposes for which it was written) that Jesus is the Son of 
God, the Redeemer of the world, and the Savior of mankind; that 
he redeemed us from death, and brought to light life and immortality, 
through obedience to the gospel. This is the testimony that we bear to 
the world. Our doubts have been dissolved by the gospel ; and, 
instead of doubt and uncertainty, the light, the testimony of the 
I loly Ghost, the power that guides into all truth, fills our hearts, and 
we can say, with Job, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he 
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth." 

Thank God for the gospel. Thank God for the Holy Ghost. 
Thank God for the inspired prophets, seers and revelators who, by their 
ministry and the word of life, have dissolved all doubts and dispelled 
the clouds of darkness. 

I bear you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God ; that 
Joseph Smith was his prophet, and that he, like Daniel, was a di.ssolver 
of doubts, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

At 10 o'clock Saturday .morning, April 7, 1928, the conference 
reconvened in the tabernacle. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Come, come ye saints." 
Invocation was offered by Elder Walter K. Barton, president of 
the Franklin stake of Zion. 

A solo, "He that dwelleth," was sung by James E. Haslam. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Among the wonderful inventions of our day is that of the amplifier 
and the radio. This morning I am grateful that I have the assistance 
of this device in speaking to you in this great building. 

Yesterday we had as visitors men from afar, one of whom addressed 
us, calling attention to our particular position in the world of Scouting. 
His remarks reminded me of an experience I had recently, at least it is 
not many months ago, while in San Francisco attending a regional 
meeting of the Scout organization. We had spent the day in session. 
At the close of the meeting, when it was ready to adjourn, I asked 
the chairman for permission to say a few words on the Latter-day 
Saint plan of taking care of boys. My request was cheerfully granted. 
I asked those who were present, first, if they would pay attention to 
what I had to say, with the thought that they might add to our program, 
and give us the benefit of their thinking, because they were all experts 
in taking care of boys. 

THE MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN 

I said first of all, we have a fathers' and sons' outing manual. 1 
had it in my hand. This is an invitation to the fathers and sons of our 
country. We have in our Church ninety r nine ecclesiastical divisions 
known as stakes, and this program is suggested for fathers and sons, 
with the thought that if they can go out together into the open spaces 
and camp in the mountains or plains of God's great out-of-doors, and 
become better acquainted, both fathers and sons will be greatly benefited 
thereby. I went through the program, of course, in a little more 
detail than I shall do here today. I said: We have a Junior Manual. 
This is intended to inspire in the boys faith in God. There is a lesson 
for each week during the Mutual Improvement season, and we feel it 
is a fine program. I called attention to some of the features of the 
plan, some of the experiences of our missionaries and early Scouts, and 
the feeling that it would engender in the heart of the boy in appreciation 
of the heroism of these individuals. 

I said: We have an advanced Junior group in the Mutual. For 
this group we have a manual prepared to call attention to the fact that 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 45 



courage is an important thing, not only courage in the face of ordinary 
danger, but courage to do right when evil is present. We feel that at 
this age our boys should be stimulated with the courage to do right. 
Scouting is an important part of the program of these Junior groups. 

Our next age is our senior group, and we have a manual prepared 
for them. While men are quarreling about the differences between 
science and religion, we prepare a manual and put it into the hands of 
our advanced adolescent youth, calling attention to the fact that there 
is no conflict between true science and true religion ; that the truth, 
no matter from what source we derive it, all originates with our 
Heavenly Father. We place a manual in their hands that calls attention 
to the fact that instead of trying to find a conflict between science and 
religion we do well to understand them both, to the end that we will be 
able to harmonize them. 

While I was talking I noticed several individuals in the house nod- 
ding to one another, calling attention to the fact that that was a good 
thought. 

Now, I said, we have an advanced Senior group. For this group 
we have taken for this year's study short biographies of men who have 
been prominent champions of liberty throughout the world, such as 
Moses, Confucius, Gotama the great Buddha, Justinian and other phil- 
osophers and religious leaders. Then we call attention to the fact that 
in this group were Oliver Cromwell, George Washington, Joseph Smith, 
Abraham Lincoln, Brigham Young, Benito Juarez, etc. In the life of 
each of these men we have found that which we feel ought to inspire 
men and women with a desire to do better things. In addition, we 
have our Mutual Improvement Era, that is published monthly, contain- 
ing articles that are intended to inspire in the growing young men a 
feeling of reverence for God, and a desire to know of his purposes. 

At the conclusion of my talk to them I said : Now, gentlemen, 
I have told you what we are trying to do for our boys in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I shall appreciate it if you will 
now give me your reaction and any suggestions for improving our 
plan. 

One of the leaders of the group, without hesitation, said: "Mr. 
Smith, we are at your feet." Another man spoke up and said : "There 
is no other program like that, for boys, in the world." The Superin- 
tendent of Schools of San Jose. California, said to me: "There is no 
church in all the world doing for its young people what you are doing," 
and he said, "It is remarkable to me that we, in San Jose, work our 
heads off to put over the Boy Scout program with the thought that we 
are doing the most wonderful thing in the world for boys, and you 
come here and tell us that that is only a little part of your program, that 
Scouting is a part of your Junior work." And he said: "I want to 
compliment you." There were quite a number of those present who 
gave me their cards and asked if we would supply them with our 
manuals for this year. 

I mention this because only yesterday you heard from one of the 
chief Scout men of the United States, the statement that we lead in 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Scouting, that Utah and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints are in the forefront in the world of Scouting. In the case of 
the people I have mentioned, their lives are set on that one department. 

OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE CHURCH 

When this man from San Jose said: "We find that this is only 
a little part of what you are doing for boys," I did not enlarge upon the 
program by saying, this is only one of the departments of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We start with our Primary 
children, and they are surrounded by the love and tenderness of the best 
women in the world. Our children are taught to pray ; in the organiza- 
tions with which they are identified they are taught faith ; they are led 
along the pathway of constructive thought. They are carried on in that 
department until they are twelve or fourteen years of age. I did not tell 
of our Sunday Schools — no other Sunday Schools in all the world com- 
pare with ours. We take our boys and our girls in their tender years 
and lay a foundation for an understanding of the Bible, the Book 
of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and 
the history of the Church ; so that when they are old enough to come 
in contact with individuals in the world they have a fund of information 
by which they are not only able to defend their faith, but are qualified 
to advocate their faith in such a way that others may be inspired and 
interested in it. Then we have the Mutual Improvement organizations, 
that have developed both boys and girls to become orators, musicians, 
writers and thinkers. We have our Relief Society, the great national 
organization, than which there is nothing in all the world better, an 
organization that contributes, not only to the intellectual and spiritual 
welfare of its members, but also to the desires in their hearts to reach 
out and benefit and bless those who are in need, as the name implies. 
I did not tell these men that when our boys are young they are taught 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, and ordained to the Priesthood ; that as 
Deacons, as Teachers and as Priests, they are taught, while in youth ; 
that as Elders they become members of the Melchizedek Priesthood, 
and may be ordained Seventies, and High Priests, going upward through 
the various ages of their lives. I did not call attention to the fact that 
we have our ward meetings where, once a week, we are brought to- 
gether and where we may partake of the Sacrament. I did not call their 
attention to the fact that we have our quarterly conferences which 
afford the opportunity for the people to come together in the various 
larger districts, under the influence of our Heavenly Father. I did 
not tell them of the great annual and semi-annual conferences that are 
held in the Church, attracting people from all parts of the world, afford- 
ing opportunity for the reuniting of families, the bringing together of 
friends and renewing acquaintanceships — all these things, a regular 
part of the program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH 

I haven't touched all the things that are in my mind, but I have 
mentioned enough to call your attention to what I would like to have 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



47 



you remember, that when our Heavenly Father established his Church 
upon the earth, he established it on such a broad plane that there is 
afforded in this organization, by means of its priesthood and its aux- 
iliary organizations, an opportunity for the development of every living 
soul, under the influence of his Holy Spirit. He organized his Church 
on so broad a scale that all are invited to search the scriptures and 
understand them for themselves. On such a scale we are invited to go 
into the great schools and universities of learning of the world, seeking 
for the things that the world has been able to uncover and explain; 
and these all, as far as they are true, to become a part of our thinking, 
to be made a part of our lives. When we analyze these things and 
realize what God has done for us, we would be an ungrateful people 
if in the depths of our souls we did not worship him day by day, with 
thanksgiving in our hearts for the mercies that are extended unto us. 
No other people in all the world are so. cared for and cultured, no 
other people in all the world are so tenderly taught and so carefully 
advised and counseled as are the Latter-day Saints. And if we will only 
take advantage of our opportunities and avail ourselves of our privileges, 
this Church will continue to grow and spread, there will be less oppor- 
tunity for evil to come into our communities ; we will continue to be 
a tower of strength for righteousness, as I believe we now are among 
the people of the world, not only in keeping the ethical ideals of this 
world before the people, but also in instilling in mankind a living faith 
in our Heavenly Father, which is at the foundation of all real progress 
and all that is really worth while. 

A NEW PLAN 

I am grateful for my standing in this Church. I am thankful to 
be associated with my brethren and sisters in a department of service. 
And now today, inasmuch as there is a new plan in operation, affecting 
the Priesthood and the Mutual Improvement Associations, following 
upon that of the Church Sunday School, let us all desire to carry for- 
ward this mighty work of our Heavenly Father, put our shoulders to the 
wheel and cause this department to function for the benefit and blessing 
of the youth of Zion, and for the uplift of every man, woman and child, 
to the end that each may in due time be found worthy of a place in our 
Father's celestial kingdom. That we who have part in this glorious 
work may rejoice in it, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

We have had a very excellent conference thus far. To me the 
meetings have been extremely profitable, and I have rejoiced greatly in 
the spirit of the conference. 

I am reading now the Twelfth Article of Faith of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 

ALL ARE SUBJECT TO LAW 

"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in 
obeying, honoring and sustaining the law." 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



My brethren and sisters, this is not a mere platitude ; it is not a 
formality, but it is an article of faith of the Church, of Christ. Let 
me call your attention to the fact that all people in all nations are 
under a reign of law. We cannot escape this conclusion, we cannot 
evade the fact, being upon the earth as we are, mingling one with 
another, we are subject to law. The Lord has said in one of the 
revelations to his Church, through the Prophet Joseph Smith (See 
Doctrine and Covenants, Section 58) : 

"Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of 
God hath no heed to break the laws of the land." 

That is direct and emphatic, and leads one to the obvious con- 
clusion that the laws of God are higher and superior to the laws of 
the land. 

We read in the scriptures that when the wicked rule the people 
mourn, and conversely it might be said that when the righteous rule 
the people rejoice. They rejoice because the righteous make righteous 
laws, and they mourn because the wicked make wicked laws. We are 
living, my brethren and sisters, under one of the best and most sub- 
stantial governments in the world today, if not the best. It simply 
results from having the best and most liberal laws of government. 

T call your attention to this important truth, that people who 
live in far distant hamlets are under law ; that people who live in the 
cities of the land are subject to law, and it follows if a citizen desires 
to enjoy the privileges that belong to the city in which he resides, he 
must yield obedience to the laws of that city, and give heed to its 
ordinances. If a man wishes to enjoy the advantages and privileges 
of citizenship in this great nation of ours, he must subject himself to 
the laws of the nation. You know quite as well as I do what is said of 
a man who disregards law, who goes beyond and away from it, who 
appears to think that that is his privilege. Well, the Lord has some- 
thing to say about that, for he spoke by revelation to Joseph Smith 
the Prophet and said: 

"And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also 
preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same. 

"That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a 
law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, canwit 
be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they 
must remain filthy still." 

So a man who ignores the law. who sets his face as flint against it, 
is called an outlaw, and if he sets himself against the Government in 
which he resides and of which he is a part, and violates the law and 
uses his influence against the Government, that is designated 
treason. He is treasonable, he is subject to the action of this very 
law which he violates. 

LAWS OF GOD AND LAWS OF MAN 

Now there are two great law-givers, the one is the Lord in heaven. 
He is the supreme law-giver of the universe. The other is man upon 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



49 



the earth. The laws of God are great spiritual and eternal laws, and 
are given to govern us in our conduct and to protect us in our future 
prospects. The laws of the land are of temporary character and 
appertain to mortal life. However, if the laws of the land are good 
laws, they have the approval of the Almighty. The greatest and most 
spectacular revealment of law, if I may use that expression, ever made, 
was given at Mount Sinai when the Lord descended upon the moun- 
tain, and in the midst of thundering and lightning and a great smoke 
going up, he gave the Ten Commandments. It might truly he said 
that all the righteous laws of man have their origin in the Ten Com- 
mandments. 

THE PURPOSE OF THE CONSTITUTION 

The Lord had a great purpose in view in establishing the Consti- 
tution of this land, and doubtless entertained very great respect for 
our pilgrim fathers, and the early fathers of this great nation, because 
he has referred to them in a revelation given to his servant Joseph 
Smith. (See Sec. 101, Doc. and Cov.) Speaking of the Constitution 
the Lord said: 

"According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffererl 
to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all 
flesh, according to just and holy principles; 

"That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity. , 
according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man 
may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. 

"Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. 

"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by 
the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed 
the land by the shedding of blood." 

OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CONSTITUTION 

Is it to be wondered at, brethren and sisters, that the Latter-day 
Saints as a people have profound respect for the Constitution of the 
United States? We believe that the Constitution was inspired of the 
Lord. If other people draw away or lose their interest, or their faith 
in the Constitution and the flag of our country, the Latter-day Saints 
will be expected to rally around it. We propose to maintain the 
Constitution and all that it stands for. Our children are taught to 
respect the flag and to honor the law-givers of the nation. In Scout 
law, our boys are taught to be obedient and to honor the law, to be 
honest, to be truthful, to be upright. They do not always have a 
good example set before them by men of influence and men of power 
in the nation, men who have rightly earned the designation of "boot- 
leggers." We hope that the Scouts who are growing up will be safe- 
guarded against the pernicious example of these men. 

PROHIBITION LAW SHOULD BE OBSERVED 

The law pertaining to prohibition is an expression of the wishes 
of the majority of the people of the United States of America. It 
has become a sacred law of the land, and should be so regarded, at 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



least until it is repealed. So I might add that the voices of the Latter- 
day Saints are raised against those who violate this law. 

ALL KINGDOMS GOVERNED BY LAW 

I call your attention to the fact, and to me it is very interesting, 
that the Lord is the author of many great and glorious laws. We are 
told in one revelation from on high that all kingdoms have a law 
given unto them. 

"There are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no 
kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater 
or a lesser kingdom. 

"And unto every kingdom is given a law ; and unto every law there are 
certain bounds also and conditions. 

"All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified. * * * 

"And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by 
which they move in their times and their seasons ; 

"And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, 
which comprehend the earth and all the planets. 

"And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons, in 
their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in 
their years — all these are one year with God, but not with man." 

The foregoing quotation will be found in Section 88, Doc. and Cov. 

BLESSINGS PREDICATED UPON OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

Upon another occasion the Lord said to his prophet : 

"For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if 
ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this 
covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory. 

"For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the la*v which 
was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted 
from before the foundation of the world. 

"And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for 
the fulness of my glory ; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall 
abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God. (Doc. and Cov. 132, 
verses 4, 5, 6.) 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of 
this world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God. it is by obedience to that 
law upon which it is predicated.'' (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 130, verses 20, 21.) 

Now we learn from this that every blessing bestowed upon men 
is predicated upon law. I take it there is no exception to this rule. 
Blessings do not come in a haphazard way, they do not come by chance, 
but they come by obedience to law. And if you want a blessing you 
must obey the law upon which that particular blessing is predicated. 
The blessing of salvation is predicated upon obedience to the New and 
Everlasting Covenant, and condemnation is predicated upon its re- 
jection. 

THE NEW AND EVERLASTING COVENANT 

Now, what is this New and Everlasting Covenant spoken of? 
We understand it to be the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the law of the 
gospel. If you desire salvation, then you must obey the law of the 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



51 



gospel. It cannot be had in any other way. Wle can't run and jump 
into heaven, or drop down into it from above, or climb up into it from 
below. If you get into heaven, if you would secure the blessings, joys 
and privileges of heaven, you must obey the law that governs in 
heaven. That is good logic and good reasoning, and is according 
to revelation. 

BLESSINGS DERIVED FROM PAYMENT OF TITHES 

Let us make an application or two : For instance, there is the 
law of tithing. It is a law of God. If you would receive the bless- 
ing that goes with paying tithing, then you must obey the law of 
tithing. Somebody might ask : "Well, what is the blessing that goes 
with the paying of tithing?" The answer is this: A great and im- 
portant blessing. We are told in the revelation on tithing — Doc. and Cov., 
Sec. 119 — that to them who observe to keep this law the land will be 
sanctified and will become a land of Zion; it will not be a land of 
Zion to them who reject the law of tithing. 

BLESSINGS OBTAINED THROUGH OBEYING THE WORD OF WISDOM 

What blessing, if any, comes through obedience to the Word 
of Wisdom? Is it worth while to render obedience to this special 
Word from the Lord? Certainly it is worth while. The Word of 
Wisdom is often referred to in our Church as the law of health. I 
am sure if the Latter-day Saints would follow it strictly and carefully, 
they would enjoy the blessing of health to a very great extent. Of 
course we naturally inherit the weaknesses and imperfections of the 
flesh, that is true, but generally speaking, good health and the preser- 
vation of our bodies would result in the main from an observance 
of the Word of Wisdom. 

Still another great blessing comes from observance of the Word 
of Wisdom, for the Lord said to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, that 
"all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and 
marrow to their bones ; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of 
knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and 
shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, 
that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, 
and not slay them." 

DISTINCTION BETWEEN DESTROYING ANGEL AND ANGEL OF DEATH 

Some people might say, well, so far as that is concerned, the 
destroying angel slays everybody sooner or later. The answer is : 
Not so. 

There is a distinction between the angel, or messenger, of death 
and the destroying angel. When a righteous man dies the angel who 
comes to take charge of his spirit is not a destroying angel, but rather 
an angel of mercy, of peace and love, a messenger from the Father. 

The death of a wicked and disobedient man is bitter, and he has 
no promise that the destroying angel will pass by him and not slay him. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I rejoice in the fact that all men are subject to law, both civil 
and heavenly law — the law of the Gospel and the law of the land. 
We admonish Latter-day Saints to cultivate respect for law. 

I know that the Gospel is true, that Christ is and was the Savior of 
the world, that Joseph Smith the prophet, was a glorious character and 
a mighty minister of truth. I testify of these things in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I wish to take as the subject for my sermon the first and last 
articles of our faith, written by Joseph Smith. 

"We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in 
the Holy Ghost. 

"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing 
good to ALL MEN ; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul — 
We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope 
to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good 
report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." 

The first and last articles of faith of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints embody principles, large in their concept of 
life. These two statements of religion deal with the most important 
problems of the soul, and they solve in a general way how man may 
enter into a divine world. Perhaps the majority of mankind is not 
yet ready for such a presentation of religion ; but it is through 
some such conception as the thought of these two statements that 
mankind will grasp the meaning of life and its ultimate end. The 
same trend of thought that we have today — the religious and the 
scientific — was developed in ancient times when Hebraism and 
Hellenism flourished. This brought forth much of the thought 
expressed by the Prophet Zechariah, when he wrote "Thy Sons, O 
Zion, against thy Sons, O Greece." The one thought was the 
selfless life, and its eternal belief in God ; the other was the life 
of nature ; the pursuit of knowledge, the establishment of great 
truths by philosophers and men of science. 

Such men who believe in the one true and living God, the 
eternal father of us all, like Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Zechariah, estab- 
lished through their writings the fundamental truths of religion 
and life. They gave to the world religion, which took the culture 
of Greece and afterwards the power of Rome, and elevated and 
inspired them. The Hellenistic movement was that of Aristotle 
and Plato, and through these men there came into the world a 
struggle fiercer than the struggle of arms ; for it was a struggle 
of ideas, but the words of the prophets had a keener significance 
for all time to come than had any other thought. "The Sons of 
Zion were against the Sons of Greece." Israel and Greece stood 
for the two great forces that have moulded our Western history, 
and still dominate modern life. Paul, the Apostle before the age 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



53 



of historical criticism, made the distinction so emphasized in our 
day, between the Hebrew spirit and the Gentile, particularly the 
Greek, when he said that the Gentiles followed not after righteous- 
ness ; but that Israel did follow after the law of righteousness. 
Beautiful are his words found in the ninth chapter of Romans. 
History fully bears out Paul's contrast between the Jew and the 
Greek ; the religious mind and the scientific mind. The Jews under- 
stood that God required righteousness as indispensable for life. 
The law flashed out solemn warning to the world. The sense 
of sin, the need of redemption, the lawlessness of human nature, 
when it is not under subjection to the law of God ; and these prin- 
ciples were all postulates of the Bible. Hebraism stood out for 
the moral and religious principle, Hellenism for the culture of the 
human ; the sensitive love for the beautiful, and the joy of living. 

Down through the ages, faith in one God was needed before 
consistency in the moral life of man was possible. The world is 
indebted to the Jews for the moral law, not merely the Ten Com- 
mandments, but the idea of law in general. The result of this 
moral advance was an infinite intellectual advance, and it brought 
reason and order into the world. 

The idea of the uniformity of nature, which is the first prin- 
ciple of science, was impossible until the Jewish mind swept away 
Polytheism, and through the concept of law, saw the world con- 
sistent, with unbroken continuity. In this way, the Herbraism 
of the Jew and the Hellenism of the Greek came together." 

So today we have the struggle of ideas. There appear two 
opposing methods of thought and development, which we meet in 
our schools and universities. They reflect at times a conflict in 
human nature. With the thought of the first and the last articles 
of our faith, certainly we make a contribution to religious thought 
in our day. We see the simple acceptance of both sides, looking 
with clear eyes on the whole situation. We accept the Hellenistic 
or scientific truths as given by the master men of science and 
philosophy. It is the gospel of the love for the beautiful and the 
joy of living; that man may search out truth by study and thought- 
ful work in the world. Then on the other hand, these two articles 
implicitly say that all discord in life is changed into harmony by 
reconciling man to God. The deepest thought of Christ's teaching 
and life is simple confidence in God, as seen in the world and in 
human life. This consciousness of the divine takes precedence over 
all else, and becomes the great inspiring motive, driving the life 
to noble ends, and assuring the spirit of man of the highest realities 
of life. This is one of the contributions of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ our Lord, as we Latter-day Saints understand it. The 
problems of life are solved not by denying one side or the other, 
but by carrying both sides to a high point. As of old, so today, 
Christianity reconciles religion and science by a form of knowl- 
edge and ethics, that is made accessible to all classes, kindreds, 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tongues, and peoples. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a scheme 
of culture or a system of philosophy; but a Religion, fulfilling the 
law and the prophets, enforcing the obligations of duty, and 
pointing to the glory of the Cross. It brings man into a new- 
relationship to God. Its end is not the curtailment of thought and 
life, but its enlargement, so there is room for the development of 
every gift of heart, mind, and soul. As was indicated by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in the last article of faith, the narrow lot of 
man is broadened whenever he comes into filial relation to God. 
This enlargement of life through faith is a fact of experience. Faith 
in God enlarges the horizon of life, and leads to the acceptance 
of all truth. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are opened 
to the believing mind ; "for they are all broken lights of God, in 
whose light alone, we see light." How forcibly wrote Paul of old : 

"The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world 
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." 

So we, Latter-day Saints, say to the world: "Believe in God 
the eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy 
Ghost," for it is Christ who gives us power to become, and opens 
up new possibilities of thought, feeling, and action. He asks for 
obedience, and when we obey, we discover the law of our own life ; 
He asks for service, and when we serve, we discover perfect freedom. 
The love of God in Christ unifies life for us; we gain love, and 
as our love increases, our faith deepens. 

The message of Jesus then, as it is now, was : "Repent." 
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord." His coming in that first day 
was a revolution in religious thought. He taught that the soul of 
man deals directly with his God. Man must be perfect even as our 
Father in heaven is perfect. His life changed the history of man- 
kind more deeply, more widely, and more permanently than any 
other from the beginning of the world to the present. It was he, 
Christ Jesus our Lord, who bestowed upon us the increasing con- 
sciousness of the immortality of spiritual values. 

So has the message of our Lord been revealed today. 

Jesus Christ and him crucified for the sins of the world; the larger 
faith that assures us immortality, are what the world needs this Easter 
day. He is risen. He is our Savior and our King. He lives and we are 
in the image of the true and living God, who made the world and all 
things therein. And when the sons of Greece are for and not against 
the sons of Zion; when all ideals of culture shall find their inspiration 
and nourishment in the divine ideals of Jesus, the Redeemer, then will 
the world march on to perfection. 

When thought, and art, and literature, and science, and knowledge 
and life are brought into subjection to the obedience of Christ, then 
shall we have the true victory of life, and we will be able to say : "Thou 
hast conquered, O Galilean." 

Both trends of thought are coming together in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. George Santayana, America's greatest philosopher writes today : 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG

"O world, thou choosest not the better part. 
It is not wisdom to be only wise, 
And on the inward vision, close the eyes, 
But it is wisdom to believe the heart. 
Columbus found a world, and had no chart 
Save one that faith deciphered in the skies 
To trust the soul's invincible surmise 
Was all his science and his only art. 
Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine 
That lights the pathway but one step ahead 
Across a void of mystery and dread. 
Bid then, the tender light of faith to shine 
By which alone the mortal heart is led 
Unto the thinking of the thought divine." 

And so by thy divine faith, says Santayana, shall you find out 
the true knowledge. 

In our belief as Latter-day Saints, Zion and Greece are brought 
together today in the Doctrine and Covenants one of our sacred books. 

The Doctrine and Covenants contains the revelations of God the 
Father to Joseph Smith and other prophets of God in this dispensation. 
It tells about the restoration of the plan of God in the salvation of the 
human race. It is largely ethical in its message, and, like the Book of 
Mormon, makes public and private righteousness matters of practice. 
The book opens by telling of a mighty work that is about to be ushered 
into the world. This is the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
with the giving to man of the holy priesthood of God, the Aaronic and 
Melchizedek, as it existed in the days of the prophets of Israel and at the 
time of Christ. The outstanding truth of the book is that God is identi- 
fied as the Father of the race, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is restored 
in this day with all its gifts and blessings. It puts the principle of right- 
eousness through obedience to the plan of salvation into the foreground; 
and all its teachings grow out of the principle that for man to attain 
the highest development he must place his faith in God the Eternal 
Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost, and receive 
by divine authority the priesthood of God. It also emphasizes the im- 
portance of man's spiritual life, and his great mission on earth; as well 
as the glory of immortality and the power of eternal progression in the 
hereafter. Men are coming to know beauty and truth. Zion and Greece 
are brought together. These two articles of faith, the first and the last, 
written by the Prophet Joseph Smith, embody this great thought, and 
that is a distinct contribution to the truth and to the religion of the world. 

That the Lord may help us to see these things and appreciate the 
beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the majesty and the grandeur of 
the principles of eternal truth that have been revealed in this day, I ask, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "High on the mountain top."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

No servant of the Lord should ever arise before a congregation 
and say, I have nothing upon my mind. A people who have been com- 
manded of God to "seek for wisdom out of the best of books" — to 
"seek learning by study and also by faith," ought to have something 
upon their minds. I have something upon my mind, but I need the 
Spirit of the Lord to enable me to bring it forth, in such a way as to feed 
your souls with the bread of life and build you up in the faith of the 
everlasting gospel. That Spirit I now invoke. 

THE CONFERENCE KEYNOTE 

The keynote of this conference, if I heard it aright, was struck 
by the president of the Church in his opening address yesterday morn- 
ing, when he referred to the great and marvelous work in which the 
Latter-day Saints are taking part. I wish to elaborate that theme. 

A PROPHECY AND ITS FULFILMENT 

It was about seven hundred years before the birth of the Savior, 
when a prophet of God upon the Eastern hemisphere predicted the 
coming forth of "a marvelous work and a wonder." The reason as- 
signed for its coming was given in the language of the Lord, as follows : 

"Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their 
lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, * * * 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a 'marvelous work among this people, 
even a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall 
perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." — Isa. 29:13, 14. 

If you wish to know when and where this prophecy began to be 
fulfilled, follow me down the ages to the spring of the year 1820, and 
into the rural districts of New York State, where then dwelt a humble 
family by the name of Smith. One member of that family was a boy 
between fourteen and fifteen years of age. Anxious for his soul's 
salvation, young Joseph Smith went into the woods near his father's 
home, and inquired of the Lord which of all the churches then extant was 
the true Church of Christ, in order that he might join it. While praying 
he was seized upon by an evil power, which strove to destroy him ; but 
he was delivered by a vision of light, in the midst of which stood two 
glorious personages, one of whom, pointing to the other, said : "This 
is my beloved Son — hear him." 

In answer to his inquiry as to the churches, the boy was told, to 
his astonishment, that none of them was the true Church of Christ, and 
that he must not connect himself with any of them ; but await the 
coming of the true Church, in the founding of which he was destined to 
play an important part. Said the Son of God, in relation to the churches 
then existing : "They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts 
are far from me;" — thus linking together the ancient prophecy per- 
taining to the "marvelous work and wonder" and the work inaugurated 
by Joseph Smith in this the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.

MARVELS AND WONDERS 

And what a wonderful work it is ! What could be more so? At a 
time when all over the Christian world — to say nothing of the heathen 
world — it was popularly supposed that the heavens were sealed, and 
the canon of Scripture full ; that visions and revelations had ceased, and 
that angels no longer communicated with men — at that very time the 
heavens burst, and not only angels, but God himself comes down, and 
proclaims to a little fourteen-year-old boy the opening of a new gospel 
dispensation! Could anything be more marvelous? 

Three years pass, and an angel appears to Joseph, giving his name 
as Moroni, and stating that in mortal life he was a prophet to an 
ancient people called Nephites, the civilized ancestors of the present-day 
American Indians. Among other things the youth was told that a 
record engraved upon gold plates, compiled by Moroni's father, another 
prophet named Mormon, would be found in a neighboring hill, where 
Moroni had concealed it centuries before. This record contained the 
fulness of the everlasting gospel, as delivered to the Nephites by the 
Savior, who claimed them as his "other sheep" — a branch of the House 
of Israel. (John 10:16; 3 Nephi 15:21.) That book, translated by 
Joseph Smith, reveals the wonderful past and the yet more wonderful 
future of America, the Land of Zion, otherwise known as the Land of 
Joseph, referred to by the Patriarch Jacob when blessing his twelve 
sons (Gen. 49:22-26), and by the Prophet Moses, in giving his fare- 
well benediction to the tribes of Israel (Deut. 33:13-17.) America 
is shown to be the place of the New Jerusalem, a holy city to be 
built by a gathering of scattered Israel, prior to the glorious coming 
of the Lord. 

Next came John the Baptist, another angel',' who conferred upon 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, authoriz- 
ing them to preach the gospel in its restored purity, and to baptize by 
immersion for the remission of sins. And this was followed by a visita- 
tion from three other heavenly messengers — namely, Peter, James and 
John, who ordained them to the Melchizedek Priesthood, thus em- 
powering them to bestow upon their baptized converts the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. By virtue of these ordinations, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, April 6, 1830, at Fayette, 
Seneca county, New York. And thus was fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy 
of the lifting up of the Ensign for the gathering of scattered Israel ( Tsa. 
11 :1 1-16.) This movement was authorized by Moses, who as an angel 
delivered to Joseph and Oliver the keys of the Gathering; that the 
dispersed of Judah and the outcasts of Israel — including the Lost Tribes 
in "the land of the North" — might assemble in fulfilment of prophecy 
— the Jews to Palestine, to rebuild the old Jerusalem ; the other tribes to 
America, where the new Jerusalem is to rise. 

Elias also appeared and committed to Joseph and Oliver "the dis- 
pensation of the gospel of Abraham." These men were descendants of 
the great Hebrew patriarch, and were to begin a work having as its 
object the eternal welfare of Abraham's posterity. Then Elijah came, 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the 
fathers," that the dead as well as the living might share in the blessings 
of the Final Dispensation, wherein, pursuantly to divine purpose, all 
things that are Christ's, both in heaven and on earth, will be brought 
together in one. 

In preaching the gospel to the world and gathering Israel 
from the nations, the Latter-day Saints — children of Ephraim — 
are helping to fulfil the covenant made by Jehovah with Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob : "In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the 
earth be blessed." So runs the ancient promise — fulfilled by Jehovah 
himself in coming through the lineage of those patriarchs as the Savior 
of the world ; and further fulfilled by the dispersion of Israel among 
the nations, blessed by this racial admixture and by the gathering that 
has begun. 

These are some of the marvels connected with the mighty work 
in which we are taking part — the wonderful work of Almighty God, in 
this the last and greatest of the gospel dispensations. What can com- 
pare with it? Is there anything half so wonderful? 

ALMOST AS WONDERFUL 

Yes, there is something almost as wonderful — and that is, that the 
wise men of this world do not see in it anything worthy of their special 
care or attention. "Mormonism," to its devotees, is the most glorious 
thing in existence — the sublimest poem that was ever written, the pro- 
foundest system of philosophy that the world has ever known. But the 
"wise" and "prudent" pass it by as a thing of naught, or stand at a 
distance, sneering at it and pelting it with unsavory epithets. Why is it ? 

LINCOLN AND GREELEY 

Why couldn't Abraham Lincoln, that good and great man, see in 
"Mormonism" what we see in it, and what it really is — the Everlasting 
Gospel? He and Joseph Smith lived almost within a stone's throw of 
each other in Illinois. Why did not the future president recognize in 
the prophet of God what the Latter-day Saints recognize in him — the 
most remarkable human being that has walked this earth in two thou- 
sand years? Why couldn't Lincoln see it? The great emancipator 
was no enemy to the "Mormon" people. When asked, after his elec- 
tion as president, how he intended to treat the "Mormon" question — 
which was bothering the politicians as well as the priests — he answered 
in his quaint, characteristic way: "I intend to treat it as a farmer on 
the frontier would treat an old water-soaked elm log lying upon his 
land — too heavy to move, too knotty to split, and too wet to burn. I'm 
going to plow round it." And he did. 

Horace Greeley, another great character, the founder and editor 
of the New York Tribune, a man whose utterances were more potent 
in his day than those of the president of the United States — he came 
out to Utah in early times when the fastest means of travel between 
the Missouri river and the Pacific Coast, was the ox-team, the pack- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



59 



mule, or Ben Holliday's stage line. Greeley came by stage, and on his 
way to California, tarried certain days in Salt Lake City. He had 
repeated interviews with President Brigham Young, and in a book 
afterwards written and published he paid high compliment to the pio- 
neers and early settlers of these mountain solitudes. He didn't believe 
the "Mormons" were robbers and murderers, as he had been told, and 
he spoke of them as honest and industrious people. But that was all. 
Brigham Young's views on marriage and slavery interested the great 
editor, but the "Mormon" religion in its sublimest phases was a sealed 
book to him. Why? 

OUTSIDE AND INSIDE AUXILIARIES 

Well, doubtless there were good reasons for it; and I will venture 
to advance one. Perhaps the Lord needs such men on the outside of his 
Church, to help it along. They are among its auxiliaries, and can do 
more good for the cause where the Lord has placed them, than any- 
where else. And the same is true of the priesthood and its auxiliaries 
inside the Church. Hence, some are drawn into the fold and receive 
a testimony of the Truth ; while others remain unconverted — for the 
present ; the beauties and glories of the gospel being veiled temporarily 
from their view, for a wise purpose. The Lord will open their eyes 
in his own due time. 

ISRAEL AND THE GENTILES 

God is using more than one people for the accomplishment of his 
great and marvelous work. The Latter-day Saints cannot do it all. 
It is too vast, too arduous, for any one people. Our part in it is the 
greatest. We have the gospel and the priesthood, with a mission to 
gather Israel, build the New Jerusalem, and prepare the way for the 
advent of the King of kings. And this duty has been laid upon us 
because we belong to the house of Israel. It is the God of Israel who 
is coming to reign and we are the right people to prepare the way 
before him. 

But we don't own the steamships and the railroads and other means 
of rapid transit and communication, whereby the Lord's people are 
being gathered out from the nations — flying "upon the shoulders of the 
Philistines," as Isaiah predicted. The risen Savior, when he appeared 
to the Nephites and spoke of the glorious future, said that the Gentiles 
would assist his people in gathering to their promised lands. And are 
they not doing this? Is it not the ships and railroads of the Gentiles — ■ 
"the shoulders of the Philistines" — that are bringing the children of 
Ephraim to this Land of Joseph, and carrying the children of Judah 
to their ancient homeland — dedicated for their return by direction of 
the Prophet of Ephraim — Joseph Smith? 

We have no quarrel with the Gentiles. They are our partners in 
a certain sense. The name Gentile is not with us a term of reproach. 
It comes from Gentilis, meaning, of a nation, a family or a people not 
of Israel — that is all. "Mormon" is a nickname for Latter-day Saint, 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but "Gentile" is not a nickname. It simply means, with us, one who 
does not belong to the Church. We need the Gentiles, and they need 
us, but they don't know it, and we do. They are wiser than we are 
in material things — the things of Earth and Time. But when it comes 
to spiritual things — the things of Heaven and Eternity, we can teach 
them. We need their wealth and worldly wisdom, their wonderful 
skill in managing and manipulating temporalities. And they need the 
Gospel and the Priesthood. They need us, for we hold in our hands 
the Key to their eternal salvation. 

Again I say, the Lord's Work has need of auxiliaries outside 
as well as inside, to help it along. Because of their worldly influence 
— which would depart if they connected themselves with the Church — ■ 
many are kept where they are, where the Lord has placed them, and 
can best use them for the good of all. 

THE WISE AND PRUDENT 

Many years ago I had an interesting conversation with a man 
who was a member of the Roman Catholic church. He was a great 
scholar ; he must have had a dozen languages at his tongue's end, 
and seemed to know all about history, science, law, philosophy, and 
all the rest of it. We were frank and friendly with each other, and 
one day he said to me: 

"You 'Mormons' are all ignoramuses. You don't even know the 
strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one 
other position tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the 
position of the Roman Catholic church. The issue is between 'Mor- 
monism' and Catholicism. If you are right, we are wrong. If we 
are right, you are wrong, and that's all there is to it. These Protestant 
sects haven't a leg to stand on; for if we are right, we cut them, off 
long ago, as apostates ; and if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, 
for they were a part of us and came out of us. If we have the 
apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there was no need 
of Joseph Smith and 'Mormonism ;' but if we have not that apostolic 
succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and 'Mor- 
monism's position is the only consistent one. It is either the per- 
petuation of the Gospel from ancient times or the restoration of the 
Gospel in latter days." 

"Doctor," said I, "that is a very clear and concise statement, and 
I agree with it in almost every particular. But don't deceive yourself 
with the notion that we 'Mormons' don't know the strength of our 
own position. We know it better than you do. We know it better 
than any other people can know it. We haven't all been to college, we 
can't all speak the dead languages, and we may be ignoramuses as 
you say; but we know we are right, and we know you are wrong." 
I was just as frank with him as he had been with me. 

Now what was this great scholar's viewpoint ? With all his learn- 
ing, he could not see into the heart of "Mormonism." He recognized 
the strength of its position; but he supposed that to be an accident. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



61 



He thought Joseph Smith had stumbled upon something of which 
he did not know the true value. He was wise in worldly wisdom; 
but his wisdom perished in the presence of this mighty and marvelous 
problem. 

Another instance and I am done. A learned gentleman named Riley 
applied for a doctor's degree at Yale University, and as the basis of 
his application, he wrote a thesis entitled "Joseph Smith, the Founder of 
Mormonism." And what did he bring forth? Simply this: That 
Joseph Smith was an epileptic, who fell in a fit and imagined that he 
saw the Father and the Son ; imagined that Moroni revealed to him the 
Hook of Mormon; that John the Baptist conferred upon him the 
Aaronic Priesthood, and Peter, James and John the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood ; that Moses restored the keys of the gathering, and that Elias and 
Elijah also appeared to him. All imagination, said Mr. Riley. 

But this wise man overlooked one important fact : A tree is known 
by its fruit; a fountain, by the stream that issues from it. The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as a system of government, 
challenges the admiration of intelligent men all over the world. It is 
conceded to be a wonderful organization. And the doctrines of "Mor- 
monism" are replete with poetry and philosophy — are beautiful, 
glorious and sublime. Joseph Smith declared that these things were re- 
vealed to him — that they came right down from God out of heaven ; 
but Mr. Riley would have us believe that they all sprang from the 
diseased brain of a fourteen-year-old boy who had fallen in an epileptic 
fit! 

There are some things that do not need answering, and this one 
of them. Well was it said in days of old, with reference to the days in 
which we live : "The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the 
understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." 

ONLY ONE WAY 

There is but one way to understand "Mormonism" — and that is 
God's way, not man's. Books and schools cannot give a testimony of 
the Truth. Those who sneer at the Everlasting Gospel, and pelt it 
with nicknames, will never understand it — unless they repent, and are 
baptized, and receive the Holy Ghost, whereby the things of God are 
made manifest. What Peter said to the multitude in his great Pente- 
costal sermon, is just as true today as when it was first spoken. The 
Gospel does not change ; it is the same yesterday, today and forever ; 
and what was necessary to save a soul two thousand years ago, is 
necessary to save one now. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

Retiring President of the Western States Mission 

During the few moments at my disposal I pray that I may have 
the spirit of this occasion. 

For nearly nine years it has been my good fortune to labor as a 
missionary of the Church, proclaiming to the world the marvelous work 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and a wonder that has been established in this dispensation. I can 
truly say to you, my brethren and sisters, that it has brought into my 
life a greater joy than any other experience. We may buy pleasure, 
we may attain happiness, but real joy comes to the individual who 
gives long and unselfish service to his fellowmen. I have rejoiced in 
the opportunity afforded me to lift up my voice in proclamation oi 
the gospel and to declare that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith 
was and is a prophet of the living God. 

As I have listened to the brethren, during the sessions of this 
conference, I have realized more fully than ever before that Joseph 
Smith was the spiritual pioneer of the nineteenth century, that he 
was the trail-blazer, if you please, who led men and women away 
from the worship of idols and planted anew in their hears a knowl- 
edge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ. He led by voice and 
life and never permitted the message entrusted to his care to be 
throttled by any power, social, economic or military. Joseph Smith 
established the Church on a firm foundation, builded it upon the 
Savior of the world, with apostles and prophets as in the great 
organization established by the Savior in the meridian of time. I 
am wondering if we appreciate the value of that organization, how 
important it is that we have the living oracles among us. If it were 
not for these men, who direct the destinies of the Church, who keep 
it in order, we would soon be as the world, wafted about by every wind 
of doctrine, and as unstable as many of the organizations calling 
themselves Christian churches. 

I am happy in the knowledge that the Church has been controlled, 
from the beginning, by the power of God, and that the men who have 
stood at the head have directed its destiny under his inspiration. The 
Latter-day Saints, as indicated by the last speaker, are not in doubt 
with respect to the gospel of the Master. It is the purpose and will oi 
our Father that all men might know the truth. To that end the gospel 
is being preached in all the world as a witness. The promise is made 
unto all who obey its saving ordinances, that they may know the truth. 
There are thousands and tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints today 
who bear witness that the Lord has heard and answered their prayers, 
and has sealed upon their hearts this knowledge. The missionaries who 
are out in the world, undaunted and unafraid, proclaim to the people 
that if they will obey the truth they may know that it is of God. The 
Savior has promised that if any man will do the will of the Father he 
shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether we speak 
of ourselves. 

May I refer to one incident that happened in our mission during 
the last year. One of our missionaries, laboring in Casper, Wyoming, 
called at a home one day and was invited in, by the man of the house. 
He discussed our faith with this gentleman for upwards of three 
hours. The man then said to him : "I have been a member of a 
Christian church for many years, and was educated for the ministry. 
My father and my grandfather before me were ministers of the gospel. 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



63 



Some ten years ago I discovered that there was a lack of vitality in 
the organization to which I belonged, and 1 covenanted with the 
Lord that if I ever found the truth I would accept it. I resigned my 
pastorate, took up school teaching, and have been searching for the 
truth." He said, "I have looked everywhere, except into your or- 
ganization and your faith, and I discover today that you have presented 
to me the message that I have been seeking all these years. I have 
covenanted with the Lord that 1 would join the church that presented 
to me the truth, and I find what I am looking for in your organization." 

It was not an easy matter for this gentleman to accept the message 
of the elders. Wjeeks and months went by, a serious illness overtook 
him, an operation was necessary; but before the operation was per- 
formed he called his family around him and said to them : "I have 
discovered the truth in the Mormon Church, and if I die, it is my 
wish that you accept their message and become identified with that 
people, and then have the work done for me in the temple." The man 
did not die. The elders administered to him ; he lived, and as soon as 
he was sufficiently well he became a member of the Church by 
baptism. After baptism he said, in bearing testimony, that the scrip- 
tures were opened to his view, or to his understanding; they became 
a new volume. He understood them as he had never understood them 
before. He comprehended the truth. It was to me the best evidence 
of his conversion. The Holy. Spirit had come into his life, and he was 
able to understand the gospel of the Master as it is presented by the 
Latter-day Saints. Many such instances might be related. 

I appreciate that the time has expired. I desire to bear my testi- 
mony to the truth; that I know as I know I live that this is the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, that it is the power of God unto salvation to 
all who will obey its saving principles and ordinances. It is not enough 
for us merely to go down into the waters of baptism, but after we 
have accepted the truth we should make application in our lives of its 
saving graces — add to our faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and 
to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience, 
godliness ; and to godliness, brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly 
kindness charity. The apostle of old said: "If these things be in you, 
and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor un- 
fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." 

The Lord help us to so live that we may be worthy of all his 
blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Henry D. Moyle, Pres- 
ident of the Cottonwood stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting commenced at 2 o'clock in the Tabernacle, April 7, 
1928. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation." 

Elder Heber S. Allen, president of the Taylor stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

A solo, "Lift thy heart," was sung by Harold H. Bennett. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I pray that 1 may have the Spirit of the Lord to direct me in 
what I shall say this afternoon. It is my desire to address my remarks 
particularly to the officers and teachers of the Church — those who 
have been called to responsible positions in the Church and who have 
a voice in the choosing of instructors in the priesthood quorums and 
the various auxiliary and other organizations of the Church. 

TEACH AS DIRECTED BY THE SPIRIT 

I shall read a few verses from section forty-two of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

"And again, the elders, priests and teachers of ths church shall teach the 
principles of my gospel, which are in the Bihle and the Book of Mormon, in the 
which is the fulness of the gospel. 

"And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and 
these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit. 

"And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if 
you receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach." 

We are inaugurating in the Church this year, a little different 
system in regard to the teaching of members of the Church, and I think 
it is an improvement through which all the members may have the 
opportunity to receive instruction in the principles of the Gospel as 
these things are presented unto them by these elders, priests and 
teachers of the Church, according to the word of the Lord in this 
revelation. 

FAITH A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION 

The matter of teaching is one of the greatest importance. We 
cannot estimate its value when it is properly done ; neither do we 
know the extent of the evil that may result if it is improperly done. 
Whether in the Church schools, the seminaries, auxiliary organizations ; 
or in the Priesthood quorums, the greatest qualification required of 
a teacher is that he have faith in the principles of the gospel ; that he 
believe in the principles of revealed truth as they have come through 
inspired prophets in our own day as well as in times of old ; and that 
he shall exercise his privilege as a teacher in the spirit of prayer and 
faith. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 65 

I am in full accord with the commandment as it is written in this 
revelation. Unless a man does have a knowledge of the truth, has 
faith in the word of the Lord and his power, and is guided by the 
Spirit of the Lord, he should not teach. We are commanded "to give 
diligent heed to the words of eternal life." For we "shall live by 
every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. For the 
word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and what- 
soever is light is spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ." 

In this day of wonderful educational privileges and opportunities 
for the gaining of knowledge, as the world understands it, we may 
feel that the greatest thing required of a teacher is that he possess a 
liberal education. It is very essential that men with the responsibility 
that teaching brings, be educated; that they have knowledge in a 
general way; but it matters not what a man's training or what his 
schooling may be — how many degrees he holds — if he has not faith in 
the gospel of Jesus Christ and has no testimony received from the 
Spirit of the Lord of the divine truth which has been revealed, he is 
not qualified to teach in any organization within the Church. Some- 
times those who are serving as Bishops and Presidents of Stakes, and 
in other leading positions, I fear, may overlook this fact and in the 
choosing of teachers in classes, as teacher trainers, or wherever it may 
be, think of the man's educational qualifications as they would be 
looked upon in the world and forget the spiritual and doctrinal qualifi- 
cations which are more essential. A teacher should not be called 
primarily because of his schooling, or educational attainments, without 
taking into consideration his humility, his faith and his integrity to the 
cause of truth which he is supposed to represent. This training does 
not come through the study of science, art or literature, but through 
prayer and faith and the promptings of the Spirit of the Lord. It 
cannot be stated too forcefully that the man or the woman without faith 
in the gospel as it has been revealed in the day in which we live, should 
not teach. The Lord has made it very emphatic. 

MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE PROPERLY TRAINED 

This is a very important age in which we live, and our message 
and our authority in the world are the most important things in the 
world. The souls of members of the Church are just as precious in 
the sight of the Lord as are the souls of the people in the world 
unto whom our missionaries go with the plan of salvation. In fact, if 
a choice is to be made, a soul already in the Church — one who is in 
the Covenant — is just a little dearer to the Father, if possible, than is 
one who is on the outside. Of course, the Lord is no respecter of 
persons, and all souls are precious in his sight, but he no doubt loves those 
who obey his voice and who are willing to walk in his truth, more 
than he does those who fail to do so. We should spend our time and 
give diligent attention to the training of members of the Church. 
Teachers who are filled with the spirit of the Lord and who are tried 
and true, should be called to act in this capacity, and those who are 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not so tried and proved, should not be called to instruct the members. 
What do we accomplish if we spend our time and means preaching in 
the world to make converts to the gospel, if we place instructors before 
the youth in the stakes and wards who destroy the faith in the hearts 
of the young people in the divine message intrusted to our care ? 

SAVING PRINCIPLES 

A .man may have a wonderful education and not be on the road to 
salvation. It matters not if a man is acquainted with the principles 
of science, history, literature, and all the branches of education as 
they are taught in the schools of our land, these truths, of themselves, 
will not save him in the kingdom of God. He must have in his heart 
the spirit of faith in the mission of Jesus Christ; he must understand 
the principle of repentance; he must understand the principle by 
which the remission of sins may be obtained, which is baptism by 
immersion by one having authority. In fact, he must understand all 
of the first principles of the gospel and obey them. These truths are 
fundamental to salvation. If a man has not complied with these 
principles and received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands, and obtained entrance into the kingdom of God, he is not on 
the road to salvation, no matter what else his knowledge may be. 
The great learning he obtains in the world will not save him. 

FULNESS OF TRUTH PROMISED TO FAITHFUL 

All knowledge is helpful, all truth is a part of the gospel, but the 
Lord has given us some fundamental laws, truths by which his king- 
dom is governed, and we must be in accord with these principles of 
truth and these laws, and understand them if we would be saved in 
the celestial kingdom. Having possession of these truths pertaining 
to our salvation, we may add to our knowledge. Eventually a man 
will be under the necessity, if he becomes perfect as the Lord prayed 
and taught in his sermon on the mount, to understand all truth. Things 
are taught in a fragmentary way now, but we will know them in full 
sometime when we receive the greater light and understanding after 
the resurrection. Our knowledge does not end with this life. We 
will continue to progress in eternity, and all things will be revealed 
unto those who are faithful in this life in keeping the commandments 
of the Lord. The Redeemer has said : 

"The Spirit of truth is of God. I am ithe Spirit of truth, and John bore 
record of me, saying : He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth. 

"And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments. 

"He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he 
is glorified in truth and knoweth all things." 

SEEK MEN OF FAITH AND TESTIMONY 

We learn in the scriptures, then, that there are fundamental things 
which we must understand, and laws which we must obey, if we would 
find our way into the celestial kingdom. Now I speak this way to 
impress upon my brethren, the Bishops and Presidents of Stakes, and 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



67 



others, the necessity of hunting for men as teachers in organizations 
within the Church who have a firm testimony and who live in full 
accord with the word of the Lord. Men who are filled with the spirit 
of faith, who understand the principles of the gospel, and who make 
them a part of their lives and who spend some of their time in prayer 
and fasting. 

THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH 

Let me read from another revelation : 

"Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question — unto what were ye ordained? 

"To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent 
forth to teach the truth. 

"And then received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and received 
them to be of God; and in this are ye justified? 

"Behold ye shall answer this question yourselves ; nevertheless, I will be mer- 
ciful unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter shall be made strong. 

"Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach 
the word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he preach it by 
the Spirit of truth, or some other way ? 

"And if it be by some other way it is not of God. 

"And again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the 
Spirit of truth or some other way? 

"If it be some other way it is not of God. 

"Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that 
receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the 
Spirit of truth? 

"Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, 
and both are edified and rejoice together." 

HOW TO AVOID DECEPTION 

Again the Lord has said, speaking on this question: 

"And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be 
deceived ; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations — 

"Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted 
of me if he obey mine ordinances. 

"He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and 
edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances. 

"And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong, and 
shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom, according to the revelations and 
truths which I have given you." 

Satan is abroad in the land, deceiving the nations, and he will 
deceive us unless we are firmly grounded in the faith, unless we base 
our salvation on truth, unless we search for gospel knowledge and 
understanding. The Lord has required of us, as he sets it forth in 
many of the revelations given to the Church, that we should search 
the scriptures, and make ourselves familiar with the teachings they 
contain. If we will do this then, we will not be led astray by every 
wind of doctrine and foolish teaching of men in the world, but will, 
have power to understand and discern between truth and error and 
choose the right, avoiding that which is wrong. Every member of 
this Church has it within his power to know the truth, so that he 
may not be deceived. This knowledge will come to us through our 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



study, through faith, through perseverance, and through living in full 
accord with the ordinances of the gospel. 

May the Lord bless and guide us, I pray, in all things, that we 
may be steadfast in the truth in these days of peril, these days when 
there are so many false doctrines prevailing in the world and men 
are striving to destroy the fundamental teachings of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. May we stand firm and faithful in the spirit of prayer, the 
spirit of faith and with a perfect testimony of the truth, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I have been greatly impressed by the spirit of this conference, and 
with the fact that the Lord has set his hand to do a marvelous work and 
a wonder among the inhabitants of the earth in the day and age in 
which we live. It is, indeed, a marvelous and wonderful work that 
was portrayed to us so beautifully, in the meeting this morning, by Elder 
Orson F. Whitney. It has been accompanied by the most miraculous 
occurrences, and it is not a great wonder that many people have 
questioned its truth. 

We are living in a day of agnosticism, a day when there is but 
little faith among the children of men. The great thing in connection 
with these miraculous occurrences is the introduction, among our 
Father's children, of those principles and doctrines that have within 
them the power of God unto salvation. 

What is the work of God? We read in the opening paragraph of 
the Bible: 

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
"And the earth was without form, and void ; and darkness was upon the face 
of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
"And God said, Let there be light : and there was light." 

Thus began, according to Holy Writ, the great work of creation ; 
and there followed the creation of man in the image of God. 

What is God's work, of which we speak as this marvelous work and 
a wonder? It is the great plan of life and salvation. God created 
the heavens and the earth, and we look up into the starry heavens, with 
wonder and amazement at the grandeur and the glory of this universe 
in the midst of which we live. We see the blazing sun at noonday 
and our hearts are thrilled with the wonder of it ; and we learn of the 
motions of those heavenly bodies and our hearts are filled with amaze- 
ment and wonder at the glory of this wonderful creation; and we ask 
the question, Whose work is this? We may read the answer in the 
opening verse of the Holy Scriptures : It is the work of God. 

But is that all that is contemplated in this great work of God? 
Is that the great thing that God has in mind? The Lord spake unto 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



69 



his servant Moses, and his words unto that mighty prophet read like 
this: "This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the im- 
mortality and eternal life of man." The saving of human souls, redeem- 
ing them from the fall, exalting them, and bringing them back into the 
presence of God, is to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life. 
It is not sufficient that we live here upon the earth. This is but one 
phase in the progress of the children of God. This mighty work of 
God began before the foundations of this earth were laid. What do 
we know about the things that happened before the foundations of this 
earth were laid? I grant you that very little has been revealed, but 
that little is full of meaning. The Lord spake unto his servant Job 
and said: 

"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou 
hast understanding. * * * 

"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted 
for joy?" 

True enough ; where was Job then ? My brethren and sisters, where 
were we? We stood in the presence of our Maker; we stood in the 
presence of our Eternal Father — his begotten children in the spirit. 
What was the occasion that filled our hearts with joy? It was the 
promulgation of this glorious plan, whereby the children of God might 
become exalted and be saved in the kingdom of God, that we might have 
our part in that great work which the Lord instituted among his 
children even in that primeval day, that involved the creation of this 
world, the placing of our Father's children upon it in tabernacles of 
flesh and bones. It involved the fall, because we were free agents, 
and without the experience of an earth life there would be no possibility 
of an exaltation. 

The principle of progress is involved in the experiences that we 
have upon this earth. The plan was announced. It was one of free 
agency, the right to choose between good and evil. Are you willing to 
take the chances of an earth-life, with the recollection of your previous 
existence taken from you, and live in a world of sin, tempted by the 
adversary of the children of men? Are you willing to be proved, 
whether or not you will do all things whatsoever the Lord will require 
of you? The announcement was made and a covenant made with the 
children of God, even in that primeval day, when he revealed the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus to the children of God. Even then, it was the 
power of God unto salvation, the new and the everlasting covenant that 
the Lord made with his children. If you will do these things and 
prove yourselves, you will receive an exaltation in the celestial king- 
dom of God. And our hearts were filled with joy inexplicable, even to 
overflowing, and we shouted for joy over the glad tidings that had 
been made known unto us even in that primeval day. 

The plan involved the sending of one mighty and strong. The 
question arose, Whom shall I send? And there arose in that mighty 
multitude the first-born of all the children of God, who said, "Here 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



am I, send me." "Thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever." 
But there was another in that assembly who objected to the great 
plan that was evolved, that of free agency, and he arose in that mighty 
multitude and said, "Here am I send me, I will be thy son, and I will 
redeem all mankind that one soul shall not be lost." Compulsion, that. 
"Surely I will do it ;" said he, "wherefore give me thine honor." And 
God said, "I will send the first." And Satan grew angry, for Satan 
it was who had spoken thus, and he rebelled against God. He had 
been busy beforehand, laboring among the children of God, deceiving 
them with his sophistries. And there was war in heaven, and Satan 
prevailed not, for the Lord sent the first, and Satan was cast out of 
heaven. 

The all-important thing for the inhabitants of this world, then, 
is this, to believe on Him whom God did send, and reject the message 
of him whom God did not send but cast out of heaven. For the war. 
begun in heaven, was continued here on earth among the children of 
men. and Satan is abroad in the land endeavoring to lead the children 
of God away here as there, continuing his work of destroying the souls 
of men. To believe on Jesus Christ, then, is the all-important thing. 
Believe on him and thou shalt be saved. And when I say believe on him, 
T mean a living faith in him, and in his glorious gospel, for, as then, 
it is now the power of God unto salvation. A man may not say that 
he believes on him and reject his gospel. A man who has a living 
faith in him lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth 
forth from the mouth of God, and. accepts of the plan of him whom 
God sent into the world, rejecting the plan of the adversary. To accept 
the plan of our Savior is to have faith. To reject the plan of the ad- 
versary, with all his sophistry, his false religion, his deception, his 
evil and all combined, to resent and resist that, and to turn away from 
it, is to overcome sin. 

There is only one way, and that is to accept of him whom God 
sent, and his glorious gospel, which has been restored in the day and age 
in which we live. That which was first given to father Adam and in 
various dispensations of God's providence has been revealed anew to the 
children of men. Let us then have faith in him. There is no other 
name given under heaven whereby men and women can be saved, no 
other plan, no other gospel. There is but one faith, one Lord and one 
baptism; and that baptism, and that faith, and that Lord have been 
revealed to the children of men in this dispensation of his gospel, and 
now, in the day in which we live, the gospel restored in all of its 
primitive purity, having in it the power of God ; — a marvelous work 
and wonder for the salvation and exaltation of the children of God. 

May we accept that message, live in accordance with it, and there- 
by be entitled to an exaltation wherein our Father will fulfil the 
covenant that he made with us in that primeval day. Let us take 
advantage of it, and lift up our voices to all the world, that they may 
hear the glad tidings which God has sent into this world, through his 
Only Begotten Son, I pray, in the name of Jesus Chrsit. Amen. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Yesterday Elder George F. Richards, quoting the words of the 
Master, said : 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistle*?" 

May I for a few moments draw your attention to some of the fruits, 
the accomplishments, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? 

I sat yesterday in our conference by the side of Dr. Roy O. Wyland, 
director of education for the Boy Scouts of America. As he looked 
out over the great multitude in this building and listened to the remarks 
of the various speakers, he was getting, perhaps for the first time, an 
intimate and accurate view of this Church and its fruits. 

At the close of the second session of the conference Dr. Wyland 

said: 

"This is one of the glorious days of my life. I have nevter known such 
inspiration before. The feeling that has come into my soul today is entirely new." 

A TRIBUTE BY SENATOR OWEN 

These remarks of Dr. Wyland remind me of Senator Robert L. 
Owen and of the experience he had under very similar circumstances, 
a few years ago in this same building. Senator Owen and the Honor- 
able William J. Bryan occupied front seats at one of our conference 
sessions during a week-day afternoon. The great audience made up 
largely of men was to them a thrilling sight. 

At the close of the session these two distinguished visitors came 
to the stand and watched the great multitude move out of the building. 
A few people, probably a hundred, gathered in front to hear what 
these visitors might say. Mr. Bryan asked the Senator to speak : 

"My friends," said Mr. Owen, "I cannot tell you how much I have been 
surprised and how much I have been pleased at what I have seen and heard 
here this day. You need have no fear for the future, for your faith is founded 
on a rock. 

"I can perhaps explain my feelings best by telling you a little story. Two 
men were sitting side by side ; one said to the other, 'You see that man over 
there? I hate him.' 

"'You hate him? How can you hate him? He is a stranger; you do not 
even know him.' 

" 'Of course I do not know him. I could not hate him if I knew him'." 

Mr. Bryan, Senator Owen, and Dr. Wyland, were all surprised, 
they were all pleased, with the fruits of Mormonism as these were 
presented by the audiences and the words of the speakers. 

OUR WORK IN SCOUTING 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. * * * A good tree cannot bring 
forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." 

If we are to be judged by the work we have done throughout the 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Church in Scouting, we have certainly been putting forth good fruit. 
Dr. Wyland told us in our conference yesterday that no church or 
other organization has done better. 

We are aiming to do efficient Scout work in every one of our 
one thousand wards in the Church. The Scout program is an essential 
element of the work offered in our Mutual Improvement Association. 
Practically every ward has in it a Scout troop. 

Elder Richards spoke yesterday of his own son — one of five re- 
markable Scouts in my own ward, the Twenty-seventh. Few troops 
in the city or, for that matter, in the entire country, have the record 
of our Troop Thirty-nine. Scout James Bean was one of the four 
boys from Region Twelve, which includes Utah, Nevada, Arizona and 
California, to win the Harmon Foundation Scholarship. Five boys 
in the Ram Patrol of this Troop to which the son of Elder Richards 
belongs, another being a grandson of Francis M. Lyman, have each 
from sixty to seventy-five merit badges. Our Scout Executive, Mr. 
D. E. Hammond, says that "they are the ranking Scouts of the United 
States." 

If the tree is to be judged by its fruit, what must we say of this 
outstanding work? 

THE CHURCH'S MISSIONARY SYSTEM 

Recently I was asked by a great scholar to name outstanding 
characteristics of our people. I named first our missionary system. 
I am looking to see someone wise enough, philosopher enough, scientist 
enough, to explain how, with little opportunity for scholastic education, 
Joseph Smith could devise an educational institution of such merit as 
this missionary system. 

How precious are the lives of young people eighteen, nineteen, 
twenty and twenty-one years old ! — the critical ages in their careers. 
What do thoughtful folks think of an institution that teaches boys and 
young men at this the most critical period of their lives, to devote one, 
two, perhaps three years to spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
to a study of his life and labors? 

The Christian world is agreed that there is no other life, that there 
is no other example, like that of Jesus, the son of God. The historian, 
IT. G. Wells, said: 

"Being myself not a Christian, I must, without hesitancy, when T have 
been asked to name the seven greatest characters of all time, name as the first 
greatest, the character that has helped humanity most and best — Jesus of 
Nazareth." 

Had Joseph Smith done nothing more than establish this mis- 
sionary system, which sends young people out in the world unselfishly 
to teach others the Christian religion, would that work not bear the 
stamp of divinity? Remember, too, that these young people pay their 
own expenses. They are not teaching for hire, nor are they divining 
for money. This is another of the fruits. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



73 



FRUITS OF MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT WORK 

There came recently into my hands "The Vigilante" — the official 
organ of the M [Men's and Gleaner Girls' organizations of the Holly- 
wood and Los Angeles stakes. These young people are fruits of the 
Church. What must be the verdict of history as to the Church which 
produces young people who in an editorial publish the following : 

"The man who succeeds must pay the price of success. He must save 
when he would like to spend. He must work when he would like to be asleep. 
He must take the kick when he is tempted to kick back. He must be patient 
when his nature wants him to be impatient. He must call all his faculties to 
reason when they want to be unreasonable." 

These are the sentiments of the young people of the Church who 
have gone on through Scout work to "M" Men's work — their own 
ideas, expressed in their own way, in their own publication. Is the 
tree which produces such fruit a good tree? "By their fruits," says 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, "ye shall know them." 

SENTIMENTS OF GREAT LEADERS 

I would like to have you look for a moment at the man, President 
Heber J. Grant, who stands at the head of the Church. When the 
Prophet Samuel was looking for a king of Israel, he said: "Man 
looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart." 
It is on the character, the heart, of President Heber J. Grant that 1 
desire you to look. 

As I walked into his office the other day he handed me a paper. 
I found on it such words as these, which express his views of life: 

"A man is a man when he knows how to sympathize with men in their 
sorrows. Yea, a man is a man when he knows how to sympathize with men 
even in their sins. A man is a man when he knows that each man fights a hard 
fight against many odds, when he has learned how to make friends and how 
to keep them. A man is a man when no voice of distress reaches his ear in vain, 
when no hand seeks his aid without response, when he finds good in every faith 
that helps any man to lay hold of divine things, whatever the name of that 
faith may be." 

These are the feelings, these the sentiments, of the man who has 
been produced by this Church and who at present stands at the head. 

Having known him since I was ten years old, I say with certainty 
that these views mirror his daily life as he has lived and as he still 
lives it. 

I quote from another product of the Church — words spoken by 
that scholarly man, John Taylor, on the 12th day of June, 1852 — a 
man who afterwards became President of the Church. Search where 
you will, and find, if you can, principles any higher or more liberal 
than these, declared by President John Taylor : 

"If any man under heaven can show me one principle of error that I have 
entertained, I will lay it aside forthwith, and I will be thankful to him for giving 
me the information. On the other hand, if any man has any principle of truth, 
whether moral, religious, or of any other kind, if he will present it, I stand 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ready to embrace it. On the other hand, if I have principles which are out of 
the power of man to prove false, I stand upon these as a sure, safe foundation." 

That is the teaching of the Church ; is it good fruit ? 

A CLEARNESS OF VISION 

Why is it, as Elder Whitney asked this morning, that those who 
are, and those who are not, members of the Church can not see alike ? 
One with a certain mental power and another of equal capacity — why 
does one believe, the other reject? 

Do Church members see more clearly because they belong to the 
House of Israel? This may be one reason. 

It has, however, for a long time been my thought, that a clearness 
of vision has come to us because those having authority have laid their 
hands upon our heads, and with authority have said, "Receive ye the 
Holy Ghost" — a blessing which seems to enable us, by the power of 
faith, to see, to feel, to know, and to say, with Job, "I know that my 
Redeemer liveth." 

This is the Church and Kingdom of God. Repent, as has been said 
to all the world, be baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and you shall know. 

A duet, "O God, our help in ages past," was sung by Margaret 
Stewart Hewlett and Pearl K. Davis. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I was not able to be at conference yesterday, but, as I lay on the 
lounge and listened to the radio, I am glad to say to the people, I 
heard every word that was said, even at that long distance. I listened 
with great interest and partook of the spirit of the conference. As far 
as I am concerned, my brethren and sisters, I feel that it is victory or 
death. I haven't a vision of any kind whatsoever. I have no ambition 
to achieve honors, and I have only one viewpoint, and that is salvation. 
I desire most fervently to walk in the footsteps of my father and to 
emulate, as far as I am capable, his example, and to be one among the 
number who are loyal and true and faithful to the Church. 

I listened with much pleasure and a great degree of happiness 
to the reports of the presidents of Missions as to what is accomplished 
in the world through the preaching of the gospel. I do not know that 
I ever felt quite so intently as I do now, notwithstanding my own 
missionary work and the hundreds of elders I have assisted in setting 
apart, the importance of this labor, because of its influence upon our 
youngest son, who is now in France. 

You know I am rather peculiar in my thoughts and imaginations. 
I get to thinking along certain lines. I pick up ideas here and there. 
It is not original. I haven't been able to get hold of anything original 
for a long time. 

All the passion I have had for the past forty years I have put into 



ELDER ]. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



75 



this work, with all the mistakes and blunders, and my spirit has worn 
out my body. As I grow older, I become more silent, with a desire 
to be alone. To me, one glimpse of immortality would mean that 
death would lose all cause of fear and would hasten my desire to go 
home. As someone has said: "Why fear death? It is the most 
beautiful adventure of life." 

What is the good of all this education and science if it cannot 
tell us that there is a survival after death? What is the good of it all 
if it cannot answer a simple question like that? Science seems not to 
know what lies beyond the "No man's land," so we must turn our 
faces and our desires to God for an answer. It has been remarked 
very often that when we meet a really big man, we almost invariably find 
a simple man, devoid of pride and arrogance. One reason lies in the 
fact that every man holding a big position knows in his own soul, if 
he be honest, that there are forces entirely outside of himself that have 
led him onward to do big things. The man of the world calls it luck, 
just a series of accidents, but Latter-day Saints feel that great men and 
good women succeed because the front door of their intelligence is 
always open to inspiration and because of their dogged determination 
and effort to carry out what God has inspired them to do. What a man 
is worth in this world depends on the kind of life he leaves behind 
him as he passes. His riches consist, not of what he brought with him, 
but of what he left behind him as he bestowed his goods and influent 
to uplift and help the poor. 

Heber C. Kimball had the superb gift of living in the hearts of 
the people. He taught me by his good behavior that while equality is 
often impossible, brotherhood and friendship is the great possible thing. 
I cannot but feel that all that is beautiful and virtuous, all that is great 
and noble, will be for my father. God and Christ, and the Prophet 
Joseph and his brethren, in time, will assemble, and he will be among 
that number. His personality was as simple as a child's and he had 
the priceless gift of a forgiving and loving heart for the people, for 
his wives and for his children. 

The fact that Heber C. Kimball was my father need not, I think, 
with fair-minded people who are considerate, convict me of immodesty 
in telling his story. It is .not as if I were claiming anything for myself. 
I had nothing to do with his creation, but I speak of a real man, the 
personification of a great prophet, a great pioneer in American life. 
I ask why should I not, at the closing of my life, give in my way an 
authentic picture of him, with the hope that it may be faith-promoting 
and convincing to others as it has been to me? When I read of those 
143 pioneers who landed in this valley on July 24, 1847, and in one 
short month they accomplished more for the beginning of a great work 
than other men have accomplished in a lifetime, I marvel at it. I can 
remember reading a discourse preached by President Brigham Young 
at the funeral of Jedediah M. Grant, wherein he said : "This man who 
lies before you accomplished more in ten years than some men accom- 
plish in one hundred." 

I now desire to call to the attention of the Kimball race what was

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



accomplished by President Heber C. Kimball and others in preaching: 
the gospel in England. 

Heber Chase Kimball was born in Sheldon, Vermont, June 14, 
1801. When he was eleven years old, his parents removed to West 
Bloomfield, New York, where his father, who was a blacksmith, estab- 
lished a large shop in which Heber was taught blacksmithing. At the 
age of nineteen, he was thrown upon his own resources, his father 
having failed in business. Heber was relieved by his elder brother, 
Charles, who taught him the potter's trade. Heber C. suffered severe 
poverty to the extent of actual hunger at this time, but it was largely 
brought about by his shyness and timidity. 

"With all his trials, hardships and persecution he was a singular coljnpound 
in his nature, of courage and timidity; weakness and strength, with a penchant 
for mirth and a proneness for melancholy, and blending the lion-like qualities 
of a leader of men with the bashfulness and lamb-like simplicity of a child. 

"Men like Heber C. Kimball are not accidents. They are, emphatically and 
in the truest sense, children of destiny. What is true in this respect of ancient 
prophets, like Abraham and Jeremiah, is true also of modern prophets. 

"This wondrous triad of spirits, known to the world as Joseph Smith, 
Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, of "Green mountain boys" of Vermont, 
went forth in the name of the great Jehovah to plant the banner of gospel truth." 

In the spring of 1837, Brother Kimball was informed by Brother 
Hyrum Smith, one of the Presidency of the Church, that he was 
designated by the Holy Spirit, at a conference of the authorities of the 
Church, to go on a mission to Great Britain. 

Brother Kimball felt his weakness and unworthiness and could 
not help exclaiming, "O Lord, I am a man of stammering tongue, and 
not fit for the work." 

In June, 1837, he bade adieu to his family, friends, the town of 
Kirtland, in company with Brother Orson Hyde and others, and arrived 
in England July 15, 1837. 

They were moved upon to go to Preston. It was a day on which 
representatives were chosen. On one of the flags that were unfurled 
was this motto : "Truth will prevail." The brethren exclaimed. "Amen 
—so let it be." 

They arrived in Kirtland in May, 1838, having been absent about 
ten months. 

There were great numbers initiated into the Church. Those who 
were sick flocked daily to be healed. The brethren slept but little, and 
some nights and days were taken up in baptizing, confirming, administer- 
ing to the sick and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. They baptized 
ten, twenty and as many as twenty-five in one day. In Preston, fifty 
were baptized in one week and one hundred in four weeks. 

Referring to the vision of the legion of evil spirit in England, on the 
opening of the mission, Joseph Smith said, "Brother Heber, at that 
time you were nigh unto the Lord ; there was only a veil between you 
and him. The nearer a person approaches to the Lord the greater power 
does the devil manifest."

On September 18, 1839, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and 
others started on a mission to England. Their wives and children 
were sick. 

Charles Hubbard sent a boy with a span of horses and wagon to 
start them out on their journey. Brigham and Heber were both sick 
and, with difficulty, got into the wagon. Reaching Kirtland, they had 
$13.50 on hand and had paid out $87. They had traveled 400 miles 
by stage and paid eight to ten cents a mile, had eaten three meals a 
flay at fifty cents a meal and had paid fifty cents for lodgings. Brother 
Brigham suspected that Heber had put the money in the trunk, but 
Heber said a heavenly messenger provided the money. 

Elders Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, Orson 
Pratt and R. Hedlock took ship for England, March 7, 1840, arriving 
April 6, 1840. On April 20, 1841, they returned to New York. They 
established the work of the Church in almost every noted town and city 
in Great Britain; baptized between seven thousand or eight thousand; 
printed 5,000 Books of Mormon, 3,000 Hymn books, 2,500 volumes of 
the Millenhl Star and 50,000 tracts; emigrated 1,000 souls to Zion ; 
established a permanent shipping place, and sowed in the hearts of 
thousands the seeds of eternal truth. 

The fall and winter of 1838 was one of the darkest periods in 
Church history — mobocracy on one hand and apostasy on the other. It 
was first a city, then a county, and a whole state rose in arms against 
God's people. 

Agreeable to the terms of the anti-"Mormons," whom the com- 
missioners represented, the Saints, trusting in God, were now pre- 
paring for the exodus of the Church and its pilgrimage to the Rocky 
mountains, an event foreseen by the Prophet Joseph Smith and predicted 
by him in August, 1842. 

Heber C. Kimball accompanied President Brigham Young to 
Illinois, and was with President Young and the 143 pioneers that 
found their way to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. 

On returning to Winter Quarters, Brigham Young was chosen 
and sustained as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, with Heber C. Kimball as his first counselor, in the fall of 
1847, a position my father occupied until his death in June, 1868. 

I honor my father for his faith, courage and integrity to God 
the Father and to his Son Jesus Christ. He was one of the first 
chosen apostles that never desired the Prophet's place — his hands never 
shook, his knees never trembled and he was true and steadfast to the 
Church and to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

He built homes for his wives and children, two flour mills, card- 
ing machine mill, molasses mills, a linseed oil mill, school buildings, barns, 
cobble stone walls. He beautified gardens and farms and laid out his 
inheritance, and laid out city blocks and named the streets. He located 
hundreds of people who built homes, and he never speculated. 

At a council meeting held at the Prophet Joseph's house, Sidney 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Rigdon remarked that he had some feelings against Elder Kimball 
who prophesied of Nauvoo : "It is a very pretty place, but not a long 
abiding place for the saints." Sidney said : "I should suppose that 
Elder Kimball had passed through suffering and privations and mob- 
bings and drivings enough to learn to prophesy good concerning Israel." 
With a mixture of meekness and humor, Heber replied: "President 
Rigdon, I'll prophesy good concerning you all the time if you can get it." 

Brother Brigham, Heber and others were enroute to Kirtland. 
Heber had chills and fever and was very ill. A doctor said he could 
give him something to relieve him. The doctor was drunk, and gave 
Heber a tablespoonful of morphine. He reeled and fell to the floor. 
Some of the brethren wept and said, "We will never see Heber again." 
Brother Brigham cared for him. Heber said : "Don't be scared. 
You brethren go ahead, for Brother Brigham and I will reach Kirtland 
before you will" ; and they did. 

During the famine of 1856, which was likened unto the famine of 
Egypt, Heber C. Kimball played a part like unto that of Joseph of old. 
He had prophesied of the famine. He, by his providence and foresight 
and anticipation of the famine, had saved his grain, filled his bins and 
storehouse, and he fed a hungry multitude, kindred, strangers and all. 
who looked to him for succor. His own family were put upon short 
rations, though he had thousands of bushels of wheat, with bran, shorts, 
corn and barley in abundance. Several hundred bushels of wheat were 
loaned to President Young, to help feed the hungry and the poor of 
Salt Lake City. 

Bishop John B. Maiben gives an interesting link in the historic 
chain at the time of the famine. "Some individuals who had flour sold it 
at $25 to $30 a 100 pounds. Not so with Heber, for at no time did he 
charge more than $6 a 100 pounds, then the standard tithing-offiee 
price. He distributed in various amounts, from five to fifty pounds 
to the poor, amounting to about 30,000 pounds. His acts of generosity, 
mercy and charity, during this time of sore distress, are worthy of 
the man. He kept an open house and fed from twenty-five to one 
hundred poor people at the tables daily, with bread, flour and other 
necessities that were worth their weight in gold." 

It is related that during the famine, a brother, sorely in need of 
bread, came to President Kimball for counsel as to how to procure it. 
"Go and marry a wife," was Heber's terse reply, after feeding the 
brother. The man thought Brother Kimball must be out of his mind, 
but when he thought of his prophetic character, he resolved to obey 
counsel. He wondered where such a woman was and, thinking of a 
widow with several children, he got busy and proposed. As widows 
generally do, she accepted him. In that widow's house was laid un 
a six months' store of provisions. She surely grub-staked him. Meet- 
ing Brother Kimball soon after, the prosperous man of a family said: 
"Well, Brother Heber, I followed your advice." "Yes," said the 
man of God, "and you found bread."

About this time, they had to meet the wants of the immigration, 
which had commenced pouring in from Europe. The crickets had 
played havoc with the crops, in spite of the interposition of the gulls. 
Great wisdom and the broadest charity had to be exercised to relieve 
suffering and hunger. The people were put upon rations, all sharing 
the same, like members of one family. As filling, they dug roots and 
ate them, like the Indians, or cooked and ate the hides of animals. 

It was during this time of famine, when the half-starved, half- 
clad settlers scarcely knew where to look for the next crust of bread, or 
for rags to hide their nakedness, that Heber C. Kimball, filled with the 
spirit of prophecy, in a public meeting, declared to the astonished 
congregation, that, within a short time, states' goods would be sold 
in the streets of Great Salt Lake City cheaper than in New York, and 
that the people should be abundantly supplied with food and clothing. 

As soon as the spirit force had abated, on resuming his seat, he 
remarked to the brethren that he feared he had missed it that time. 
President Young said: "Never mind, let it go." Charles C. Rich, an 
apostle, said : "I don't believe a word of it." Heber said : "Neither do 
I, but God hath spoken." The words of a prophet, when spoken by the. 
spirit of God, are the words of God, as he is the dictator. 

The advent of the gold hunters, on their way to California, set 
on fire, as it were, the civilized world, and hundreds of richly laden 
trains made Salt Lake City their resting place. Thus, the Prophet 
Heber's words came true, for states' goods were actually sold in the 
streets here cheaper than they could be bought in New York. 

Heber, a few years later, said, "That is the way I prophesy, but 
I have predicted things I did not foresee and did not believe anybody 
else did, but I have said it, and it came to pass. The Lord led me right, 
but I did not know it." 

"Thou shalt go to Upper Canada, even to the city of Toronto, the 
capital," said Heber C. Kimball, to Parley P. Pratt, in April, 1836, 
"And there," continued Heber prophetically, "thou shalt find a people 
prepared for the gospel, and they shall receive thee, and thou shalt 
organize the Church among them, and it) shall spread thence into the 
regions round about, and many shall be brought to a knowledge of 
the truth, and shall be filled with joy; and from the things growing out 
of this mission shall the fulness of the gospel spread into England 
and cause a great work to be done in that land." 

This pointed prophecy was strikingly fulfilled. The Fieldings, 
who were among the people that Parley found in Canada, ready to 
receive his message, had a brother in England, a minister, to whom 
they wrote concerning the rise of "Mormonism," and thus prepared 
the way for Apostles Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, who, with 
their associates, including Willard Richards and Joseph Fielding,, 
carried the gospel across the Atlantic. The Rev. James Fielding, the 
minister referred to, received them kindly (though he afterwards 
turned against them) and it was from his pulpit in Vauxhall chapel, 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Preston, Lancashire, July 23, 1837, that these elders preached the first 
"Mormon" sermons ever heard in Britain. 

Tn August, 1853, Heber addressed the Saints in the Salt Lake 
Tabernacle : "I know you will prosper and live in peace in the moun- 
tains of Great Salt Lake and be perfectly independent. You will live 
in peace and God will be your defence. The Lord can turn the nations, 
as I can an obedient horse. They are governed and controlled by the 
Almighty. There are a few other things I wanted to say: Take care 
of your grain; for it is of more worth to you than gold and silver." 
This theme he stressed for the next three years, but they heeded him 
not and they suffered the consequence. He further said later: "1 
would like to see the people manufacture their own clothing, machinery, 
knives, forks and everything else, for the day will come when we will 
be under the necessity of doing it, for trouble and perplexity, war and 
famine, bloodshed and fire, thundering and lightning will roll upon the 
nations of the earth, insomuch that we cannot get to them nor they 
to us." 

Brother Brigham said : "This is the place." Brother Heber said : 
"Here it is on high. It is the best country I ever saw." 

At family prayers, just a little while before his death, he remarked 
that the Angel Moroni had visited him the night before and had in- 
formed him that his work on this earth was finished and he would 
soon be taken. 

He died the morning of June 22, 1868. 

No wonder we are thrilled and rejoice and glorify the name of 
God, that his servants, messengers of life and salvation, have a message 
to deliver unto his children. 

God bless you one and all. I sustain and uphold the hands of the 
priesthood, and I desire, as you do, to be saved and exalted in the 
presence of God. which, if I know anything, I know it must be the 
greatest gift of God to his children. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to express my gratitude to my 
Heavenly Father for the many blessings and opportunities that have 
come to me during my life. Two of these opportunities I desire to 
mention. I was grateful for the appointment that came to me a number 
of years ago to inaugurate in the Church and to develop in a way, two 
programs: an organized program of athletics and the Boy Scout 
program. I was grateful for the kind and wise counsel that was given 
to me from time to time by the General Superintendency of the Mutuals. 
I say that I was grateful for this opportunity, not for the position, but 
because of the opportunity it gave me to labor among the young people 
of the Church. Among the young people is that vitality, enthusiasm 
and desire for progress that make them do things. To have an oppor- 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



81 



trinity to help guide that enthusiasm and love of life into channels of 
righteousness, so that our young people might take their place in the 
work of the Church a little better than they could otherwise do, was 
a privilege and blessing. 

The other opportunity that came to me was the privilege 
of laboring as president of one of the Missions of the Church. And 
again I say, not because of the position, not because of the honor — 
for it is an honor to preside in a mission, to preside in anything that 
has to do with God's work — but I was grateful for the privilege of again 
laboring with the young men and women who have faith sufficient to 
bring them out into the world to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I have seen them grow and increase in faith, in testimony and in power, 
and I have realized that God has been with them. I have been grateful 
when a boy or girl could go home at the end of his or her mission 
firmly established in the testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In 
leaving the mission field I do so with a degree of regret, because I 
love the work and I have enjoyed laboring with the boys and girls who 
have been sent out to do missionary work under my direction. 

In our message to the people of the world we are not questioning 
the sincerity of the thousands and thousands of honest men and women, 
we are not questioning their devption or their love of God or their 
purity of life ; but we are questioning the correctness of their interpre- 
tation of the principles of life. We are questioning the correctness of 
their interpretation of the scriptures which have been given unto us by 
the servants of the Lord who wrote and spoke by the inspiration and 
power of God. When men and women can look upon the laws of 
nature, express their admiration and reverence for God because of the 
orderly way in which he works in this great creation of ours — order- 
liness in astronomy, in mathematics, in chemistry — it seems strange 
that they cannot also see that it is quite as necessary that there be an 
order in the spiritual phases of life. Is it possible that God shall be 
orderly in all other things except his way of saving men and women 
and bringing them back into his presence? 

I am convinced that the unbelief and division that we have in the 
world at the present time are the result of an incorrect interpretation 
of the word of God, and because, of such interpretation men and women 
and young people especially are beginning to wonder just how far they 
can go in religion, and whether it is possible to find out God at all. In 
our interpretation of the scriptures we have faith, but we are not inter- 
preting faith as some interpret it, namely, that by faith we are saved with- 
out works. We are not interpreting baptism as something which can be 
accepted or rejected as we may please to do. But the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is one of completeness. It has in it all things necessary for our 
salvation. We do not believe in faith to the exclusion of all other 
things, or as many of the people of the world believe, "By grace 
are ye saved." 

So I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the gospel of Jesus 
Christ that has come to us through the instrumentality of the Prophet 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Joseph Smith. It is so broad and so complete that it has an appeal to 
young people ; it has an appeal to older people ; it has an appeal to 
scientific people and to educators. It matters not who the person may 
be who comes in contact with the gospel, as he studies it he discovers 
that splendid appeal. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to do the work that he desires 
us to do here upon the earth, may our boys and girls continue to grow 
up to be splendid men and women, that they shall have a desire in 
their hearts to go out and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in plainness 
and simplicity, and above all in humility, T humbly pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I am very grateful for the privilege of being present at this con- 
ference, to partake of the good spirit here manifested, and for the 
wonderful experience which comes through the personal association at 
a conference of this character. A number of important subjects came 
to my mind while sitting here, listening to my brethren, but, it seems, 
they have now all disappeared. I trust, however, that I shall be enabled 
to recall something of interest during the few moments that I may 
stand before you. 

DESIRE FOR GREATER STRENGTH 

I am very grateful for the blessings that have come to me in my 
ministry in the Church. I have often desired to have greater strength, 
realizing that the responsibility which has come to me is of such a 
character that it needs strength, both mental and physical, to discharge 
it acceptably to the Lord. Like Elder Kimball's, my body has not been 
strong enough to carry out the work that my spirit has been willing to 
do. I have often wished that I might have the strength that was en- 
joyed by some of the former officers in the Church, those especially 
who have held the office that I now hold. 

From reading the history of the Church, I have learned that the 
first patriarch of the Church weighed three hundred pounds, more than 
any of the present general authorities. I have also observed that only a 
small percentage of the men who have been very faithful in the Church 
for a number of years as bishops or as presidents of stakes, and have 
been called to the office of patriarch, are able to conduct the affairs 
required of them for any great length of time. 

THE PASSING OF A PATRIARCH 

The desire expressed by Elder Kimball was realized by one of these 
good men only the night before last. I do not know the exact age of 
the brother, because I did not refer to the records, but Patriarch Joseph 
S. Larkin, a very faithful man in the Church, had prepared himself only 
last Thursday to attend this general conference, and retired that night 
with a smile on his face and a sweet good-night to his family. When 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



83 



the family looked upon him in the morning his spirit had gone. He 
passed on without disturbing anyone. This might be a peaceful way 
to go ; but death seems sad in any way that it comes. 

HONOR AND RECOGNITION DUE STAKE PATRIARCHS 

I want to express my appreciation, my sympathy and my testimony 
relative to these good men who have been called to this important work 
in the Church. From experience, I have learned that there are many 
individuals in the Church who do not know their local officers suf- 
ficiently to honor them as we would like to have them honored. Many 
of our missionaries, desiring to get their blessings before going away 
from home, fail to call for them at the hands of their own fathers, and 
their own kin, and their own neighbors — men who have been tried and 
found faithful — men of faith, devotion and integrity for the work. I 
should like to urge these young people to take advantage of their 
opportunities, realizing that these good men hold the Priesthood of 
God and that they are authorized, with the keys of power, to function 
just the same as the Presiding Patriarch; the only difference being 
the extent of jurisdiction. 

I desire to instill in the minds of the Latter-day Saints, both old 
and young, a respect and honor for the men who hold the office of 
patriarch in the stakes of Zion. I testify that these men hold the keys 
of power to bless the people, and that their calling is just as important 
in their field of labor as mine is in the field in which I have been called 
to labor. 

BLESSINGS OF ETERNAL CHARACTER 

As far as the strength and power of the Priesthood is concerned, 
a priest, a young man who may be honored with the Priesthood of 
Aaron, can lead a convert into the waters of baptism and baptize him 
in the name of the Lord, and that baptism is of an eternal character; 
nothing will take the place of it. Yet, many of us, both old and young, 
forget that a man who is advanced in years and experience and bears 
the Melchizedek Priesthood has the power to confer upon us a bless- 
ing and a promise ; to advise and counsel, all of which also is of an 
eternal character. All our blessings are of an eternal character when they 
are administered by proper authority, and I testify that these good 
men do bear that authority and that they are willing, as far as their 
strength will permit, to function in their calling, and they are very much 
encouraged when members of the Church apply for their blessings in 
their home stakes. 

I pray that the spirit and the blessings of these good men may 
increase ; that many more may be caused to seek out these men and 
honor them, as they should be honored, throughout the stakes and 
wards of the Church. These good men hold offices of a stake capacity, 
and are limited to the stake in which they reside. I should like to 
encourage the members of the Church to honor them in their position. 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



TESTIMONY OF POWER IN THE CHURCH 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I have dis- 
covered, through experience, that the Priesthood is in the Church and 
chat it is held by those to whom it has been given. I realize that there 
are certain gifts and powers that come to us about which we do not 
know very much, because we do not cultivate them, we do not use them 
as perhaps we might do ; but I have discovered that I possess the Priest- 
hood of God. I have seen its fruits. I know that, by my faithful 
labors, the Lord has given me some very comforting experiences. The 
experiences of the elders of the Church, if published, would be a large 
volume. Through my experiences, I have been convinced that I do 
possess that power which has been given to me and has been given to 
other men, and I desire that I might have strength to honor and use it 
further for the blessing of the people. 

My heart is filled with a love of the work, and I pray that the 
Lord will continue to bless me, in body as well as in spirit, that I may 
continue faithful so long as the Lord requires my labors. 

BLESSING PRONOUNCED UPON THE PEOPLE 

I pray that the spirit of this conference will go with us to our 
homes, and help us to keep the commandments of the Lord; help us to 
be faithful in the discharge of our duties ; help us also to avoid falling 
into error — the breaking of the Word of Wisdom, the breaking of the 
law of tithing, and the breaking of other commandments that will 
shorten our blessings or cause them to be withheld from us. I desire 
to leave with you the blessings of the Lord; and to inspire greater 
diligence and greater faithfulness on the part of the members of the 
Church, not only to secure their blessings, but to live for them, ob- 
serving that all our blessings are predicated upon obedience to law, 
and that the laws are plain and for our benefit. I bless the people ; 
I bless the officers of the Church who have gathered here to receive 
instructions of the leaders; and I pronounce upon them all, leaders 
and followers alike, the blessings of God, according to their needs, and 
pray our Heavenly Father to bless you one and all in health and in 
strength and in wisdom and in gifts, according to your needs, both 
temporal and spiritual, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Zion stands with hills surrounded." 
The closing prayer was pronounced by Elder Clyde Lindsay of 
the San Francisco Stake Presidency. 

The conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, April 8, 
1928. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday, April 8, 1928. The tabernacle was crowded, every seat 
in the galleries and main hall being occupied, and hundreds were stand- 
ing in the doorways and aisles. 

The meeting commenced promptly at ten o'clock a. m. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the man." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder George W. McCune, 
president of the Hollywood stake of Zion. 

The choir sang "The morning breaks," led by Brother George 
Careless, who composed the music for this hymn and who is now in 
his eighty-ninth year. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

I think, my brethren and sisters, that we are to be congratulated 
on this blessed Easter Sabbath morn in having the great privilege and 
honor as servants of the Lord in his Church, to meet together under 
such favorable circumstances, knowing that the work of the Lord is 
spreading, increasing and becoming a great power for righteousness 
and for the well-being of mankind in the world. 

I am findful that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints ; that my parents heard this word gladly from 
the elders who were delivering the message of Mormonism ; that they 
received and accepted it with full purpose of heart, and that they 
remained faithful and devoted to the end. I am proud of this organi- 
zation, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the great 
American Church, the Church that had its birth in the land of free- 
dom, where men's minds were permitted to expand, to debate, to 
question, to tell their thoughts without let or hindrance, and not 
where the mind of man, as in some of the older counties, had for ages 
been so "cribbed, cabined and confined" that it was not safe to 
advance thought or to express opinion freely and frankly. 

I am glad that the birthday of the Church, the 6th day of April, 
is also the birthday of the nation, for on the 6th day of April, 1789, 
the two houses of Congress met and, in the way that the Constitution 
then provided, declared George Washington elected as president and 
John Adams as vice president of the United States. So we are proud 
that the Church is American-born and does not have to receive any 
instructions or orders from any foreign power or potentate whatsoever. 

"Freedom and reason make us men. 

Take these away, what are we then? 
Mere animals, and just as well 

The beasts may think of heaven or hell."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We live in a land of freedom, and a land of liberty, a glorious land. 
And in these last days the Lord has established his Church upon the 
earth for the last time. 

MANY SIGNS OF THE TIMES 

How do we know they are the last days? There are many signs 
of the times by which we may know of this fact. I haven't time to 
go into all that fully, but just hastily call your attention to the prophecy 
of Daniel, twelfth chapter, 4th verse. Speaking of the time of the end 
he said : "Many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased." 
Now imagine what there was in the way of running to and fro in his 
day, and all the succeeding centuries down to the last one hundred 
years when the revelation from Almighty God came to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. There were not many running to and fro in the earth 
in those days. Now, in contrast, how many run to and fro on the earth, 
on the sea a under the sea, and in a couple of months from now probably 
half of the people of the United States of America will be on wheels 
running to and fro all over the country. What a change, what a mar- 
velous change from the slow old movement of even a hundred years 
ago or less! 

Then again, knowledge, he said, would be increased. How won- 
derfully has that been fulfilled. It was to be increased in the latter 
times, as distinctive from the former times. We have books by the 
millions, newspapers, periodicals, magazines, knowledge on every hand. 
Then look at the last one hundred years, or one hundred eight years, 
since the first revelation, the great revelation and manifestation came 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Even the railroad was not in existence 
in 1820. From that time on, how knowledge has been increased on 
every hand! Inventions by the tens of thousands, going on and on, 
until we have the marvelous and wonderful radio — my voice going 
out now on the air. It goes around the world seven times in a second ! 
So that people in any part of the United States who are within hearing 
distance of this ether wave, as we call it, will hear my voice as instantly 
as you hear it in this building. A marvelous and wonderful invention ! 
It is not because the mind of man is more acute in this age than in 
any former ages, for the scientists all agree that the mind of man 
was quite as acute in the days of Abraham and in the days while the 
Savior was upon the earth as it is now. But those are not the days 
and times mentioned in the scriptures, which were called the last days 
and the fulness of times. 

THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD 

The Lord, through Joel, the prophet, said: "I will pour out my 
spirit upon all flesh." The Lord has poured out his spirit upon the 
people everywhere. And his spirit is intelligence. "The glory of God 
is intelligence." Any man, even an unbeliever, whose mind is operated 
upon to invent this or the other for the benefit of mankind, is acted 
upon by that intelligent influence which we name the Spirit of the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



87 



Lord, whether it is an Edison or any other man. All intelligence comes 
from God. In other words, light and truth, as our scriptures say. 
So that these inventions which have been multiplied in a most mar- 
velous manner, have been brought about through the operation of the 
spirit of the Lord. 

In the 14th chapter of the Revelation of St. John, we read of the 
coming of this latter-day work by the hands of an. angelic messenger. 
John the Apostle, the beloved, banished on the Isle of Patmos for the 
testimony of Jesus, was then the only one remaining upon the earth, the 
other disciples by this time having gone to the great beyond. The 
angel of the Lord told him : "Come up and I will show you things 
that must come to pass hereafter." Wjhat did the angel show him? 
Marvelous things. Among others was this, which was to come to 
pass after that time : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every, nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the hour 
of his judgment is come." 

This was to be in the hour of God's judgment — drawing near to 
the end, you see — in the days spoken of by Joel and Daniel, when 
knowledge should be increased and many should run to and fro. In 
other words, in the last days — the set time in which all things are to 
be consummated. 

THIS CHURCH STANDS ALONE 

In 1820 there was no divinely organized Church of Jesus Christ, 
with power and authority of the priesthood, on this earth. The or- 
ganization of the Church did not take ef fect until some ten years later — 
April 6th, 1830. From the time of John the Revelator up to 1820, we 
affirm, we make the positive declaration, we are convinced in our hearts 
and souls, for we have had it revealed unto us by the power of the 
Holy Ghost, that there was no organized Church of Jesus Christ upon 
the earth, with the authority of the priesthood to take a man down 
into the water and baptize him, that his sins might be remitted, or to 
lay hands upon his head and confirm him a member, and confer upon 
him the gift of the Holy Ghost. So that this Church stands alone 
with respect to that. 

We have no contention against any church or any people. There 
are many, many thousands of good people in the world, millions of 
them, indeed, who are faithful believers in their own way. But the 
Church of Christ as an organization — something through which the 
Lord operates, by his power and spirit — did not exist until this Church 
was organized. So that we may say that any other church claiming 
that authority, claiming the authority to bind on earth and it is bound 
in heaven, is not recognized by the Lord, for he himself has declared 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is "the only true 
and living Church upon the face of the whole earth."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NOT FOUNDED ON MEN 

I know it is claimed that there has been direct succession from 
Peter, the great apostle. Peter, the president of the Twelve, the head, 
the leader, than whom in many respects there was no greater apostle. 
We honor him. The latchet of his shoes, I would say, I am unworthy 
to unloose. But he was human. This Church is not built upon Peter. 
It is not the Church of Joseph Smith, nor the Church of Brigham 
Young, nor the Church of President Grant. It is not founded on men. 
It was founded by direct revelation from heaven. Let me read what 
the Lord said with respect to this: 

"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked the disciples, 
saying: Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am? 

"And they said: Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias ; and 
others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of 
the living God. 

"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: 
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in 
heaven. 

"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." 

What rock? The rock of revelation; for flesh and blood had not 
told Peter, but it had been revealed to him that Jesus was the Christ. 

"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven." Of 
course he did. He was the proper man to give them to, the President 
of the Twelve. 

"And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and 
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 

"Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was 
Jesus the Christ. 

"From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he 
must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priest" 
and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day." 

THE HUMAN PETER 

Now right here, Peter, the human being, on whom was conferred 
this great authority, just as today by divine appointment, is conferred 
that same power, on President Heber J. Grant, the president of this 
Church, a human being like you and me, and like Peter — right at this 
point I read: "Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him" (Peter 
the human being, undertaking to rebuke the Savior!) "saying, Be it 
far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee." We will not allow 
these men to take you and kill you — no sir. What was the answer 
of the Savior? 

"But he turned, and said unto Peter : Get thee behind me Satan, thou art 
an offense unto me : for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but 
those that be of men."— Matt. 16:13-23. 

That was the human Peter, as all men are human. Joseph Smith, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



8Q 



great as he was, the forerunner, the man chosen probably before the 
foundations of this earth were laid to usher in the great and last dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, was human. He was Joseph Smith ; 
he was not God. This Church is not founded on him any more than 
on Peter, to whom the Savior had to say : "Get thee behind me, Satan." 
You don't know what you are talking about, Peter. 

So I repeat that the rock upon which this Church is founded is 
the rock of revelation. What is revelation? If you will turn to your 
Doctrine and Covenants, in the eighth section, you will find this defini- 
tion of revelation. The Lord speaks to Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery : 

THE SPIRIT OF REVELATION 

"Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy 
Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. 

"Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by 
which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground." 

Do we have revelations today? Is President Grant guided by 
revelation? Certainly, just in that kind of way, ready to receive the 
promptings of the Spirit of the Lord as they shall be given by the power 
of the Holy Ghost. Have we the same power and the same oppor- 
tunity to receive the spirit of revelation? Certainly we have. Why, 
every member of this Church, every last one who is living as he should, 
keeping the commandments of God, receives that testimony, and is 
thereby founded upon that rock which flesh and blood hath not delivered 
unto him, but which our Father in heaven has revealed. And upon 
this rock he builds his Church. 

There isn't time to go into further discussion of this matter. I 
will have to hurry, but I want to read what St. Paul said in his first 
epistle to the Corinthians (2nd chapter, 1st to 5th verses) in respect to 
the resurrection of Christ, and I think it fits me and fits every member 
of the Priesthood, in going out to proclaim the gospel, to stick jus* 
to the one great text. 

WHAT PAUI- SAIP 

"When I came to you, I came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom, 
declaring unto you the testimony of God." 

We are not depending so much on excellency of speech, though we 
are glad to hear it. 

"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, 
and him crucified. 

"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 

"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's 
wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power. 

"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men. but in the power 
of God." 

That is Mormonism. Stick to the one message — Jesus Christ and 
him crucified; Joseph Smith receiving the everlasting gospel from an- 
gelic beings, as John on the Isle of Patmos declared, coming at the 
time of the end when all these things are being fulfilled.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



COVENANTS WITH HOUSE OF ISRAEL 

Just one other citation that I want to give you and then I am 
through. In the Book of Mormon we have a prophecy of the time 
of the end. You will find it in the 14th chapter of First Nephi. I 
haven't the time to read the whole chapter: 

"And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words, 
he said unto me : Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto 
the house of Israel ?" — the covenants that had been made unto Abraham 
not yet fulfilled, but in the way of fulfillment. The time is here, the 
covenants are being fulfilled. General Allenby, in the World War, 
marched into Palestine and freed that country from its oppressors, and 
since then that work has been going on. That is what the angel a 
thousand years ago asked Nephi in that question : 

"Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto the house of Israel? 
1 said unto him, Yea. 

"And it came to pass that he said'unto me: Look, and behold that great and 
abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation is 
the devil." 

I now skip some verses to hurry on. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out 
upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and 
rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth." 

THE FIRST WORLD WAR 

Let me call your attention to this fact, that until the World War, 
all the nations and kindreds of the earth had never been involved in 
one great war before. 

When Columbus discovered America, he found the new world. So 
prior to that time all the nations and all the kindreds of the earth could 
not be involved in war together. Since 1492 we have the most accurate 
history of all the wars, and all the nations and kindreds of the earth 
were for the first time involved in this great struggle. 

"And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations 
which belonged to the mother of abominations the angel spake unto me, saying : 
Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots ; and behold, thou 
seest all these things — 

"And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the 
mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, 
whose foundation is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall 
commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he 
hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel." 

Now the question will come : Define that Church. What Church 
is it? The Lord defines it so you can tell. Find any church that is 
great, that is abominable, whose foundation is the devil, and upon which 
the wrath of God is poured out in the last days, and then you have it. 
I can't define it any other way. 

The Lord help us to know, by the power of revelation, that this 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



91 



is his Church, that it is not founded upon Peter or Paul or Joseph or 
Heber, or any other human being, but only upon the power and authority 
of the living God, and upon the solid rock of revelation from Almighty 
God. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Certainly Zion is growing. I hope some time we will be able to 
have an auditorium that will hold all who would like to attend our 
meetings. 

We have learned that the majority of the people prefer to hear the 
sermons that are preached in this building on Sundays, rather than 
attend overflow meetings. For that reason we have discontinued the 
meetings in the Assembly Hall, and are giving the people who can not 
get into the tabernacle the privilege of sitting in the Assembly Hall and 
other places and listening to the singing by the Tabernacle Choir and 
the remarks that are made from this stand, as they are broadcast over 
the radio. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that GM 
should raise the dead?" 

This question was put by Paul to King Agrippa when the Apostle 
stood a prisoner in bonds because of his testimony of Christ, about 
thirty years after our Lord's resurrection. At that time the Saints 
were persecuted on account of their persistent testimony of the Christ, 
crucified and risen. The powerful Sadducees of that day condemned 
the doctrine of a resurrection ; the Pharisees professed vague concepts 
of resurrection of or from the dead, in the sense of there being some 
awakening of the Spirit that had been asleep ; but only those who had 
accepted the testimony of the Christ believed in the absolute and literal 
resurrection. 

TRUTH NOT CONDITIONED BY HUMAN COMPREHENSION 

This.,day is observed throughout Christendom in commemoration of 
the greatest event of history — the coming forth of the crucified body of 
the Christ as the tabernacle of his immortal spirit, he a resurrected soul, 
the first man to thus rise from death to immortality upon this earth, 
"the first fruits of them that slept," "the first-born of the dead." In 
this day of higher criticism, of skepticism and doubt, there are many of 
the learned and wise — learned and wise in their own estimation and 
that of their fellows — who proclaim the impossibility of any process of 
resurrection. Are not such men seeking to limit the power of God and 
to make him a falsifier? 

Can there be nothing but what we are able to understand and explain 
as to means, mode, and accomplishment? This would be a poverty- 
stricken world if it knew nothing but what man can explain and ex-

pound. Shall it be that because we cannot do a thing, we shall say it 
cannot be done, even by a higher power? The resurrection of Christ 
had . been foretold ; the predictions concerning his coming forth were 
literally and actually realized. Even those who were nearest unto him 
were unable to comprehend his own prophecies concerning his resur- 
rection, and at first doubted the fulfilment. After he had come forth 
from the tomb there were some of the disciples, aye, even of the 
Apostles, who treated the report as an idle tale. They could not com- 
prehend that which had never been known to have taken place before. 
They lacked analogy, they had nothing with which to compare the 
unprecedented event, and resurrection to them meant much as it meant 
to the Pharisees. 

AT THE TOMB AS PREDICTED 

On that Sunday morn, the third day after the body of the Christ 
had been laid away in the rock-hewn tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, 
Mary, the devoted woman of Magdala, and other women, had gone to 
the sepulcher to give tender ministry by external embalmment of the 
Lord's body. On the way they questioned how they would gain en- 
trance to the tomb ; as to who would roll away the great stone that 
sealed the entrance to the sepulcher. When they arrived they were 
astonished and affrighted, for notwithstanding the imperial seal of 
Caesar that had been placed on the portal, in spite of the guard of 
soldiery, the tomb was open. There sat upon the stone an angelic 
being, glorious in appearance. He spoke to comfort them, but they 
were terrified; yet the angel said: "Fear not ye; for I know that ye 
seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here ; for he is risen, as 
he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly, 
and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. 

They carried back the gladsome glorious word that the tomb no 
longer held the body of their Master ; but the disciples could not under- 
stand, notwithstanding the fact that the Lord had\> re( hcted to them, 
and that but a few days before — the last of many declarations of the 
sort — that he would be slain, and that on the third day he would rise 
again. "Let these sayings sink down into your ears," he had said unto 
them of slow understanding and of seeming unbelief, as he told again 
of his impending death, with which on other occasions he coupled 
assurances of his rising from the dead ; yet they questioned among 
themselves as to what he could mean by rising from the dead. 

ON THE WAY TO EMMAUS 

The events followed one another in rapid succession on that most 
memorable Sunday in all history. You know the record of the two 
disciples, not of the Apostles, Cleopas and a companion, who were 
wending their way along the country road, leading to Emmaus ; how 
another Traveler joined them ; how their eyes were holden so that they 
recognized him not ; how he questioned them, not to gain information 
for himself but to give them opportunity, as every true teacher gives 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



93 



his pupils a chance, to express themselves. He asked them what was 
the subject of their solemn conversation, and they voiced their surprise 
that he, even if he were a stranger in Jerusalem, had not heard of the 
great events of the preceding few days. They told their story; then 
he expounded unto them the scriptures, even from the first, showing 
that it was necessary that Christ should suffer death, and that he was 
surely to come forth from the tomb, as the prophets had foretold — 
and yet the wayfarers recognized him not. Not until they were seated 
at table in the little cottage in Emmaus, not until the honored Guest 
whom they had invited to tarry with them broke the bread and blessed 
it, did they know him. We are not told whether perchance they caught 
sight of the nail-prints in his hands, or whether they were moved by 
remembrance of other similar blessings, voiced by him and heard by 
them before, or by what circumstance it was, but they knew him, and 
he vanished from their sight. 

MANIFESTATIONS TO THE DISCIPLES 

The two men hastened back to Jerusalem, where ten of the Apostles 
and other disciples had assembled, locked in, by way of precaution 
against possible intrusion by some of the many enemies who were 
seeking their lives. They told their story to the newly arrived disciples. 
He is risen ! He has appeared unto Simon, they declared ; and while 
the little company talked and rejoiced together the Lord stood there 
amongst them, and they were sorely frightened. They had talked of his 
having been resurrected, of his having come back to life, and yet they 
were afraid. They thought they saw a ghost ! He calmed their fears. 
"Peace be unto you. * * * Behold my hands and my feet, that it 
is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, 
as ye see me have." And yet they could scarcely believe for the joy 
of it! The demonstrated fact seemed to them too good to be true. 
To make plain that he was a corporeal being in the sense of having a 
tangible body, no mere outward shape or semblance only, he asked 
if they had anything to eat, and they brought honey and other food to 
him and he did eat before them, demonstrating that his body was com- 
plete, with internal organs as well as external parts. 

Can a resurrected being eat food of earth? A resurrected being 
can function upon any lower plane. A resurrected personage can do 
anything that a mortal personage can do, and much besides. 

One of the eleven, Thomas, was absent; and when they told him 
what had taken place he could not believe. He was yet skeptical. Don't 
blame him. We know not what tradition was doing in his mind. We 
may not know the limitations of his powers of understanding, but he 
was very much like some people of this day. "I can't believe it," he 
said in effect, "not until I can see, not until I can feel his hands and 
his feet — I shall have to examine those wounds and thrust my finger 
into his side before I can believe." After eight days, that is to say, a 
week later, the next Sunday, which day of the week thenceforth became 
the Sabbath, the Lord's day, Christ appeared unto them again and 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Thomas was there. It was an affecting occasion: Thomas, come, 
see and feel ! Thomas, convinced, bowed in worship, exclaiming only : 
"My Lord and my God." "Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou 
hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen and yet have 
believed." 

IN THE REALM OF THE DEAD 

Through the ministration of the spirit of wisdom and knowledge, 
of light and truth, Christ had predicted what he would do while his 
body lay in the tomb ; read for yourselves those scriptures. But a short 
time before the crucifixion he had said unto the people: "Verily, verily, 
I say unto you : the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall 
hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. * * 
Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which all that are in 
the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have 
done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil 
unto the resurrection of damnation." A reiteration of the sublime 
principles comprised in that scripture has been made in this modern 
day, and the two resurrections are spoken of by the voice of the Lord 
to Joseph Smith as the resurrection of the just and the resurrection of 
the unjust. Furthermore it hath been declared that all who have 
breathed the air of earth, all who have tabernacled in bodies composed 
of the elements of this planet, shall be resurrected. The separation of 
spirit from body is but temporary. 

lucifer's design foiled 

You know the great plan that was laid in the councils of heaven 
before the earth was framed, that men should be sent upon the earth, 
that is, the spirits of men, to take upon themselves bodies. Lucifer, 
a son of the morning, and his followers, comprising a third of the 
spirit-hosts, had opposed the plan that the Father had proposed, and 
he and his followers, Lucifer and his angels, were cast out upon the 
earth, and straightway they sought to nullify the Father's decree and 
to destroy those bodies into which the preexistent spirits would enter 
to work out their mortal probation. Lucifer, known upon earth as 
Satan, gained a temporary triumph ; he succeeded in bringing death into 
the world, and doubtless there was rejoicing amongst his demon sub- 
jects. What would become of the great plan of giving those spirits 
bodies upon the earth when death had come in and had forced a 
separation of spirit and body, and had brought the body to decay, re- 
solving it into its elements? What now would be accomplished by the 
decision of the council in carrying out the plan of the Father? 

Christ's attributes — human and divine 

Separation of spirit &nd body was foreseen and provided for, for 
in due time came the Only Begotten Son of the Father, the only being 
who has ever walked the earth, from Adam down, not the child of two 
mortal parents, father and mother. Christ, the Son of a mortal woman 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



95 



but not begotten by a mortal father, combined within himself the powers 
of Godship and the attributes of mortality. How else can we explain 
his own declaration that he had life in himself? Consider his words 
as part of that sublime sermon on the shepherd and the sheep, in which 
he made plain that he was the good shepherd and the only true shepherd 
of the Lord's flock. He said unto the people: "Therefore doth my 
Father love me, because I lay down my life that I might take it again. 
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power 
to lay it down, and I have power to take it again;" and he added this 
comment regarding his power, capacity, and ability : "This command- 
ment have I received of my Father" — by which we may understand 
that from his Father lie had derived, by heredity, the power to rise 
from mortality to immortality. 

He could have said: "From my mother I have inherited the power 
to die, for she was a mortal woman ; and from my Father, who was no 
mortal man, I have received this power to hold death in abeyance. I 
have power to lay down my life and I have power to take it up again. 
No man can kill me until I am ready, not until my hour shall come and 
I shall give up my life. I am here for that foreordained purpose, as 
a consummation of this part of my work." He followed his work to the 
end. We read that when he was able to utter those words of triumph — 
■and they must have been words of exultation to him : "It is finished," 
that he "gave up the ghost." 

Oh yes, they killed him, that is, they killed him from their point of 
view, but not until he had finished his work did he relinquish his life. 
While he lived among men, he was preeminently the Man among men. 
So during his period of disembodiment he was preeminently the Spirit 
among spirits in the realm of the disembodied. To them he went and 
opened the work of preaching amongst the spirits who had lived in 
bodies upon the earth, men and women who had died. 

ACTUALITY OF THE RESURRECTION 

The resurrection of Jesus Christ was absolutely literal. He took 
up that body from the tomb as it had been laid down, for it had been 
predicted that he should not see corruption. The body bore all the 
marks of the crucifiers. So shall the resurrection of everyone be 
literal in this sense — that although these bodies go to decay, by the 
power of God shall all their essential parts be brought together again. 
When we stand before the bar of God we shall stand with spirit and 
body reunited, inseparably connected, and it is through the union of 
spirit and body, inseparably united, that a fulness' of joy is made possible. 

Such is the Lord's plan to bring about the immortality and the 
eternal life of man. Immediately following, or soon after the resur- 
rection of Christ, many of the righteous dead came forth from their 
graves and were seen by mortals ; other resurrections have followed, 
according to the appointed order in the resurrection of the just. Christ 
came thus and robbed the grave of its victory, assuring the eventual 
resurrection of all the sons and daughters of God who have tabernacled 
here upon the earth.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Let us rejoice on this Easter day, commemorative of the coming 
forth of the Christ from the tomb. It falls this year very close to the 
actual anniversary. 

Easter, as you know, is a movable feast, fixed by decree of the 
Catholic Church. But this year it falls very close to the actual day on 
which the Christ came forth from the tomb. We have great reason to 
rejoice in the glorious blessing of the resurrection that is assured unto 
us. We should know further that during the period of our disem- 
bodiment we are not to be inactive. We have to follow up the work of 
the Lord among the disembodied, even as we are commissioned to do 
his work here upon the earth. Death is no overwhelming change by 
which the spirit loses its power of thought, or other of its God-given 
attributes. The spirit retains such and is active in the world of spirits, 
and will so exist and function until the time for the reunion with the 
body, and when the work reserved for that stage of human progress 
will be taken up. 

MAN IS OF ETERNAL NATURE 

Great is the plan of God with respect to his children, extending 
through the eternity that lies beyond. Right thankful should we be 
for the knowledge that has been given to us through revelation. Man 
could never have attained to a knowledge of these glorious truths by 
his own reasoning, by deduction or original conception. There are 
truths that man cannot find out; they have to be given unto him. 
cardinal, basal truths, and this is one of them. Forget not that we are 
eternal ! We had an existence before we were born. In that existence 
you were you and I was I before our spirits entered into these bodies. 
You will be yon and I shall be I after the change called death befalls 
us. We shall maintain our identity, or it shall be preserved unto us, 
through and beyond the resurrection; for we are eternal! How could 
it be otherwise, when we are the children of the Eternal One ? Let us 
rejoice in this knowledge, which surpasses the wisdom of men, and 
shape our lives accordingly. To this end I humbly pray, in the name 
of the Resurrected Lord. Amen. 

The choir sang two verses of the hymn, "Jesus once of humble 
birth." 

A duet, "An angel from on high," was sung by Laurinda P. 
Brewerton and Donna Cox Gunderson, the choir and congregation 
joining in the chorus. 

AN ANGEL FROM ON HIGH 

An angel from on high, 

The long, long silence broke ; 
Descending from the sky, 

These gracious words he spoke : 
Lo ! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 
A sacred record lies concealed. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Sealed by Moroni's hand, 

It has for ages lain, 
To wait the Lord's command, 

From dust to speak again. 
It shall again to light come forth, 
To usher in Christ's reign on earth. 

It speaks of Joseph's seed, 

And makes the remnant known 
Of nations long since dead, 

Who once had dwelt alone. 
The fulness of the Gospel, too, 
Its pages will reveal to view. 

The time is now fulfilled, 

The long expected day ; 
Let earth obedience yield, 

And darkness flee away ; 
Remove the seals, be wide unfurled 
Tts light and glory to the world. 

Lo, Israel filled with joy, 

Shall now be gathered home, 
Their wealth and power employ 

To build Jerusalem; 
While Zion shall arise and shine; 
And fill the earth with truth divine. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

If Parley P. Pratt had written nothing else but this hymn to 
which we have just listened, it would have immortalized him. He 
has, however, written more of the inspired hymns that are in our- 
hymn book than any other of our writers. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California Mission 

' I feel very highly honored, my brethren and sisters, in being 
accorded this privilege. It is marvelous to me that I should be permitted 
to stand before you. I feel in my soul that it is good to be here on 
this occasion, and I most fervently thank the Lord that the teachings 
that have been imparted to us in this session of our conference find 
lodgment in my soul, and fill me with that joy that passeth under- 
standing. 

I will read a word or two from the revelations of the Lord that 
I think very important in connection with the great work in which we 
are engaged. 1 suppose it is but reasonable that, as a missionary, my 
own mind should reflect upon matters pertaining to the preaching of the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



gospel abroad among the nations. There has been much given in the 
revelations of the Lord concerning the importance of carrying the 
gospel to the nations of the world. I do not know whether it is com- 
mon today for men to seek to know the mind and will of the Lord 
regarding those things which would be most important for them to do 
that the Lord's work might be forwarded. There are many revelations 
in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, indicating that in the early 
days of the Church men frequently sought the prophet of the Lord 
to know what would be most important for them to do ; and the Lord 
answered. I will read one of those revelations: 

"Hearken, my servant John, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, your 
Lord and your Redeemer. 

"For behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine arm 
is over all the earth. 

"And I will tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone — 

"For many times you have desired of me to know that which would be of 
the most worth unto you. 

"Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which I 
have given you according to my commandments. 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most 
worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may 
bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father." 

The Lord himself has declared the following in relation to the 
value of the souls of men : 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; wherefore 
he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on conditions of repentance. 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be- one soul unto me, how great shall be 
your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!" 

The importance of carrying the message of the gospel has not 
only been declared in the revelations that have been given in the dis- 
pensation in which we live, but the same importance was comprehended 
by the servants of God in the meridian of time. The Apostle Paul 
declared : 

"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is 
laid upon me; yea, woe unto me if I preach not the gospel!" 

A dispensation of the gospel had been committed unto Paul, and 
he knew that woe would be unto him if he preached not the gospel. 

Much more might be brought forth from the word of God in 
relation to this very important matter. I am wondering whether the 
men of the Priesthood who are at home in the midst of the people in 
the Zion of the Lord, feel the importance of the commandment of God 
in relation to the carrying of the gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. 
I think I would but voice the sentiments of mission presidents if I 
made the declaration that in every mission of these United States and the 
countries adjoining our nation, people are perishing for the word of the 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN

Lord. There are opportunities abounding on every hand for the pro- 
clamation of the gospel, and we are crying out until I suppose we be- 
come almost an annoyance to the Presidency of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints: "Give us more missionaries!" That is 
the cry from California. There is a feeling with some people, that 
there is not much necessity for the word of the Lord, or for religious 
doctrine in the state of California, as Californians are supposed to be 
concerned about pleasure alone. Well, I thank God that there are many 
earnest, God-fearing men and women in the state of California. We 
are finding a few of them, and we would find more if we had more 
men and women to bear witness concerning the truth. We need many 
more. I would like to plead with the men of the Priesthood, presid- 
ing men, that they feel in their hearts the necessity of sending the 
servants of the Lord abroad in the nations with the truths of the gospel. 
I would like to make a plea among all men and among women who 
are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that 
they cultivate a desire to engage in the proclamation of the gospel. 
I understand that I am under the same obligation as the Apostle Paul, 
and that unto me, in connection with my brethren; a dispensation 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has been committed, and woe 
will be unto me if I preach not the gospel. I want to say, in the name 
of the Lord, that woe will be unto all men who bear the authority of 
priesthood if they do not desire to labor and do not labor to the extent 
of their power, that the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, which 
is the power of God unto salvation, be sounded among the inhabitants 
of the earth. If you desire to bless your sons and your daughters, and 
to establish them in the work of the living God, give them an oppor- 
tunity, if they are of proper character, and if they have the proper 
desire in their hearts, to go abroad as missionaries. If there be anything 
else in this world that establishes the feet of young men and women 
in the right path, and reveals to them the truth of the gospel in the 
same wonderful manner that missionary service does, I do not know 
what it is. 

I listened with very great joy to the testimony of our Commissioner 
of Education that there had come to him in periods of trial and anxiety 
the whisperings of the Lord, the revelations of the Lord, establishing 
in his soul a knowledge concerning the existence of God our Father in 
heaven. Thanks be to God for such whisperings. I want to say to 
you that God is no respecter of persons. Men who are educated, who 
humbly seek the Lord, receive" the revelations of the Lord and the 
testimony of his word ; and men who are not educated receive by the 
same marvelous power the same convincing evidence. It has been my 
pleasure just within a few weeks to listen to the testimony of the gospel 
from the lips of young girls and young boys, trembling with fear, their 
eyes moistened with tears, yet with joy in their souls, bearing witness 
that God lives, and that that knowledge has come to them by the power 
of the Holy Ghost. I thank God for that. I am also glad that the 
Lord, in his mercy, has revealed to me that this is his work, the 
marvelous work promised by the voice of inspiration through ancient

prophets for the latter times. I have that knowledge. I thank God 
that in my soul, in my heart and in my mind I have been given to know 
the truth of the record that we have been singing about, the Book ot 
Mormon, that it is true, that it contains the fulness of the everlasting 
gospel I thank God for my membership in the Church of Christ, for 
the fellowship that I have with my brethren ; and I bear solemn witness 
to the truth of the gospel, the truth of the things that have been taught 
us this day, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Canadian Mission 

1 rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in the testimonies 
which we have received today. It was inquired of old: "If a man die, 
shall he live again?" That question has been answered well this 
morning. I rejoice, and I think you do, in the information given us by 
our prophet, seer and revelator at the opening of this conference, that 
Cumorah's hill is now in the possession of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. In standing upon that sacred ground on the 
one hundredth anniversary, I wished then, and I expressed the thought 
at our last semi-annual conference, that this property might belong to 
the Church ; because in connection with the Hill Cumorah and the revela- 
tions to the Prophet Joseph Smith, there has been a flood of information 
answering that question of old: "If a man die, shall he live again?" 
What joy must have come into the heart of Job when he was able to 
exclaim : "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at 
the latter day upon the earth : And though after my skin, worms destroy 
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." 

A questionnaire was sent out by a bereaved man a score of years 
ago, to philosophers and scientists, requesting them to state in brief the 
outstanding reasons which they had for the hope of life after death, 
and for the resurrection of the body. These arguments and reasons 
given were merely corroborative of the clear revelations from our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as revealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in these last days. Our elders of course have strong testimonies, 
not only of the existence of the spirit after the death of the body, and 
of the resurrection, but also that Jesus is the Christ — that Jesus is 
divine. They have all the evidence that the non-Christian Jew had 
or has that there shall be a Christ. They have all the evidence that 
the Christian believer has that there has been a Savior and Redeemer. 
Many of those matters have been very beautifully presented to us today. 
In addition to all that, there is the scripture that came from Cumorah's 
hill, the Book of Mormon, one of the very purposes of which was to 
testify to Jew and Gentile that Jesus was the Christ. I realize that 
there isn't time to refer to some passages of the Book of Mormon in 
support of this doctrine, or at least to read them. The story and 
testimony of the Christ as given upon this continent when he appeared 
to his people as recorded in the Eleventh Chapter, Third Book of Nephi, 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



101 



is a wonderful testimony. I have had the feeling as I read that chapter 
time and time again, that no man without inspiration ever wrote that 
story. We have been studying the Book of Mormon in our mission 
home in Canada during the past year, and after nearly every lesson 
I could say, and I have said many times : Isn't that beautiful ! Isn't 
that wonderful ! No man without inspiration could produce those 
things. And that is my testimony to you here today, that in addition 
to the testimony of the Book of Mormon we have the testimony in the 
revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 76th Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants : 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

I thank God for that information, for that revelation, and for 
the many others along that line contained in the book of modern 
revelation, the Doctrine and Covenants. I thank the Lord for the 
testimony that is in the hearts of the missionaries. I remarked last 
night to our Canadian missionaries : I wonder if the people of the 
Church realize the very beautiful and splendid growth these mission- 
aries have made during their sojourn in the mission field. I wonder 
if the bishops of wards and presidents of stakes will so order things 
that that growth which they have made will continue, that they will 
continue to grow spiritually and intellectually in a knowledge of the 
truth and continue in the conviction that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that this is his work, established, never to be thrown down nor 
to be given to another people. And that is my testimony to you today. 
I bear it humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Then shall your light." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Fred A. Caine, president of 
the Idaho Falls stake of Zion. 

The meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing meeting of the conference opened in the tabernacle, 
Sunday, April 8, 1928, at 2 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the choir and congrega- 
tion would sing the hymn, "The spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

After the spirited singing of this song by the great audience, the 
opening prayer was offered by Elder Oliver H. Budge, president of 
the Logan stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The earth is the Lord's". Pearl K. 
Davis, soloist.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of religious gatherings this is one of the most thrilling sights in 
all the world, and the most inspirational. To address this vast audience 
is indeed a weighty responsibility. I pray therefore for your sym- 
pathetic, prayerful help and for the inspiration of the Lord. 

Our children are our most precious possessions ; and the proper 
training of youth is the most important duty and obligation of society, 
Impressive and earnest have been the admonitions and instructions in 
this conference to the people properly to educate their children. 

TRUE EDUCATION 

True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few 
facts of science, history, literature or art, but in the development of 
character. True education awakens a desire to conserve health by 
keeping the body clean and undefiled. True education trains in self- 
denial and self-mastery. True education regulates the temper, subdues 
passion and makes obedience to social laws and moral order a guiding 
principle of life. It develops reason and inculcates faith in the living 
God as the eternal loving Father of all. 

I desire to call attention this afternoon to three groups in society 
on whom the responsibility rests to give this true training to the youth 
of the land, and I should like to consider this responsibility in the light 
of revealed religion. 

We heard this morning from President Nibley a most timely and 
authoritative declaration regarding the restoration of the Gospel and 
the Priesthood of God on earth. In the year 1820 the Prophet Joseph 
Smith received that authority, and ninety-eight years ago last Friday 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was officially or- 
ganized. Thus there was at least one man who had direct authority to 
represent God in giving to mankind principles of salvation and peace. 
We heard this morning that before that day there was no such authority 
either by apostolic succession or by reformation. Granting now, that 
Joseph Smith received that authority, that he established the Church 
for the salvation of the human family, I ask you, can you find a safer 
guide in the education of your child than through the revealed word of 
God to his prophet? 

RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 

To parents is assigned the first responsibility for the training of 
children. The Lord through the prophet says: 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the Living God, and of baptisim and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the 
sin be upon the heads of the parents." 

Direct responsibility could not be assigned more emphatically and 
clearly than it is assigned in that paragraph. Parents, there is the word 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



103 



of the Lord to us regarding the proper training of children. Education 
commences at the mother's knee, and every word spoken in the hearing 
of little children tends towards the formation of character. Let parents 
always bear this in mind. Victor Hugo says, "There are no bad herbs 
and there are no bad men — there are only bad cultivators." If we 
could have parents who are good cultivators in our homes, which are 
the gardens of the Lord, our civil officers would have little difficulty 
in maintaining order, and the violations of law would be less frequent. 

There are parents in the world — I hope there are very few in the 
Church — who say they will leave the educating of their children in 
religious matters until the children themselves arrive at years of ac- 
countability. They will permit their children to choose which Church 
or which principles of religion the children desire to accept. The 
Prophet Joseph gives no intimation that any parent has a right thus 
to leave the religious training of his children until they arrive at the 
years of accountability. x 

Coleridge once met a man who made that same statement, and 
Coleridge said, "I took him and showed him my garden, and told him 
it was my botanical garden." "How so," said he, "it is covered with 
weeds." "O," I replied, "that is only because it has not yet come to 
its age of discretion and choice. The weeds you see have taken the 
liberty to grow and I thought it unfair in me to prejudice the soil 
toward roses and strawberries." 

The application is clear. It is said that Plato one day, seeing a 
child do mischief, called immediately and reprimanded the child's 
father. He, too, recognized the fact that one of the great potent factors 
in the education of childhood is the parent. "Whatever parent gives his 
children good instruction and sets them at the same time a bad example, 
may be considered as bringing them food in one hand and poison in the 
other." 

RESPONSIBILITY OF PRIESTHOOD QUORUMS 

The second group upon whom the responsibility of training 
children rests by divine revelation, is the quorum of the priesthood 
and other helps in government. A few years ago when I was attending 
conference in the Carbon stake, President Horsley and I discovered a 
little child that was lost. President Horsley wiped away the little one's 
tears, and carried her to his home and placed her in the hands of Sister 
Horsley, through whose gentleness and tenderness the child soon fell 
asleep. Efforts were made to discover the parents, and at about five 
o'clock in the afternoon, the distracted mother was found. Her tear- 
stained eyes showed what anguish she had passed through since the 
little one had wandered from her side. But she was at peace when she 
found her darling sleeping by the fireside. 

I think this incident illustrates the relation of the quorums to the 
parent. There are boys and girls wandering from the parental hearth- 
stone. In the world, outside the Church, hundreds and thousands and 
tens of thousands of them are crouching today behind steel bars. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Even here in our own stakes some are wandering carelessly, aimlessly 
away from the influence of home standards and home teachings. It is 
the duty of quorum members to extend the hand of fellowship, the 
hand of guidance to these young men and young women wandering 
towards the downward path. Can you find any more potent influence 
in all the world than the quorums as established in the Church of Christ? 
Time will not permit me even to define them for you. You all know, 
and while I am speaking you have in your minds the quorums of 
Deacons, one thousand or more ; you have in mind over nine hundred 
groups of Teachers, and approximately an equal number of groups of 
Priests, young men between the ages of seventeen and twenty. Seventy 
thousand young men thus grouped, whose duty it is to extend the glad 
hand to those of their companions who have not glimpsed the privilege 
given to these members of quorums. 

QUORUM POTENCY 

T wonder how many parents ifave stopped to realize how potent 
these quorums are in the lives of boys ! In the first place, quorum 
membership awakens in the boy the pride of fellowship and member- 
ship. Entrance into that group means that the boy has attained to 
certain standards of excellence of character, and the more distinctive 
we can make these entrance requirements the greater will be the pride 
in the young boy's heart. 

Second, the quorum influence arouses or satisfies the call of the 
boy for the inspiration of the group. Have you heard of the gang 
spirit ? Have you seen the boys out on the ditch bank gathering in 
groups in answer to the call of their souls for companionship ? Then 
can you see the wisdom of God in gratifying this natural inclination 
by grouping the boys under, an influence that is educative in the 
highest sense of the term? 

Third, that group throws upon the youth responsibility. Tell a 
young boy that you trust him, and you have one of the greatest means 
of guiding him uprightly that can come into your hands. Young boy, 
I trust you ! To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved. 
Boys are few indeed who will not hold inviolate an implicit trust. 

Fourth, grouping in a quorum offers service. The Presiding 
Bishopric, holding a presidency over these seventy thousand young 
men, have outlined as they have hitherto done, a plan of service into 
which these young men are invited, not just on Sunday, but on every 
day of the week. 

Finally, into that group is introduced faith in God the Father, in 
his Son Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of the world, and their service and 
acts are all done under the cognizance and realization that God is ap- 
proving of their acts. It is sublime. It is divine. Fathers and mothers, 
let us unite with the priesthood in extending the influence of these 
groups. 

I have mentioned only the Aaronic Priesthood, but our fathers are 
grouped in like manner, and we have one hundred and thirty thousand 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



105 



men and boys working for the true education, working to train the 
youth in parenthood and faith in God and in the restored gospel. 1 
tell you, this grouping in Priesthood Quorums has the mark of divinity. 
It is divine. And Joseph Smith, a young man not twenty-five years of 
age when he gave that revelation, gave it by the inspiration of God 
for the salvation of the youth of Zion. 

OTHER CHURCH EDUCATIONAL FACTORS 

Now I cannot say anything this afternoon about the other educa- 
tional factors furnished by the Church for the education of our boys. 
Our Church schools — O, what they mean in true education ! Our 
seminaries, correlating as they do the gathering of facts in science, 
literature and art, introducing these high elements, faith, integrity, obe- 
dience to law, respect for order, purity of life. Our Religion Classes, 
the Sunday Schools, the Mutuals, the Primary — I cannot do more than 
merely mention them, because I want to pass to the third group very 
seldom mentioned as a means of influencing youth. I find reference 
to it in the Doctrine and Covenants in these words : 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and 
magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer 
the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of 
the people." 

COMMUNITY INFLUENCE 

You will recognize this third group in the influencing of boys is 
the community — our civil officers and social functions. It is said the 
pulpit only teaches to be honest ; the market-place trains to over-reaching 
and fraud ; and teaching hasn't a tithe of the efficiency of training, 
Christ never wrote a tract, but he went about doing good. 

The press dispatches this morning report the results of a survey 
made recently by W. F. Burton of the Department of Education of the 
University of Chicago. Many of you no doubt saw it. He made a 
survey of thousands of young children in the sixth grade in our public 
schools. That means the boys and girls ranging approximately from 
ten to twelve years of age. He said the six things they all know most 
about, in their order of knowledge, are "bootlegging, divorce, alimony, 
sheriffs, juvenile courts, jail and jury." Now you may say of course 
they were in Chicago, but the same examination was given to the 
children of the schools of Salem, the capital of the state of Oregon, 
where 63% of the people own their own homes. The result was 
exactly the same. "Next in order," Burton averred, "the children know 
most about mayors, elections, polling places, ballots, taxes, and in- 
surance ; and third, bank deposits, rents, bankrupts, pioneers, and 
sanitary inspectors." We do not know just how these questions were 
given to the children. Perhaps they were so worded as to call forth 
these answers, but I think it is significant that the fundamental things 
in education are not named — not even mentioned. 

I call attention to this merely to drive home the fact that our com- 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



munity is a great factor in the teaching of our children. Our officers, 
public servants, are teachers of the youth and they carry the responsi- 
bility of teachers. It is our duty, therefore, as citizens of this great 
republic, to exercise our right at the ballot box. It is our duty to see 
that men in both our great parties are chosen who will teach not only 
by precept, but by example, obedience to law ; that these men so elected 
will appoint men under them who will not scoff at the law against 
liquor, who will not themselves indulge in bootlegging, or who will 
not in any way protect those men or women who violate moral laws. 

I said that the greatest obligation upon society is the proper train- 
ing of youth. The home, our quorums, our officers in the community 
are three great educational factors, and all three subject to our senti- 
ment, our approval. 

"It matters not what I shall gain 
By fleeting gold or fame, 
My hope of joy depends alone 
On what my boy shall claim. 
My glory must be told through him, 
For him I work and plan — 
Man's greatest duty is to be 
The father of a man." 

And each one of us may be the father of a man, as Paul spiritually 
was of Timothy, and Peter of Mark, who as a young man undoubtedly 
was a witness to Christ's betrayal, and who, if he did not see him 
resurrected, wrote in after years : 

"Ye seek Jesus who was crucified ; he is not here, he is resurrected." 

God help us to get our young boys to feel and to know not only that 
Christ has risen, but that he has appeared again to men, and restored 
the gospel of Christ, the power of God through which youth and all 
mankind may receive salvation and peace. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Senior President of the Firstt Council of Seventy 

My brethren and sisters, in all the conferences of the Church that 
I have attended, I cannot recall a time when I have felt that we have 
had a greater spiritual feast than we have had at this conference, be- 
cause of the outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord upon his servants. 
The spirit of testimony has been very strong, and it appears to me that 
it has been colored by the spirit of testimony as exemplified in the 
declaration of the Christ upon one occasion — that occasion when he 
taught the mysteries of the new birth to Nicodemus. After his expla- 
nation about the second birth, and having expressed some surprise that 
Nicodemus, a teacher in Israel, was not acquainted with these truths, 
the Savior said : 

"We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen." 

And then he appears to have been under the necessity of saying 
this rather sorrowful thing: 

"And ye receive not our witness." 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS

I trust that that reflection will find no place in our experience in 
this conference. 

At another time the Savior struck a more hopeful note connected 
with the fact that he himself was a witness to the truth. That occurred 
in his conversation with Pontius Pilate just before he was condemned 
to crucifixion by that officer. Pilate was seeking justification for 
letting the Savior go, and when that seemed to be hopeless, he sought 
for justification for signing the death warrant enacted by the Jewish 
Sanhedrin against the Christ. Among the charges made against Jesus 
was that he claimed to be a king ; and of course I suppose it occurred 
to Pilate that if he could attach that claim directly to the Christ he 
would feel some justification in condemning him to death, as such a 
claim would be a challenge to the sovereignty of Rome. Hence he 
brought up that question and said unto Jesus: 

"Art thou a king?" 

The Savior replied : "My kingdom is not of this world." 
"O, then, thou art a king?" exclaimed Pilate. 
"Thou sayest I am a king." 

As if he saw the hopelessness of continuing the discussion, "Thou 
sayest I am a king," so we will let it go at that. Then he turned to a 
more serious matter and said: 

"To this end was I born, for this purpose came I into the world, 
to testify of the truth." 

Something more than a kingship ; something of higher importance 
than being a king: I am a witness of the truth. "And they who are 
of the truth, hear my voice." (St. John 18:33-37.) 

• From which we gather that there is a force and power in truth 
itself apart from any bolstering up by arguments or reasons a direct 
power in truth itself that carries conviction of the effect of it to 
those who are "of the truth." I think that is the spirit that has char- 
acterized so splendidly this conference — The Spirit of Truth. 

Among the many important subjects that have been brought to our 
attention I think there is no item of more importance than the subject 
that was discussed by President Ivins in tracing the records of the 
Nephites from the centers of their civilization northward, and the long 
pilgrimage of the people as they moved northward until they came to 
the land of Ripliancum, the land of many waters, and the Hill Cumorah. 
I was deeply interested in what he said, and I believe that his remarks 
make a very important contribution, not only to this conference, but 
to the literature of the Church. It will at least be preserved in the 
minutes of this conference, and will be of permanent record. 

As he closed his remarks the thought that flashed through my mind 
was this : O, what the world would have lost, if the Book of Mormon 
had not been brought forth ! 

I wish I had the time to consider the things that would have been 
lost to the world but for the bringing forth of the Nephite scriptures, 
the American volume of scriptures. I remember in my early days 
coming in contact with opponents of the Book of Mormon who charged, 
for instance, that it had no aphorisms of any importance, and that it 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was in this respect in strong contrast with the Jewish scriptures. 1 
want to call, your attention, however, to a few aphorisms that are of 
great worth, and that enrich the sacred literature of the world. 

For instance, there is that sharp-cut sentence: 

"Wickedness never was happiness." 

I think it would be difficult to find an epigram more important 
than that, and a truth that the world ought to know. 

Again : "All things have been done in the wisdom of him who 
knoweth all things." 

A beautiful utterance; and a declaration of confidence in the perfect 
knowledge of God ; and builded upon that perfect knowledge — and it 
can only be builded upon perfect knowledge — perfect wisdom. And 
that beautiful declaration is followed by this announcement of the 
great truth, giving us clear vision of the purpose of God with reference 
to the earth-life of man, the like of which is not found elsewhere, 
neither in Jewish nor Christian scriptures ; nor in the philosophies 
of men : 

"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have 

That is the thing that God is working out, and what a lesson of 
cheer and good will and of hope it is! 
Here is another: 

"The Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, 
save he prepares a way for them that they may accomplish the thing 
which he commandeth them." 

You who are starting to bring to pass the high purposes of God, 
with reference to this creation of his, what comfort that assurance 
brings ! "God will require nothing at the hands of the children of 
men save he prepares the way for them to accomplish that thing." 

Again, Moroni, near the close of his record, seems to tremble for 
the success of his work, and as he reviewed it and became conscious 
of the weaknesses in it, he was very deeply sorrowful and he wrote 
in substance — and all these quotations are but in substance: 

"Lord, the Gentiles will mock at our weakness in writing." 

And the answer of the Lord was: 

"Fools mock, but they shall mourn ; and my grace is sufficient for 
all who humble themselves before me, saith the Lord." 

I remember having a very rich bit of experience with that passage 
in the younger days of my ministry when I was on my first mission. 
It fell to my lot to engage in a three-day debate with a seasoned man 
in that line of work. I was but twenty-three and had had no expe- 
rience. He was fifty-four and had the reputation of having driven all 
his opponents from the platform. He mocked considerably at the 
Book of Mormon, and brought up this very question of its lack of 
incisiveness and clear-cut aphorisms, and challenged me to produce 
anything that could be comparable with the sharp, clear-cut aphorisms 
of the Bible scriptures. 

I told him I could think just at the moment of but one, and that 
was, "Fools mock, but they shall mourn." 



ELDER BR1GHAM H. ROBERTS 109 

I am not very much acquainted with his history after that debate, 
but after three days' discussion he utterly refused to go on with the 
debate, when it was really but half through, and notwithstanding he 
had previously driven every opponent from the platform. I had his 
promise also that I should have the opportunity of examining his doc- 
trine after closing our debate on the Book of Mormon, but he refused 
to go on with it, and left the platform with an unfinished job on his 
hands. By the way, let me say, not by way of boasting, but because 
of the blessing of the Lord on our labors, immediately following the 
discussion, we began baptizing, and within two months had raised up 
a branch in the neighborhood of more than sixty members. The 
Lord so blessed us on that occasion. 

After calling this gentleman's attention to that passage, "Fools 
mock, but they shall mourn," he did not ask for any more aphorisms. 

"Fools mock, but they shall mourn !" And then this richer state- 
ment follows it: 

"I, the Lord, give unto men weakness that they may be humble; 
and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before 
me." 

Have you in your moments of trial or deep sorrow felt the hand 
of a friend steal quietly into your hand, and by pressure express 
sympathy and brotherhood to you? I have fortunately had a few 
friends with whom I have had such experience as that, both men and 
women, a recollection that is among the precious treasures of my 
experience. But this passage, "I give unto men weakness that they 
may be humble ; and my grace is sufficient for all those who humble 
themselves before me," — in this, it seems to me, that I feel the hand of 
God slipping gently into my hand, and giving me the pressure of assur- 
ance that there will be mercy, that there will be helpfulness, that there 
will be encouragement from God. He will remember that we are but men 
and women in the making; and while not yet perfect, yet perhaps 
perfectable — which is the important thing. In that utterance in the 
Book of Mormon, I feel the richness of the grace of God, and assurances 
of success in hungering and thirsting after righteousness, for it shall 
be given unto us. 

The Book of Mormon is important because of its correction of 
some errors that have crept into the philosophies and religions of men. 
You see perhaps the most perfect expression of God's law unto men 
in the sermon on the mount. That sermon as it stands in Matthew is 
vulnerable, at least at one point ; and that is where the Savior admonishes 
men without any limitation, apparently, as expressed by Matthew, to 
take no thought for tomorrow, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, 
or wherewithal ye shall be clothed ; and calls attention to the lilies of the 
field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet Solomon 
in all his glory is not arrayed as one of these. He refers to the very birds 
of the air, that they are under the care of the Father, and will have his 
attention, and not one falleth to the ground without his notice. "Are ye 
not of more worth than many sparrows ?" 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Now those who enter into arguments against the doctrines of 
Christianity, and who try to condemn even this sermon on the mount, 
say that this doctrine of taking no thought of tomorrow is utterly im- 
practicable in life. That if men generally tried to live as the birds do, and 
to receive their clothing as the flowers are clothed with beauty, the 
result would be not civilization but savage life as we know it among 
the undeveloped races of the children of men. 

In the Book of Mormon account of Christ delivering that sermon 
on this continent among his people, when coming to that part of his 
sermon which he repeated here in this land, he turned directly to the 
Twelve Disciples unto whom he had given authority to preach the 
gospel and administer the Sacraments thereof, and it was to them, and 
to them alone, that he addressed that part of his sermon. They were 
to take no thought of the things of tomorrow, nor the things of the 
world; for the Father knew beforehand what their needs were. And 
then he admonishes them to take encouragement from his reference 
to the birds of the air and the flowers of the field, how they were fed 
and clothed ; and gives them encouragement that the Father would so 
care for them. From the fact that this part of the sermon was limited 
to the Twelve Special Disciples on this western hemisphere, it is a 
reasonable conclusion that the same limitation was fixed in his sermon 
on the mount when he delivered it in Palestine, as it was recorded by 
Matthew. 

Civilized man must of necessity take thought of tomorrow, and 
plan for it, and practice self-denial, that in the future greater things 
may be accomplished, through the thinking and the sacrificing of today. 
These things are the very keynote of building up civilization. But out 
of a community you could call twelve ministers, dedicated to a certain 
purpose in life, that requires all of their energies and all of their 
thought, and enjoin upon them self-consecration to a given special 
task, without injury to the development of civilization ; they could take 
no thought of tomorrow, and trust in the providences of God for their 
maintenance, without affecting industrial, or economic conditions. 

There is no apparent effort to make a correction of Matthew's 
account of the Sermon as it appears in the Book of Mormon. Tt 
relates simply the incident, and from it you see how this point in the 
sermon on the mount may be clarified. 

So with several of the beatitudes in that sermon. Changes here 
and there made which give them point, and make them more definite 
and beautiful. For example, in this one, Matthew says : 

"Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven." 

The Book of Mormon version of that beatitude is : 
"Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit, who come unto me : for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven." 

To be poor in spirit is no doubt a very excellent quality, but it 
requires more than that to enter the kingdom of heaven: They must 
come unto God in order to enter the kingdom of God. And so through- 
out. I can only give you just a brief example of these things.

Since this is Easter day, let me call your attention to one other 
thing in the testimony of the scriptures of the western continents — ■ 
the Book of Mormon — in relation to the resurrection of Christ. What 
a wonderful testimony that book contains for the thing that is celebrated 
this day throughout Christendom, namely, the resurrection from the 
dead of our Lord the Christ ! In all the accounts that are given of the 
reality of that resurrection — and it has been beautifully expressed to 
our thought during this conference, the absolute reality of it — how 
well the testimonies of the Christian scriptures and the prophetic parts 
of the old Bible, too, are sustained by that wonderful appearing of 
the Lord Jesus Christ to the inhabitants of this western world ! After 
the awful destruction by storm and tempest and earthquake, which 
very much changed the character of the face of the land, even moun- 
tains arising from plains, and mountains shaken to their foundations, 
covering wicked cities upon whom God had decreed destruction ; after 
the awful three days darkness which seems to have been even more 
terrible than the storms and earthquakes, and which has become en- 
shrined in the legends of the native people of this American 
continent; after that dreadful experience of storm and tempest 
and destruction — then a voice was universally heard in the land 
proclaiming the mercy and willingness of the Savior to forgive; 
proclaiming the truth that he was the Creator of the heavens and the 
earth, and had made his sacrifices for the redemption of men. Follow- 
ing that, some time after the close of the storms, tempests, whirlwinds 
and earthquakes, came to pass the wonderful appearing of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, when a few people in the Land Bountiful stood by a 
temple that happened to have escaped destruction — then, as they won- 
dered upon the changes that had been wrought in the lands about them, 
and were recovering somewhat from their own errors, they heard a voice, 
but knew not whence it came nor what was said. They looked about 
at each other wondering whence it came. The second time they heard 
it, but there was no definite communication in the sound. The third 
time they heard it they recognized that something was said, and that 
something was this, and it thrilled them: 

"Behold my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, in whom I 
have glorified my name — hear ye him." 

Looking in the direction whence that voice came they saw a man, 
all glorious, descending in white raiment, and down he came until he 
stood upon the earth in their presence. Stretching forth his arms — 
it seems to me it must have been with wonderful majesty — he said unto 
them : 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall 
come into the world. 

"And behold, I am the light and the life of the world : and I have 
drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have 
glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the 
which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the 
beginning." 

What a message of the Deity to the world ; a message and testimony 



112 



GENERA L CONFERENCE 



of the Christ ; of the fact that he had suffered for the sins of the world, 
of the fact that he had risen from the dead, and now stood before them 
clothed with all authority in heaven and in earth, come to establish faith 
in the hearts of these people who had been tried by their severe ex- 
periences, and had survived because they were the worthiest to survive ! 
To them also he granted the privilege of St.' Thomas, to behold his 
wounds in hands and feet and side. And when they had thus confirmed 
their faith, on their faces they fell and shouted aloud: "Hosanna. 
Hosanna to the Most High God!" And so they worshipped the risen 
Lord. 

Now, tell me in what church or cathedral in the world, in what 
sacred grove, in what place among the habitations of men, will be found 
a more glorious Easter vision of the Christ than this? And the world 
would have lost this' if it had not been for the Book of Mormon coming 
forth, and there is a hundred more such glorious things that have 
come to the world in that book to enlighten the children of men, all of 
which would have been lost had not this American volume of scripture 
been brought forth. 

My brethren and sisters, we have had a most glorious conference. 
Will you not permit me to close my remarks according to the desire 
that is in my heart, and what I would like to say to express my own 
feelings of gratitude for the things that have been reviewed before us 
in this conference? Do not think me presumptuous, but if I might 
follow the promptings of my own heart on this occasion, I should do 
so in this manner : 

O God, the Eternal Father, in the name of thv dear Son Jesus 
Christ, we worship thee ! We worship thee as the Creator of heaven 
and of earth, and of the seas, and of the fountains of waters. We 
worship thee not only as Creator, but also as the World-sustaining 
Power of the universe. We revere and honor thee as the Intelligence- 
inspiring Power in the world, also as the Vital Force of the world, 
and the Sustaining Power of Life. We honor Thee also as the Love- 
manifesting Power, as expressed through Jesus Christ our Lord. To 
us he is God manifested in the flesh — God incarnate. 

We thank thee for that glorious line of patriarchs from Adam to 
Noah, and from Noah to Melchizedek, to Abraham and Moses and all 
the prophets in Israel. We thank thee for the service and labors of that 
majestic man who stood at the head of the Aaronic priesthood in his 
day and time, John called the Baptist, who was the forerunner of 
Christ, in the meridian dispensation. We thank thee from full hearts 
for the Christ himself, and for the sacrifice that he made for us. Also 
we thank thee, our Father, for the Apostles of that dispensation, and 
for the honor and integrity in which they discharged their high duties 
in bearing special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

We thank thee for the great prophet of the New Dispensation, the 
servant in thy house, Joseph Smith, the Seer of the last days. And 
also, Father, we thank thee for that flood of knowledge that has come 
into the world, the testimonies from the Nephite scriptures, as well 
as those which have come from the Jewish scriptures. And, O Lord, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



113 



far and above all, the most excellent of all, and to whom we are directly 
indebted for hope of eternal life and redemption from sin and union 
with Thee through thy Spirit and our baptism into it, that Spirit by 
which we "may know the truth of all things," even the Holy Ghost. We 
thank Thee for this. 

And now, O Lord Jesus, if thou couldst but come into the con- 
sciousness of our souls this clay, as thou didst come into the vision of 
the ancient Nephites in the Land of Bountiful, we would join their 
great song of praise and worship, saying — "Hosanna ! Hosanna ! 
Blessed be the name of the Most High God!" And we, like them, 
would fall down at the feet of Jesus and worship him this Easter day ! 
Amen. 

A duet, "The morning land," was sung by Mrs. Dolores Fernstrom 
and Miss Jessie Evans.

"Zion's welfare is my portion, 
And I feel my bosom swell 
With a warm, divine emotion, 
When she prospers, all is well." 

My soul has rejoiced in the spirit of this conference and in the 
hope that we have in the completion of the Lord's work according to 
his plan and purpose. I am in full sympathy and accord with all that 
has been said concerning the marvelous work and a wonder which the 
Lord has established. My great anxiety is that it shall continue to be 
a marvelous work and a wonder. I feel constrained to make an appeal 
to the Latter-day Saints, particularly my brethren who bear rule in 
stakes, wards and quorums, to see to it that we do preserve all our 
sacred privileges by complying with those requirements which the Lord 
has made for the future welfare of Zion. 

A BOOK OF MORMON MESSAGE 

Reference has been made frequently to the Book of Mormon, dur- 
ing this conference, and to the messages it contains. I should like to 
read from it, to call to your attention a message that comes to us from 
Nephi (II Nephi, Chapter 28). He saw this day as clearly as his own, 
and he gives us this warning: 

"And now, behold, my (brethren, 1 have spoken unto you, according as the 
Spirit hath constrained me ; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to 
pass. 

"The things which shall be written out of the book shall be pf great worth, 
* * * and especially unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel. 

"For it shall come to pass in that day, [in the day when this book should 
come forth], that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when 
the one shall say unto the other, Behold I, I am the Lord's ; and the others shall 
say : I, I am the Lord's ; and thus shall every one say that hath built up 
churches, and not unto the Lord — 

"And they shall contend one with another ; and their priests shall contend 
one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Ghost, which giveth utterance. 

"And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel ; and they say 
unto the people : Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept ; for behold there is 
no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he hath 
given his power unto men; 

"Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle 
wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God 
of miracles ; he hath done his work. 

"Yea, and there shall be marry which shall say : Eat, drink, and be merry, 
for tomorrow we die ; and it shall be well with us. 

"And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; 
nevertheless, fear God — he will justify in committing a little sin ; yea, lie a little, 
take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor ; there 
is no harm in this ; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die ; and if it so be 
that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be 
saved in the kingdom of God. 

"Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false, and 
vain, and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek 
deep to hide their counsels from the Lord ; and their works shall be in the dark. 

"And the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them. 

"Yea, they have all gone out of the way ; they have become corrupted. 

"Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false doctrine, their 
churches have become corrupted, and their churches are lifted up ; because of pride 
they are puffed up. 

"They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries ; they rob the poor 
because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart, 
because in their pride they are puffed up. 

"They wear stiff necks and high heads ; yea, and because of pride, and 
wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone astray save 
it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, 
that in many instances they do err, because they are taught by the precepts of 
men." 

DANGERS THAT THREATEN THE WORLD 

I shall not read the remainder of it; I commend it all to you. 
Here is a message to the Church, a message to the world. Nephi saw 
most clearly these things which threaten the world, and the dangers 
that threaten the Church. I see no dark clouds gathering against the 
Church, but I do see most clearly that which Nephi declared, that in 
this day Satan would stir up the hearts of men, and he would rage in 
their hearts against the truth, and he would seek to gain power and 
control over the kingdoms of this world. 

THE LORD'S PROMISE TO THE CHURCH 

I recognize, my brethren and sisters, that the Church has attained 
a right to exist. I fear neither kings nor potentates so far as the future 
destiny of this work is concerned. The only fear and anxiety that I 
have in my heart is that the Latter-day Saints will not keep the com- 
mandments of God. 

I read in the Doctrine and Covenants words of precious promise 
to this Church on conditions found in the one hundred and third 
section, wherein the Lord, even in the midst of the trial and suffering 
of the Church following the days of their sorrow in Missouri, said : 

"But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



115 



shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel 
which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them. 

"Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine 
enemies from this very hour." 

And here are the conditions : 

"And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God. 
shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of 
the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to 
possess it forever and ever. 

"But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not to 
observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them, 

"For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of men." 

This precious promise is ours, on condition that we continue as 
faithful as our fathers and mothers were. We live in the time when 
men begin to say, It is all right to sin a little, to lie a little, to! begin to 
pay little heed and attention to those strict requirements of the Lord, 
to begin to break the Word of Wisdom a little, to begin to neglect the 
payment of our tithes and offerings, to begin to treat the moral law 
lightly, and to look upon it as a thing not binding upon us. That is the 
spirit that is in the world, and the Lord said that influence would 
actually affect the Church itself — the few who were the only ones in 
the world acceptable, and yet, in some instances, they were stumbling 
because of these false doctrines and precepts of men. 

CAN OUR CIVILIZATION ENDURE 

I heard recently, as some of you did, an eminent philosopher 
deliver an address, in the Assembly Hall, on the question, Can civiliza- 
tion endure? He recited the rise and the fall of empires, and said 
that all the glory of Babylon had gone the way of the world, as was 
the case with other civilizations that had arisen. And yet, out of it 
all, there has come unto our civilization all the blessings and benefits 
of former civilizations. But he also called attention to the fact, that 
if the glorious civilizations of the past had not been destroyed and 
could have gone on building, what might be our status today! He 
also said, there is, of course, a possibility that, glorious and wonderful 
as this civilization is, it, too, may perish and go the way of the world. 
He asked the question, Will the day ever come in the lives of the chil- 
dren of men when a civilization shall be established that will stand for- 
ever and will not go into decay as those great civilizations of the past 
have done ? He hoped that day would come, he believed it would. While 
listening to his remarks, I saw, more clearly than ever, the hand of 
God in laying a foundation in fulfilment of that promise made through 
Daniel, in the interpretation of the dream given to Nebuchadnezzar, 
that that day would come. He saw all the kingdoms that have risen 
and have fallen, and foretold their future as accurately as the historian 
has recorded it since the events have happened; and, with as much 
accuracy, he foretold the day to come when, after all this period, the 
God of heaven would set his hand to establish a new order of things 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the earth, to build up a kingdom that would stand forever, and that 
never would fall. 

A KINGDOM THAT WILL NEVER FALL 

Our attention has been called, during this conference, to the estab- 
lishment of the Lord's work in the founding of these American insti- 
tutions, and that God inspired the men who wrote the Constitution. 
We believe that his hand has been over it. I believe myself that it is 
part of God's great work in the building up and establishment of a 
kingdom for himself when he will come, for come he will, to reign as 
King of kings. All the kingdoms of the world shall go on, attempting 
to solve their problems and utterly failing, until, in desperation, after 
the days of their sorrow, they will turn to him and elect him to be 
their King. He will reign as Lord of lords in his Church — this Church, 
builded and established by him, and which shall go forward and never 
fail. Wonderful, is it not, to think that we are favored above all other 
men in the world, privileged to live in an age when we are contributing 
towards the establishment of that order of things that will never perish. 

This government, its principles and doctrines, will never perish 
from the earth. Neither will this Church nor the principles and the 
doctrines that it announces. They are not competitors, they are hand- 
maidens preparing the way for his coming. It is glorious to know 
that he has risen, and more glorious to know that he will come again 
and will live and rule and reign with his saints for a thousand years, 
and peace shall be here. This is the mission and the destiny of the 
Church of Jesus Christ' of Latter-day Saints. What then is our duty ? 
My brethren, it is to go to our stakes and wards and rally our forces 
as watchmen upon the towers of Zion, to see the dangers that threaten, 
and while they are not disastrous now, being forewarned, forearm our- 
selves, and induce our brethren and sisters not to be weary in well- 
doing, but to subscribe their lives to these simple gospel principles, for 
in abiding by them is all this future glory assured to us. By keeping 
the commandments of God, we shall never cease to prevail until the 
kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdoms of our God and his 
Christ. 

SATAN SHALL BE DEFEATED 

My only anxiety is that, when the clay comes, we shall be found 
with oil in our lamps. I bear witness to you that the devil is raging. 
He never has had such an experience in all his existence, in seeking to 
obtain power and authority over the things of this world, as today. He 
never has been so completely defeated as in the successful establishment 
of this Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He 
has sought by every power and means at his command to destroy it, and 
he has failed. And he will fail in the future. He is gathering his 
forces for the great conflict and struggle, even Armageddon, when 
the living righteous and righteous dead shall be arrayed on one side 
against the living wicked and the wicked dead, in a mighty conflict, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 117 



to settle the question as to who has the right to rule and reign ; and 
he shall be defeated, no matter how great his forces. 

god's power to be manifested 

I bear witness to you that God is speaking through the elements in 
the midst of the nations of the earth. He will manifest his power as 
never before. This Church will have the opportunity to demoinstrate 
its power and its influence in the world. If only we will adhere to 
these principles, we shall rise and shine, and no power on earth or in hell 
shall stop the progress and growth and development of this wo;rk. The 
power to make it succeed is in our hands. God give us the vision to see 
clearly our glorious destiny, to recognize the principles by which we 
may, through adhering to them, reach that destiny, and come off vic- 
torious, to rejoice in the day of the triumph of God's work in the earth, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

My brethren and sisters, this conference is drawing to a close. 
Before we separate I desire to make a few remarks, and as a preface 
to what I wish to say I will read a few lines from the Book of 
Mormon. These are the words of Christ our Lord : 

"He that believeth these things which I have spoken, him will I visit with 
the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall know and bear record. For because 
of my Sprit he shall know that these things are true ; for it persuadeth men 
to do good. 

"And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me ; for good 
cometh of none save it be of me." 

My brethren and sisters, during the sessions of this conference 
a great variety of topics have been touched upon. The doctrines 
of the gospel, the moral obligations which are upon us all, to be 
observers and exemplars of righteousness, the foundation upon 
which the Church is builded, and the circumstances under which 
it came into existence in this dispensation have all been referred to 
by the speakers. 

THE GOSPEL NOT SOMETHING NEW 

The one thing which I wish to impress upon your minds is 
this : The opening of this gospel dispensation, the restoration of 
the gospel of Christ in the day in which we live, did not come as 
an incident connected wholly with our day and time. It is not 
something new that has come into the world in conflict with other 
truths that exist in it, but it is a restoration of that which was com- 
menced with the very beginning of the human race, and is intimate- 
ly connected with that which shall continue unto the end. 

It is true, as has been stated, that the priesthood of God our 
Father has come to us through the ministry of angels whom he has 
sent to the earth. It is true that there was no other church, as has 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



been stated, where this authority existed. But that does not mean 
and I would not have you understand that other men in times 
past, and other men at present, may not be inspired of God our 
Father to perform the work which they are doing. The Church 
has no conflict with men who are thus discharging their mission. 

god's promises to be fulfilled 

The covenants entered into by God our Father with his people 
appear to have been almost lost, and absolutely so, for the mission 
of Christ himself at the time of his death appeared to have been a 
failure. The promises made to the house of Israel had not been 
fulfilled. They were scattered, their whereabouts unknown to the 
people at large. And yet the Lord had said that those promises 
were eternal. That means that they should live forever. After the 
dispersal of Israel there came a period, centuries of time, in which 
we have little authentic history. When we emerged from it we 
found ourselves in a world that was dominated by kingcraft and 
priestcraft. We found a people uneducated, untaught, untutored, 
without knowledge of the word of the Lord as contained in Holy 
Writ, for that was a book which had been sealed to them. 

THE WORK OF THE REFORMERS 

Then there came such men as John Wycliffe. Do you think 
that God called him ? Yes, just as definitely as he called Joseph 
Smith, not to perform the same work; but this great personage, 
amid a time of confusion and ignorance, declared that the word 
of God should be published to the people, and the church said, 
"It shall not be published. We have the Pope, and we had better 
be without the law of God than without him." That is a historical 
fact. But Wycliffe went on. He did publish a Bible, and he was 
hounded and persecuted to his death for having done it, and after 
he died a petition was presented asking that his remains be buried 
in a dunghill because of this great sin that he had committed. 
He had actually published the scriptures. Finally, after a rather 
decent burial, his body was disinterred, burned, and the ashes scat- 
tered in the river Swift, and carried by that into the Severn, and 
thence into the ocean, in order that his work might be obliterated. 

One hundred years later came William Tyndale with the same 
message, meeting with the same opposition. The church would 
not permit that the word of God be published. Tyndale said, "I 
will make every ploughboy in England to understand the scrip- 
ture better than the Pope himself." Do you think that the Lord 
called that man? Yes, as definitely as he has ever called a man 
to do His work. 

Then came Martin Luther, that great soul, who had the cour- 
age to stand against priestcraft and kingcraft, and declare that his 
conscience was a captive to God's word. That was his declara- 
tion when he stood before the Diet at Worms. "There I take my 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 119 



stand; I can do no otherwise. So help me God." That was his 
answer to his accusers. 

Tyndale was strangled by order of the church because he as- 
sumed to publish the Word of God. It was at a time when the 
Duke of Alva went into the Netherlands, authorized by the church 
to put to death all who were not orthodox, and he himself was 
the judge of their orthodoxy, who afterwards boasted that he had 
executed eighteen thousand men, and women were not spared. 
Any person who had the effrontery or the courage to say that the 
Eucharist was not actually converted into the body and blood of 
Christ, when he ate that piece of bread, and drank a swallow of 
wine, was put to death. 

Those were the conditions which existed. The Lord raised 
these men up and associations were formed protesting against such 
abuses. Thank the Lord for them, paving the way for the open- 
ing of this gospel dispensation, when righteousness might prevail. 

THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the friend 
of every man or woman, every association of men or women which 
is formed that has for its purpose the accomplishment of good. 
The words of Christ are true : That which is good comes from 
God, and that which is evil and tends to lead men away from the 
truth comes from that evil one. 

But when it comes to associations of men and women, whether 
they be ecclesiastical or whether they be civil, that are bound to- 
gether either secretly or openly for the accomplishment of a selfish 
purpose, or for the accomplishment of a purpose that is contrary 
to the word of the Lord as it is contained in the scriptures, against 
all such the Church is opposed. 

I thought I would like to make that plain. Thank the Lord 
for good men and women whether they are in the Church or out 
of it. Thank the Lord for the efforts which are put forth to in- 
cline men to faith in Christ and to bring them to him. But we are 
irrevocably opposed to any association, whether it be religious, 
political, or social, which denies these eternal truths, which binds 
men in the bonds of ignorance, which shackles them as the people 
of the world were shackled in the middle ages, which slays men 
because they do not accept their point of view. It is anti-Christ, 
and not the doctrine of Christ our Lord. Those millions of people 
in Mexico who are fighting today for personal liberty will no 
longer be held in bondage, kept in ignorance of the word of God, 
and denied those privileges of progression which everyone is en- 
titled to. 

This is the attitude of the Church. We do not want to be at 
enmity with any good man or woman, or with any good institution. 
But we are against that which leads men and women into evil. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, and send us away from 
here with a renewed determination to establish righteousness, to 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



give our sympathy to everything that leads to the intellectual and spiritual 
development of mankind. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Before closing this conference, although the time has expired, I 
desire to say a few more words. I realize that there are people here 
from all our stakes from Canada to Mexico, and I feel assured in my 
heart that they will be perfectly willing to stay a few minutes beyond the 
allotted time. 

GRATITUDE FOR SPIRIT OF THE LORD 

I desire to express my gratitude for the rich outpouring of the 
Spirit of the Lord during our three days of conference, for the splendid 
music, for the inspirational prayers, expressive of the heartfelt devotion 
of those who have prayed for us, for the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
for the Lord's many blessings unto us. 

TIME INSUFFICIENT TO HEAR ALL AUTHORITIES 

I am truly grateful for the inspiration of the Lord to each and 
all of those who have spoken. It would have been a source of pleasure 
to me to have heard from all of the General Authorities of the Church ; 
also from some of the stake presidents and others that I had in mind 
to call upon; but time forbids. As I have remarked upon several oc- 
casions, I think we ought to have at least one more meeting of two 
hours in addition to the six meetings we now have in our conferences ; 
there are so many that we should like to hear ; but, to date, we have 
been contented with twelve hours of general conference meetings. 
Twelve hours once in six months is not a very long period for the 
people to stay together, and yet we notice considerable restlessness in 
a meeting the moment the two hours are up. But, even at the risk of 
wearying you, there are a few things more I desire to say. 

A BLESSING FOR AUTHORITIES AND MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH 

I wish to endorse the remarks that have been made at this con- 
ference from start to finish. I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints 
that I believe God is blessing every one of us who is keeping his com- 
mandments, beyond even that of which we are worthy. I know he 
has blessed me beyond all that I could have asked or expected in my 
ministry, from the day that I was made the President of the Tooele 
stake of Zion to this moment. And I, as the President of the Church, 
standing at the head of the Church, pray God our heavenly Father to 
bless each and every one of the general, stake, ward, auxiliary, temple, 
school and mission authorities, all over the world, all men and women 
who are striving honestly and conscientiously to fulfil the duties and 
the obligations that rest upon them. I pray that all men and all 
women who hold any place of responsibility, no matter how high or 
how low, may magnify their callings and preach the gospel by their 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



121 



example of righteousness, that they may grow and increase in influence 
with God, and with those over whom they preside. I promise every 
soul holding any place of responsibility that the blessings of the 
Almighty shall be and abide with him if he strive, to the full extent of 
his ability, to magnify his callings. 

A BLESSING FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 

I pray God to bless his Saints all over the wide world, and I bless 
them by the authority of the priesthood which I hold. I pray for our 
country and ask the Lord to bless those who preside in the nation, in 
the states, in the cities and in the counties. I pray God to inspire the 
people that they will obey his commands, and elect good men to office ; 
that they will bury their political differences and seek for good men 
to hold office, and not men who connive with those who are breaking 
the laws of our country. It is one of the articles of our faith to obey 
and uphold the laws of the land. May God help us to do it. May .the 
sweet influences of his Spirit attend every honest-hearted soul the 
world over. And I pray for their welfare and particularly for the wel- 
fare of all who are striving for the spread of the gospel, and I do it in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and a quartet sang the anthem, "Let the mountains 
shout for joy," led by Professor Evan Stephens who composed the 
anthem. 

The choir and congregation sang "Doxology." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder J. Fred Corbett, pres- 
ident of the Idaho stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by 
B. Cecil Gates. Accompaniments and interludes were played on the 
great organ by Edward P. Kimball, Tracy Y. Cannon, Frank W. 
Asper and Alexander Schreiner. 

Stenographic notes of the conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

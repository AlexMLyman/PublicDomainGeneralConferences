GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the conference commenced at 10 o'clock Friday 
morning, October 5, 1928. 

The great tabernacle auditorium and galleries were well filled with 
people from all parts of the Church. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced the opening 
of the conference. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Elder Willard Young offered the invocation. 

The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice in having the opportunity of again meeting with the 
Saints in general conference. I am delighted to see the splendid 
audience that is here this morning. 

CHANGES IN STAKE AND .MISSION OFFICERS SINCE LAST CONFERENCE 

I am sure that it will be of some interest to those who are here 
assembled to learn regarding the changes that have been made since our 
last conference. 

New Stakes Organized : The Alpine stake has been divided into 
three stakes, to be known as the Alpine, Lehi and Timpanogos stakes. 

Stake Presidents Appointed : John E. Magleby has been released 
as president of the South Sevier stake, and James R. Ware has been 
appointed to succeed him. 

John M. Baxter has been released as president of the Woodruff 
stake, and William R. Smith appointed to succeed him. 

Stephen L. Chipman has been released as president of the Alpine 
stake, and Clifford E. Young appointed to succeed him. 

Anchor Carlos Schow has been appointed president of the new 
Lehi stake. 

Wilford W. Warnick has been appointed president of the new 
Timpanogos stake.

Charles H. Hyde has been released as president of the Australian 
mission, and Clarence H. Tingey appointed to succeed him. 

Ernest C. Rossiter has been released as president of the French 
mission, and Peter Rulon Christensen appointed to succeed him. 

New W ards Organised : Elberta ward, Tintic stake. Echo ward, 
Summit stake ; Midvale ward, East Jordan stake, divided into two wards 
to be known as Midvale First and Second wards; Green River ward, 
Carbon stake ; Compton ward, Los Angeles stake ; Hurricane North 
ward, St. George stake. 

Bishop who has passed away during the past six months : William 
A. Stringer of Milburn ward, Lyman stake. 

Stake clerks who have filed : Nelson J. Hansen of Uinta stake ; 
F. C. Mickelson of Shelley stake. 

All of the retiring stake presidents retire with the confidence, love, 
respect and good will of the General Authorities. They have done most 
excellent work, some of them serving over a quarter of a century. 

The Church today has 101 stakes of Zion; 940 wards; 72 in- 
dependent branches. 

When we speak of an independent branch we mean a branch with 
a president and two counselors. There are many small branches of 
wards in addition. 

We have 1,012 organized wards and branches in the Church, 
from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south. 

We have at the present time 27 missions in different parts of the 
world. 

EXPENDITURES FOR CHURCH EDIFICES 

The building program of the Church is progressing as rapidly 
this year as it did last year. There was expended last year for the 
erection of Church buildings and amusement halls throughout the 
Stakes of Zion over one million dollars of Church funds and a like 
amount by the people. 

There has been expended in the first nine months ending October 
first, this year, $868,892.54. During the same period last year there was 
expended for stake and ward edifices $742,282.40. So that over $125,- 
000 more money has been appropriated by the Church for the nine 
months ending October 1st this year, for the erection of public build- 
ings, than for the same period last year. And the Saints have con- 
tributed a like amount. Therefore, over $1,700,000 has been expended 
up to date from the tithes and by the people in the various stakes 
for these purposes. 

VISITS MISSIONS 

It has fallen to my lot during the past six months to visit the 
following branches in the missions: Chicago, 111., Washington, D. C, 
New York and Brooklyn, N. Y., Charleston and Huntington, West 
Virginia. I have had the pleasure of meeting the mission presidents

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and many of the elders and holding meetings in the places in the 
mission fields that I have mentioned. 

BUILDINGS DEDICATED 

In addition I have had the pleasure of holding meetings in many 
of the wards and in some of the stakes, and of dedicating meeting 
houses and amusement halls. I dedicated a chapel and amusement hall 
in Kirtland, New Mexico, in the Young stake of Zion. There has 
been erected there a very beautiful little ward meetinghouse, one of 
the finest in the Church. The people there are very much more pros- 
perous than they were some years ago. 

I was reminded of the wonderful change that has taken place since 
I went over the mountains from Alamosa down to Durango and then 
by wagon to Kirtland, with the late Brigham Young, Jr., forty-five 
years ago. We covered the same ground on this recent trip in between 
three and four hours, that it took us four or five days to cover with 
a team on my first visit. 

I dedicated a splendid meetinghouse and amusement hall at Smith- 
field, in the Benson stake, a very fine building in the small town of 
Mapleton, in the Franklin stake, and a meetinghouse costing between 
sixty and seventy thousand dollars at Mar Vista, one of the wards of 
the Hollywood stake. The last named ward was organized only five 
months ago, its members having originally belonged to the Ocean Park 
ward. It is remarkable that in less than five months from the time 
the erection of the building was commenced, it was completed and paid 
for. Men, women and children worked on this building. The little 
children carried tiles for the roof ; the good sisters nailed on laths ; and 
some of our non-Mormon friends devoted time and attention to laboring 
there. The people did more than one-half of the total cost of erecting 
this building. I think it is the most remarkable accomplishment in that 
length of time of any building we have erected in the various wards. 
There were one thousand people in attendance at the dedicatory services, 
and by opening the doors between the amusment hall and the chapel, 
they were all comfortably seated. When the building was commenced 
the membership of the ward was less than four hundred people, and 
few of them have large means. 

The Los Angeles stake has built a large amusement hall which 
is utilized for conference purposes, adjoining the Huntington Park 
ward meetinghouse. The combination of the meetinghouse and stake 
hall gives them one of the finest plants in the entire Church. This 
building for stake purposes and recreation has cost about $110,000, a:: 
I remember it. 

BUILDINGS IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION 

The Hollywood stake, in connection with the Wilshire ward, in 
erecting a most magnificent chapel and ward building and recreation 
hall combined, which will cost, I would say, in the neighborhood of 
$120,000. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

We are now erecting in Portland, Oregon, a magnificent chapel 
that will cost us over $100,000. We own an entire block there. 

The work that is being accomplished in erecting meetinghouses 
with the funds that the people pay into the various missions as tithing 
is very remarkable. 

In the California and other missions many meetinghouses are being 
erected at the present time, and many have been erected. Several 
hundred thousand dollars have been expended in the last few years in 
the California mission alone. 

It fell to my lot recently to attend the conference of the San 
Francisco stake held at Oakland, and also to hold a meeting at San 
Francisco. That stake is growing very rapidly indeed. So also are 
both of the stakes in Los Angeles. 

I also had the privilege of attending a three days' hike or outing 
of the Mutuals of the San Francisco stake at Stinson Beach on the 
Pacific ocean, enjoying a very splendid time there. 

We have erected a fine seminary building at Moscow, Idaho, facing 
the university buildings there. It is a very creditable structure, and the 
president and other officers of the university are very much delighted 
with it, and speak in the highest terms of our having done something 
along religious and educational lines for the members of our Church 
who are attending the university. 

We are erecting a similar building near the Agricultural College 
in Logan. 

The building program of the Church during the past nine months 
I feel is all that we could have asked or expected. 

AN INTERESTING AND PROFITABLE TRIP 

It fell to jny lot with President Anthony W. Ivins, to be one of 
the guests of the Union Pacific Railroad and of the National Parks, 
in visiting the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the scenic wonders 
of Southern Utah — Zion Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Cedar Breaks — 
than which, to my mind, there is nothing finer in the world. There is 
a great tunnel and road being built, winding up over the mountains to 
come out of Zion Canyon, that is costing a vast sum of money, the 
government alone, as I remember it, having appropriated over a million 
dollars to build this tunnel. It will be the most remarkable and scenic 
route that any automobile has ever traveled over when it is completed. 
There will be an abundance of room for two automobiles to pass all 
through this great tunnel. It will save a vast amount of time which is 
now "spent in traveling over the bad roads and through a strip of Arizona 
to get to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Many miles will be 
saved, and as I say, it will be the greatest scenic road ever traveled 
over by automobiles, when it is completed. 

I need not enter into any details here regarding these four scenic 
wonders. They are marvelous. They cannot be duplicated in any 
part of the wide world. 

There were about two hundred guests, as I remember it, in the party

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



— a special train from Los Angeles and a special train from Salt Lake 
City. I wish to express to President Carl R. Gray and to the chairman of 
the finance committee of the Union Pacific Railroad, Mr. Seger, and to 
Stephen T. Mather, the sincere gratitude of President Ivins and myself, 
Mayor John F. Bowman, Congressman Don B. Colton and many other 
people who were with us, citizens of Utah, for the most marvelous and 
wonderful trip that it has ever fallen to my lot to take. 

The splendid compliments paid to our people for their accomplish- 
ments in Southern Utah by President Gray, Chairman Seger, Mr. 
Mather and others who spoke, filled our hearts with gratitude and 
thanks to them. We rejoice that the Latter-day Saints are coming 
into their own. 

It fell to my lot after this dedication to travel to Los Angeles with 
over one hundred of the men who had the privilege of being on this 
excursion, and they were universally pleased with what they had seen. 
They spoke in the highest terms of the very splendid singing of our 
choir at Kanab, of the wonderful singing of our choir at Cedar City, 
and of the very fine singing of our Sunday School children at Kanab. 
They also spoke of the healthy, fine looking children and of the fine 
young men and the fine young ladies that they met on this trip, and 
I rejoiced in it. 

I forgot to say in speaking of dedicating meetinghouses that I 
had the pleasure of getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning at the Grand 
Canyon and driving to Kanab where I arranged for the Sunday School 
to stay in session so that the visitors might meet them and that the 
children might sing a song for them. I also remained there for the 
afternoon meeting and dedicated the Kanab meetinghouse. These 
gentlemen were favorably impressed indeed with such a splendid meet- 
inghouse in such a small town as Kanab. Several of them announced 
to me in Los Angeles and also in San Francisco, (as I had to go up 
there for a couple of days on business) that one of the outstanding 
things with which they were more pleased than anything else in making 
this trip to Southern Utah, was to become better acquainted with the 
Mormon people, with their aims, their objects and their accomplish- 
ments. Several said to me : "Mr. Grant, we have never seen anything 
but unfavorable notices regarding your people in magazines and news- 
papers." More than one of them said: "I am convinced that you 
will now have a couple of hundred non-Mormon missionaries sounding 
the praises of the Latter-day Saints and of the fine class of children, 
young men and young women and citizens generally that you have ir 
your state." 

I am very grateful, indeed, for the wonderful expenditure of money 
by the government of the United States, and by the Union Pacific Rail- 
road of over $700,000 in building a magnificent lodge on the rim of 
the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. It is an architectural dream. 

THE LORD'S PROMISES TO BE FULFILLED 

There is nothing that I am about to say that I have not said many 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

times to the Latter-day Saints. We find in the very first revelation in 
the Doctrine and Covenants these words : 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the pro- 
phecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself ; and 
though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but 
shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, 
it is the same." 

I wish that I possessed the power to impress upon the hearts and 
the minds of the Latter-day Saints the necessity of becoming familiar 
with the commandments contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
not only becoming familiar with them, but that I might have the power 
to impress upon their hearts and souls a determination to keep those 
commandments, to live them in very deed and in their every-day lives. 

We find recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that "there is a 
law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, 
upon which all blessings are predicated — and when we obtain any bless- 
ing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated." 

BLESSINGS PREDICATED UPON OBSERVANCE OF WORD OF WISDOM 

Some very wonderful promises are made to us if we observe the 
Word of Wisdom. The blessings will come if we observe the Word of 
Wisdom, and they will not come unless we do observe it. I feel at the 
present time that it is very appropriate for all Latter-day Saints to have 
their attention called (although I have called their attention to it time 
and time again) to this marvelous and remarkable Word of Wisdom. I 
shall not take the time to read but very little of it: 

"To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation 
and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the 
temporal salvation of all saints in the last days." 

Nearly 90 per cent of all the time of the saints is spent in laboring 
for their temporal advancement, and I have announced before and I 
announce again that if the Latter-day Saints had observed the Word of 
Wisdom as a people, every one of them, from the day that they came 
into these valleys, our temporal salvation would have been assured. 
The money expended for those things which the Lord says are not good 
for us, which we have been taught to leave alone — namely, tea, coffee, 
tobacco and liquor — if every dollar of that money had been kept in our 
country we would have had one of the wealthiest states in this Union, 
and more of the circulating medium, namely, the hard coin, so to speak, 
than most any state in this western part of America. 

It is estimated that every single dollar circulates around like the 
blood in the body of a man, being the vital circulating medium. Every 
dollar does one hundred dollars' worth of work in a year, and when 
you stop to think of the hundreds and thousands of dollars, running 
up I am sure at the present time perhaps to nearly a million dollars a 
year, that go out of this state by the breaking of the Word of Wisdom,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



certainly if we desire our temporal salvation and if we have faith in the 
words of God, every word of which he says shall be fulfilled, we should 
keep this law. The Lord has not made this an absolute commandment, 
but when our Heavenly Father, the one to whom we owe our lives and 
all that we possess and all our allegiance, desires us to do a thing, it 
seems to me that we as Latter-day Saints should do that thing more 
willingly even than though it come as an absolute command to us. 

To my mind the most remarkable promise that any man can have 
is contained in this revelation : 

"And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow 
to their bones; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures." 

Health is one of the first great blessings of God to man, and 
second only to health is wisdom. These two great blessings are promised 
to every man, woman and child in the Church of Christ that obeys the 
Word of Wisdom. 

"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

And I honestly believe that but for obeying the Word of Wisdom, 
when I was operated upon and the doctors said that blood poisoning 
in the third and last stage had set in, that I had to die — if I had not 
been an observer of the Word of Wisdom, so that the blood in my 
veins was pure and could overcome the poison, I would not be standing 
here before you, but more than thirty years ago my time would have 
come to pass from this life. 

INFLUENCE OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

We hear a good deal of talk and complaint about the influence of 
the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the 
domination of the people by those who preside over them. I want to 
read, more particularly for the benefit of those not of our faith, a 
revelation of Almighty God to Joseph Smith, when he was in Liberty 
jail, (and at one time when he was in that jail he was in chains ,which 
shows that even the chains of the wicked could not restrain God from 
giving his word to the prophet whom he had raised up to establish the 
gospel of Jesus Christ in these last days). Speaking of the calling of 
the priesthood, he said : 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

"Because their hearts are set so [much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably .Connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven ca.nnot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they rnay be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we undertake 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control 
or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree 
of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves ; the Spirit of the 
Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the 
authority of that man. 

"Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, 
to persecute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

"We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of 
almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will 
immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen." 

This is the part I wish to emphasize : 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and 
by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost ; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou 
hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household 
of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly ; then shall thy con- 
fidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine of the priesthood 
shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an un- 
changing scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without ccffnpulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
forever and ever." 

Is it a terrible thing to exercise the priesthood of the living God 
in the way that the Lord prescribes : "By kindness and gentleness" ? 
That is the only way, and unless it is exercised in that way, Amen 
to the priesthood and authority of those who hold this priesthood in 
the Church of Christ. 

COUNSEL REGARDING VOTING 

It has been whispered around frequently, and I hear the murmur 
now, that the Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ, standing at 
the head and holding the priesthood, desire this man or that man or 
the other man elected to office. The Presidency of the Church so far 
as they are concerned, allow every man, woman and child, that is old 
enough to vote, to vote according to his or her own conviction. But 
we do appeal to all men and women, realizing the responsibility resting 
upon them, to seek God our Heavenly Father to guide them politically 
as well as religiously, and to stand for right and for those things that 
are for the good of this nation. The Latter-day Saints believe absolutely 
that the Constitution of our country was written by inspired men. We 
believe in upholding the laws of our country. We believe in being 
obedient to the laws. One of the Articles of our Faith says that it 
is our duty to do so.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BELIEF REGARDING GOVERNMENTS AND LAWS 

I am going to read a declaration of the belief of our Church 
regarding the governments and laws, issued by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in August, 1835 : 

"We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of 
man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both 
in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society. 

"We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are 
framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of 
conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life. 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and 
.magistrates to enforce the laws of the same ; and that such as will administer 
the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of 
the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. 

"We believe that religion is instituted of God ; and that men are amenable to 
him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt 
them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others ; but we do not believe 
that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind 
the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion : that 
the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience ; should 
punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul. 

"We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective 
governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and in- 
alienable rights by the laws of such governments ; and that sedition and rebellion 
are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly ; 
and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments 
are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, 
holding sacred the freedom of conscience. 

"We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and 
magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the 
punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and deference, 
as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; 
human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as 
individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of 
heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both 
to be answered by man to his Maker. 

"We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are 
bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of 
their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to 
deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long 
as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions 
do not justify sedition nor conspiracy. 

"We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to 
the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach 
of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their 
criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that govern- 
ment in which the offense is committed ; and for the public peace and tranquility 
all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against 
good laws to punishment." 

I would like to emphasize that: 

"All men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders 
against good laws to punishment." 

"We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government." 

I wish to emphasize that: "We do not believe it just to mingle 
religious influence with civil government." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

—"whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its 
spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied. 

"We believe fjhat all religious societies have a right to deal with their 
members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such 
societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but 
we do not believe that any religious society; has authority to try men on the 
right of property or life, or take from them this world's goods, or to put them 
in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon 
them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw 
from them their fellowship." 

SENTIMENTS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN 

In closing I wish to read a few words that I have read many 
times, (and I wish that we would get these words in our hearts and in 
our minds) from that great and wonderful man, Abraham Lincoln, 
who all Latter-day Saints believe firmly was raised up and inspired of 
God Almighty, and that he reached the presidency of the United States 
under the favor of our Heavenly Father, defeating Stephen A. Douglas, 
and fulfilling a prediction made by Joseph Smith to Stephen A. Douglas 
when he was an obscure country judge in Illinois. 

Lincoln said : 

"Let the people know the truth, and the country is safe." 
"Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we will succeed." 
"Let us dare to do our duty as we understand it." 

"Bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible; still while 
they continue in force for the sake of example, they should be religiously 
observed." 

Notice the language — "religiously observed." 

"Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his 
posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate, in the least 
particular, the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. 
As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws, let every American 
pledge his life, his property and his sacred honor. Let every mail remember that 
to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the 
charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the law be 
breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her 
lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries and in colleges. Let it be 
written in primers, in spelling books and almanacs. Let it be preached from 
the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls and enforced in courts of justice. In 
short let it become the political religion of the nation." 

Above all, let it become the religion of the Latter-day Saints. 
Why? Because it is in absolute and perfect harmony with the word of 
the living God to us in the revelations, every word of which, according 
to God, shall be fulfilled. 

May God bless each and every one of you. May every soul within 
the sound of my voice or who may be listening in over the radio, who 
has received a testimony of the work in which you and I are engaged, 
who is able to testify that he or she knows that God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living 
God — may we each and all who have this knowledge live the gospel and

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



set an example before all men of integrity and devotion to God and the 
laws of our country, that will preach the truth, which is of far more 
value than all the words that we can utter, is my humble prayer, and 
I ask it in the name of Jesus our Savior and Redeemer. Amen. 

Professor Charles Kent sang a sacred solo, "Consider the lilies." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, that another oppor- 
tunity is afforded us to meet together in general conference, in peace 
and enjoying the degree of prosperity with which we are blessed, as 
set forth in the report which has been made by President Grant. As a 
preface to the brief remarks which I desire to make — and I pray that 
what I say may be directed through your faith by the Spirit of the Lord 
— I desire to read from the words of the Prophet Jeremiah : 

"Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old 
oaths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your 
souls. But they said, We will inot walk therein. 

"Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. 
But they said, We will not hearken. 

"Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among 
them. 

"Hear, O earth : behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit 
of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my 
law, but rejected it." 

According to our chronology, my brethren and sisters, more than 
two thousand years have passed since the Lord, through his servant 
Jeremiah, delivered this message to the House of Israel. Preceding 
the paragraphs which I have read, the Lord says : 

"To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, 
their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken : behold, the word of the 
Lord is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it. * * * 

"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they 
were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush." 

REFUSED TO LISTEN 

At the time to which this scripture refers, the Israelitish people, 
after their deliverance from the Egyptian captivity, after the Lord 
by the matchless power of his outstretched arm had given them full 
possession of the Promised Land, had become indifferent to the words 
of their prophets, had departed from the path which the Lord had 
marked out for them, and the prophet calls them back to the old paths 
which is the good way. The promise is that if they will walk therein they 
shall find peace to their souls; but they said: "We will not walk 
therein." When the watchmen whom the Lord had set over them 
sounded the trumpet of alarm, they refused to listen. This attitude 
resulted in the scattering of the House of Israel to the four winds of 
heaven, as his prophets had declared that they would be scattered. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



13 



Thank the Lord that as the scattering of Israel had been declared so 
did the Lord definitely promise that they should be gathered again and 
restored to the promised land, and the fulfilment of that promise is 
near at hand. 

I have been asking myself the question recently : Aren't we at the 
present time in a condition somewhat similar to that of Ancient Israel 
at the time to which this scripture refers? From a small number of 
people at the time they left Palestine and went into Egypt they had 
become a great kingdom, the influence of which under the reign of King 
Solomon was felt throughout the then known world. The conditions 
with which they were surrounded during their early development had 
changed. They felt the strength of their own power, and depended 
less upon the arm of the Lord. The old paths had been replaced by 
modern roads, broader and more easy to follow. They had listened 
to the blast of the trumpet until the sound had become monotonous. 
They preferred the timbrel and the harp which brought pleasure without 
restraint. The word of the Lord to them had become obsolete, sup- 
planted by more modern theories. Are we aware — and when I say "we" 
I am not applying my remarks to the members of my own Church alone, 
but to the splendid men and women who make up the citizenship of 
the United States — that we too live in a land of promise, that it is 
through the grace and mercy of God our Father that we have been 
brought here and made participants in its privileges and blessings? 
Do we people of America know that certain unchangeable decrees of 
God our Heavenly Father apply to this land as they apply to Palestine ? 
Let us examine and see. 

A CHOICE LAND 

According to the manner in which we count time, it was four 
thousand and forty-six years ago, about two hundred years after the 
deluge, that a small number of people under the leadership of inspired 
men, left the city of Babylon on the banks of the Euphrates river in 
the valleys of Mesopotamia and found their way to the American con- 
tinent. As they started on their long pilgrimage, the word of the Lord 
came to them as follows : 

"And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the 
wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of 
promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had 
preserved for a righteous people. 

"And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, 
should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the 
fulness of his wrath should come upon them. 

"And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is 
a land of promise ; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or 
they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. 
And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. 

"For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands ; wherefore 
he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the 
children of the land, that they are swept off. 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of 
God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness 
come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon 
you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall 
be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under 
heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who 
hath been manifested by the things which we have written." 

It would be interesting, my brethren and sisters, and instructive, to 
follow this colony of people in their migration from the Old World 
until their arrival in America, the land which the Lord had promised 
to them for an inheritance. 

The story of their development into a great nation is told, the 
building of many cities ; how they departed from the way of the Lord 
to the worship of idols, the wars which ensued, because of conflict for 
the control of the government which was established,' and their final 
destruction as a nation ; but time will not permit. 

More than one thousand five hundred years had elapsed since the 
people referred to had departed from the old world, when another 
colony, under the leadership of another prophet, left Jerusalem during 
the reign of Zedekiah, the last king of Judea, and after many wander- 
ings and tribulations they crossed the great waters and came to America. 
As they landed upon this continent the Lord, through his prophet, 
delivered the following message to them. I read this because I desire 
that you shall hear it as it is and understand it. The prophet who had 
led them out, in referring to their journeys, said : 

BLESSED UNTO THE RIGHTEOUS 

"Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land 
vi hich is choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted 
with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath 
covenanted this land unto me and to my children forever, and also all those 
who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which 
is in me, that there shall none come unto this land save they shall be brought 
by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And 
if it so be that they shall serve him according to the com'mandments which he 
hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them ; wherefore, they shall never 
be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if 
iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the 
righteous it shall be blessed forever." 

As these latter people penetrated and explored the land to which 
they had come they report that they found a portion of the surface of 
it covered with the bones of men and animals, with the ruins of great 
cities and buildings, a land which they say had been populated by a 
people as numerous as the hosts of Israel. This was all that remained 
of the colony which had come from Babylon more than one thousand 
five hundred years before. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS

PROPHECY FULFILLED 

The history of this latter people, who also became numerous and 
highly civilized, was not less tragic than that of . their predecessors. 
They too were highly favored of the Lord. In their weakness they 
served him and kept his commandments, but when through his pro- 
tection and blessing they had become wealthy and powerful they turned 
from him to the worship of idols, and refused to walk in the old paths 
or listen to the trumpet which called them back to God. They fought 
over the control of government until they degenerated into the tribal 
conditions in which they were found when Columbus landed upon the 
shores of the new world. 

The time had arrived when the Lord would again bring people to 
this continent, when he was to again undertake the establishment of 
a righteous nation upon this promised land. 

More than two thousand years before Columbus landed at San 
Salvador, prophets had definitely declared his coming; more than two 
thousand years before the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth the 
Lord had declared that they should come that they might be free 
from the bonds of religious intolerance and the shackles of kingcraft, 
that a nation of free men might be established here, a nation over which 
neither kingcraft nor priestcraft shall ever reign ; a nation where the 
majesty and authority of the law, which God our Father would inspire 
the people themselves to enact and administer, is to reign supreme. 

OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 

Have you ever thought, my brethren and sisters, of the miracle 
of the establishment of this government, and the blessings which 
you enjoy under it as compared with other people? The Lord did 
not give the dominance of the United States to a certain race, that 
the traditions, language and prejudices of the old world might be 
established here as they were in all of the great country to the south of us. 

To the devoted faith of the Puritan separatists of New England 
was added the industry and patriotism of the Dutch reformers who 
had settled at New York, the gallantry and chivalry of the English 
cavaliers of Virginia, and the light-hearted energy and patriotism of 
the French at New Orleans. Protestants, Catholics and people without 
church affiliations united together, just the combination of elements 
to give us the Declaration of Independence which won our freedom, 
and the Constitution, which is the foundation upon which our system 
of government rests. 

These men, whom the old world referred to as a mob, declared 
that in this country all men should be equal before the law. They 
declared that men were born with certain rights which could noft in 
justice be taken from them, among which was the right to worship 
God according to the dictates of conscience, or not worship at all if 
they so desired ; that all men were entitled to life, to liberty, the pos- 



If, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



session of property, freedom of speech and the press, and above all and 
most important, that they should enact and administer their own laws 
and that they should not be deprived of any of these privileges without 
due process of law. The most sacred privilege granted us was the 
right of franchise by which every citizen was entitled to cast his 
ballot for the men who were to represent him in enacting and ad- 
ministering the law. It is upon the proper use of this sacred heritage, 
bequeathed to us by our fathers, that the perpetuity of our government 
depends. It may declare war or maintain peace, it may bring peace and 
good order to society, or tribulation, confusion and final dissolution. 
It controls your property and mine. We come or go at its behest. 
Our very life depends upon the proper use of it. 

A PUBLISHED APPEAL 

In January of the present year the Presidency of the Church 
published an appeal to the members of the Church throughout the 
world, and to liberty-loving people everywhere, from which I desire 
briefly to read. It was headed: "Can This Be True?" 

"Can it be possible that reports which reach us concerning the lawlessness, 
immorality and graft which are said to exist in Salt Lake City and other 
localities in our state, are true? 

"Have we among our judges, attorneys and peace officers those who regard 
these iniquitous offenses against society with apathy and indifference? 

"Are we to believe that in this community of ours large sums of money are 
regularly collected which are disbursed by trusted agents among city, county, 
state or federal officers, who have been appointed or elected by the voice of 
the people to hunt down, prosecute and rid the community of lawless disturbers 
of the peace, violate the trust reposed in them, and for money seek means by 
which these criminals may be liberated, rather than convicted? 

"Do men with brazen effrontery perjure themselves while on the witness 
stand, in order that the law may be nullified and the guilty go free? Do any of 
our judges, knowing this, allow the perjurer to go without rebuke or punishment? 

"Are we losing our high ideals regarding the honor of men and the virtue 
of women? Do we ignore the existence of houses of prostitution and assignation 
into which virtuous women and innocent girls are being lured, or forcibly taken, 
to be ruined by wicked licentious libertines both white and black? 

"Laws which are enacted for the protection of society have no value except 
when they are administered in righteousness and justice, and they cannot be 
so administrated if dishonest men occupy administrative offices. 

"The Lord says : 'When the wicked rule, the people mourn.' Wise men, 
good men, patriotic men are to be found in all communities, in all political 
parties, among all creeds. None but such men should be chosen. * * * 

"Without beneficent laws, righteously administered, the foundations of 
civilization crumble, anarchy reigns, decay and dissolution follow. 

"We call upon all members of the Church of Jesus Christ .of Latter-day 
Saints throughout the world to honor the laws of God, and obey and uphold 
the law of the land ; and we appeal to good men and women everywhere, re- 
gardless of creed, party affiliation, race or condition, to join with us in an effort 
to put into operation the words of Lincoln, the great emancipator, that our 
country may continue to be a light to the world, a loyal, law-abiding, God-fearing 
Nation.

First Presidency,"

HAVE NOT CHANGED 

Since the publication of that which I have just read it would appear 
that conditions have not changed for the better. 

Another period has arrived when the people of the United States 
are td elect men who are to represent them in both legislative and 
administrative branches of the government, both state and national; a 
time when the citizenship of our country are to exercise this divine right 
of franchise. If reports which come to us are true, vast sums of money 
are being collected to be used for the purpose of influencing the voto 
of the people in favor of one or the other of the great parties that are 
striving for the control of government. We are told that the expend- 
itures will be limited to eight millions of dollars. We are also informed 
that this limit may be greatly exceeded. Can it be possible that we have 
reached a point in our history when the ballot, this sacred heritage which 
has come to us from our fathers, has become a thing of barter and 
trade, that it can be purchased with money? Are the liberties of the 
American people on the auction block to be sold to the highest bidder ? 
Have we lifted up a golden calf (as ancient Israel did) to which the 
American people are commanded to bow down in worship ? God forbid. 

To my mind the man who would sell his vote for money should 
forfeit his franchise forever. Is the man who sells his vote less guilty 
than the man who tenders money for it? Is he who tenders money 
less guilty than the individual who, having knowledge of the crime, 
enters no word of protest? I cannot shift the responsibility from one to 
the other. All are equally guilty. 

Is it possible that during the last ten years lawlessness has in- 
creased in the United States until statistics show that we are the most 
lawless civilized nation in the world ? Only yesterday the public press, 
our own press, declared that a large number of policemen in the city 
of Philadelphia, "the City of Friends," a city established under the 
religious impulses of one of the most devout sects of the world, the city 
of my mother's birth, the city that provided the men Under whom my 
early life was tutored, that these policemen, chosen to protect the people 
from the acts of lawless men, are under arrest charged with levying 
tribute on gangsters of the underworld for protection guaranteed them 
by the police who were under oath to bring them to justice. From the 
halls of Congress to the town constable fraud in public life has found 
its way. 

CONDITION NOT HOPELESS 

Do not understand me to infer that the condition of our country 
is hopeless, or that money has not its place in human welfare. My 
remarks have no application to the high-minded, honest, capable men 
who are engaged in public life, and there are many of them in both 
national and state affairs. I believe in the soul of the American people 
and that they will rise in their majesty when the truth becomes known 
and drive dishonest men from the temples of justice, Lincoln said: 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Let the people know the truth and the country is safe." The trouble 
is that it is almost impossible to get the truth before the people. 

In every state in the Union, in every county in these states, there 
are men who live above this criticism, patriotic, true Americans. 

Do not understand that I decry or under-estimate the vast good 
that comes to humankind from the use of money and the proper ac- 
quisition of it through industry and economy, but when it is used to 
corrupt the politics of our country, to purchase the honor of men, the 
virtue of women, or to interfere with and influence the public mind 
away from the paths of justice and righteousness it then becomes the 
"root of all evil." 

I would not for earthly gain alienate the friendship of the many 
friends which I have and through acquaintance with whom my life has 
been enriched. They are among Catholics, Protestants, Jews and 
people professing no affiliation with the church. They are in all 
political parties ; men whom I love because of their manhood and 
Americanism. I am not talking politics. I have no candidate, no 
political interests at stake. I am speaking directly to the people of the 
Church of which I am a member. It is my duty, as a shepherd of the 
flock of Christ, to warn them of the danger which threatens; and if 
I fail in my duty and the danger comes upon them and they perish, the 
Lord has said that he will require their blood at my hands, and at the 
hands of every other shepherd of the flock, who, knowing his duty, 
fails to perform it. 

THE MORMON PIONEERS 

It was the impulse of religion that brought the iMormon pioneers 
to these valleys. Among them my early life was passed. It was their 
example and teaching which fixed in my mind the ideals that have 
governed my life, in both religious and civil affairs. They taught me 
that an office-seeker, whether for political or church advancement, was 
a dangerous man. They taught me that offices of trust should seek the 
man and not the man the office; that men of unquestioned integrity 
should be selected for public trust. 

Profoundly religious, they taught me to hold in reverential respect 
the religion of other people. They taught me that the institutions of 
my country were of greater value than human life, and should be 
upheld and defended against all enemies, be they foreign or domestic. 
They were not egotists, these men among whom my youth was spent, 
whose life was confined to their own restricted environment; they 
understood the past, they lived for the present and saw the future. 
They knew that other men found the Lord, if they sought him, just as 
they found him here in the solitudes of these everlasting hills. They 
were not Pharisees who magnified the faults of others while blind to, 
their own imperfections, but men who acknowledging their own weak- 
nesses, spread the mantle of charity over those of their fellows. They 
were not men who sought the downfall of their neighbor that they might 
rise to greater heights, but just brave, God-fearing men who knew that 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



19 



the Lord was knocking at the doors of the hearts of all men, and that 
if they would only keep the latchstring on the outside, as it always 
hung on their cabin doors, the Lord would come in and bring peace to 
their souls. They were men who walked in the old paths, the paths 
which our Lord and Master had marked out for us, and which, if we 
follow them, will lead us back into his presence. 

TO THOSE OLD PATHS 

It is to these old paths, my brethren and sisters, that I call you 
back ; not to endure the hardships which they endured ; not to cut the 
grain which grows in your fields, with a sickle, and to thrash it with 
a flail, as I have done ; not to cut the hay which grows in your meadows, 
with a scythe, not to study your lessons by a tallow dip or a pine 
knot, as I have done, because there was nothing better to be had ; not to 
print your daily paper on a handpress, or travel to conference with an 
ox-team, as many of your fathers and grandfathers did. Progress and 
development which have come to the world during our life-time have 
made these things obsolete, and we do not desire to call them back. 
But the truth does not change with time. It is always the same. The 
same obligations of righteousness, justice, mercy and charity which have 
been in force from the beginning are still in force. There is no other 
path that will lead us back to Christ our Lord, for he is the light, the 
life and the way, and it is his word that I have quoted to you. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, you who familiarize yourselves with 
existing conditions know that I have not exaggerated or ever-estimated 
the danger which threatens us. The cure is so simple and so easy, it 
is strange that we do not readily find it — just to return to obedience 
to the word of the Lord, just to walk in those old paths of righteousness 
that never change. If we do so they will lead us back into the presence 
of God our Father, where we will be crowned with glory, immortality 
and eternal life. 

I pray for this, for you, for myself and for all good men and 
women, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

It is always a refreshing sight to witness the large congregation of 
Latter-day Saints who regularly attend these conferences — men and 
women who come filled with a determination to serve the Lord and to 
help build up his kingdom ; who know in their souls that the Lord 
has spoken in these last days through his servants, that he has revealed 
his will through the ministration of holy angels, heavenly beings, and 
that he has established his priesthood in the Church with divine au- 
thority to give guidance to the people. 

I endorse most heartily the remarks of our President, Heber J. 
Grant and President Anthony W. Ivins. They are for our benefit and 
our blessing if we will follow them. I am always glad to report that the 
Church is growing, that it is increasing in numbers ; and I believe that 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we as a people are increasing in faith. We have heard from the Pres- 
ident as to the good work you are performing in the building of meeting- 
houses and the amount of tithing of the Church that has been con- 
tributed for that purpose. A people no more numerous, no more 
rich than we are, who will contribute more than two million dollars 
a year for the building of meetinghouses have a whole lot of good in 
them. The Latter-day Saints believe their religion after all. We do 
not practice it as we should. We are not perfect by any manner of 
means. But we and our fathers before us are of those who have listened 
to the voice of the Spirit and are really converted to the truth. 

A MORE LIBERAL FEELING 

During the last week or two I have been away in the Northwestern 
States mission, visiting with President Sloan, and I have noted with 
great pleasure the growth and development of the work in that section of 
the country. I have noted, too, the growth of a more liberal feeling 
among the people towards the Latter-day Saints. I might almost say 
-here is a spiritual awakening; for in Idaho the governor of the state 
and other officials in their remarks, made plainly manifest that they 
desire spiritual thought, spiritual teaching, in connection with their 
schools and colleges. They said that these things were lacking and they 
were glad to see that in that state our Church was fostering spiritual 
development, spiritual thought. Not only is it true in that section of 
our land, but I think it is true in all sections of it. People are beginning 
to learn after all that the material alone is not sufficient, and that 
they must turn unto God. 

As we have heard, the Lord has declared that the people, if they 
are to be maintained on this land, must be a people who will serve the 
God of the land, who is Jesus Christ. And I believe that slowly and 
gradually there is a more liberal spirit growing among the people, with 
an inclination in their hearts towards the things of God. The Lord 
will bring testimonies which will foster this feeling. After the testimony 
of the servants of God comes the testimony of earthquakes, the testi- 
mony of the sea, heaving beyond its bounds, through perhaps the force 
of terrific winds ; the testimony of destruction here and there. These I 
believe will be more manifest and will more and more bring the people 
to a realization that they of themselves are powerless, and that they 
must depend as a people and as a nation upon God. 

NOT SO FAVORABLE 

We are delighted to know that neighbors feel so well towards us. 
But I want to remark here, my brethren and sisters, that they have 
told us things not quite so favorable, even material things. They go 
around through our country (and there will be tens and hundreds of 
thousands of tourists in the next few years, traveling all over our 
country, north and south) and they see in some of our villages and 
towns the poorest kind of fences, the worst gardens, decaying orchards 
and an abundance of weeds, which they ought not to see at all. We 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 21 



should improve and beautify Zion, so that people can say that the 
Latter-day Saints are forward-looking, up-to-date people; and that they 
have their homes, their gardens, their fences, their orchards and all 
pertaining to them as spick and span as you could find anywhere in 
the country. That ought to be, but it is not so yet. Therefore, you 
sisters, get after your husbands to take up or to do away with the old 
pole fences and put something else there that looks a little more re- 
spectable and modern. 

THE CALL FOR MISSIONARIES 

The favorable sentiment prevailing throughout the country con- 
cerning the Latter-day Saints calls for more missionaries. Mission- 
aries are wanted everywhere. You bishops of wards and presidents of 
stakes, do you hear me? All over the Church the call is to you for 
missionaries and still more missionaries. Write it down and do not 
forget it. 

DREAM MINES 

'We have letters coming to us in the President's office concerning 
mining and mines, and among others, "dream" mines. Too many of 
our people, after thirty or forty years experience, are still foolish 
enough to invest money in "dream" mines. If there is any man here 
or anywhere who will tell me that a "dream" mine has ever made 
money or is a success financially I would like to be informed of it. I 
have never heard of it. 

SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY 

So our advice to our people now, as it always has been, is to spend 
your money wisely, not foolishly. Build up and beautify the country; 
beautify your homes. Spend your 'money where you know it is going 
to do some good. But mining, as President Young said in his time, 
is for those who understand it. Of course mining is good business. 
We need the metals, gold, silver, iron — they are all good. But if you 
have a farm, you tend to your farm. If you are in the dairy business 
attend to that. Build that up. Do not go speculating in something 
that you know nothing about ; you are apt to lose your money every 
time. I speak from experience, for I have lost some myself, though 
not much ; I was rather cautious, being born Scotch, and did not 
venture too much. But I lost what I did venture in mining. 

I remember talking to Philo Farnsworth at least forty years ago, 
he was a successful mining man at that time ; and I said : 

"Philo, I am thinking of investing in a mine out at Baker City 
^ where I was then living) ; what do you think about it?" I told him 
of the kind of mine it was represented to be. 

He said, "Well, if you want to gamble, it is all right. But if you 
really want to gamble find a faro game. There are only fifty-two cards 
in a deck, so that in a faro game you have one chance in fifty-two, 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



because you might hit the right card and there are only fifty-two of 
them. But in the mining game you have one chance in a hundred." 

I took his advice and stayed out of mining. And so, I repeat, let 
mining or other business that we know nothing about alone, and espe- 
cially "dream" mines. It is simply a wild dream, and you had better 
let it alone. 

PEACE IS COMING 

The winter is coming on, my brethren and sisters. Always we 
have men out of employment. Let me call the attention of the bishops 
of wards and presidents of stakes, the leading men of means in the 
communities, to the importance of trying to provide employment in all 
your settlements, towns and cities, to help those who are out of em- 
ployment. Provide work for them if you can. If each one would try 
to help his neighbor a little, help his brother, we would be a better 
community and there would be more satisfaction and peace in it. That 
struggle for peace down through all the ages, which has been sung 
about, prayed about and prophesied about, is coming still. The world 
is getting nearer to the millennium. There may be terrible catastrophies, 
terrible judgments, wonderful things coming upon the earth after the 
testimony of the elders ; but peace also is coming. Our nation is striving 
for it. Other nations of the earth are signing up contracts, which may 
not amount to so much now, but it is all in the direction of peace, and 
I believe that the time will actually come when men will beat their 
swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruninghooks, and 
nation will not take up war against nation, neither will they learn 
war any more. That time is coming, that blessed time that Burns, the 
poet, 150 years ago sang of when he wrote: 

"Then let us pray that come it may 

As come it will for a' that — 
* * * * * 

That Man to Man, the world o'er, 
Shall brothers be for a' that !" 

Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "High On the Mountain Top.' 
The benediction was offered by Elder Joseph F. Merrill, Superin- 
tendent of Church Schools. 

The conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting was opened promptly at 2 o'clock p. m. by President 
Heber J. Grant, who announced that the congregation would sing the 
hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Nathan Ricks. 

A solo was sung by Mrs. Mamie Stark, "My faith looks up to Thee." 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON 



23 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON 

Former President of the Swiss and German Mission 

It will not be possible, my brethren and sisters, to describe my 
feelings in being called thus suddenly to address this vast congregation. 
I sincerely pray that the Lord will illuminate my mind while I occupy 
this position. 

As President Grant stated, I have returned rather recently from 
presiding over the Swiss and German Mission. I can report conditions 
in that field as being very favorable. It is true the people are not flocking 
to the Church in such great numbers as came during the distressing 
years immediately succeeding the war, but still we are making very 
satisfactory headway there, and the members of the Church are faithful. 
I think it would not be possible to find anywhere a body of saints who 
are more exact in the payment of their tithes and offerings than are 
the Swiss and German people. It would not be easy nor perhaps 
possible to find a people who are more willing to contribute to the 
missionaries. Some of the things which we see there are extremely 
touching. My heart has been made to rejoice, and still it has caused 
a feeling of humility to come over me, when I have witnessed what 
our members and friends are willing to do for those who come into 
their midst to preach the gospel. It is not an uncommon thing for 
members of the Church to share their last crust of bread with the 
missionaries. I have known of cases where men and women have sat 
up all night in chairs so that the elders might have a comfortable bed 
in which to sleep. That spirit is broadcast among the German-speaking 
people, both in the Swiss-German and in the German-Austrian missions ; 
and when we see their fidelity, their faith, their willingness to do for 
us, naturally it is a spur to our missionaries to do the very best they 
can. 

The elders laboring in those fields are sincerely anxious to spread 
the gospel truth. I have been impressed with the quality of our repre- 
sentatives who have come out into the world. Of course I am better 
acquainted with those who have come to the particular field where I 
presided. They proved to be a very faithful and devoted band of breth- 
ren, willing to give their all for the advancement of truth. In my 
opinion there is a noticeable improvement in the quality of missionaries 
now going into the field, and this thought has impressed me very deeply : 
the better educated the missionary is, speaking generally, the more 
faith he has. We have had quite a number of men in the field who 
were college graduates, men who have taken their degrees from the 
Universities of the State and of the Church, and those men, I can say, 
without an exception, were unusual missionaries. It was from their 
ranks very largely that district presidents were chosen. Naturally this 
was not always the case, because sometimes, while they had the educa- 
tion, they did not have the gift of handling men as did some others who 
had not made quite so much progress along scholastic lines. But 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those who had taken their college degrees were a very fine body of 
brethren. So I have come home prepared to recommend to all our 
young boys that so far as possible they should finish their university 
work, though not necessarily before they go on missions. Sometimes it 
fits into the scheme of things better if they go before they have finished, 
but I think our young men should have the ambition to graduate from 
our universities, or at least go as far in educational lines as it is 
possible for them to go. 

I am impressed, as has already been said, with the excellent quality 
of the men who go out, and impressed also with the sacrifice which 
their parents are willing to make in order to keep them in the field. 
I recall now a mother whose letter to her sons was shown me. It was 
my practice to write twice a year to the parents of the missionaries in 
the field. One couple had two sons there, one already a district 
president, the other subsequently to become one. I wrote complimenting 
them on the character of their sons and telling of the splendid work 
they were doing. I saw a letter from the mother written to her boys 
in which she said, "When Brother Cannon's letter came I was washing, 
I was tired, and felt as though I could not possibly face the duties that 
were upon me. But when that letter came I went into the other room 
and read it and re-read it and cried for pure joy." 

"That is a feeling which people in the world cannot understand, 
how a woman can cry with joy because she, in connection with her 
husband, has to send her sons about seventy dollars a month and be 
deprived of their association and the help which they could give on the 
farm. But she did cry and it was for pure joy. We who have had 
similar experiences can understand her feelings. All who are here 
know that her joy was genuine and real. Many cases of that kind might 
be related if time permitted. 

Our missionary boys are hedged about here at home, they are 
watched over with the utmost care as they grow to maturity. Then 
they go out into the world, many of them to countries where alcoholic 
beverages are almost as easy to obtain as water, and yet these boys 
do not drink. They are surrounded by men, and in this modern age, by 
women, very many of whom use tobacco, still these boys do not smoke. 
They come in contact with people whose moral ideals are not high, 
men and even women who do not look upon virtue and morality as we 
look upon it. They are shining marks for the dissolute, for the wicked, 
for those who would lead the servants of the Almighty astray; and 
still they remain pure and clean and come home with heads erect, able 
to look any man, any woman, any child in the face. That is the 
character of missionaries with whom it has been my privilege to labor. 

I should like to say a word or two about the missionary after 
his return. While he is in the field he is watched over by his mission 
president and by his district president. His parents, his bishop, per- 
haps the president of his stake, are writing letters to him, urging him 
to do right. They are praying for him. He is engaged in his Master's 
service. He realizes that he is no longer representing himself, but is 



BLUER HUGH J. CANNON 



25 



representing a great cause, and he feels ashamed to do things which are 
wrong. He is careful, is humble. His whole thought is concentrated 
cn righteousness and he learns to live it. Then at the end of his mission 
he is released to come home. You know what happens. The bishops, 
I am sure, do all they can to find a place for him. But it is often a 
fact that this boy who has been the biggest figure in the circle which 
he occupied, after his return, drops completely into the background, too 
frequently out of sight. I haven't any criticism to offer to the officers 
of the stakes and wards. I know from experience how difficult it is 
to find employment, either secular or in a Church capacity, for this 
army of men returning from the mission field. It is not always easy, 
sometimes not possible, to put them into positions of responsibility. 
But I do think they are deserving of all the thought and care and 
attention that we can possibly give them. There is a reaction, a relaxation, 
when they are released. Perhaps many of you know how it is to be 
engaged in active service and then all at once not have anything to do. 
You frequently have that experience right here at home. When you 
have had a difficult task to perform, a sermon to deliver perhaps, which 
weighed heavily upon your mind and frightened you, a spirit of relax- 
ation came over you when that work was done. That is the situation 
with our missionaries. 

I had a young man in the field say to me once, "If I ever get into 
serious trouble it will be on Tuesday." I was a little surprised at the 
statement and asked, "Why?" He said, "Because I am keyed up the 
latter part of the week. Knowing I have to speak on Sunday, I am 
humble and prayerful ; I plead with the Lord to help me with my work, 
that it may be done well, and then on Sunday night after that sermon 
is finished I am inclined to relax. Monday finds me completely re- 
laxed, and after Monday night or Tuesday I am the weakest that I 
am during the entire week. After Tuesday I begin to worry about 
Sunday again." 

This, in my judgment, illustrates the general condition of our re- 
turned missionaries. They are relaxed. They often feel, and of course 
improperly, that they are no longer representing a people, but are merely 
human individuals, simply units in the Church, and what they do will 
not reflect serious discredit upon the Church. That splendid and 
sustaining thought which was with them during their missions, that 
they must be true because of the Church, leaves them when they 
return home. 

I would like to suggest to parents that when your 'boys come 
home you do not feel that their feet are safely anchored to the rock 
of truth, but feel that they need your prayers just as much at home and 
perhaps more than they did in the mission field ; feel that you should 
watch over them, talk with them and plead with them just as much as 
before they went, or during the time they were absent. I may take 
an exaggerated view of this matter, but it seems to me that the returned 
missionary is one of the biggest problems the Church has before it, 
I would not infer that any large percentage of our misisonaries go 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



astray. That is not the case, but if we take time to consider the matter, 
we will see that more of them become careless after they come home, a 
far greater number, than do wrong in the mission field. The per- 
centage of those who fall into serious transgression in the mission field 
is very small, almost insignificant. Of course it is larger than it should 
be, for as long as one man goes astray the number is too large, but in 
this particular we have little cause for concern. At home, while the 
number of delinquents is not extremely large it far exceeds the de- 
linquency abroad. And so I say in behalf of the returned missionary, 
to bishops and ward and stake officers, to those who preside in quorums, 
and particularly to parents, watch the returned missionary, try to make 
him feel that there is a place for him, perhaps not a place where he can, 
preside, but that there is a place in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
here just as much as there is abroad. He comes home full of faith, 
bearing testimony that he knows this message is true, and he does 
know it. I have heard boys say that they know just as well as the 
Prophet Joseph knew, that he saw the Father and the Son. They 
do not understand the gospel as he did ; they do not comprehend its 
real significance as did the Prophet, but the knowledge of its divinity 
is theirs. So I pray for them and pray for us all, that we may under- 
stand the magnitude of this great work which is entrusted to our care, 
and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been very much interested in the remarks of this conference 
thus far, especially those referring to the Word of Wisdom and the 
training of missionaries. Last week more than sixty young men and 
women left the Missionary Home for the mission field. During one 
examination period, the Word of Wisdom was discussed, and from 
the statements made it was apparent that such teachings have had 
a guiding influence in their lives. One young lady, a mere slip of a 
girl, made this statement : "The Lord cannot work with those who are 
unclean mentally or physically." Living according to the teachings of 
the Word of Wisdom gives us a fitting background to prepare us to 
receive his blessings. I am afraid there are a great many of us who 
have not learned this one lesson ; it is not a new doctrine, but is em- 
bodied in the teachings of the Savior and the apostles of old. We read 
in I Cor. 111:16, 17, 18: 

"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God 
dwelleth in you? 

"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple 
of God is holy, which temple ye are. 

"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise 
in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise." 

If we could be so impressed with these thoughts that they would 
always be manifest in our thoughts and actions, our faith would be 
increased and our labors extended to the benefit not only of ourselves 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



27 



but our associates and fellow Church workers. Has it occurred to 
us that perhaps many blessings needful for our welfare are withheld 
from us? The Lord has commanded that we support the laws of the 
land because the constitutional laws of the land make us free. In the 
days of Kirtland, the Lord said he was not well pleased with many 
who were in the Church. 

"Were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning 
the Church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now. 

"But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I 
required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, * * * and are 
not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom." 

Are we as individuals seeking to be united as a Church ? Are we 
exemplary in our teachings by word of mouth and in our actions? 
We need only to look about us to see on every hand a tendency to break 
the Word of Wisdom. Perhaps as individuals we feel that because 
we are trying to live according to this law we are meeting the require- 
ments of the law, but to those who have received the priesthood comes 
also a responsibility of not only complying with the law as individuals 
but of laboring unceasingly with those who are careless or indifferent, 
for Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of 
the celestial kingdom. Let us remember that we are "temples of the 
living God" and that God cannot work with us when we are unclean 
mentally or physically. 

The Word of Wisdom makes this clear to us and offers a most 
wonderful promise, "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the 
weakest of all saints who are or can be called saints," and we are 
assured that through obedience we shall be made strong, mentally, 
spiritually and physically. Let us study it and so apply its principles 
in our daily lives that the influence thereof will be felt throughout the 
land. Sometimes we become impatient because the results we hoped for 
are not apparent immediately ; sometimes in our zeal we make mistakes 
of judgment — it may be in business matters, our farming operations, 
or in the conduct of our community affairs — if we are living according 
to the laws of God we shall have the spirit of discernment and under 
the guiding influence of that spirit will find that such experiences are 
as bread cast upon the water, for after many days we shall find it to be 
a blessing, "for the Spirit of God knoweth the things of God and 
the spirit of man knoweth only the things of man." When we learn as 
a Church to apply these teachings, we will overcome such difficulties, and 
happiness will be our lot; for we shall do away with fault-finding, 
contention, and indifference, and in the spirit and power of the holy 
priesthood we shall lend a helping hand to those who find it difficult to 
meet the requirements of the laws of God, especially the young men and 
women who are now living in an age of freedom, more so than in any 
other period of the world's history. The Lord never intended that they 
should not have pleasure, for "man is that he might have joy" ; that 
their enjoyment might be wholesome it is necessary that they be 
properly guarded, for "truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing jt

is for the eyes to behold the sun." We sow the seed in the spring- 
time but know not what the harvest will be in the fall ; the result is 
generally measured by the faith, the diligence, and the labor we put 
forth. This has always been the law and will be until the purposes of 
the Lord are fulfilled. A writer of the Old Testament expresses tht 
thought beautifully as follows in the 11th chapter of Ecclesiastes : 

"Cast thy bread upon the waters : for thou shalt find it after many days. 

"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand : 
for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether 
they both shall be alike good. 

"Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold 
the sun: 

"But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember 
the days of darkness ; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 

"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the 
days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of 
thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into 
judgment. 

"Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy 
flesh : for childhood and youth arc vanity." 

That we may more nearly meet these conditions a re-adjustment 
has been made in our priesthood and recreational activities. The Sab- 
bath morning — the beginning of the Sabbath Day — has been designated 
as the study and recitation period for religious exercises. During the 
Sabbath School period we should be free from cares, our labors should 
be put away and our hearts turned to the things of God. Provision is 
made that from the oldest to the youngest all may come under this 
influence ; the whole family may go in a body and find spiritual activity 
suitable to their age and condition in life, with the influence of the 
priesthood of God the controlling power. 

Tuesday night has been set aside as a time for planning and re- 
porting on priesthood, Church, and community activities. It is desirable, 
therefore, that each person holding the priesthood, whether a deacon 
or a high priest, have some specific work assigned to him each week, 
"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office 
in which he is appointed, in all diligence." 

I thank the Lord for a testimony of his Gospel, that I am per- 
mitted to labor in his great cause in authority of his holy priesthood 
which has been conferred upon me through his authorized servants. 
I rejoice in this work and in the opportunity I have of working with 
you in the furtherance of his Gospel. May we ever seek to keep his 
commandments and strive earnestly to do our part, that we may magnify 
our calling, is my prayer, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



29 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I sincerely trust, my brethren- and sisters, that I may be inspired 
by the Lord, and to that end I ask for an interest in your faith and 
prayers. 

In the missionary work in which I am engaged it is always re- 
freshing and is a very great inspiration to us to come to conference and 
to get into contact with the body of the Church and its leaders. You 
realize, my brethren and sisters, that frequently for six months at a 
time we are on the firing line. We are away from the wards and the 
stakes with their activities, and out of contact, except of course by cor- 
respondence, with the auxiliary organizations of the Church and that 
which is going on at home. Therefore, I say again it is refreshing and 
inspirational, and I think is of great benefit to the work that we are 
endeavoring to carry forward, that we should assemble with you in 
conference. I thank the Lord for this privilege. 

I feel especially thankful to the Lord today for my membership 
in this Church. I feel especially thankful to him for the assurance 
that I have in my heart that the gospel is true. I thank the Lord that 
I am not in doubt, for I find a great many people in the world in doubt 
concerning the means and the way of salvation. I wish to bear you my 
testimony that I do know that the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the 
power of God unto salvation, is restored to the earth in this day and 
age. I do know that the Lord spoke to Joseph Smith and that he 
raised him up and made of him a prophet through whom he effected 
this great restoration. 

I sense the responsibility of preaching the gospel of salvation unto 
the children of men, for as I peruse the scripture I find that it is the 
intention of the Lord that the gospel shall be preached in all the world 
for a witness unto all nations, and he has decreed that it should be 
before he should come again to earth. That responsibility rests upon 
us as a Church. Those who hold the priesthood hold it for the purpose 
of administering in the things that pertain to the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men, as well as themselves. 

I rejoice in the faithful labors of the missionaries who are sent into 
the field. It is marvelous to me as I contemplate that year after year 
we keep up the great force that we have out there ; that the brethren at 
home are able to find the young men to fill the vacancies caused by 
the release of those who are in the field. When I contemplate the 
conditions of the world today and the environments that encroach upon 
us as a Church, the evil if you please (not all that is in the world is 
good — and there are many temptations that our young folks are beset 
with in their working hours and in their school life and everywhere that 
they mingle), I marvel that out of this comparatively small body of 
people, when you come to compare it with the world at large, the Lord 
is able to select and send out that great number of young men and 
young women who are worthy to bear his name and to preach the 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



principles of the everlasting gospel to the people of the world. They 
do not all come prepared, my brethren and sisters. They are not all 
versed in the scriptures. A great deal of the teaching they have received 
at home has been along lines that do not particularly qualify them for 
preaching the gospel. But they come with faith in their hearts, they 
come with a desire to serve, and the vast majority of them come with 
a strong testimony that the gospel is true ; and they teach it from that 
standpoint. They teach it as though they know whereof they speak. 
They have faith that the principles of the gospel that they are sent to 
teach are indeed true and a means o»f salvation unto our Father's 
children. 

We have, my brethren and sisters, a message of repentance to 
declare to the world today. I rejoice in the teachings of this conference 
so far, and in the not uncertain terms in which we as a people have been 
made to know the dangers that beset our paths, and the certain call of 
repentance that has come to us. I feel that we should look things squarely 
in the face as they exist in the world today and not let ourselves sleep 
in the idea and the thought that because we are members of the Church 
we are safe, or that because we are prosperous all is well. 

I have rejoiced in the report of the President of the Church 
today regarding the great prosperity that is attending the Church, mak- 
ing possible the great building campaign that is being carried on. But 
there are other things in the Church, my brethren and sisters, that touch 
our lives and we should look to them as well, for the Savior said : 

"For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose 
his own soul?" 

And again when the disciples asked him which was the greatest in 
the kingdom of heaven, he placed a little child in their midst and said 
unto them : 

"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter 
into the kingdom of heaven." 

Become converted to what? Speaking in a large sense, converted 
to the fact that God is, that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the 
world ; converted to that extent that we can exercise an implicit faith 
in God and in the saving principles of his gospel that he has restored 
to the earth for our benefit and for our good and for our salvation. 
Specifically it means, being converted to the gospel. Are we as a 
people converted to the necessity of living the Word of Wisdom? 
Except we become converted sincerely and in the same spirit that a 
little child is converted and is humble and receives without qualification 
the teachings of his father — unless we become so converted to the Word 
of Wisdom and the principles of honesty, of justice, of brotherly 
kindness, of love and of tolerance towards all men — I fear we are still 
barring ourselves from participation in an ultimate exaltation in the 
kingdom of our Father in heaven. 

I deplore the fact that there is evil existing, but I cannot ignore it. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



31 



my brethren and sisters. This evil, thank the Lord, does not exist to 
the same extent among those who are members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ as, it exists in the world. We find unchastity, immorality, 
lack of temperance, lack of reverence for God, or for man, or for law. 
We find men imbued with the idea that all is right if they can get by 
with it. But it is not, my brethren and sisters. The Lord will not be 
mocked, and he has given us a plan which, he expects us to live up to. 
I pray to him that I may be sincere all the days of my life. The 
greatest anxiety is that I may not falter by the wayside, that my faith 
may remain firm and that my testimony may grow and be strong ; and 
after that I pray for my loved ones. I have passed through peculiar 
experiences in my life and have met sorrow by reason of having 1 
to lay away my loved ones. But as I contemplate those who have gone 
to the great beyond in their innocence I would ten thousand times 
rather that they should all go than that they should make shipwreck of 
their faith. What would it profit me if they were to gain all the wealth 
of the world or all the education in the world or all the honors of the 
world, and lose their salvation" in the kingdom of our Father in heaven ? 
It would bring to me only sorrow. 

I rejoice in the testimony that I have of the gospel and the oppor- 
tunity that has come to me to labor in the ministry for those who are 
in darkness. My heart goes out to our Father's children who are in the 
world. I do not censure them because of the conditions which I have 
explained ; I only feel sorry for them and have an overwhelming desire 
to carry to them the uplifting principles of this great gospel, and 
to carry them in such a way that my testimony might carry conviction 
to their hearts that they are true. That is the "greatest desire that I 
have in the world. 

In my ministry I have tried to imbue the young missionaries who 
are laboring with me and who have labored with me in the past, with 
this thought, that if they will take care of the work in the field and 
labor for the uplift of our Father's children they need not put in any 
time worrying about what kind of an impression they will make when 
they come home. Something has been said here today concerning the 
danger that besets the missionaries upon their return home, and the 
thought has been voiced that some provision should be made to give 
them something to do in the Church. I have tried to impress them 
with the idea that the Church is very well officered and very well 
manned, and perhaps there may be no available place for them even 
as officers in an auxiliary organization when they get home. I try to 
impress upon them the idea that the Church is very much in need of 
honest good members. No one can deprive them of being that no 
matter how little they might be called upon to do. They can labor 
zealously in keeping the commandments of the Lord. They can set 
examples worthy of imitation. They can bear their testimony to their 
fellow men. They can put themselves in a position to be useful. And 
even in the auxiliary organizations, as I have observed them in the 
little contact I have had with them, one of the crying needs is for good

membership. We are pretty well officered, but we need one hundred 
per cent good membership in all of these auxiliary organizations of the 
Church, and each missionary who goes home is qualified, if he will but 
continue in the spirit with which he has labored out there, to be a 
splendid member in any organization in the Church or in any society 
that is uplifting in the world. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to understand our duties in the 
Church and help us to perform them faithfully, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 
There comes to my mind a little couplet that I learned as a child : 

"Lord, how delightful 'tis to see, 
An whole assembly worship thee." 

We who are here this afternoon have come, I believe, with the 
desire and purpose to worship our Father in humility. No one could 
be in a meeting of this kind without being deeply impressed with the 
spirit and power that is here ; without being impressed with the counsel, 
advice, and testimony that have been given regarding the progress 
of this great Church of ours. 

I want to add a little to what my brother has said concerning those 
missionaries who return home. I called attention to this matter at 
one time when I was attending conference in a little town in Southern 
Utah, because I knew bf two cases that had happened there, those of a 
young man and a girl who had returned home. They had been busy, 
active, laboring vigorously, doing their best work at the end of their 
missions, and then came home and almost dropped out of sight. A 
bishop came to me at the close of the meeting and said: "It has never 
happened in my ward. I have been a bishop for fifteen years. Yes, 
we have had missionaries out all the time, more than the average share, 
and we are proud of that too. No boy or girl has had to go out of 
this ward to find employment, even in spiritual duties." He further 
said: "When a young man comes home, if I have time, and I find 
it mostly, I meet him at the station with his parents and get acquainted 
with him, and I invite him to see me as soon as the greetings of his 
family are over. I talk to him about his spiritual viewpoint, and his 
testimony. I inquire of him what he would like to do in the ward. 
I try to see that he gets that which he likes to do. I do not give him 
the chance to take things easy or become lazy in the Church. After that 
if anything happens that he does not get employment, then we all 
interest ourselves in him, high councilors and bishopric. We never 
rest until that young man is employed, for his spiritual growth depends 
upon his temporal well-being." I was glad to hear this. 

Yes, we are here today to be taught, to be reminded, to be en- 
couraged. I have a few thoughts concerning a somewhat old subject. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS

I labor, as you know, in the office of the Presiding Bishop, and there 
constantly is the application of the law of tithing, that great revenue 
law. So much superior to that of the world that the world would like 
to copy it. They make efforts now and again to do so. In their efforts 
they fail after a while, I notice, because they have not found the people 
who could handle their tithes. They lack that glorious revelation 
and belief in it that was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1838, 
telling the Latter-day Saints that they should pay one-tenth of their 
interest annually. 

I attended a stake conference a short time ago and listened to an 
interesting discourse on the application of the law of tithing. The 
speaker stated that a young couple had called upon a certain bishop 
and applied for temple recommends. The bishop, in a fatherly manner, 
asked them how long they had been employed at a salary. They replied 
from two to three years. Then the bishop reminded them that they 
had not paid any tithing on their earnings. This brought tears to the 
eyes of the young woman, but the young man said, somewhat defiantly, 
to his bishop : "I don't see what difference tithing makes anyhow." 
It set me thinking all the way home : does not tithing matter much any- 
how ? The law of tithing was revealed in these latter days to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, by which means are provided for the support of the 
Church. It is a voluntary offering. The obligation to pay tithing 
is a personal one and should be rigidly observed by every Latter-day 
Saint who is blessed with an income. 

I read some years ago in one of the early Journals of Discourses 
a sermon given by the late Elder Franklin D. Richards, at Logan, 
when, in urging a better observance of the law of tithing, he stated 
that every law of the gospel had its particular blessing, and that he 
had in his possession a receipt signed by the Prophet Joseph and the 
tithing clerk, which stated that "Franklin D. Richards, having paid his 
tithing in full to date, is entitled to the benefits of the baptismal font in 
the Nauvoo Temple." So it appears that in the early days of the 
Church it was necessary that those who were privileged to enter the 
house of the Lord should be full tithepayers. Without this law temples 
could not be built and maintained ; colleges and seminaries would be 
closed ; the large sum provided toward the erection of meeting-houses, 
and other buildings could not be paid; the liberal aid toward the 
support and maintenance of the stakes and wards could not be provided ; 
the missionary work of the Church would be curtailed or abandoned; 
hospitals, where hundreds of the poor of the Latter-day Saints are 
treated annually at the expense of the Church, could not continue this 
service; the poor, the aged and feeble could not be provided for. So 
I think the payment of tithing matters a great deal. Without the 
tithes the Church would be like an automobile without gas, a street 
car without electricity, a railway engine without fuel. 

Some time ago a prominent man in the state of Texas, not a 
Latter-day Saint, who sincerely believed in the payment of tithes, wrote 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to the Presiding Bishopric, asking if there were on record information 
to show how many men over the age of sixty-five, who had been con- 
sistent tithepayers, had become dependent. This information was 
secured from several stakes. Of 332 over the age of sixty-five, 274 
were and had been consistent tithepayers, and were self-supporting 
None was drawing assistance from the Church or from charity or- 
ganizations. This indicates that when a person observes the law of the 
tithe he accumulates and provides a surplus for old age and does not 
become dependent. Tithe paying will never impoverish anyone. 

There are many other benefits that will come to those who will 
observe this law. It will train men and women to be generous ; it will 
develop character ; it will strengthen our faith, for faith comes only by 
works. It will teach obedience. It will add to our testimony ; and after 
all isn't it worth something to have a testimony that the gospel has 
been restored; that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God; that the priest- 
hood has been given to men in these latter days, and that the Church of 
God has been established to bring about our Father's purposes ? 

Tithing is a debt, not a gift to the Lord. "The earth is the Lord's 
and the fulness thereof." For the use of his property he requires 
from his people 10% of all their interest annually. That 10% is not 
ours to use . Let us pay our tithing not with the expectation of an 
increase in worldly goods, but as a privilege, to help the work of the 
Lord. Let us do it cheerfully, feeling that we have been blessed with 
the privilege of helping in his great latter-day work. 

It is characteristic of most men and women to harbor good in- 
tentions, and we should always encourage good intentions and good ideals 
and purposes, but it is better to put one of these into operation than 
accumulate ten of them. The tithing one intends to pay next year, or 
the resolve to pay tithing in the future, is not nearly as good for char- 
acter building as a payment actually made. In order to avoid the 
temptation to use the Lord's money why not pay our tithing at regular 
intervals during the year, once a month or oftener if necessary. 

I appeal to my brethren and sisters to get into that habit and to 
teach our young people in our homes to observe that law in their child- 
hood and youth, and get the habit of tithe-paying. Go home with a de J 
termination that at regular intervals, not at the end of the year alone, 
we will examine and find out what we owe the Lord, and pay it. I 
have always admired the statement of the late Bishop George Romney. 
I used to receipt him for the tithes he paid into the office of the Pre- 
siding Bishop. He came in regularly every month with a good-sized 
check. He was a large tithe-payer. He said to me one day, "I do not 
know whether I could gather up enough faith to be absolutely honest 
with the Lord if I left all my tithing until tithing settlement. I might 
get into the habit of seeing how little I owe the Lord and not how 
much. So I balance up with him every month, and that is the first 
check I pay out each month." 

Three months from now the bishopric throughout the Church will 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



35 



announce the time and place for the annual tithing settlement. All 
Latter-day Saints who have some income are invited to meet in, 
privacy with the bishopric of the ward as common judges in Israel, sq 
that they may examine their tithing record and declare to the bishopric 
whether it is a full tithing or not. Thousands will accept this invitation 
and will go gladly because they have observed this law. Many others 
will go with excuses and regrets and promises to do better in the future. 

May we at this season of the year, as officers and members of the 
Church, observe the payment of our tithes and offerings, teach it in the 
quorums and classes of the priesthood, so that all the blessings which the 
Lord has promised his people through the observance of this law may 
be ours and this goodly land become sanctified and be in very deed a 
land of Zion to his people. 

I want to bear my testimony that Mormonism as it is known, is 
the work of God, that the Lord has given me a testimony that Joseph 
Smith is his prophet, that he came in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, bringing the gospel with power and authority to establish it. 
Ministering angels and glorious beings came with authority and power. 
Oh, his was a wonderful life ! As a lad of fourteen years of age he saw 
the Father and the Son ; at seventeen years of age a holy messenger came 
and told him what was expected of him ; and each year thereafter until 
he was twenty-two the same messenger saw him and admonished and 
encouraged him. Then he received the plates, and by the gift and power 
of God they were translated. When he was twenty-four years of age 
the Book of Mormon was ready for publication. The same year he 
received the visit of John the Baptist and of Peter, James, and John, 
and of others, who gave him power and authority to establish the work 
of God upon the earth. At twenty-four years of age, or a little more, 
he had by that same power and authority organized the Church of 
which we are members. At thirty years of age he dedicated the first 
temple in this last dispensation. At thirty-nine years of age he had 
paid the penalty that the world had been hungering for for years, paid, 
for his testimony with his blood. As President Brigham Young said 
at one time, "Forty-six times was he arrested, forty-six times was he 
acquitted. It cost his brethren thousands of dollars to keep him alive 
until his work was done." Yes, he died poor. Great leaders of religious 
movements usually become rich, but he died poor, too busy, as President 
Young said, in establishing the kingdom of God, to accumulate wealth. 
He is the man whom I testify was a servant of God, and I do it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, 
make full proof of thy ministry. 

"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith." 

So wrote Paul the Apostle to Timothy, his "son in the faith." Tim- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



othy was then at Ephesus, presiding over that branch of the Church. Paul 
was a prisoner in (Rome, possibly facing the death to which he refers 
when he writes, "I am now ready to be offered." Paul seems to have 
cherished a warm affection for this young man whom he baptized early 
in his ministry, possibly at the same time as when he baptized Timothy's 
mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois. 

KEEP THE FAITH 

The part that I wish to emphasize of this last message to this 
fellow servant whom he loved may be put in three words: "Keep 
the faith." 

Once before in a letter Paul had urged Timothy to do this very 
thing — to hold the faith : 

"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in 

word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." * * * 

"Continue in the doctrine : for in doing this thou shalt save thyself and 
them that hear thee." 

As I have listened to the inspirational addresses that have been 
delivered during the sessions of this conference I have wondered what 
message I might give to those who have assembled and to those unto 
whom you will carry the message. It is an important responsibility, 
this speaking to a conference of the Church. The time for each speaker 
is limited, but his responsibility to give an important message is not 
lessened thereby. Just what this message should be has given me 
prayerful concern. 

I am impressed to give this last message of Paul to Timothy : 
"Keep the faith." To some of you such an admonition might seem 
trite, as having very little weight, or as carrying with it but little im- 
portance, but as I stand before you today I can think of no better 
message to give to the people of the Latter-day Saints. "Hold the 
faith." Keep it. When I say this, I am thinking of young men and 
young women who are perplexed in their minds about the problems of 
the day, who are striving to harmonize the teachings of the Latter- 
day Saint Church with some of the teachings which they are receiving) 
in schools and with some of the condemnatory remarks which are made 
by their associates. These young men and young women are sincere in 
their desire to do right and I believe they want the truth, but they are 
perplexed, they wonder sometimes with Pilate, "What is truth ?" 

In all these perplexities, in all these wonderings, I would have 
them anchor their souls with this thought: "I am going to keep the 
faith, I am going to be true to the faith of my fathers until I have 
proved beyond a doubt that that faith is not in harmony with truth." 
And I know the day will never come when a sincere soul can prove that 
this faith is not in harmony with truth. A sincere soul will find it in 
harmony with truth, for it is truth. 

WHAT IT MEANS TO KEEP THE FAITH 

What does it mean to keep the faith? It means first, that we 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



37 



accept Jesus Christ, not merely as a great teacher, a powerful leader, but 
as the Savior, the Redeemer of the world. Now, there is much associated 
with that, for I know that many students are reading comments from 
reputably great educators who say that in order to be a christian it is 
not necessary to accept Christ as the literal Son of God, it is not 
necessary to believe in the immaculate conception, it is not necessary to 
believe in the literal resurrection from the grave. But he who keeps 
the faith will accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Redeemer of 
the world. I would have all men keep that faith. I think it is funda- 
mental to man's happiness, fundamental to his peace of mind. I think 
it is the cardinal principle of the Church of Jesus Christ. A young 
man who keeps that faith may not in his heart know that all things 
which jjesus said are true, but if he holds to the truth of Christ's 
divinity he will keep in harmony with the Savior's teachings by the 
spirit of faith. And we walk by faith in this world. We are as the 
little boy who holds his father's hand in the midst of a great city: the 
little boy is confused by the din and bustle of the crowd, and realizes 
that if he breaks away he will be lost and may not be able to get back 
to his father. While he holds that father's hand, however, he is safe. 
He has an assurance that his father will lead him back to his home. 
So it is with the young man who keeps his faith in this latter-day work. 
There may be confusion around him, his thoughts may be distracted, but 
he has his hand in that of his Redeemer, and with faith in that spiritual 
inspiration he will be led into truth, his conscience will be awakened to 
that great spiritual reality which is around us. 

man's relationship to the infinite 

Man is a spiritual being, a soul, and at some period of his life 
everyone is possessed with an irresistible desire to know his relation- 
ship to the infinite. He realizes that he is not just a phyiscal object 
that is to be tossed for a short time from bank to bank, only to be 
submerged finally in the everflowing stream of life. There is some- 
thing within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his 
environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a 
higher and more beautiful world. 

It was James Russell Lowell who wrote in his description of that 
beautiful day in June: 

"Every clod feels a stir of might, 
An instinct within it that reaches and towers, 
And, groping blindly above it for light, 
Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers." 

So there is in man a spiritual longing, a desire for spiritual com- 
munion which attends and which may at all times lift him from that 
which is physical and sensual to the realm of spirituality. 

SAFE ANCHORAGE 

I believe that in this day we are coming more to a realization of that 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



great truth. President Nibley referred to it this morning. Young man, 
keep your faith. Know that the greatest of all teachers, the Perfection 
of Humanity, the Redeemer of the world, is the only safe guide to all 
hungering souls. That is what Mormonism teaches. It is not dogma, 
it is a reality. 

Millikan, the great scientist, so wrote when he penned these words : 

"The most important thing in all the world is a belief in the reality of 
moral and spiritual values." 

These thoughts I associate with that one safe anchor, keeping the 
faith ; the knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world. 
Let neither sophistry nor golden-tongued oratory delivered by men 
who have lost their anchorage in Christ, lead you away from that truth. 

To keep the faith means also to accept the fact that the Savior, a 
resurrected personal being, has appeared in this dispensation and re- 
stored the authority to men to preach in his name, and to officiate in 
things pertaining to God. That too is a great anchor. Some of the 
young men say, "We do not know that" ; but they believe it, and that 
belief, with confidence in their parents, with confidence in their own 
experience, their own feelings, should be sufficient to hold them in 
anchorage until the real knowledge takes possession of them, as it will. 
No sincere youth can hold to that truth and live in obedience to what 
it inspires without receiving an assurance from that spiritual reality 
that Jesus Christ has appeared in this dispensation. Oh, what that 
means to an unbelieving world! Who can grasp its full significance? 
What a revelation to man regarding the Godhead ! What it means 
regarding life after death — the reality and personal relationships after 
death! What it means regarding God's fatherhood to man and the 
brotherhood of the human family! All these great questions are in- 
volved in that great declaration that Joseph Smith received a personal 
visitation from the Father and the Son. 

IDEALS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE 

Again, to keep the faith means that young men will strive to keep 
themselves as Paul asked Timothy to keep himself, "exemplary in 
action, exemplary in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in 
purity." Such, also, is Mormonism; and our young men believe in it. 
Just within the last month, I have read approximately one hundred 
papers written by as many young men and young women on the 
subject, "What it means to be a missionary." We asked them to write 
their own honest thoughts. Parents, I want to congratulate you on 
the part you have contributed toward the excellency of those papers 
which revealed a training on the part of these young people that is most 
commendable. The papers were neatly written. The percentage of 
misspelled words was small, there was not a page which was blotted, 
every one was a credit to the writer. But the best part of it all was 
their statements regarding the ideals of the Church, their desire to 
live in purity and to reflect credit upon the people whom they are 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



39 



representing. You cannot tell me that our boys and girls are not 
desirous of doing that which is right. Some of them gave expression 
to thoughts which perhaps are a little surprising, but they were honest 
expressions. The important thing is that these young people are going 
out into the world anchored, I believe, in the thought that they want 
to be true to the faith of their fathers, and if they do, they will keep 
themselves pure and unspotted from the world. Keeping the faith 
means just that. I know that I am speaking to fathers and mothers 
who would rather have their boys and girls do this than to have them 
accomplish anything else in all the world. 

KEEP CLEAN , 

In confirmation of this, I am reminded of a message that was sent 
by a mother to her son in Holland. It was written on a little package 
containing, I think, a present to her boy. The mother sent it over with 
one of the missionaries, and it was handed to me in Liverpool to be 
forwarded to the boy in Holland. On the outside of that package, 
written in the mother's hand, was this message: "Quinn, keep clean." 

In those three words was expressed a mother's most sincere hope 
and prayer for the boy she loved better than her own life. "Keep clean." 
To keep the faith of our fathers we must be clean from the sins of the 
world, young men as well as young women. Is there anything which 
will contribute more to the peace and happiness of mankind 
than chaste living? The perpetuity of our government depends upon 
the stability of our homes, and the stability of our homes depends upon 
the purity of the parentage in those homes, the fathers as well as the 
mothers. 

Youth of the land, when we say, keep the faith, we are but asking 
you to be patriots as well as to be true men, to be strong in your youth, 
that you may be worthy of fatherhood; young women, that you may 
possess the beauty of honorable and worthy motherhood. Thus you 
will contribute to the strength of your community, to the strength and 
perpetuity of the nation you love. 

TRUE MANHOOD AND TRUE WOMANHOOD 

Oh, I love the Church that stands for these high ideals, not in 
theory only but in practice; and I love the boys and girls who are 
inclined to protect themselves from the evils with which they are 
surrounded, who are anchored in the faith of their fathers. We are not 
outgrowing it, we cannot outgrow it. Our point of view may be some- 
what different, and the application of the teaching may vary from the 
application made by our parents, as President Ivins pointed out this 
morning, but the faith is sound, it is eternal. Gospel principles are 
truly the "power of God unto salvation." 

This summer, ninety-six young men and young women went out 
for a party. They belonged to an organization in one of our Church 
schools. They were properly chaperoned and stayed over night. When 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they returned home next day one of the anxious fathers very wisely 
questioned his boy as to the actions of the crowd, and among' other 
things asked: "Son, how many boys were tipsy?" "Why, what do 
you mean, father?" "I mean how many of the boys drank whisky?" 
"Not one." "How many of them smoked?" The son hesitated a 
moment, then said: "I cannot recall one." Then, turning to his 
brother he asked, "Did you know of any boys or girls who used cigar- 
ettes?" "No," said his brother, "there was not one. If there had been 
he would be expelled from the society." 

I think those ninety-six boys and girls are cherishing the ideals 
of true manhood and true womanhood, and they are keeping the faith. 
God bless them in doing it. 

OBSERVANCE OF LAW REQUIRED 

Finally, to keep the faith means to keep the laws of our country. 
No man who keeps the faith will participate in the making or in the 
distributing of "bootleg" whisky. He who indulges in such illegality 
is disloyal to his country and to his Church. For nearly a hundred 
years the Church has preached and plead with men and women to keep 
themselves free from intoxicants and the excessive use of stimulants. 
Today we heard that plea repeated by President Grant when he urged 
all to keep the Word of Wisdom. 

To accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Savior of the world ; 
to believe in the resurrection and in the immortality of man ; to be 
tolerant, charitable, benevolent, chaste ; to defend the purity of the 
home ; to be loyal to our country, and true to our God — these are some 
of the virtues connoted by Paul's admonition to keep the faith. 

God help us as young men and women, as members of the Church, 
to do this, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Canadian Mission 

I have been thrilled, my brethren and sisters, not only by the songs 
that have been sung in our hearing today, but by the testimonies of the 
brethren. I recognize the wise statesmanship involved in the speeches 
delivered by the First Presidency of the Church this morning. 

May I pharaphrase the declaration of Apostle Paul to the Romans, 
when he said: "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ," and 
say, "For I am not ashamed of the restored Gospel of Christ, for it 
is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." 

There was a time when the name "Mormon" was used as a term 
of derision. Indeed an early decision by one of the appellate courts of 
New York went so far as to decide that the Court would take "judicial 
notice" that it was libelous per se for one to falsely publish of another 
that he was a member of the Mormon Church. Of course that decision 
was erroneous. At most it would be a question of fact. It might in 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



41 



some quarters be injurious to an individual to falsely say of another 
that he was a Mormon. But fortunately the number of individuals 
who would feel themselves so aggrieved is becoming fewer every year. 

I am pleased to hear the report of President Nibley that there is a 
kindlier feeling existing towards the Latter-day Saints in the Northwest 
than heretofore. I can say the same thing with reference to the North- 
east, in the region of country where I am doing missionary service, in 
the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and 
in the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. 

The term "Mormon" first applied as an epithet in derision, is now 
accepted by the Latter-day Saints as a compliment. Those who best 
know what this Church stands for are not ashamed of this honored 
nickname. Mormonism stands for a sane and rational interpretation 
of the Bible, declining to discard the so-called miraculous and refusing 
to spiritualize away the literal. At the same time it makes due allowance 
for the figurative and symbolic. In addition to the Hebrew scriptures, 
so believed and interpreted, we have a volume of ancient American 
scriptures and still another book of nineteenth century revelations. 
Since the coming forth of these two volumes of scripture, many er- 
roneous doctrines and creedal statements have been, and are being, laid 
away in the cemetery of worn-out creeds, exploded dogma and false 
theology. For instance, the truth was revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith that little children are not capable of committing sin, that 
baptism is unto repentance for the remission of sin, and that sinless 
children have no need of repentance, either of baptism, but are alive 
in Christ, are without the law and have claim on the mercies of God. 
After these teachings go forth, the doctrine of infant damnation becomes 
less popular in the world, and there are fewer unbaptized infants refused 
burial in what is called holy ground. With the further understanding 
that "eternal punishment," "endless punishment," is God's punishment 
and that these terms are used because "more express than other scrip- 
tures, that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men;" 
allow a reasonable time for the dissemination of these truths, and we 
cease to hear of unbaptized infants suffering the torture of an ever- 
lasting fire in a lake of brimstone. 

The very first revelation in this dispensation disclosed the fact that 
man is in the physical image of God. It was learned anew that in the 
beginning God had said : "Let us make man in our image, after our 
likeness;" that man is in the highest form of creation known to the 
universe ; that in potentiality and possibility of development he is of the 
same lineage as his Heavenly Father. The leaven of this doctrine has 
not yet expelled the error still taught that God is a being without body 
parts or passions. Would it not have been un-Godlike to have created 
man, God's masterpiece, lower in potentiality than the highest form 
of being known to the universe? The power of endless progress is 
a sufficient reason for endless life. 

For centuries it was believed that the canon of scripture was full, 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that our Heavenly Father had no new word of counsel, encouragement 
or admonition for his struggling, misguided children; that one of the 
present century was to be less favored than one living in the first 
century. To believe there is no new revelation is to believe that God 
does not answer prayer, at least a prayer for information or instruction. 
Gradually the thought is gaining ground in the world that divine in- 
struction adapted to a race in one stage of its growth may not be 
adequate for more mature development, and that an all-wise Father will 
not refuse or neglect to give progressive instruction suited to the pro- 
gressive needs of his children; that the Eternal Father would be at 
least as considerate of his offspring in this respect as an earthly father: 
From the fact that it was necessary to have the revelations of the Old 
Testament supplemented by the revelations of the New Testament, 
there can be no objection apriori, to the revelations of the Old Testament 
and of the New Testament being supplemented by a still later revelation. 

Mormonism is pre-eminently an American religion, as was more 
fully presented by the First Presidency this morning. It stands for. 
America, North and South, and particularly for the government of the 
United States. It teaches that this western hemisphere is a land choice 
above all other lands — a land of liberty dedicated to freedom and right- 
eousness. The Constitution of the United States is believed in with 
religious devotion, that its framers were heaven-inspired. And well 
may such a . belief be cherished. Gladstone, the great English premier, 
said of it: 

"As far as I can see the American Constitution is the greatest and most 
wonderful work ever struck off at one time by the brain and purpose of man." 

Our Constitution has rightly been called the "bond of our union, 
the shield of our defense, and the source of our prosperity." While the 
name of Deity is not mentioned in the Constitution, yet, in a sense, ours 
is a Christian government and country. Religious liberty is guaranteed 
in that Congress can make no law respecting the establishment of 
religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that no religious 
test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust 
under the United States. At the time of the adoption of the Constitu- 
tion such a thing as a written constitution was scarcely known ; certainly 
nothing of the nature of the one devised. England had a constitution 
but it was an unwritten one, embodied in the laws and practices of 
more than a dozen centuries of time. It was to be found in such 
documents as Magna Charta, The Petition of Rights, The Bill of Rights, 
the Habeas Corpus Act, Act of Settlement, and other great enactments. 
The idea of a written constitution was soon taken up by France, spread- 
ing to most of the European countries ; also to other continents and to 
the islands of the sea. While this wonderful document can be read 
through in less than an hour, there are already many thousands of 
references to distinct points decided by the Supreme Court construing 
the Constitution. 

In view of all this, it is but natural that the leaders of our Church 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



43 



in various stages of its history have expressed themselves warmly in 
support of the Constitution of the United States and laws passed in 
conformity thereto. 

Our system of proselyting is unique. It is the re-establishment of 
the early missionary system so far as the same is applicable to present 
day conditions. Gratuitous service of months and years at a time is 
given by our men and women. There are now missionaries representing 
our Church to the number of about twenty-five hundred in the foreign 
missions. Where else can you find so many volunteers in foreign lands 
or States preaching without purse or pay? Their consolation is the 
thought embodied in' the lines of Longfellow in his poem entitled, "The 
Arrow and the Song": 

"I shot an arrow into the air, 
It fell to earth, I knew not where ; 
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight 
Could not follow it in its flight. 

"I breathed a song into the air, 
It fell to earth, I knew not where ; 
For who has sight so keen and strong, 
That it can follow the flight of song? 

"Long, long afterward, in an oak, 
I found the arrow, still unbroke; 
And the song, from beginning to end, 
I found again in the heart of a friend." 

Now we sometimes feel that it is a perplexing task to deal with the 
different problems that arise in perfecting new missionaries, yet there 
is always a joy attending our labors, and that joy brims over when 
we see souls come into the Church. Quite recently I have had instances 
of that sort. In one of our provinces four of our Elders baptized 
within the eight months of this year some twelve converts, among the 
number being two entire families. There is great joy in bringing a 
single soul into the Church and much greater when many are brought 
into the fold. 

May the Lord bless the missionary service, and all those who take 
part therein, that they may go forward in faith and power in pro- 
claiming the truth to the children of our Father who are in darkness 
and who need the message which the Eiders have to bear to them, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "O say, what is truth?" 
Elder Joseph Eckersley pronounced the benediction. 
The conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, Saturday morning, 
October 6, 1928. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING ' 

The meeting commenced at 10 a. m., Saturday, October 6, 1928, 
President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Guide us, O Thou Great Je- 
hovah." 

Elder Mark Austin offered the invocation. 

A soprano solo, "Eye hath not seen," was sung by Sister Pearl 
Kimball Davis. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, notwithstanding there are many attrac- 
tions in Salt Lake City to engage the attention of the people, . there is 
still a very large gathering in this tabernacle this morning. I greatly 
rejoiced in the spirit and teachings of the conference yesterday. I trust 
that the Lord will continue to be with us today, by the influence and 
power of his holy Spirit, that it may be a time of rejoicing and thanks- 
giving. 

A PERPLEXING QUESTION 

I am reading in part from one of the daily papers, a message wired 
from Glasgow, Scotland, September 10, 1928: 

"The great mystery of the origin, nature and purpose of life, always will 
remain to tease, stimulate or humiliate mankind. Professor C. Lovatt Evans 
told the physiology section of the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science today. 

"Professor Evans is a fellow of the Royal Society, a member of the Royal 
College of Surgeons, a doctor of science and one of the best known physiologists 
in the world. His remarks were made in the course of the presidential address 
for physiology section of the science association. * * * 

" 'Matter, energy, time and space are in the melting pot,' he said, 'and out 
of it will come, we know not what kind of strange relations, one to another. 
One thing we may be sure, no final explanation will follow'." 

The position taken by this learned professor is extraordinary. He 
assumes that man will never come to know the purpose of life. And 
if that be true, I take it that there would be very little or no satisfaction 
in living. Man is fearfully and wonderfully made. He is the marvel 
of creation, he is the noblest work of God. Nevertheless, Professor 
Evans, by the study of man, could never ascertain the purpose of life. 

THE AUTHOR OF LIFE 

If this mystery is to be solved at all, it would be well for Professor 
Evans and all others interested in the subject to go back of man, back 
to the beginning, and there become acquainted with the Author of life. 
Who is the Author of life? I take it that this is a pertinent question. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 



45 



The answer is, God, the Father, the Creator of the heavens and the 
earth. He is the Author of life. That such knowledge is vital to the 
consideration of the subject before us, is made clear by the following 
scripture, a saying by Paul the Apostle: 

"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and 
Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." 

How shall we come to know him, that he may reveal to us the 
purpose of life? We can only know him by rendering obedience to the 
Gospel, the plan of life and salvation which he has given, and through 
such knowledge by obtaining the Spirit of God. This is clearly indi- 
cated in the following passages of scripture: 

"But as it is writen, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered 
into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 

"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit ; for the Spirit searcheth 
all things, yea, the deep things of God. 

"For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which 
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 

"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is 
of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God." 
(1 Cor. 2:9-12.) 

Having progressed sufficiently to get possession of the Spirit of 
God, our minds will be illuminated so that we can comprehend the things 
of God. 

WHAT IS MAN? 

The scriptures teach us that mankind are the children of God, or 
in other words, that God is the father of our spirits, while our earthly 
parents are the fathers and mothers of our bodies. If this be true — 
and it is true — it follows that there was a great family of spirits in 
the spirit world, God himself being at the head of said family. The earth 
was created then that these spirits might come down and get bodies. 
This is clearly and beautifully set forth by the following quotation from 
the 2nd Chapter of Genesis: 

"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed 
into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul." 

What was the breath of life here referred to? Why, it was the 
man's spirit that God put into his body. He never was a living soul 
prior to that first great creative act, but now that he has a body com- 
bined with a spirit, it constitutes him a living soul. We begin to see 
something of the purpose of life. The spirits of men and women came 
down to the earth to get bodies, and I take it, my brethren and sisters, 
that this was indeed a great and glorious privilege. 

THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 

Man stands upon the threshold of life. The question might well 
be asked : Following his birth, what is the purpose of it all ? 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The following significant language will be found in the Book of 
Mormon, a record of sacred scripture : 

"Adam fell that man might be and man is that he might have joy." (Book 
of Mormon, page 54, paragraph 25.) 

Men are here upon the earth then that they might have joy. Is 
there anything more desirable than happiness or joy? We are all 
seeking it; we all want it. How is it to be obtained? It can only be 
obtained through the Church and Kingdom of God. How may one 
get into this Church and Kingdom of God ? The answer is : he must 
be born into it. He was born into the world to begin with, and now if 
he comes into the kingdom of God he must be born into it. 

Christ said to Nicodemus upon one occasion: 

"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. 
"Except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the 
Kingdom of God." (John 3 :3, 4, 5.) 

So that it becomes in a sense a real birth. Baptism by water and the 
laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost is the door that 
leads into the Church and Kingdom of God. 

MARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 

It might be said of man that after coming into the Church and 
Kingdom of God the purpose of life could not be fully realized without 
marriage — marriage for time and eternity. In the beginning, when man 
was formed from the dust of the earth and became a living soul, he 
was alone. God said: "It is not good for man to be alone," and he 
then formed the woman and brought her to the man, and gave her to 
him in wedlock. Jesus said, speaking of marriage : 

"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God 
hath joined together let no man put asunder." (Matt. 19:6.) 

A man cannot grow to the full measure of a man without a woman, 
and conversely a woman cannot grow to the full measure of a woman 
without a man. They were created together and God intended them 
to be together in wedlock. 

If men and women are to enter into a fulness of joy it must needs 
be that the family relationship should continue throughout eternity. 
That it will so continue in the Church and Kingdom of God is the 
firm belief of the Latter-day Saints. To ; be born into the world in the 
first place, and then to be born again, born into the Kingdom of God, 
and finally to enter into the eternity of the marriage covenant — these 
three conditions explain with clearness the very purpose of life. Surely, 
brethren and sisters, life is worth living. 

I testify to you most earnestly that I do know that the work in 
which we are engaged is the work of God and that this is the Church of 
Jesus Christ. It is so denominated. It is called the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints to distinguish it from his Church in the 
meridian of time. I know that Christ was and is the Savior of the 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON

world, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and the instrument in 
the hands of God in founding this work, by organizing the Church as 
he did in 1830. I rejoice in this knowledge. To me it is a glorious 
testimony, and I am determined, if possible, to hold on to it all the days 
of my life. 

I pray God's choicest blessings upon you my brethren and sisters, 
the Latter-day Saints, the general authorities of the Church and the 
local authorities, that this work may go on and be successful. This is 
my humble prayer and I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I have been deeply impressed, my brethren and sisters, by the 
splendid instructions of the First Presidency and others who have 
spoken during this conference thus far. I rejoice with you in the 
favorable conditions which prevail, and the measure of prosperity 
and progress in evidence among the Latter-day Saints. I realize 
the vast work that is before us to do. I appreciate the tremendous 
responsibility that rests upon the Latter-day Saints, both tem- 
porally and spiritually, to accomplish that which the Lord has in 
view for us. It is incumbent upon every one of us to do our part 
and to strive to qualify ourselves to accomplish the work assigned 
us. For the building up of the Church depends, not upon one or 
two or a few, but upon every one of those who have received the 
gospel. 

The responsibility is upon each one of us to learn our duty and 
then endeavor to do it. If we all take part, if we all perform our 
work, if we all sense that responsibility and endeavor to live up 
to it, we shall unitedly receive the blessings and the benefits. This 
great and important work is divine in its nature, and is intended to 
fulfil a great destiny. It is to prepare the way for the coming of the 
Son of Man and the establishment of righteousness, to build up 
Zion, and to do all those things which the Lord has declared unto 
us. So it means that every one of the Latter-day Saints, both 
young and old, should seek to prepare himself or herself to do his 
part, and to achieve the work before us. 

TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS 

I was greatly impressed, as I am sure you were, with the 
statement ,made by President Grant, at the opening of this con- 
ference, regarding the material achievements of the Latter-day 
Saints, in one respect alone, and that is the building of meeting 
houses, amusement halls, and stake houses, during the year 1927, 
and during the nine months of this year. The Latter-day Saints 
recognize that material progress and temporal affairs are bound up 



48 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



with the spiritual; and we cannot dissociate one from the other; 
for they both, temporal and spiritual, affect our welfare. We can 
not live by the material things alone, neither can we live entirely 
by the spiritual things. In a sense all things are spiritual, because 
all things which contribute to the welfare and progress of man- 
kind in this life, make for their eternal progress, and are in con- 
formity with the will of the Lord. The Lord has promised the 
Latter-day Saints that they should enjoy prosperity — material as 
well as spiritual. If we live in such a way as to merit the blessings 
of God, he will prosper and bless us. However, the possession or 
absence of wealth by men does not, of itself, evidence the attitude 
of the Lord toward them. 

When we think of what is required in the way of the building 
of these meeting houses, which is only one of the activities of the 
Latter-day Saints — one of the responsibilities which are placed 
upon us — we realize that it is the result of a great deal of labor 
and money. Money, in fact represents labor. So the money spent 
represents the accumulation of labor previously done in the way 
of production, and which is now so much capital. In like manner 
the tithes used for this purpose represent the accumulation of 
labor by the Latter-day Saints, which have been dedicated to the 
Lord. The members themselves in their own wards and stakes 
have given a tremendous amount of labor, and of means, which 
also represents labor. 

LABOR — A COMMAND OF GOD 

We appreciate the fact that labor is one of the means whereby 
we progress. It is one of the things every one of us must learn 
to do. It is one of the great factors of growth. In the early history 
of mankind, when the Lord sent Adam out of Eden, he declared 
to him : "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou, 
return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust 
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." From that time down 
to the present time this charge has been binding upon mankind, 
that we should labor diligently, first, that we may provide susten- 
ance for ourselves and those who are dependent upon us, and, 
second, that we may also give or dedicate a part of that labor, or 
the returns therefrom, for the welfare of our fellowmen and for the 
accomplishment of God's purposes. If we keep these things in 
mind we shall appreciate the fact that our labor will be profitable. 

You remember many centuries later that the Lord, through his 
prophet, Moses, gave to the children of Israel the commandment ; 
"Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh is 
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Six days are sufficient each 
week in order to accomplish the things that are necessary for the 
sustenance of mankind, and the seventh day should be a day of 
rest, set apart for the worship of the Lord, for the consideration of 
things that are of a purely spiritual nature. Nowadays, with the 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



49 



increased use of machinery and the consequent greater efficiency 
and returns of labor, it is coming to be realized that five days of 
such labor each week will be sufficient to take care of needed 
production, and will be instrumental in overcoming unemployment. 
Under such an arrangement the two remaining days could be 
profitably used for rest, improvement and recreation. 

BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL LABOR 

Now, of the benefits that come to us from labor, there is a 
distinct advantage that comes from the fact that in the sweat of 
our face we learn to value the things of life. It brings health to 
us, it brings satisfaction, it brings an appreciation of our responsi- 
bilities. The wise man, Solomon, has declared, with regard to 
labor: "Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that 
gathereth by labor shall increase." Again : "He that tilleth his, 
land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain 
persons shall have poverty enough." Again : "The sleep of a 
laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much : but the 
abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep." These all 
testify with regard to the benefits that come to us from physical 
labor. 

SPECIALIZATION OF LABOR 

In the centuries that have elapsed since the time when these 
men in the early history of mankind pursued a simple, pastoral life* 
there has been a gradual change until the present time. Par- 
ticularly in the last century, however, has there been a very marked 
change in the labor conditions that prevail throughout the world. 
It is true that the pastoral or agricultural pursuits still prevail in 
large measure. They are just as dignified and important as they 
ever have been, if not more so. But in addition thereto there has 
been a multiplication of industries which have brought ab'out not- 
able changes and great progress in the conditions of mankind. 
They have produced, especially in this country, a material pros- 
perity that is unsurpassed in all the history of the world. Now, if, 
along with that material prosperity, produced by improvements 
in labor conditions through new developments and specialization, 
we can keep our feet firmly planted on the ground, and not be 
carried away by the idea that prosperity is the end desired, but 
only a means to that end, we shall enjoy the blessings which the 
Lord has promised. 

It is important that every one of our young men and women, 
and our boys and girls, shall learn, first, to understand the im- 
portance of work, and second, to specialize in their labors. 
It is an age of specialization. That is especially true at the present 
time. "There is no excellence without labor." There is an old 
Brahminical saying, something to this effect : "A parent who does 
not teach his son a trade teaches him to be a thief." Whether that 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be true or not, the fact remains that it is important that every one 
of us should learn to do some particular thing well. Every one 
should learn some trade or profession. The complex conditions 
of today are such as to practically force us to develop and qualify in, 
the variety of industries that prevail throughout this country and 
the world. In the matter of agriculture, for instance, it is recog- 
nized that in order to place this great industry upon the proper 
basis of economical production and distribution, it involves the 
application of those principles of efficiency in connection with the 
employment of men and machinery whereby the most profitable 
results will be secured. Scientific agriculture is a profession and 
it involves thorough study and practical preparation to insure the 
greatest success. 

OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT 

Complaint is made at the present time of considerable lack of 
employment. This is a condition that deserves careful attention 
on the part of employers and Church officers, and earnest efforts 
to remedy it as far as possible. This condition, however, is partly 
caused by those without employment lacking training for par- 
ticular jobs, and partly, also, by failure to get back to first prin- 
ciples. Many men, out of employment, could largely feed and 
support their families from the products of the farm, if they would 
diligently apply their minds and bodies to such work. I know 
of men living on a few acres of land, not generally considered most 
fertile, who have produced a comfortable living for their families, 
through dairy products, poultry, hops, orchards, and kitchen 
gardens. 

A recent instance of the opportunities open to those seeking 
progress and independence has come to my attention. I visited 
recently at the home of a young man, with a wife and two little 
children, in an outlying section of this state. Two or three years 
ago he was working, when work was available, at small wages. 
He determined to start for himself in dairying. He had no home 
and practically no credit. His wife and he made considerable 
sacrifice in a very humble home on a farm, which they leased. 
He managed to get one or two cows as a start. By strict economy 
hard labor and mental effort he now has a fine dairy herd of about 
thirty cows, is getting a monthly cream check of about $400.00, 
and is feeding calves and hogs of good quality. He is living in a 
comfortable home and has an automobile. He is a bishop's coun- 
selor. 

NO CLERGY — NO LAITY ALL TO LABOR 

In connection with this matter of labor the attitude of the 
Latter-day Saints is vastly different from that of the world gen- 
erally with respect to the occupations of those engaged in Churc 
service. With the exception of a very few engaged entirely in 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



51 



Church work, the thousands of men in this Church bearing; the 
priesthood have their individual vocations. Whereas the clergy 
in other churches are dependent upon the laity for their support, 
those engaged in the ministry of this Church give a part of their 
time voluntarily for the service of the Lord while they, at the samo 
time, provide for their families by their own efforts. Among the 
advantages of this divine plan are that there is developed in then 
the spirit of service, self-reliance, sympathy, practicality, a desire 
for knowledge and brotherly kindness. You remember the state- 
ments of the apostles of old, how they labored. Paul, especiall}' 
declared repeatedly how he had worked for the welfare of the peo- 
ple and yet supported himself. In his epistle to the Corinthian 
saints, he says : "We labor, working with our own hands ;" and 
again, to the Thessalonion saints, he says: "For ye remember 
brethren, our labor and travail : for laboring night and day, be- 
cause we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached 
unto you the gospel of God." 

MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EFFORT 

It is important that everyone should learn the value of hard 
work. The Lord commanded Adam, and through him, all his, 
descendants, that we should eat our bread in the sweat of our face 
or, in other words, by earnest effort, whether we labor physically 
or mentally. Mental labor is often just as strenuous, and just as 
important, if not more so, than physical labor. Ordinarily, whether 
our vocation is chiefly physical or mental in character, we have 
occasion to use both powers in that which we have to do. Well- 
balanced development involves sustained physical as well as mental 
efforts. Paul the apostle declared : "Be not slothful in business ; 
fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord." 

IDLERS HAVE NO PLACE IN ZION 

Solomon says : "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it 
with thy might." The Apostle Paul says: "We commanded you, 
that if any would not work, neither should he eat." And, again : 
"Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labor, work- 
ing with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give 
to him that needeth." In the revelations which the Lord has given 
in these times it is declared, "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that 
is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer." 

President Brigham Young on one occasion, speaking on this 
subject, declared: "The non-producer must live on the products 
of those who labor. There is no other way. If we would all labor 
a few hours a day we could then spend the remainder of our time in 
rest and the improvement pf our minds. This would give an op- 
portunity to all the children to be educated in the learning of the 
day and to possess all the wisdom of man." Every member of this) 
Church ought to have some vocation and proceed to do that work 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with purpose and energy. "Seest thou a man diligent in his busi- 
ness? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean 
men." We need to learn the benefits of concentrated effort. Our 
purpose should be to gain sufficient resources to enable us to 
give more effective, whole-hearted service to the work of the Lord, 
besides maintaining satisfactorily those dependent upon us. 

DEDICATING OF OUR LABOR AND TIME TO THE LORD 

f would particularly like to stress the idea that we should all 
willingly and gratefully set apart a considerable portion of the fruits 
of our labors for the furtherance of God's purposes with respecl 
to mankind. That is a law established of the Lord for our blessing 
and benefit. It is not sufficient that we should help only in com- 
munity activities. That is a proper and appropriate thing. We 
ought to take part in those movements that really promote the 
community welfare. As a matter of fact, all the things that we are 
doing which we consider we do for the Lord, are in reality for the 
welfare of our fellow-men. The tithing which we pay is actually 
for the benefit of mankind. We dedicate a portion of our means 
to the Lord to be used by his servants in the promotion of those 
things that concern mankind — in the preaching of the gospel of 
salvation, the building of places of worship for the spiritual train- 
ing and recreational welfare of all who desire to take advantage of 
the same, the education of the young people, the help and welfare 
of those in need, the erection of temples for sacred ordinances, and 
many other things. 

The apostle declares : "I have shewed. you all things, how that 
so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the 
words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give 
than to receive." All of these things we ought to do. AVe ought 
to be diligent in our labors in order to obtain the greatest material 
and spiritual advancement, keeping in mind always the counsel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ: "Labor not for the meat which perisheth. 
but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which 
the Son of man shall give unto you." 

I pray that the Lord may guide each one of us to a sense of 
our responsibilities, whereby we may strive to qualify in the most 
effective way to be helpful in the building up of the work of God. 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Do what is right." 

ELDER NOAH S. POND 

President Northern States Mission 

My Brethren and sisters : I deeply appreciate the blessed privilege 
of being associated with the missionary force of the Church. I bring to 
you an excellent report of a hundred or more elders and sister mission- 



ELDER NOAH S. POND 



53 



aries who are laboring in the Northern States Mission. The blessings 
of the Lord are attending our labors, and we are receiving progress 
through conversions and in a chapel-building program. It might in- 
terest you to hear a few of the experiences of some of your sons and 
daughters, brothers and sisters. 

Recently a young elder had an excellent conversation with a gentle- 
man who propounded questions and presented arguments in a very 
kindly, christian-like spirit, and then invited the young elder to dine 
with him. After they had dined and visited and exchanged views for an 
hour or such a matter, the gentleman revealed his identity. He was a 
minister of the gospel, and it was his first contact with a Mormon elder. 
Both the minister and the elder appeared to have enjoyed the ex- 
perience. 

At another minister's home an elder was given the privilege of 
holding a gospel meeting in the minister's church. 

Another elder was given the privilege of holding a gospel meeting 
in a large community hall, through the fine impression that the elder 
had made upon the mind of the gentleman who had the authority to let 
the hall. 

Two elders were entertained in the home of a mayor of an eastern 
city who had visited Salt Lake. He had been received so kindly in the 
temple grounds and had received the hospitality of the people to such 
an extent that he went home with the resolution that he would extend 
similar hospitality to the Mormon missionaries when they should come 
to his home, and this he did. 

Two elders were refused entertainment in a very unfriendly and in 
fact a hostile attitude at a well-appearing residence, but a change of 
sentiment came over this man and after the elders had departed he sent 
his son in an automobile to overtake them and bring them back. He 
gave them entertainment, something to eat, a good bed upon which to 
sleep, breakfast in the morning ; and when they left him he placed a 
dollar bill in the hand of each of the missionaries with an invitation to 
visit him when they should come that way again. This change of senti- 
ment was an immediate answer to prayer by these two elders. 

Recently a good but aged brother died in the State of Wisconsin. 
Before his death he wrote into his will I a donation of five hundred 
dollars to the Church for the furtherance of the building of a chapel. 
In his immediate locality there had existed bitterness and prejudice 
against our people, and for this reason little if any missionary work- 
had been successfully carried on. This good brother requested that 
the elders should speak at his funeral. He died in a few weeks time, 
and the large public hall of the town was placed at their disposal for 
the funeral service. Half of the population of eight hundred people 
assembled in that hall. Of that congregation of four hundred people, 
less than a score were members of the Church. It was a wonderful 
incident, for we could verily feel the vanishing and the disappearance 
of the spirit of prejudice and bitterness that had existed, and a spirit

of friendliness and sympathy taking its place. A few Sundays there- 
after the elders were invited to return. They went there and organized 
a Sunday School, and we now have hopes of conversions and finally the 
establishment of a branch in that locality. 

Intolerance has played its part in the experiences of the mission- 
aries of the past, but it appears now that indifference is our great 
obstacle. When the minds of the people are aroused, frequently the 
question is asked of us : "Why devote time and effort and money in 
such a highly educated and christianized nation as the United States? 
I answer with a quotation from the Luther Burbank book, "The 
Harvest of the Years," in which Mr. Burbank says: 

"After more than thirteen centuries of Mohammedanism, twenty centuries 
of Christianity, twenty-five centuries of Buddhism and Confucianism, and 
four thousand years of Hebrew religion, we are still greedy, selfish, cruel, 
short-sighted and ready to go to war at almost any pretext and fritter away 
the savings of decades, the flower of our youth and the friendliness that it has 
taken a half century to build up." 

Only the living of the gospel of Jesus Christ can make men better. 
With only forty per cent of the population of the United States identi- 
fied with any church or ecclesiastical organization — Catholic, Jewish or 
Protestant — the answer to that question is clear ; the necessity of preach- 
ing the gospel in the great nation of the United States. The virtues of 
courage, generosity, loyalty and willingness to sacrifice are fine. Peo- 
ple may be highly educated, but yet be wicked, cruel and ruthless. 
People may be wealthy and prosperous and yet without that higher 
level of a spiritual life. And so it is necessary that we preach Jesus 
Christ and him crucified, and the principles of his gospel. 

May God bless the people of this nation and of our Church. May 
the kindly blessings of the Lord be showered upon the First Presidency, 
the Council of the Twelve and all the presiding authorities of the Church, 
upon the authorities of the wards and the stakes, and upon the won- 
derful missionary forces throughout the world. My dear brethren and 
sisters, presiding authorities and saints — do all in your power to send 
your sons and daughters out into the mission field, and may God add his 
blessings, is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Western States Mission 

My brethren and sisters : I sincerely trust that the Lord will assist 
me in making a brief report of conditions in the field of labor to which 
I have been called. It has been, practically, six months time since I 
went into that field — a short time more than that. At the present 
time we have ninety-six missionaries in the Western States Mission 
laboring in the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Ne- 
braska, with a few in the southwesterrn corner of South Dakota, and 
two elders and two sisters in Council Bluffs, Iowa — a Church popula- 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF

tion of about six thousand, six hundred members — with twenty-one 
more or less well organized branches, and quite a number of scattered 
families. As you know, the Western States Mission lies close to the 
Church at home, and in some of our districts, particularly Western 
Colorado and Wyoming, conditions are about as they are at home, except 
for the scattered condition of the people. Practically no prejudice 
to overcome, perhaps a good deal of indifference, but the great task 
the missionaries have, as I see it, is to teach the people the principles 
of the Gospel ; for many of them are in a receptive attitude. Many of 
them are friendly and willing to listen to our message. 

The experiences of the missionaries are interesting, to be sure. I 
want to pay tribute, if I may, to these young men and women who come 
to the mission field, converted in their hearts to the principles of the 
gospel, not altogether aware of the fact that they are converted, but 
genuine and sincere in their desire to do the will of the Father. The 
principal thing they need is just to be taught, guided and led into the 
way of their duty, for they are all willing and anxious to learn ; and it 
is a remarkable thing how fast they do learn when they can have 
competent supervision. I have in mind, for instance, one district in 
which it so happened that six young men were laboring, only one of 
them having been in the field longer than a year, the rest of them not 
longer than six months, four months, and three months. It so happened 
that the elders formerly laboring with them, the experienced elders, 
had been released all at once. Fortunately for us we had an elder 
sent to us as a short-term missionary, the superintendent of one of 
our seminaries, a wonderfully strong character, humble, intelligent, 
wise ; and it was my privilege to send him into that district for two 
months time to labor with those young missionaries. Two weeks ago 
I followed him up and came through there. He had been released, but 
the transformation in those six missionaries was wonderful. Each of 
them was able, with considerable ability, to express himself, to teach 
the gospel ; because they had had a competent teacher to give them a 
start. In other districts experienced elders fill such places, and the 
young elders and sisters, who come out are laboring under their direc- 
tion, and they improve themselves very quickly. They are anxious, 
as I have said, to learn, anxious to teach. 

We came to the conclusion as a result of a conference of district 
presidents held in our mission, that it would be wise if every elder in 
the mission could have at least two weeks every year, traveling without 
purse or scrip, in the summer time. We felt that it would bring them 
nearer to the Lord and nearer to the people; with the result that I 
can report every elder in the Western States Mission has had that 
experience this year, and without exception they come back reporting 
that they have had a splendid experience. Perhaps not altogether a 
pleasant one, but they are delighted with their experience. It was their 
testimony that it was a good thing to do. Two of them started out 
with great confidence ; when they discovered that the Lord was bless- 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ing them and raising up friends for them they were over-confident, with 
the result they had to spend one night in a corn field and eat the green 
corn, but they were soon humbled and thereafter in response to their 
appeal they were never without friends. 

Perhaps another interesting experience that has come to the elders 
in New Mexico might be worth relating. A very unusual thing, and 
for it I have no explanation. A woman with Lamanite blood in her; 
veins became interested in the elders and their message. She purchased 
a Book of Mormon and read it partly through, laid it up on top of her 
library, put a portable typewriter on top of the book, locked up her 
house and went away to visit her daughter. In her absence her house 
burned to ashes. When she came back and was searching among the 
ruins of her home the spirit seemed to say to her, "Go get your book." 
She went over to where the library had been and poked among the 
ashes and found the typewriter burned and twisted. Under the 
typewriter she found her Book of Mormon, covered with a white 
paper cover, as we cover the fifty cent edition that we send out. The 
paper cover was scorched but the book was unharmed. All of the 
rest of her books were entirely burned. The woman brought the book 
out and came to the elders in great astonishment and showed them what 
had happened, how it had been miraculously saved. I saw the woman, 
I saw the book, and I felt a certain amount of reverential awe when I 
held it in my hand. We wanted to purchase it from her, but she would, 
not part with her wonderful relic. She has since become a member 
of the Church. 

I have to say to you that your missionary sons and daughters who 
are laboring in the Western States, with two exceptions are all well, 
enjoying good health. The two who are not well are lady missionaries, 
one in the Latter-day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City and the other 
at Council Bluffs. That you may not be concerned or think it is your 
daughter, let me say that the mothers of these girls know where their 
daughters are. The missionaries are happy in their labors and are 
enjoying their work. 

One thing I would like to say to you is that when you write to 
your missionary sons and daughters write them encouraging words 
and do not worry about when they are going to be released. I have 
noticed in some cases where the fathers and mothers anticipate the 
release of their missionaries, the missionaries themselves become so 
interested in their release, about ninety days before it happens they let 
down in their work and lose to some extent the spirit of their mission. 
You do them a great, injustice when you make them feel that they 
should come home, or that you are anxious to have them come home. 
Write them encouraging letters and tell them you want them to remain 
as long as they can. If you have any financial worries write to the 
mission president and not to the missionary. The mission president 
I am sure will always be sympathetic with you in your troubles, but 
keep your troubles away from your missionary sons or daughters. 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 



57 



We have one missionary in our mission who I am told is about ready 
to come home because he does not get encouragement from home; he 
feels discouraged. That is very serious and ought not to happen. If 
you will encourage them you will bless and help them wonderfully. 

I want to testify that the hand of the Lord is over us to protect us 
and inspire us in all that we do. As long as we remain humble we 
enjoy a wonderful spirit. We are very happy in our labors and we are 
trying in our humble way to carry the gospel message as plainly and 
simply as we can. May God bless you, I humbly ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

President of the Northcentral States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, it is a joy to me to be able to report 
conditions in the Northcentral States Mission. We are the youngest 
mission in the United States, and the smallest mission in numbers. We 
have been organized only about three and one-half years. Our mission 
includes the State of Montana east of Great Falls, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, and Minnesota ; then passes over into Canada and takes 
Ontario west of the Great Lakes, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and part 
of Alberta. When the mission was organized we numbered only about 
nineteen hundred people. I should like to say in behalf of the young 
men and young women who come to our mission that they have been 
very loyal and faithful in the performance of their duties. I should 
rather change President Pond's invitation wherein he solicited that you 
send your boys and girls into the field, I should like to say to you. 
brethren, come yourselves, we need some more older brethren in the 
work, to go with these young elders, men who have wisdom and 
discretion and who can lead out in the work of the Lord. 

Not long ago, during the cold winter months, four missionaries 
came to our mission. We left headquarters in Minneapolis and traveled 
five hundred miles north to the city of Winnipeg. We started up the 
street on a street car. When we got off the car to go to a restaurant 
just across the road, there was a bitter wind blowing, and the weather 
was exceedingly cold. These elders, four of them, had a grip in 
each hand. We had not gotten very far from the street car when 
every one of them had dropped his grips and was holding his ears 
to keep them from freezing. I went back to help them along and got 
them into the restaurant. After we had given our orders for our dinner 
I said : "I will see if I can get in touch with the elders here." One 
of the elders turned to a companion and said: "Wouldn't this make 
you ask for your release?" and he said other things but I don't know 
what they were. When I got on the train with two of these mission- 
aries to go to Saskatoon (the other two went to Regina) — one of them 
said : "When you get to Regina that elder will not be there." I said 
"Why?" He replied: "This country is too cold for him." He was 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



an office man and had been working where it was warm all the time. 
When I arrived in Regina we held a priesthood meeting, and this 
young man was given an opportunity to express himself. He arose 
and said : "I am prepared to give all I have, even to my life, for this 
work." That is the kind of integrity that is in the hearts of these young 
men and young women who go out from Zion to preach the gospel. 
That integrity is not confined to the missionaries only, but it is in the 
hearts of the parents. Only yesterday I met two parents and I was 
asked: "How is my boy?" He is a very fine, splendid young man. 
Not long ago I said to the president of his district: "We must take 
this elder out and make a president of him." And he said: "Before 
you do it I want to talk to you. Don't take him away ; he is the finest 
man we have in our district. We can't get along without him." I 
said to those parents: "How long has he been in the field?" "Two 
years this month." "How are your finances to keep him longer?" 
"We haven't any, but we have as much now as we had when he went 
out;" and then the father said, with tears in his eyes: "Everything 
we have is on the altar, and you keep him as long as you want him." 
That is the kind of faith that has permeated this work frdm its in- 
ception. That is the kind of faith that will consummate this work. 

Not long ago two of our elders sat in the rear of a building where 
a meeting was being addressed by the Governor of the State of 
Minnesota. At the close of the meeting the Governor went down 
the aisle and said to these young elders : "I understand you are Mormon 
elders from Utah." "Yes." ' "Well, I received a Book of Mormon, 
from the headquarters of your mission not long ago, and I want to 
thank you personally for the teachings of that wonderful book. When- 
ever you come to St. Paul come in and see me. I would like to have 
you visit me in my office." The people of Minnesota and those states 
where we are laboring, are many of them of good old Scandinavian 
stock, and they believe the gospel when it is properly put up to them. 

We feel encouraged in our work, and are determined to go forth 
with all the power and zeal that God has given us for the accom- 
plishment of his purposes among men ; and our greatest need is more 
missionaries. We have whole cities with only one pair of elders in them. 
What can one pair of elders do in a big city, to make proclamation of 
the gospel of the Son of God ? I pray that God will inspire the people 
of this Church, that we may look more abundantly to the prosecution 
of this great and important work that the Lord has given us, in that 
we will not only send our boys, but that we will break away occasion- 
ally and come ourselves. Presidents of stakes, bishops of wards, 
men of experience, it will make you bigger men and you will be able 
to render valuable service in the world preaching the gospel. I pray 
that the Lord will bless you in your finances and in your desires, that 
you may be able to do this, that we may have in the mission field more 
of the older brethren. 

I can't speak too highly for the young ladies of our mission, young 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 



59 



ladies who have come into the world to preach the gospel. They can 
get into the homes of the people and find an opportunity for explaining 
the gospel where the elder cannot go. Send us more lady missionaries. 
We have had no trouble with a single lady missionary in our field. 
I was not wholly in favor of lady missionaries when I first went out, 
because I thought they would cause so much trouble; but now I am 
always glad to see them come, because my experience has taught me 
that they can do a great work. 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that this is the work 
of God, that he has established it and that he will carry it on, through 
his servants and handmaidens in the earth. The faith of this people, 
both at home and abroad, is sufficient to carry this work successfully 
through, and the Lord's purposes will be brought about and his righteous 
designs established among men. I am grateful in my heart for the 
privilege of laboring in the ministry of the Lord. I would like to be 
able to perform the duties devolving upon me in a manner that shall be 
acceptable and pleasing to him. May God grant us his Spirit and his 
influence and power in the preaching of the Gospel, and in the building 
up of his kingdom, both at home and abroad, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

god's work and man's 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a wonderful 
organization. And it ought to be, for it is the work of God and not of 
man. It used to be said that the "Mormon" Church was the most 
perfect organization in existence — excepting the German army. In 
rhetoric this would be called an anti-climax ; in common parlance a let- 
down. As if one were to say, The sun is the brightest luminary in the 
heavens — except the moon. 

There is no possible comparison between the work of God and the 
work of man. The German army at its best represented, perhaps, the 
quintessence of military wisdom, drawn from the experience of the 
ages — but it was man's wisdom. The Church of God is a product of 
Divine Wisdom, and there is nothing like it in all the world. 

THE CHURCH ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN 

I believe, and think I have good reason to believe, that this Church, 
so far as it has been developed, is a replica or duplicate of a Church in 
the heaven of heavens, a Church presided over by the Father, the Son, 
and the Holy Ghost, the great First Presidency over the Universe. 
Joseph the Seer, having beheld in vision that heavenly Church, under- 
took by divine command to reproduce it on earth ; and did so as far as 
possible amidst the crude and primitive conditions under which he 
labored. It had a humble beginning, this infant Church; but it has 
been growing and developing ever since, approximating nearer and 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



nearer to the perfection it is destined finally to attain. Some day wc 
shall have in the midst of mankind the fully matured and perfect 
Church of Christ, and the will of God shall then be done on earth 
even as it is done in heaven. 

STAKES AND MISSIONS 

President Grant, in his opening address yesterday morning, drew 
attention to the fact that the Church today comprises one hundred and 
one Stakes of Zion and twenty-seven outside missions. The stakes 
extend through the Rocky Mountain region from Canada to Mexico, 
and to parts of the Pacific Coast ; while the missions cover the various 
States of the Union and most of the countries of the globe. These 
constitute in area, membership and organization, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT 

Each stake is officered and equipped in such a way as to constitute 
almost a church in itself. The stakes, are all independent of one an- 
other, yet subject to the stake authority — the spiritual "binding pole" 
that makes of them one stake. Even so with the missions and their 
subdivisions ; each is subject to the authority above it — the branch to 
the district, the district to the mission. And the missions, like the 
stakes, are all under the General Authority which holds them to- 
gether and makes of them one Church. 

THE EASTERN STATES MISSION 

I have recently returned from visiting the Eastern States Mission, 
presided over by Elder Henry H. Rolapp, in whose company I traveled 
through nine States of the Union and the District of Columbia, holding 
conferences in seven of those commonwealths and preaching the Gospe! 
in the principal cities, including Washington, Baltimore, New York, 
Philadelphia and Boston. I greatly enjoyed my travels in that very 
interesting region — the land of the Sacred Grove, where Joseph the 
Prophet beheld in vision God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, and 
received from them instructions relative to the opening of this Gospel 
dispensation ; the land of the Hill Cumorah, where the record of the 
Nephites was unearthed by divine direction, that the world might know 
the truth concerning the glorious past and yet more glorious future of 
America ; the land where Zion, the New Jerusalem, is to rise, and 
where a work has already begun that will prepare the way for the coming 
of the Lord in his glory. In that great mission also is the town of 
Palmyra, where the Book of Mormon was first printed; and the little 
village of Fayette, where the Church was organized on the sixth day 
of April in the year 1830. 

I enjoyed my association and labors with President Rolapp, as I 
previously enjoyed the companionship of President Callis in the' South- 
ern States, and of President Quinney in Canada — all zealous and hon- 
orable men of God.

WORLDLY AND HEAVENLY THINGS 

What most impressed me during my travels was not the beautiful 
and sublime scenes through which I passed, not the many objects of 
historic interest presented to my view. New York, with its towering 
sky-scrapers — that busy Babel of many tongues, where modern men, 
like their ancient prototypes, seem trying to get to heaven in some 
other way than the God of heaven has appointed — "The Great White 
Way," for instance; the spacious and splendid railroad depots, where 
one is almost lost in the multitudinous concourses of people crowding 
to or coming from the outgoing and incoming trains ; the glittering 
palaces, stately monuments, magnificent public buildings, and all the 
other evidences of wealth, power and civilization that are to be seen on 
every hand — these were not the things that most impressed me. For 
I thought, with Shakespeare, as I gazed upon them: 

"The ckmd-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces. 
The solemn temples, the great globe itself — 
Yea, all that it inherit, shall dissolve, 
And like the baseless fabric of a vision, 
Leave not a rack behind." 

god's GREATEST GIFT 

In that day one thing will remain. What is it? Eternal Life, 
God's greatest gift. That will abide when all else has passed away. 

The millennial reign of Christ will sanctify the earth, and help to 
prepare it for celestial glory; but it must first undergo a baptism of 
fire, in which its elements will "melt with fervent heat," and all the 
dross of its mortality be consumed. Then, by the power of the resur- 
rection, Mother Earth will rise again, changed into a glorious sphere, 
a heaven ; and the righteous will inherit it eternally. 

WHAT MOST IMPRESSED 

What most impressed me was the love of Truth, the love of the 
Gospel, in the hearts of the Elders, our boy and girl missionaries ; in 
the hearts also of the scattered Saints ; and manifested to a degree by 
the honest investigators of our doctrines and claims, those who attend 
the meetings of the Saints and listen respectfully and appreciatively to 
the testimonies of the servants of the Lord. Their love for the Gospel 
and their reverence for those who preach it, beamed from every face 
and lingered in every hand-clasp. 

I don't wonder that they love the Gospel. I love it. We all 
love it. It is the greatest, grandest and most glorious thing under the 
sun. 

THE GOSPEL OF COMMON SENSE 

Next to the beauty and sublimity of the Gospel, I appreciate it 
for its plain, sound common sense. It satisfies the cravings of the soul ; 
answers every question that needs answering and solves every problem 
that ought to be solved. It makes clear life's meaning and purpose, and 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



reveals to man his origin, duty and eternal destiny. It tells the truth 
about God and enables one to comprehend the things of God. 

THE TRUE GOD 

The God we worship — who is he? What is he? He is the God of 
the Bible, the God of Adam, of Enoch, of Noah, of Melchizedek, the 
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; the God who made man in his 
own image. He is our God ; but he was not the God that the churches 
were teaching and their congregations worshiping when Joseph Smith 
and "Mormonism" came forth. The Christian world had conjured 
up an impersonal god, a bodiless deity, a spirit that : 

"Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, 
Glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees, 
Lives through all life, extends through all extent, 
Spreads undivided, operates unspent." 

A very beautiful description — of something, but no correct por- 
trait of the true and living God. There is indeed a spirit that proceeds 
forth from him and is immanent in all things. It is the power by 
which the grass grows, the flowers bloom, and the trees bear their 
fruit. It is the light of the sun, moon and stars, and the lamp of the 
human understanding. All men and women have a portion of it, are 
born into the world with it. It is the principle of life and light through- 
out all creation. 

But that is not our Father in Heaven ; no, nor our Savior, Jesus 
Christ; nor the Holy Ghost as a personage; it is not even the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, which is the exclusive possession of members of the 
Church of Christ. It is not God, but a spirit sent forth from God, not 
Divinity, but an emanation from Divinity ; and it was what the Chris- 
tian world was worshiping, or what Christian teachers were teaching, 
when Joseph Smith and the restored Gospel came. 

Joseph knew God, ior he had seen him, had conversed with him, 
and received from him instruction. He declared God to be in human 
form, an exalted, glorified Man, and that was his first great service to 
humanity. He brought back the lost knowledge of the true and living 
God. 

MAN IN THE DIVINE IMAGE 

And how reasonable, how logical it is. What simple, plain com- 
mon sense. For if God made man in his own image, then God must 
be in the image of man. And if men and women are indeed God's 
children, his sons and daughters, what more reasonable than the 
conclusion that we have a Mother as well as a Father in Heaven, in 
whose likeness we are, male and female? 

NOT CREATED OUT OF NOTHING 

The churches were also teaching that God made this beautiful earth 
and all that it contains out of nothing. Why, a ten-year old boy 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



63 



ought to reject such a dogma as that. How can something be made out 
of nothing? Think of it a moment! God never gave such a doctrine; 
Jesus never taught it; neither did his apostles. Neither did Joseph 
Smith. In the Book of Abraham, translated by him, the Lord is quoted 
as saying, "unto those who were with him" on the morning of creation : 
"We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these 
materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." 

That is "Mormon" doctrine and it is plain common sense, true 
philosophy, in perfect accord with true science. Science declared long 
ago that it is impossible to create or destroy an atom of matter ; and 
divine revelation proclaimed it long before science did. The elements 
• are eternal; matter as well as spirit is uncreatable, indestructible. 
Out of the eternal elements God created the earth spiritually and 
temporally, with all that it contains. 

life's purpose 

And this earth is for God's children, for you and me and all the 
rest of the race. We are placed here as spirits to take bodies and 
thus become souls, capable of endless increase and eternal progression ; 
to be tested in this our second estate, as we were tested in our first 
our spirit estate. Here we walk by faith, whereas in the spirit world, 
we walked by sight. We kept the first estate and won the privilege 
of coming into this second estate, with the promise that if we manifest 
equal integrity here, we shall have glory added upon our heads forever 
and ever. 

WHERE WE SHALL SPEND ETERNITY 

What is the Lord going to do with this beautiful world? Did 
he create it merely to destroy it? No. He is going to change it into 
a heaven, a home for the righteous. I picked up a card on a railroad 
train one day, a card on which was printed this question: "Where do 
you expect to spend eternity?" A very interesting query; and a very 
difficult one for some people to answer. But "Mormonism" answers 
it, and it is the only religion that can answer it consistently. "Mor- 
monism" says that when we pass out of the body we are in the spirit 
world, and will remain there, the righteous resting from their labors — 
not in idleness, but in doing, working without weariness, without pain, 
while awaiting a glorious resurrection, when they are to have the 
privilege of coming back to spend their time on this planet, when it is 
celestialized and converted into a heaven. 

HOW SHALL WE SPEND ETERNITY? 

About the time that I picked up that card and read the question 
thereon, a similar question was going the rounds of the religious 
magazines. Thus: "How do you expect to spend eternity?" This 
question caused quite a discussion. One reverend .gentleman answered 
it in these words: "How do I expect to spend eternity? I expect to 
spend the first million years gazing upon the face of the Savior. And 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



then," he added, somewhat facetiously, "I might take a sidelong glance 
at my wife." 

Poor lone woman, waiting a million years for that sidelong glance ! 
Is it not plain that her loving husband did not know how to answer 
the question? If he had known he would have told, and made himself 
famous; but. he did not know, and so passed it off as a joke. But it 
is no joke, this problem of life and death and resurrection and the 
hereafter. It is a solemn and sublime reality. 

But assuming that he was serious and really meant what he said, 
let us consider for a moment the gentleman's reply. Does any sane 
man or woman believe that an all-wise God would create an earth like 
this, and place his children upon it to become expert and skillful as 
farmers, as artisans, as engineers, bankers, merchants or what not, and 
then whisk them away to some distant part of the universe, some world 
"beyond the bounds of time and space," where they would sit down 
and twiddle their thumbs and stare somebody out of countenance for 
a million years? Is it reasonable? Is it sensible? 

A MORMON REPLY 

How would a Latter-day Saint answer such a question? One who 
understands his religion — an intelligent, thoughtful Latter-day Saint, 
if asked : "How do you expect to spend eternity," would be very apt 
to reply : "I expect to spend it in doing there the things I have learnecK 
to do here." That is common sense. It is logical, economical. Else 
were this all wasted time. No, we are not going to sit down through 
all eternity and gaze upon the face of the 'Savior. I don't believe he 
would want anyone to look at him that long. It would be bad manners. 
We shall do in eternity the things we have learned to do in time, but we 
will do them better there than here. We will be better fathers and 
mothers, better husbands and wives, better in every way; and every 
faculty exercised and developed here, will find full play and employ- 
ment in the Great Hereafter. 

I do not mean to say that the farmer will have to plow and sow, 
in heaven as he does on earth, in order to produce a harvest ; nor that 
the good housewife will have to cook pancakes on a red-hot stove. 
But I do say that all the occupations of this life that are proper and 
legitimate are typical of and lead up to and prepare us for the higher 
occupations of the life to come. We will do there the things we have 
learned to do here, but we will do them in higher and better ways. For 
instance, when man wants light, he strikes a match or presses a button, 
or turns a switch, and lo there is light. When God wants light he 
says : "Let there be light !" and there is light. Nay, God himself is 
Light, and would need but to appear and all darkness would flee away. 

Nor is there anything contrary to law in all this. God works by 
law. But there are greater laws and lesser laws, and sometimes the 
greater suspend the action of the lesser. Miracles are not contrary to 
law ; they are simply extraordinary results flowing from superior means

and methods of doing things. When Elisha the Prophet raised the 
sunken ax from the bottom of the Jordan River, he might have done 
it in a commonplace way — might have laid aside his robes, taken off 
his sandals, and plunged in like a diver and brought the ax to the 
surface. But he knew a better way. Plucking a sprig of green from, 
a bush growing on the bank of the river, he cast it upon the water and 
commanded the ax to float. "And the iron did swim," says the sacred 
record. I believe it. The prophet's act was not contrary to law, but 
in accordance with law, a higher law than the law of gravitation which, 
had not its operation on that piece of iron been suspended, would have 
kept the ax at the bottom of the stream until raised by some other 
process. 

In conclusion. The Gospel explains all such problems, and will 
solve for us in due season all mysteries. We know some things now. 
We know where and how we will spend eternity. Revelation has made 
it clear, and good old Dr. Watts, author of the hymn, "Sweet is the 
Work, my God, my King," had a glinting of light upon this great 
subject when he wrote concerning the Hereafter : 

"Then shall I see and hear and know 
All I desired and wished below, 
And every power find sweet employ 
In that eternal world of joy." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have received a telegram from President L. G. Kirkman of the 
Twin Falls Stake, reading as follows : 

"Regret I cannot attend conference Friday morning. Services 
could be heard very plainly over the radio. Afternoon services could 
not be heard so well." 

I have received a telegram from President Richard C. May of 
the Minidoka Stake, which says : 

"We have enjoyed today's conference services. Reception good." 

President Joseph W. McMurrin has a very sick wife, which 
accounts for his absence from this conference. 

President J. Golden Kimball is confined to his home, suffering 
from a very severe cold. 

As you all know, Elder John A. Widtsoe is presiding over the 
European Mission. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Come, let us anew." 
Elder Joseph Quinney, Jr., offered the closing prayer. 
The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 



Conference reconvened promptly at 2 o'clock p. m., President Grant 
opening the meeting by announcing that the congregation would sing 
the hymn, "How firm a foundation." 

The invocation was offered by Elder William T. Jack, President 
of the Cassia stake. 

Jessie and Charlie Williams sang a duet, "Proud? Yes, of our 
home in the mountains." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

This, my brethren and sisters, I regard as a tremendous responsi- 
bility as well as a wonderful opportunity. As I have anticipated this call 
and have meditated on what I might say that would be proper, my 
mind at times has been illumined by the Spirit, to see and feel the truth 
of this work in a way that if presented in the same light to others might 
be profitable; and then the vision of these things would in a measure 
fade away. By this I have been made to realize my dependence upon 
the Lord on such occasions. 

I realize that it is quite possible for those of superior minds to 
profit more by the thoughts which may arise in their minds as a result 
of what is said by the speaker than from just what is said. The mind 
goes out farther and brings in material relative to the same subject 
and is edified thereby. I hope that all my hearers may, by the aid of 
the Holy Spirit, enlarge upon that which I may say and that to their 
profit. I also realize that it is impossible for me to make you feel what 
I do not feel myself. It is my desire at this time by my remarks to 
cause you to see and feel the beauty and the truth of this great latter- 
day work. 

THE NEED OF REVELATION 

The world had no greater need than that of the revelation given 
through a fourteen-year-old boy in the Spring of 1820, a revelation 
of God the Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. At that time 
spiritual darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the minds of 
the people ; and that deplorable condition continues, except where people 
have accepted what was revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
We have but to refer to the creeds of the different denominations to 
be convinced of this fact. I would refer you to the "Confession of 
Faith" of the Presbyterian Church, which church has a following, I 
presume, of millions of people; and these members of the church have 
by their membership subscribed to the things which are written in the 
"Confession of Faith" as follows: 

"In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons of one substance, power 
and eternity, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



67 



Quoting from "Shorter Catechism," I read this: 

"There are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Ghost; and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and 
glory." 

The question is asked in the Catechism: "Are there more Gods 
than one?" j And the answer is: "There is but one only, the living 
and true God. 

"We must not conceive of him as being like, in form, any thing 
in either heaven or earth." 

Those who wrote this part of the creed of the Presbyterian Church 
did not know God the Eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the 
Holy Ghost, as they are. The world at that time was in need of new 
revelation of God the Eternal Father and of his Son Jesus Christ. 

We have also in the first Article of Religion of the great Anglican 
Church, the headquarters of which are found in Great Britain, which 
church also has a following of many millions of people subscribing to a 
creed, a professed belief, very similar to that which I have read. It 
is as follows : 

"There is one living and true God everlasting, without body, parts or 
passions, of infinite wisdom, power and goodness ; the maker and preserver of all 
things visible and invisible, and in the unity of this Godhead there are three 
personages of one substance, power and eternity, the Father, the Son and the 
Holy Ghost." 

Coming down to a later date, let me read you what the Bishop of 
Liverpool of that Anglican Church had to say about conditions. This 
was on March 21st, 1912, as reported in the Lancashire Daily Post, and 
is as follows : 

"The Bishop of Liverpool performed the consecration ceremony at Holy 
Trinity Church, Southport, yesterday. In his sermon he said ; one of the great 
needs of the Christian Church was power. They were living in an age of great 
material power ; they had covered the land with new and restored churches ; 
they had spent great sums of money on colleges and ecclesiastical buildings ; 
they had improved and enriched their services; they had planted new -missions 
in foreign lands, and their settlements in all the great towns. Religion today 
was wearing silver slippers, and moving in high places, and yet he ventured 
to think, there was a strange want of power about the Church of God, not only 
in their branch, but about every other branch. 

"The Church at present seemed almost overmatched by the power of 
darkness. Sometimes it seemed as if the darkness was gaining on the light. 
What was the cause of the strange paralysis that had befallen the Church?" 

An admission that a paralysis had befallen the Church : 

"He believed that the Church needed today a re-discoveryi of God ; he 
believed the Church was weak today because God was so distant, so unreal, 
so dimly seen. Today they saw the results of that dim vision of the distant 
God. They saw on all sides unsettlement in the faith, slackness in the spiritual 
life, men losing their grip on those great and vital truths which had made 
Christendom what it was, refusing to face the spectre of the mind, content to 
drift and to leave things in suspense, and this weak unworthy spirit was be- 
ginning to affect our whole national life."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is an admission of the importance of having a correct under- 
standing or conception of God the Eternal Father and of his Son Jesus 
Christ. The world I say was in need of the revelation that came from 
heaven through a fourteen-year-old boy in 1820, as well as all the other 
revelations that were given subsequently to that same individual, the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. This was a wonderful revelation, the vision 
of the Prophet Joseph, wherein the Father and the Son appeared to 
him, and the Father, speaking to him, introduced his Son, who an- 
swered his questions satisfactorily. He saw that God the Eternal 
Father is a personage, having body and parts like unto man, or in 
other words that man is really and actually in his image and likeness, 
but that God is an immortal being, a glorified and exalted being, and 
that his Son Jesus Christ is like him. There was no removing this 
testimony from the mind of Joseph Smith, although it came to him as 
a mere boy. 

"a marvelous work and a wonder" 

We read in Isaiah, 29th chapter, a prediction of the coming forth 
of this great work. The Lord speaks to his servant Isaiah, saying: 
(If you read the context you must be convinced that it refers to this 
particular time when the gospel is restored. ) 

"Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their 
lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear 
toward me is taught by the precept of men : 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people, even a marvelous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." 

This one revelation — the vision of the boy Joseph — marked a 
fulfilment of this prediction. As we see the Church as a whole today, 
the wonderful effective work of this organization with the gospel and 
its principles and ordinances, scriptural appealing and true, we are led 
to the conclusion without a doubt that it is "a marvelous work and 
a wonder." 

Men and women outside of this Church have been able to see this 
and they have wondered at it. The thing that is a wonderment to me 
is that when they have given this consideration to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and the gospel which we have received 
and which we are teaching to the world and have done for more than 
a century, and which we are trying to live, that they should consider 
it the product of the mind of man and not give God the glory. It is 
a wonderment to me that the Bishop of Liverpool, after nearly b, 
century had elapsed after God had given this great vision and revela- 
tion to the world, should not be able to see the truth, to understand the 
light that has come unto us. as many, many others are not able to 
see and understand. 

appreciative of light and knowledge 
And this makes me individually appreciative that I have been able 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



69 



to see the light and that I have received the light, that I do not only 
believe in God the Eternal Father as a personal, an exalted and 
glorified being, but that I do know that he lives and that he is the 
God of this world, the very eternal Father of the spirits of all men, 
and that Jesus Christ, who was with him in the appearance to Joseph 
Smith, is the firstborn of the Father in the spirit, the Only Begotten 
of the Father in the flesh, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. 

We as a people, my brethren and sisters, should rejoice in this 
light and knowledge that has come unto us and the testimony our 
Heavenly Father has given us concerning these things. 

CHOSEN BEFORE BIRTH FOR SPECIAL MISSION 

Joseph Smith was chosen, as we believe, from before he was born 
for a special mission, the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness 
of times. We read in the third chapter of the Book of Abraham that 
the Lord showed to his servant Abraham intelligences, the spirits of 
men. He told Abraham that they were among his noble ones whom 
he had chosen to be his rulers ; and said he, "Thou, Abraham, art one 
of them." They were to be rulers in the sense that Abraham was a 
ruler in his day, a servant of God and of the people. It is just as easy 
to believe that Joseph Smith was one of those noble spirits, that he 
was reserved of the Lord to come forth in this last day, to be used as 
a mouthpiece of the Lord, his prophet, in the establishment of his 
Church and Kingdom anew upon the earth, and the restoration of the 
everlasting gospel. So we Latter-day Saints believe and so we testify. 

I bear my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I do 
know of the truth of this work. It is God's work. It is his plan 
instituted in heaven from before the foundation of the world, the only 
plan that God has instituted, the only plan that has in it the power of 
God unto salvation unto those who obey. I pray God that he may 
help us, for we need his help on every hand, that we who have em- 
braced the gospel may remain true and faithful. 

SERVE THE LORD 

We heard yesterday a message, an impressive message, in three 
words : "Hold the faith," and that reminded me of what I heard just 
a few days ago in attending a conference at Ogden. A little story 
of a cobbler who was asked what his business was. He answered, 
"My business is to serve God. I mend shoes for a living." 

Serve the Lord ! A three word message worthy of our remem- 
bering ; and if I were to add another three word message, my brethren 
and sisters, it would be this: Live your religion. And I will make 
this promise, that if we do live our religion it will mean for us joy and 
happiness in this life and eternal life and exaltation in the world to 
come. I bear you my testmony to this end in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

"The Glory of God is Intelligence." These words of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith have been adopted as the motto of the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations. I desire to apply these words to two of the world's 
great educational movements. 

EDUCATION, ANCIENT AND MODERN 

Why did people of olden times know so much about eclipses, the 
stars, their distances and their orbits? Why were they so intensely 
interested in these and other technical mathematical problems before 
they knew how to build a wagon wheel? The reason is that in those 
days the people were divided into two classes, aristocrats and slaves. 

As soon as education was given to those who had to toil, as well 
as to those who were aristocrats, this marvelous mechanical age in 
which we live had its beginning. Toilers with trained minds found 
little interest in astronomy. What did they care about eclipses? They 
were not concerned with theoretical mathematical problems, but with 
devising methods of lightening the burdens that were resting upon their 
backs. As a result of this change in the application of learning, we 
live today in an age of scientific miracles, which the mental efforts 
of these toilers have made possible. Today machinery can do almost 
anything. One of the latest achievements is the flight of Lindbergh 
from New York to Paris. 

In 1880, when Louis Pasteur, a French scientist, a French toiler, 
who had arisen from poverty, put forth the mental effort necessary to 
discover the relation that exists between disease and disease germs, he 
gave to mankind the greatest human-welfare contribution of all time, 
arising from scientific investigation. 

SCIENCE APPLIED TO SANITATION 

I have returned this morning from the city of Chicago. The 
Sanitary District of Chicago includes the city of Chicago and fifty- 
nine other municipalities. I was invited by the district officials to 
inspect and make a report on their recently completed North Side 
Sewage Treatment Plant. This project is the largest, the most scientific, 
the most modern institution of its kind in the world. In this District 
there are 3,500,000 people. The Sanitary District was created by act 
of the legislature of the State of Illinois in 1889. Its purpose is the 
disposal of the sewage and other wastes of that District. The special 
aim was and is to avoid contaminating the waters of Lake Michigan — 
the only source of water supply for the city of Chicago and other 
municipalities in the Sanitary District. 

Back in 1893, when the World's Fair was held in Chicago, 
engineers from every country looked with astonishment and admiration 
at the tremendous undertaking of changing the direction of the flow 
of the Chicago River. From flowing into Lake Michigan it was 
changed, by means of a deep cut, to flow out of the Lake through the 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



71 



city of Chicago, into the Des Plaines, the Illinois, and the Mississippi 
rivers, and thence into the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, through this canal, 
by the dilution method, the most modern then known, they had their 
sewage carried into the Gulf. 

But it was in 1895 that the first great modern hydro-electric 
power plant was constructed at Niagara Falls. This brought to the 
water of the Niagara river a new value, and at once the power interests 
began to raise objections to the diversion of the water from Lake 
Michigan. Led by these power interests, cities located on the shores 
of the Great Lakes and states on their borders, have waged a long 
and fierce battle against this diversion. So intense have been these 
objections that leading citizens have been led to think it has lowered 
the water surface of the Great Lakes, to the serious injury of shipping. 
In fact many citizens suppose that the diversion has caused most of the 
difficulties of commerce on the Great Lakes. As a matter of fact, the 
water taken through the Chicago drainage canal has lowered the water 
surface but 5 inches; and by use of comparatively simple regulating 
works constructed at the outlets of the Lakes, fluctuations of level can 
be largely prevented and the water surfaces can be held at the highest 
desirable levels. Such works will protect all interests involved, greatly 
improve harbor conditions, allow water for power to be used more 
efficiently, and will make possible the restoration and perpetuation of 
the beauty of Niagara Falls. 

THE MODERN OUTLOOK OF MEN 

In this modern day, when the men who labor have been trained 
and educated, they have brought and they are bringing their minds 
to bear upon problems of practical value. The work of reverising the 
flow of the Chicago river was hardly completed in 1900, when the 
officials of the Sanitary District began, by experiment and by use of 
other scientific methods, to' devise more recent, better, and more 
efficient ways of treating the wastes from the District than the dilution 
method. 

The purification works they now have constructed, and those for 
which they have completely designed plans, will mean, when completed, 
an investment of $300,000,000. For the welfare of mankind, not on 
astronomy or on theoretical mathematics, but on the practical things of 
this practical age of miracles the District has already expended $182,- 
000,000. Modern works like these are coming into the world because 
we are educating those who labor. 

FOR PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH 

I was at the formal opening last Wednesday of one unit of the?c 
great works. This unit alone has cost $32,000,000. State officials, city 
officials, and eminent sanitary and civil engineers of the whole land 
were in attendance. ■ 

Were the preservation of the public health of Chicago a local 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



problem only, I would not here refer to this project. But since 
Chicago is a center through which practically all east-bound and west- 
bound traffic of our country passes, all citizens may be affected by the 
health conditions of this Sanitary District. 

For the purpose of establishing, in and about Chicago, the best 
possible conditions for public health, a veritable army of civil, electrical, 
and sanitary engineers are making scientific experiments and are study- 
ing the results of similar investigations wherever they are being per- 
formed. By holding this extensive organization together in entire 
freedom from politics or other prejudices, qualified men are given 
positions and are retained in them solely because of their merit. This 
is one of the reasons why the District has been able to design, con- 
struct, and formally to open the North Side Sewage Treatment works. 
I have said that up to this hour, it is the greatest accomplishment 
of its kind in the world, for the promotion and preservation of public 
health. 

MAGNITUDE OF CHICAGO'S WORKS 

It has been charged that Chicago was not putting forth reasonable 
efforts to purify and dispose of its sewage and similar wastes. You will 
be interested to know that there are but 23 other cities in the United 
States with a population greater than 100,000 which have sewage- 
disposal plants. All of these 23 combined have expended in this line 
of work but $149,000,000, while Chicago has expended for this pur- 
pose $182,000,000; that is, $33,000,000 more than have all these other 
23 cities. 

The citizens of Chicago exhibit a real American spirit. It is 
the same spirit that actuated our soldiers in France. It is said that 
when the Germans blew out a bridge at night, they were surprised the 
next morning to find that the Americans had replaced it and were 
across the river. 

RECENT ELEVATION OF WOMAN 

That is the fir ! st of the two phases of the historic educational 
problem that I desire to mention. The other is the education of women. 

The time is short, even today, since women were admitted into 
educational institutions ; and just as the education, in years past, of 
those who had to toil, has transformed the world into this marvelous 
scientific age, so the education of women is destined to produce further 
marvelous transformations in human welfare. 

There are still many educational institutions that do not believe 
in co-education ; that is, they do not admit women. In the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there is no educational opportunity 
provided for men that is not open also to women. Side by side with 
the women, high priests and patriarchs do their studying each Sunday 
morning. Young men preparing to go into the mission field get their 
training alongside of young women, many of whom are also being 
trained for missions. You heard it said this morning by one of our 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



73 



mission presidents, that he wants us to send more young women into 
the mission field. Thus we give to the women of the Church, as we 
have always done, the same educational opportunities that we give 
to men. 

A GREAT CHURCH SCHOOL 

A great school, to which women are freely admitted, has been 
instituted by the Church. For this purpose we have set apart the best 
period of the best day — Sunday morning from 10 to 12 o'clock. In 
this school we teach theology to all the people. Side by side in this 
great Church school men and women listen to the instruction. Will not 
this equal educational opportunity now provided for women, not only in 
the Church but in nearly every part of the world, yet produce another 
profound change in the welfare, the conduct, and the development of 
the human family? 

THIS BOOK OF PUPIN's 

As part of the course of instruction, our Committee on Adult 
Recreation has recommended for our reading course this year a book 
entitled From Immigrant to Inventor, written by Michael Pupin. This 
book portrays a picture and cites an example of the far-reaching in- 
fluence that a mother may exert upon the character and accomplish- 
ments of her son. While in this instance the mother was .not versed 
in the learning of books, she nevertheless had the wisdom to perceive 
the value of education and the gift to impress upon her son the benefits 
that come from a trained mind. 

At the age of fifteen Michael Pupin came to the United States. 
Today he holds the chair of electro-mechanics in Columbia University. 
The long-distance telephone was made possible by his inventions ; the 
radio is due largely to his genius. We recommend to all people in the 
Church the reading of this book. Those who have read it appreciate 
the strength and uplift of the message it carries. It will tell you 
something of the spirit of our Mutual Improvement organizations. It 
will teach you to value in the lives of men the development that can 
come to them from women, especially the training that can come from 
mothers. 

HOW HIS MOTHER GUIDED HIM 

Michael Pupin received his inspiration from a mother in Serbia — ■ 
a mother who was not able to read or write. In his boyhood he 
surmised that reading, writing, and arithmetic were methods of torture 
that had been devised by the teacher in order to punish students, espe- 
cially boys who had appointments with their chums and playmates. 

"But," says the inventor, "my mother soon convinced me that 
I was wrong. She could neither read nor write ; and she told me that 
she always felt that she was blind, in spite of the clear vision of her 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



eyes ; so blind, indeed, that, as she expained, she. did not dare to venture 
into the world much beyond the confines of her native village." 

She would say to him : "My boy, if you wish to go out into the 
world, about which you hear so much, you must provide yourself with 
another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. * * * 
Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; 
knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and 
leads to a future life of everlasting glory." How closely these words 
approach the words of the prophet : "The Glory of God is Intelligence." 

INFLUENCE OF MOTHERS 

What think you of the power that comes into the life of a boy 
who has the right kind of mother? I urge all the people in the Church, 
especially those who are and those who expect to be mothers, to study 
this remarkable book. It proves how powerful is the influence that 
a mother has in the ambition, in the success, and in the spiritual values, 
in the life of a man. God bless the mother who whispers such messages 
of inspiration into the soul of her son. She might have said : "My 
son, if you live, I expect to see you realize in your life many of the 
ambitions and many of the hopes that I myself have not been able to 
achieve." So changed was his mind, so aroused was his determination, 
that in a short time he had the delight of convincing his mother that 
he could read and write as well as any boy. 

Later, when the teacher had observed the change in the boy's at- 
titude toward study, the teacher was so much astonished that he 
fancied a miracle had occurred. The mother told the teacher that in a 
dream she saw a Saint lay his hands upon the head of her son; then 
the Saint, pointing to her, said : "Daughter, your boy will soon outgrow 
the village school. Let him go out into the world, where he can find 
more brain food for his hungry head." She told this to the teacher in 
the presence of her son. It was like a message whispered into his 
ear. It brought higher ambitions to his soul. The words of his 
mother aroused him to action. 

A DECISIVE STROKE 

Next year the teacher selected this boy to give the recitation at 
their annual celebration. The teacher wrote the speech. While the 
mother was not able to read or write, she had a memory. She knew 
many of the psalm's and took delight in reciting them. She amended 
and amplified the speech and had the boy rehearse it again and again. 
The success of the address, Pupin relates, was overwhelming. His 
chums — unruly boys — did not giggle; they looked interested, and thus 
encouraged the speaker. Pupin writes: "My mother cried for joy." 
Heaven bless the mothers who cry for joy at the successes of their 
sons. In the great training-school of the Church, where theological 
work on Sunday and activity work on Tuesday night, are undertaken, 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



75 



we have a course of training that continues from the cradle to the 
grave. We trust that, under divine guidance, this training will prepare 
mothers who can lead their sons as the mother of Michael Pupin 
led him. 

He had heard of Lincoln during the war. His mother appealed now 
for him to be sent away to school — fifteen miles to a high school. 

a father's doubts 

Notwithstanding objections raised by the father, the mother had 
her way ; and the son, who had outgrown the country school, was sent 
to the higher educational institution. Here the boy learned of Benja- 
min Franklin and of electricity. The father had looked upon Franklin 
as an idle boy playing with a kite, and was indignant when the boy 
intimated that this American might possibly be wiser than the wise 
men of their country village. Womanlike, the mother took the boy's 
side ; and soon the father was himself convinced that wisdom might be 
found in America. To train the mothers so that they shall exert on 
the lives of their sons the same fine influence and awaken the same stimu- 
lating ambition that swelled the heart of Michael Pupin, — this is an 
aim of the Church. 

THE YOUTH'S RESOLVE 

So much had the boy heard about America, that he sold his heavy 
coat, his books, his warm clothing, for money with which to buy his 
ticket to America ; for he hoped here to achieve the success his mother 
had laid out for him. Leaving his school, he started for America 
without returning to his home. A letter to his mother, in affectionate 
terms said that, having outgrown the school and the teachers, he had 
departed for the land of Franklin and Lincoln. He assured her that 
"with her blessing and God's help" he would certainly succeed. He 
promised that he would return rich in rare knowledge and in honor. 
The story is thrilling. Will you read it ? No woman can do so with- 
out receiving new inspiration, the kind of inspiration that we are aiming 
to give to all the women of the Church. 

And so he sold his clothing and his coat, got his fare, and started 
for America. He did not know that he would have to provide his own 
mattress and blanket; therefore he almost perished. He said he had 
seen pictures of the American Indians. They did not seem to have 
much clothing. He sat by the smoke-stack during the night to keep 
from freezing. He landed in America at the age of fifteen, and no 
human soul was here that he had ever seen. When by an interpreter 
he was asked: "Don't you know somebody in America?" he answered 
that he had no relatives here and knew of nobody in the country but 
Franklin, Lincoln, and Harriett Beecher Stowe. The emigration agent 
at Castle Gardens said: "You showed good taste when you picked 
your American acquaintances."

pupin's search for "light" 

During all of his early days as a student and many of his years 
an an investigator, Michael Pupin went from library to library, from 
school to school, yes, even from country to country, endeavoring to 
find an answer to the question: "What is Light?" It was his life- 
long search for an answer to this question that gave him the power 
of concentration, and laid the foundation for his later inventions. 
He was searching for Light — the light that illuminates the uni- 
verse, the true nature of which men did not understand. His question 
stirs in me a desire to know what light in a spiritual sense truly is. 
John, the beloved Apostle, says that Jesus "was the true Light, which 
lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world 
and the world was made by him, yet the world knew him not." (John 
1:9, 10.) The prayerful life of righteous living apparently brings into 
human hearts a something we refer to as a testimany — a satisfying 
feeling that enables one to speak as did Job when he said, "I know 
that my Redeemer liveth." 

CAN PSYCHOLOGISTS EXPLAIN:? 

I am looking for some psychologist or some other student of 
human nature who can explain how it is and why it is that this prayer- 
ful life of righteous living specified by our Lord and Savior brings this 
satisfying knowledge into human hearts, — knowledge which hearts can 
feel and souls can know, but rarely can explain. It is a seemingly 
unexplainable conviction, which those who have not gone through this 
religious experience, have difficulty in understanding. Satisfied with 
the conviction that comes as a result of living in accordance with the 
teachings and example of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the 
human soul rises to such a height of feeling that there is hardly any 
sacrifice in time, money, or effort, which those genuinely converted 
will not undergo for the advancement of the cause. I ask, "What is 
this light, which prayerful, righteous living brings into human hearts ?" 

THE REVELATION ON LIGHT 

The language of a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, beginning with the 6th 
verse, refers to Jesus Christ the Son of God as "The Light of Truth; 
which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, 
and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made. 

"As also he is in the moon, and is in the light of the moon, and the power 
thereof by which it was made ; 

"As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were 
made ; 

"And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which 
you stand. 

"And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him . who

enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your under- 
standings ; 

"Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the 
immensity of space — 

"The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is 
the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth 
upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all 
things." 

SCIENCE CORROBORATES REVEALED TRUTH 

Just as the physical light of the sun illuminates the globe and all 
the dark planets ; and just as this light and its lesser form heat are neces- 
sary physical conditions of all animate life of the globe, all animal 
and vegetable life being dependent upon the heat from the. sun, so the 
inner light, the light of the spirit, the illumination that comes to the 
dark souls of men, is derived from One who is the true Light which 
lighteth every man that comes into the world. The spirit and testimony 
of Jesus is the light of the soul — the light of the world. This true 
Light was in the world, and the world was made by him ; yet the world 
knew him not till he revealed himself to those who were able to under- 
stand him and know who he is. So the physical light which, in another 
sense, is the life of animate nature on the globe, was in the world and 
the world of life was made or sustained by it, yet men do not now, even 
the most learned, understand its exact nature. 

I probably cannot give to the question, "What is Light?" an answer 
that would satisfy the scientific intellect of Michael Pupin. Nor have 
I been able to find anyone who can answer the question, "What is the 
light that comes into human hearts as a result of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ?" 

Do the words of the Prophet, above quoted, answer these queries ? 
Is Jesus Christ "The light of truth," the source of all the light of 
which I am speaking? 

READ THE BOOK 

Mutual Improvement Organizations recommend to the Church a 
reading course. This Pupin book, From Immigrant to Inventor, is one 
of the books recommended. Read it, I pray you. Study it; for the 
book impresses me as being filled with the gospel spirit. You women 
are to train up a generation of strong, noble, and Christian men, are 
destined to produce a generation of women who can teach the gospel 
to all the people in all the world — a preparation for the coming of our 
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This great educational institution that 
the Church has established for men and women, for old and young, 
will help to prepare for this great work. May we succeed in it; and 
may we have the power, the influence, and the testimony, that "to 
every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (Rev. 14:6) we may 
effectively preach this gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been restored 
here and now by the power of God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

Elder McKay referred to an admonition given by the Apostle Paul 
to his son, in the faith, Timothy. That message was to hold the faith. 
While he was giving expression and explanation of that glorious 
message, I thought of another message which the same apostle sent to 
that same valiant servant of the Lord, Timothy. I presume that he 
felt a fatherly interest in Timothy and probably noted that even that 
valiant servant of God had become somewhat derelict in the observance 
of his duty; and so he admonished him to "stir up the gift of God, 
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands." And I thought 
that if we or any of us are to hold and keep the faith the means 
by which it can be done is to stir up within us that glorious gift which 
we have received by the laying on of hands of the elders of this Church. 
I refer to that priceless gift, the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

There is an absolute necessity on the part of Latter-day Saints, if 
they are to grow in a knowledge of God and in good works, day by 
day, that they have the help of their Heavenly Father, which he is more 
than willing to bestow upon them by transmitting or giving to them 
this wonderful and priceless gift, the Holy Ghost. It is a privilege 
that we have, a promise that has been made unto all of our Father's 
children who will comply with the necessary conditions, that they may 
have the benefit of that great and wonderful gift. Those conditions 
are in the first place: Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the 
one who was chosen of God to be the Savior of the world, and "God 
so loved the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whoso- 
ever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 
Therefore, my brethren and sisters, in the exercise of this faith we 
must turn to God. 

How are we to maintain and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? 
That was very clearly pointed out by the great apostle, Peter, in his 
sermon on the day of Pentecost: 

"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for 
the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are 
afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." 

So this gift, wonderful and precious though it is, may be realized 
and enjoyed by all the children of God to whom this call may come. 
Missionaries are sent out all over the world to make the call unto the 
inhabitants of the earth to comply with those conditions that will en- 
able them to receive the wonderful gift by which alone they may know 
the things of God, that they may grow in the knowledge of him whom 
to know is life eternal. 

President Grant, in his opening address, quoted from the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants some very precious words. I am going to 
repeat two paragraphs from Section 121, which he quoted : 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



79 



"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household 
of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy con- 
fidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood 
shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an un- 
changing scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall be an ever- 
lasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever 
and ever." 

We have no doubt read those wonderful paragraphs time and 
time again, and sometimes we are disposed to say that they are very 
beautiful words. That is a literary gem, although it may not in all 
particulars comply with all the rules of rhetoric ; yet to me it is one of 
the great literary gems. Nothing more beautiful can be found in holy 
writ. But it is much more than that — more than a literary gem. 

Here we have, it seems to me, a wonderful exposition of how to 
retain the gift of the Holy Ghost, to have the knowledge of the truth, 
to keep the faith. There are two things that are stated in those 
paragraphs which are essential and upon which are predicated the 
most wonderful blessings that we can possibly conceive of. What are 
they? 

First : "Let thy bowels be full of charity towards all men." Well, 
that is a great commandment, the one that is like unto the first, which 
is to "love thy neighbor as thy self." It is to let your hearts go out, 
and especially to the household of faith, in love, sympathy and charity 
unfeigned, to all men. 

And second: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly." If 
we would garnish our thoughts with virtue unceasingly there would 
be no room for sin. We need not concern ourselves so much as to what 
we may do, every act for which we are responsible is preceded by our 
thoughts, and if those thoughts are pure and holy, if they be garnished 
with virtue, the act will correspond, and we will not wander into bye 
nor forbidden paths. We will not go to the right nor to the left; we 
will not fall into sin and iniquity, but we will walk in the straight and 
narrow path that leadeth unto life eternal. These two things will bring 
salvation to our souls; for we read that if we do them: "Then shall 
our confidence wax strong in the presence of God." That means faith ; 
that means that we will hold the faith and it will grow strong. We 
shall ask and receive, we shall seek and find, we shall knock and the 
door will be opened unto us. What a wonderful faith we may have 
if we will comply with those two conditions. 

And then we read further : "And the doctrine of the priesthood," — 
and that is the power of God — "shall distil upon thy soul as the dews 
from heaven." Not with any great bombasting, not with any great 
manifestation, but just quietly and without any assuming, as the dews 
fall from heaven. What a glorious promise that is, to be able to 
exercise the powers of the priesthood to which that same section refers 
so very greatly, and to exercise them in love unfeigned and in long- 
suffering and in patience. What a glorious thing it is if we can exercise 
those powers of the priesthood. Yet if we will do these two things, 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this doctrine shall distil upon our souls and shall fill our whole being 
from the crowns of our heads to the soles of our feet. 

And then we read on further : "And the Holy Ghost shall be thy 
constant companion." Latter-day Saints, we know how we received 
that wonderful gift. It is essential for all mankind to receive it, and 
the promise has been given to them all if they will comply with the 
conditions. Now the important thing is to retain it. , Do those two 
things. That means to practice faith in God and repentance from sin, 
garnish thy thoughts with virtue. That is the great gospel of re- 
pentance. Let your faith and your confidence "wax strong in the 
presence of God," receive these glorious blessings, let your heart go 
out in love and sympathy for your fellow men; and these blessings 
and these powers shall be yours and will lead you eventually, just as 
true as we live, into the presence of God to receive the reward of the 
righteous. For we read on still further that if we do these things our 
"scepter" — that is the weapon that we may use to combat the powers 
of evil — "shall be an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth." 
That is the sword of truth, a two-edged sword. Learn how to wield 
it, young men who are going out into the mission field. It is the 
weapon whereby you may combat the powers of evil and bring converts 
to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — "an unchanging scepter of 
righteousness and truth." If you will only do these two things, that 
will be the weapon that you can use effectively in the saving of human 
souls. 

And then comes the climax of all blessings that will accrue to 
those who will comply with those conditions. It reads like this : "And 
thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion." That is our salvation, 
that is our exaltation, that is wherein we become like unto our Father in 
heaven, exercising divine power in having bestowed upon us a domin- 
ion; and it shall increase. This dominion shall be an everlasting 
dominion, "and without compulsory means it shall flow unto us for- 
ever and ever." That is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

We read these two paragraphs and do not realize how much we 
could find within them. The President admonished us to study the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants. Last year we had for our slogan — 
the young people of this Church : "We stand for a fuller knowledge 
of the Book of Mormon and a testimony of its divine origin." I feel 
like proposing as a slogan for some future consideration: We stand 
for the Book of Doctrine and Covenants and for a testimony of its 
divine origin. The books are full of just such passages as these I have 
quoted, and they have upon them the impress of divinity. 

Let us study the word of God, his revelations ; for his Church has 
been built upon that solid foundation which brings us into communion 
with our Heavenly Father. May we grow in the knowledge of the truth 
and in good works day by day, and realize the glorious promises that 
have been made to us, conditioned upon our compliance with the" laws 
upon which they are predicated, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. , 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



81 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

It is one thing to give advice and counsel and it is another thing 
to take it. A great many of the members of the Church have sought 
counsel at the hands of the General Authorities of the Church, but they 
have not all taken the counsel that was given them. It is the privilege, 
however, of the officers of the Church to give counsel and advice when 
the opportunity affords itself. I am sure the Latter-day Saints will 
have much to take home from the results of this conference, from the 
fruits of the testimony of the Spirit, and the experience of the brethren. 
The members and officers, I am sure, have been wonderfully blessed 
during this conference. 

I wish to express my appreciation for the kindness of the Lord 
to me, for the blessings which I have received since I last had the 
privilege of standing before this congregation. I am very grateful 
for the strength I possess to stand here today, although I am not free 
from suffering while I do so. 

I know there are many people in the Church who are suffering 
today from lack of employment — from the lack of employment to 
provide the necessities of life — and a word of encouragement some- 
times helps. I am very happy to know that a word of encouragement 
and prayer, if you please, occasionally helps those who are discouraged. 
I have in my office a collection of testimonies from individuals all 
over the Church, relative to their gratitude for the blessings they have 
received — the result of a word of encouragement in an hour of need ; 
and I am grateful that it has been my privilege to perform my part 
in this sacred service. I regret that I am not able to do more of it. I 
wish to take this opportunity to admonish the people generally to take 
the advice and the counsel given them in this conference. 

I have been asked many times concerning a promise that is fre- 
quently given in blessings to the effect that the person would be guided 
by the influence and promptings of his guardian angel. These people 
have said : "Brother Smith, who is our guardian angel ?" The spirits 
of our departed loved ones, as well as other spirits, may be appointed 
to act as our guardian angels, but they are special and come by appoint- 
ment, while the Holy Spirit yields a constant influence over our lives 
for our guidance and protection. Brother Whitney has explained the 
Spirit of the Lord that is in all things. There are many passages in 
our scriptures which explain the fact that the Spirit of God is in all 
things, for they were created spiritually before they were created tem- 
porally. Every living thing upon this earth was created spiritually 
before it was created temporally ; therefore, everything that is upon this 
earth or ever has been, has had a spirit, and that spirit has had a guide 
for its protection. And so we Latter-day Saints, members of the 
Church of Christ, having been especially given this spirit, having it 
pointed out to us by special notice, it is an important thing in our lives 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to guide us. And I have admonished and advised a great many of our 
saints that if they will only hearken unto those "sweet and peaceful 
promptings" they will know the truth, they will know how to decide 
upon matters for their safety and success in temporal and in spiritual 
affairs. I know this is the truth, because I have tried it myself, and 
I believe it, that it is the prompting of the Spirit of the Lord in its 
influence over our lives. I think, too, that as long as we are conscious 
of our activity and know what we are doing we never do wrong but that 
we know it is wrong ; because we have been previously warned, whether 
it is right or wrong, if we will only listen. So I am prepared, my 
brethren and sisters, to further admonish you and further advise you 
to pay attention to those "sweet and peaceful promptings," and if you 
will listen to them and act wisely, you will make fewer mistakes and 
enjoy more peace and safety in life. 

President Woodruff advised that we listen to our first impressions, 
and that too I am prepared to endorse and add to my list of advice. 
As a rule the first impression is the right one, and if we will listen to 
it, it will guide us in the ways of truth and righteousness and safety, 
in our journey through mortality. Referring again to the late President 
Woodruff— this principle became to him a daily guide in all of the 
affairs of his work ; a wonderful example to us all. In many instances 
he and his loved ones were spared from destruction through immediate 
response to his first impression — the promptings of that Still Small 
Voice that whispered to him and guided him in the performance of his 
duty and in the ways of safety. He has left us some very interesting 
little stories for our benefit regarding this principle. 

I pray the Lord to guide you, my brethren and sisters, safely in 
your work, that you may be further obedient to those whisperings for 
your protection and guidance in the Church. I thank the Lord for 
your faith and for your prayers for my personal welfare; and in turn 
I pray God to bless you, that he will continue to bless the authorities 
of the Church, President Grant and his associates — I know that the 
Lord has blessed them, for he has blessed me in being associated with 
them. I am grateful indeed for the prayers and blessings of my 
associates in the ministry, and am very grateful for the faith and the 
prayers of the saints, for I know that they have prevailed for my 
blessing. I pray that the Lord will continue to bless this Church, and 
all those who are working in it, whether at home or in the mission 
field. I pray the blessings of the Lord upon those who may be disturbed 
in their feelings and do not know how to decide upon what they ought 
to do. If they will listen, and then act when the prompting comes, I 
predict that they will receive comfort and blessing for their relief. 
May the blessings of the Lord attend us throughout the remainder of 
this conference, and when we go home may we take with us the advice 
and counsel and blessings which are given for our benefit, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

"After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to 

preach the gospel." 

That was said by the prophet of the new dispensation in a council 
meeting of the priesthood in Kirtland on the 6th day of April, 1837. 
It was a meeting of the Apostles and a number of other brethren holding 
the priesthood, at which the Prophet had been speaking and setting 
in order the quorums of the priesthood and teaching them its doctrine, 
also straightening out some difficulties that had arisen in some of the 
quorums. He dwelt at great length upon these doctrines of the priest- 
hood. He spoke on that occasion for nearly two hours, part of the 
time in severe reproof of some of the actions, of the brethren, and then 
afterwards in setting forth great doctrines pertaining to the priesthood, 
he uttered the words I have just read : 

"After all that has been said, the most important duty is to preach the gospel." 

The trend of thought in the several meetings we have held in this 
conference has been largely in the direction of giving encouragement 
and admonition to go on in the work of preaching the gospel, that has 
been restored in this great and new dispensation of it. And so this 
passage came to my mind from the history of the Church, and I have 
asked myself several times during the conference if there has been any 
change in respect to this matter mentioned by the prophet. Is it still 
true that "after all that has been said the most important thing is the 
preaching of the gospel"? 

In a number of the early revelations that were given in the 
Church about the time of its organization and the publication of the 
Book of Mormon, there is answer given to a number of personal 
questions, to brethren who had rendered some assistance to the Prophet 
in bringing forth the Book of Mormon. They saw his preparations 
being made for the organization of the Church, and they began to 
wonder what their relationship to the forthcoming work would be, 
what it would mean to them. The Prophet's brother, Hyrum, came 
making such inquiry; so did Joseph Knight, the grandfather of our 
"Uncle Jesse Knight," as we knew him here in our pleasant relations 
with him. The Prophet's father came to know what would be his lot 
and part in the forthcoming of the great work, and the Prophet by 
means of the Urim and Thummim, which he still had in his pos- 
session, made inquiry and told them what would be their lot and part ; 
and there is this singular thing in all the answers that were given at 
that time through the divine instrument of revelation, through the 
inspired Prophet, that there was no promise made of material welfare 
and prosperity, no office promised to them, no honor among men, noth- 
ing that the heart of man naturally craves. The type of the answers 
in those several revelations, and there are some eight or ten of them, 
was the one given to Oliver Cowdery. The Lord said to him in the 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



revelation given unto him as to what he should do in the new dis- 
pensation : 

"Many times you have desired of me to know that which would be of 
the most worth unto you. 

"Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which 
I have given you according to my commandments. 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which shall be of .most 
worth unto you is to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring 
souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father. Amen." 

It was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking. 

Again to David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery conjointly this was 
said : 

"Remember, the worth of souls is great in the sight of .God , 

"For behold, the Lord yotir Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; wherefore 
he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 

***** 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be 
your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!" 

I take it that there has been no change in these principles ; that 
it still holds good that great is the joy of the Lord in the soul that is 
brought to repentance: that it is still true that if one should labor 
his whole life and succeed in bringing only one soul to a knowledge of 
the truth and into the kingdom of God, great will be his joy in the 
kingdom of our Father ; and that it is still true that the most important 
work in which man can engage is to declare repentance unto this people, 
that the ministry of this Church may bring souls unto God. Therefore, 
it is eminently fitting in this conference that our brethren should be 
inspired to emphasize this work of "preaching the gospel," and what 
the Prophet said in 1837 is still true, that "after all that has been said 
the most important thing is the preaching of the gospel." 

The strength and power of our Church and the progress it has 
made in the world and the great things that have been accomplished 
by it have been in due proportion to our adherence to this missionary 
spirit that prompts us so willingly to preach the gospel. 

Preaching the gospel is the dissemination of God's revealed truths, 
the messages of God, to the woflH. In the nature of the thing itself 
there could be no more important thing than to impart knowledge 
and wisdom of God unto the children of men, that it may save them 
to the uttermost. What could be more important than spreading abroad 
a knowledge of those enlightening truths which God has sent into the 
world through his appointed and inspired prophets? And I think I 
may say, for I feel it to be true, that in all the responsibilities and labors 
that have been placed upon the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, our people have not been more faithful in anything than they 
have been in this thing of preaching the gospel. I think the Lord is 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



85 



well pleased with his people for the responses they have made to this, 
call of his to send forth his messages of truth into the world, and I am 
delighted to see that the Church has responded also to the great spirit 
of the message that was to be delivered to the earth in the hour of 
God's judgment. St. John describes it as he saw it in vision when he 
declared that he had seen "another angel flying in the midst of heaven, 
having the everlasting gospel to preach to every nation, kindred, tongue 
and people, saying," and saying it with a loud voice, "Fear God and 
give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come, and worship 
him who created heaven and earth, and the seas, and the fountains 
of water." 

It was God's call to the world to come to the worship of the true- 
and the living God, and it was to go to all people. And it was 
particularized so that there should be no mistake — it was to go to "every 
nation and kindred and tongue and people" ; and the Church has 
responded to that splendid universal spirit and mission given to our 
Church in having the gospel restored to it. We have been practically 
to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. I have marveled some- 
times in my own heart that we should remember the undeveloped peoples 
in the islands of the sea, even in the early decades of our history; 
that we should remember people with whose race and with whose 
national life we have little in sympathy. Yet, under the inspiration that 
goes with this work of preaching the gospel, the elders of the Church 
have been sent everywhere, and almost every land and race and nation 
has given up of its sons and daughters to be gathered to Zion to stand 
as witnesses unto God and to the world, that there is virtue and spiritual 
power in this gospel that has been restored in these days ; and that it 
has taken hold of the splendid spirit of the fatherhood for the human 
race ; and by our universal proclamation of the gospel we have borne 
witness to the world that God is interested in all humanity, that he is 
no respecter of persons. In that spirit the Church has labored. 

I rejoice greatly in the report of President Grant in regard to the 
building program of the Church, by which in very many of the missions, 
almost in all of them, there have been churches erected to the name of 
the Most High God. I have a thought in relation to that work which 
came to me while we were dedicating some of the chapels which were 
builded in the Eastern States Mission while I was its president ; and 
we never dedicated a church, however humble it was, but what I felt 
and said, that here we were erecting an altar, not unto the unknown 
God, but to the known Father of the human race, the God of heaven, 
whose Son Jesus Christ is. And all through the land where we build 
these chapels we are erecting altars to the known God, to which the 
people may come and find the truth and be instructed therein. I rejoice 
in every chapel that is builded, another altar to the known God, a 
center to which the people may come and receive the truth. In this 
spirit we are erecting these chapels as altars to God in the midst of the 
people. The Savior said that the kingdom of heaven was like unto 
leaven that the woman hid in three measures of meal until the whole 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was leavened, filled with life. And so in this blessed land of ours, the 
land of Zion, these chapels, meeting places, these temples, are so 
many altars unto God, calling the inhabitants of the earth to the worship 
of the true and the living God. For it is the plain implication in the 
vision of St. John on Patmos that the whole world had departed from 
the worship of the true God and must needs be called back to the 
worship of the true and living God. 

Whenever I pass this temple, walk alongside of it and contemplate 
its towers, its architectural beauty — of course I remember primarily 
that it is the House of the Lord wherein the sacred mysteries of heaven 
are revealed for the instruction of men, and holy ordinances for the 
living and for the dead are performed — but I hold it as sacred in my 
heart as I look upon it ; and I have another thought in connection with 
it, and that is that it is a mass testimony of a whole people, a testimony 
to the world that God has spoken, and that he has revealed his truths 
once more for the salvation of men and has ushered in the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times. It is a mass — a community testimony of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, and becomes a witness wherever even the 
counterfeit presentment of its architectural beauty is published to the 
world. I love the temple as a testimony to the world of God's great 
new dispensation of his gospel, and the other temples also partake 
of the same glory and power and spirit. 

Now, I am taking too much time on these things. There is some- 
thing else I wanted to say, and it is this: We have been abundantly 
admonished in this conference to give attention to the preaching of the* 
gospel and to the living of its principles; but I am emphasizing the 
matter of preaching it to the world. Since, however, we are so ad- 
monished in this our latest conference to regard this part of the work 
of the Lord, what is necessary on our part to get imbued with this 
spirit of preaching the gospel? 

In the early decades of the Church there were existing conditions 
that contributed mightily to the spiritual life and upholding of the zeal 
and hopes of the people, but things that are not so prevalent now in 
our midst. For example, in the first years of the existence of the 
Church, the fact that we were proclaiming that God had spoken again, 
that a new revelation had been given — the truth of that was immediately 
challenged. Ministers of the gospel set themselves to work to prove 
that the volume of scripture was completed and forever closed, and, 
therefore, there was no room for the Book of Mormon, and there was 
no occasion for the revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The awful voice of prophecy had ceased. There were to be no more 
prophets. The volume of scripture was completed and forever closed. 
Well, we won that victory. It was not difficult to do so. The evidence 
of the scriptures and the genius of the gospel of Jesus Christ itself 
demanded a continual revelation if the spiritual life of the Church 
was to be maintained ; and so our early elders obtained an easy victory 
over those who assailed us on that point. But the thought of a new 
revelation was a novel one; it attracted the attention of the world; it 



ELDER BRlGHAM H. ROBERTS 87 

became a center of interest. We were witnesses of it. Well, I say 
that battle was easily won, and we hear little today of objection against 
the idea that God's power is just as great in modern times as in ancient 
times, and there are very few who will undertake to disprove the 
possibility or even the probability of continuous revelation. 

Also in those early decades we had in our minds the idea of 
finding and establishing Zion, and afterward, through the revelations 
of God, we found where the center place would be and could bear wit- 
ness of that ; and some of the saints from the East gathered into Jackson 
County and founded the city of Zion, where a temple was to be built, 
the plans of which were revealed to the Prophet. Then came on 
persecution and expulsion from Jackson County. 

Then the great point of interest for a number of years was "the 
redemption of Zion" and the re-establishment of the saints upon their 
lands and the building of the city and the temple. Well, that does not 
now play so important a part in the message we have for the world in 
the preaching of the gospel. 

Also we had revealed to us the doctrine, the great doctrine, of 
consecration of all our possessions and the receiving back of a steward- 
ship from our consecrations. We had a desire to see the wealth that 
should be created by the hands of the people more justly distributed, 
so that there would be less distinction of rich and poor in the Church, 
and that there might be a community of interests and a community 
of resources from which the welfare of the people could be provided. 
That occupied our attention for a number of years. But we are not 
saying so much about that now. It is in the background of things, a 
part of the new dispensation, just as the redemption of Zion is. But 
what I wish to say is that these several things are not at present what 
you would call live issues with us. We are not giving much attention 
to those things now. 

Again in the early decades of the Church the people were led to 
believe almost in the immediate coming, the glorious coming, of the 
Lord Jesus Christ in power and great glory, and that the time was near 
at hand. Indeed there were many who fixed upon about the time 
when he would come. Well, we still believe in the coming of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, but we do not very often refer to it in these days, and 
it is not so particularly influencing our actions and our faith as it did 
in times past. The Lord will come when he will come, and that he 
will come we are assured. The time of it is in his hands, where we 
feel that we can safely let it rest. Indeed, we must needs leave it there 
because it is part of the revelation of God unto the world that no man 
knoweth the day nor the hour of his coming, no, not even the angels in 
heaven. So I say we leave that in the hands of God. 

Also we looked in those times past to a rather wonderful and 
dramatic gathering of the Ten Tribes of Israel, with mountains of ice 
flowing down before their presence and their coming in great numbers, 
with the everlasting hills trembling at their presence, and all that. Per- 
haps we have not always attributed sufficient importance to the imagery 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of poetry and revelation in giving interpretation to these scenes. Well, 
the Ten Tribes of Israel, if they are to come in that manner, will come 
when they will, and the Lord will bring them. 

But now, what is the situation that confronts us in the matter of 
preaching the gospel ? Why, we are reaching more fundamental things 
than these. We have discovered from the remarks of the brethren in 
this conference that the world is ignorant of the nature of God the 
Father, ignorant of the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ. Few Chris- 
tians believe that the resurrected Redeemer is today what he was at the 
time of his resurrection, a union of spirit with his beautiful personality 
of body, and the two united in an immortal, indestructible, forever- 
living Son of Cod. They believe rather that the splendid personality — 
splendid as it is represenated in the New Testament to be — had been 
dissolved into some indefinable essence, such as the rose, as it decays, 
dissolves and gives off a beautiful perfume with which it dies, and 
which to produce it must needs die. And so the Son of God has 
become an indefinable presence, merely ; while the splendid personality 
which stood before his apostles when he gloriously said as a resur- 
rected personage : "All power is given to me in heaven and earth. Go 
now and preach the gospel to every nation, and lo, I am with you to the 
end of the world," for many Christians has passed out of tangible 
existence, and God has become a diffused essence through the world. 
Well, they don't know the truth about God and Jesus Christ, whom to 
know is declared to be life eternal. 

We have heard from some of the brethren here and have read that 
men do not know and may not hope to know the purposes of God in 
creation. Men confess that they do not know whether the resurrection 
is to bring to pass personal immortality or whether men, too, are going 
to pass off into something like an essence, or be dispelled into ordinary 
elements of some kind or other about which they know little or nothing. 

These great fundamental truths in relation to God and man and 
the resurrection from the dead ; and "how we shall spend eternity," and 
"what we shall do there" — they are ignorant of these things. And so 
the Lord God, early in the history of this new dispensation, told his 
ministers, (years before the Prophet announced that the most im- 
portant thing was to preach the gospel) what it would be necessary for 
them to do in order to be prepared to preach the gospel. The Lord 
said to them: 

"I give unto you a commandment — " 

These were elders waiting for the time to go out into the mission 
field— 

"I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall teach one another the doctrine 
of the kingdom. 

"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be in- 
structed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the 
gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient 
for you to understand; 

"Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



89 



which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass ; 
things which are at home, things which are abroad ; the wars and the per- 
plexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowl- 
edge also of countries and of kingdoms." 

And now, why invite this group of elders into this very extended 
field of knowledge and admonish them to be faithful in their studies 
in all these things that go back into the past, that deal with the present, 
which extend into the future, a knowledge of kingdoms and govern- 
ments and countries and laws of men, things in heaven and on the earth 
and under the earth, which embrace all possible fields of knowledge? 
Why did God give this admonition to these elders? Listen to the 
answer : 

"That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to 
magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I 
have commissioned you. 

"Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh 
every man who has been warned to warn his neighbor." 

And also in that sermon of the Prophet's wherein he told the elders 
that the greatest thing was to preach the gospel. "All," said he, "are 
to preach the gospel by the power and influence of the Holy Ghost." 
"None can preach the gospel without the Holy Ghost." 

So now, there is our work of preparation set before us, and that 
is the immediate duty and work of the priesthood of God, to make 
preparation, to constitute yourselves an intelligent ministry, operating 
and testifying in the power of the Holy Ghost. The Lord bless you. 
Amen. 

A vocal solo, "Lord, remember me," was sung by Arnold Blackner. 

The congregation then sang "Praise God from whom all blessings 
flow." > 

Elder James Duckworth, President of the Blackfoot stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. m. Sunday, October 7, 1928. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday, October 7, 1928. Every seat in the tabernacle and all 
available space in the aisles and doorways was occupied by the large 
number of people who had assembled. Thousands who were unable 
to get inside of the tabernacle listened to the services as they were 
broadcast in the assembly hall and on the tabernacle grounds. 

Conference reconvened at 10 :00 a. m. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the Man." 
The opening prayer was offered by Elder Stephen L. Chipman. 
The choir sang, "That sweet story of old." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I am grateful to my heavenly Father this morning to be permitted 
to worship with you, as I have been during the preceding sessions of 
this conference. It is a wonderful thing to live in a land such as this 
in which we dwell and enjoy the blessings of the free, to be permitted 
to worship God according to the dictates of our conscience, and to feel 
that we accord to every living human being the same privilege that we 
desire for ourselves. 

DIVINE ANCESTRY 

When our Lord prepared this earth that it might be the abiding 
place of his children, he planned that those who would come to dwell 
upon it should know him as their Father, they being created in his 
image, both male and female. He gave to those spirits that he had 
created the opportunity to have physical tabernacles, that they might 
enjoy the blessings of the earth that he had prepared for them. 

It does seem strange that so many people doubt our divine ancestry, 
and that God is the Father of our spirits ; yet from the very beginning, 
from the very earliest period of which we have any record in this world, 
he has been teaching men and women this fact. 

THE PURPOSE OF OUR EXISTENCE 

I am thinking this morning of the condition that confronts mankind, 
how many there are who do not know why we live upon this earth, 
comparatively few who really understand the purpose of the coming 
of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ; and yet in this great land of 
America, in this latter day he has restored that knowledge, and for- 
tunately for hundreds of thousands of men and women they have been 
permitted to receive it. When God created the earth and placed our 
first parents upon it, he did not leave them without knowledge con- 
cerning himself. It is true that there had been taken from them the 
remembrance of their pre-existent life, but in his tender mercy he 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



91 



talked with them and later he sent his choice servants to instruct them 
in the things pertaining to eternal life. History has repeated itself many 
times. Refusal to obey the counsels of the Lord has been followed by 
destruction, and I fear that unless humanity recognizes him as the God 
of this earth, disaster may come again to the nations. 

A BLESSED AGE 

We live in a marvelous age. No people who have dwelt upon 
the earth have partaken of so many of the comforts and blessings of 
life. No people have had such opportunities, as are offered to the 
children of men in the day and age in which we live ; and remarkable 
as it may seem, you analyze the conditions that exist, every blessing 
that has come to us has been one that conforms to the ideals of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. We do not have to go outside the Church for 
real blessings ; we do not have to depart from the teachings of our fore- 
fathers in order to enjoy that which is most precious in life, but on 
the contrary those who believe most firmly in God, those who know 
of the divine mission of Jesus Christ and partake of the gifts that come 
as a result of his teachings are the happiest people that can be found 
upon the earth. I fear, however, that the prosperity that attends us 
has a tendency to draw our attention from the most important things of 
life. I fear that the sins of men blind them to the blessings of the 
Giver of all good; I am hoping and praying with you that this great 
and wonderful nation of which we are a part may not succumb to the 
evils that afflict mankind and forsake the generous offering of our 
Heavenly Father, of peace and plenty and happiness, while we dwell 
here upon the earth. 

THE EXPERIENCE OF FORMER CIVILIZATIONS 

I have no doubt that in the days of Noah there were many people 
who had opportunities to know the truth. I have no doubt that in 
his day he was very diligent in trying to teach the people the purpose of 
their being. He knew why they were here. He knew that it wa s neces- 
sary to have faith in God. He knew that all that we enjoy comes from 
a generous Heavenly Father, and for one hundred and twenty years 
he traveled to and fro in that section of the world and proclaimed the 
truth, until finally the wickedness of the world became so great that our 
Heavenly Father directed his faithful servant to prepare to save himself 
and his household. Then a great deluge swept the earth, and those 
who had been created in the image of God, who had been alien to the 
blessings that he offered them so generously, were drowned in order 
that a new race might come upon the earth, with opportunity to learn 
of his ways that they might walk in his paths. 

You remember the experience of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. 
The servants of the Lord were there, anxious to teach the way of our 
Heavenly Father, yet the philosophies of men turned them aside from 
the wisdom of the living God, and eventually fire came down from 
heaven and destroyed those communities, not because they were serving 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the God of this earth, but because they were serving Baal and other 
false gods. 

Let us consider America and think of how our Heavenly Father in 
his mercy, directed the Jaredites at the time of the confusion of tongues, 
at the tower of Babel, and brought them to this great western land and 
gave them teachers after his own heart. It was not many generations 
after they came here until they became alien to the truth. They sought 
after those things that gratified passions and appealed to their appetites, 
and the result was that as a nation they were exterminated. Then there 
were the descendants of Lehi, those who came from Jerusalem six 
hundred years before the birth of Christ. They came to America and 
began to settle it. Then there grew up among them those who did not 
desire to serve the Lord. Those who had been faithful eventually 
succumbed to the evils of mankind; dishonesty, immorality, intemper- 
ance and all those things that have a tendency to break down civilization, 
resulting in complete destruction of the descendants of Nephi. 

Why? Because they would not serve our Heavenly Father whose 
children they were. 

Analyze the conditions of the American Indian. He came from a. 
people who were educated, a people who had enjoyed the blessings of 
civilization, a people who had been taught by the prophets of the living 
God; yet because of indifference and carelessness, because of their wil- 
fulness and selfishness, they too lost the power to reason and to think 
properly, and eventually became the obscure and unlettered and un- 
tutored savage that was found here when the white men came from a 
foreign shore to settle here. These people refused the blessings of the 
living God and lost their birthright, as did many other races. Each 
of these nations has fallen from the high estate to which God had 
permitted it to come, n3s lost its heritage because the people were not 
willing to humble themselves and acknowledge that our Heavenly 
Father was the God of this earth. 

A LAND OF LIBERTY 

Think of the blessings that came to America. How Columbus 
was inspired to go out upon the great waters and find his way to this 
western land. Then the settlers of Jamestown, the pilgrim fathers, and 
all those early pioneers who came to America because they desired to 
serve God according to the dictates of their conscience. The Lord 
blessed them and finally raised up a nation that is the wonder and 
the admiration of the earth. Those men who framed the Constitution of 
the United States were not only wise in the things of this world, but 
they were inspired by our Heavenly Father who raised them up for 
that very purpose. This marvelous government that we enjoy in this 
favored land of liberty, was given to man that it might be a blessing to 
him. Here men and women are permitted to worship God according 
to the dictates of their conscience. Our Heavenly Father will not 
coerce or compel mankind, but in loving kindness has given to them 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



93 



from the age when the world was first peopled until now, opportunity 
to know the truth. 

THE GOSPEL WHAT IT IS 

What is this gospel to which we refer? It is the only power 
of God unto salvation, it is the only plan that will enable man to go 
back into the presence of his Maker and enjoy the celestial kingdom. 
It Is the only plan that will bring peace and happiness to all the children 
of men, of every race and creed ; and it is the one plan that should give 
men a desire to serve him and keep his commandments, in order that 
they might be happy and rejoice in the happiness of their fellows. 
Faith in God, repentance of sin, baptism for the remission of sins 
after the pattern by which the Savior was baptized, laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost that men may receive increased inspira- 
tion from our Heavenly Father to enable them to follow his teachings 
and know that he lives — these are the fundamentals of the gospel 
of our Lord. Not difficult to understand but easy if we will but submit 
ourselves to that feeling that always comes to us when in the humility 
of our souls we recognize the Creator of all things. In our day the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been organized, not 
after the wisdom of men. When I speak thus I have no unkindness 
in my heart towards all these great religious organizations in the world. 
Men have done their best to give to the world a system of ethics and 
a desire to live so that the best that is in life might be enjoyed, but it 
remained for God the Eternal Father, through his Son Jesus Christ, to 
give to this earth in this latter-day the gospel that he formerly gave 
to the people in Judea, and to give to us in our. day a more perfect 
understanding of the purpose of our being. We are privileged to live 
in the blaze of this glorious century when our Heavenly Father has 
organized his Church, has placed in it divine authority and has required 
those who possessed that authority to administer, not in arrogance, not 
lifted up in their own conceit, but to go to and fro in the world and in 
humility and love say to his children : "Our Father has again given to 
the earth the gospel of our Lord, and we come to divide with you this 
mercy that gives us such peace and such happiness." 

THE DUTY OF PARENTS 

As I think of the conditions that exist, the lawlessness that seems to 
have grown more rampant throughout the world since the war, I am 
reminded of some lines of Rudyard Kipling: 

"Lord God of hosts be with us yet, 
Lest we forget, lest we forget." 

. And you men who stand upon the watchtowers of Zion, you men 
upon whom has been conferred divine authority, I plead with you that 
you honor that authority. We have a wonderful Church organization, 
but the one place where we may have greater influence than any other 
is in the homes in which we reside. We have our Sabbath Schools, our 
Mutual Improvement Associations, our Relief Societies, our Primaries, 
our Church schools and seminaries. All these institutions are intended 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to develop the best that is in mankind, but we as parents of children 
in this Church have no right to place the responsibility upon these 
organizations to establish faith in the hearts of these children that God 
has placed in our homes. It is your duty and mine to teach the children 
that come to our homes. It is your duty and mine to exemplify in the 
presence of our wives and our children those glorious principles that 
our Heavenly Father has given to us to prepare us for eternal life 
in his celestial kingdom. And if we fail to do that, then will we come 
under condemnation, and we will discover when it is too late that we 
have missed the great blessing that our Father offered to us. He has 
told us very plainly in this latter-day that those of us who have chil- 
dren in Zion or in any of her stakes that are organized, who fail to 
teach them faith in God, repentance, baptism, and those things that 
are essential for their salvation, the sin will be upon our heads. I desire 
to emphasize this obligation that is upon us, that we cannot shift to 
anybody else in the world the duty to exemplify in our lives and to 
teach these boys and girls in our homes, that as they grow up they 
may develop in the nurture and admonition of our Heavenly Father. 

THE DANGER THAT CONFRONTS US 

We live in a great and wonderful age. The glory of this century 
is beyond that of any other century; but I feel that we are in just as 
great danger as were those who lived in the days of Noah, or those 
who lived in the days of Nephi upon this great western land. We are 
in as great danger as any nation that has ever lived, because God has 
given us more than any other nation, and if in arrogance and in pride 
we turn aside from the Father of us all, and in our carelessness and 
indifference towards sacred things we spend our lives for the things 
of this world, it will not be very long until the chastening hand of an 
all-wise Father may come upon us as a nation, and we be counted as 
the nations of the past, among those that have withered away. I pray 
that we may be worthy of our heritage, that the example of the members 
of this Church in every nation where they live, may be such that others 
observing their good works may be constrained to glorify our Father 
in heaven. How I pray that we as the servants of the Lord may have 
charity for mankind, may have patience with those who err, and in 
kindness and love go forward teaching the simple principles of the 
gospel of our Lord to the blessing of every soul with whom we come 
in contact. 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith was raised up in this latter-day to bring again the 
gospel of our Lord. I know that the authority of our Heavenly Father 
is upon the earth for the blessing of mankind, not to make those who 
receive that authority arrogant, but to make them humble ; not to make 
those who have received special privileges feel that they are greater than 
others, but to make us humble in our souls, prayerful in our hearts, and 
considerate of all men in all that we do, and thus exemplify by upright 
lives that which our Heavenly Father desires us to teach. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



95 



I know that if we will serve God, if we will keep his command- 
ments, if we will honor the priesthood that has been conferred upon us, 
if we will sustain those whom he has called to preside over us, with faith 
and devotion, when the time shall come for us to go hence we will find 
our names written in the Lamb's Book of Life, and we will receive at 
the hands of the Master of heaven and earth that glorious welcome 
home: "Well done thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been 
faithful in a few things ; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter 
into the joy of thy Lord." And I bear witness of it in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

One of the tests of worth is the test of time. Whatever has been 
tried over a long period of time and not found wanting is worthy of our 
consideration. I have observed with deep satisfaction that since the 
opening remarks of President Grant the speakers of this conference 
have reverted to the fundamentals, those principles which have long 
been in force and effect, and which lie at the very basis of our theology 
and our philosophy. I sincerely trust that I may be in consonance with 
these thoughts and expressions as I enter a plea for reverence for God, 
for sacred places, for sacred establishments and institutions. 

Some one has said that the national characteristic of America is 
lawlessness. It is a terrible indictment. I hope that it is not warranted. 
Whether it be so or not, we are all persuaded that there is too much of 
flippancy ; there is too little serious consideration and respect for estab- 
lished institutions and for worthy practices which have been tried and 
proven over a period of many years. 

REVERENCE FOR GOD 

I am one who believes that morality and righteousness have their 
inception and bases in religion. I believe that God is the author of all 
good, and that there is no good which emanates from any source in 
this world other than from our Father and our God. Respect and 
reverence for his holy name are essential to spiritual growth and de- 
velopment, and in my judgment they are essential to a proper attitude 
toward all institutions of society, all our relationships and everything 
that is worth while in this life. No man can be disrespectful of Deity 
and have in his heart the proper attitude toward the creations of Deity. 
A man who properly understands his relationship to God and the endow- 
ments which he has received from the Creator, will be filled with rever- 
ence and thanksgiving. After all, reverence is an attitude which shows 
itself in a deferential behavior. 

REVERENTIAL RESPECT FOR THE BODY OF MAN 

God has given us everything we have in life. He has made it 
possible for us to live in mortality. It is by reason of his beneficence 
that we enjoy our very bodies. We who believe in the gospel know that 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God is the Father of our spirits, and that as the Father of our spirits 
he has permitted them to dwell in tabernacles of flesh. These taber- 
nacles assume a holy significance, and a man with such a conception 
cannot pollute or defile his body without offering affront to God who 
gave it to him. So I plead first for a more reverential respect for the 
body of man. It is a sacred temple wherein dwells our eternal spirit, 
and it is entitled to our utmost deference and reverence. If we could 
but teach the youth of the land this high conception that has come to 
us, they would be more loath to smoke cigarettes, to take liquor into their 
bodies, and those other poisonous substances which tend to disintegrate 
and render less efficient and less pure these holy tabernacles. 

THE HOME A SACRED INSTITUTION 

We need more reverence for the sacred institution of home. The 
home is a religious institution. It has its inception in religious cere- 
mony, and to those of the Church who understand its great significance, 
it constitutes the very basis^ of our hope of exaltation in the celestial 
life to come. All the finest of its products are spiritual. It is indeed 
a sacred institution, and reverence for those who by right exercise 
authority in that institution in my judgment is indispensable to the 
inculcation of those characteristics and attributes which are 'essential 
for good citizenship in the country and a proper attitude toward God 
our Father. Boys and girls who refer to their parents as "the old man" 
or "the old woman" are taking a wrong course to bring them into 
proper attitude toward government, society and religion. There are old 
sayings in the Bible which support this position: 

"Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded 
thee, that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee in the 
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." 

No greater commandment ever came from Sinai than that one. 

"My son, keep thy father's commandments and forsake not the law of thy 
mother. Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 
When thou goest it shall lead thee, and when thou sleepest it shall keep thee ; and 
when thou awakest it shall talk with thee." 

"A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his 
mother." 

Those principles have been tried ; they have been incorporated 
into the lives of great peoples. They have made possible the establish- 
ment of the greatest institution of society — the home. I commend them 
to the youth of the land, and I commend them to parents. I sincerely 
trust that there will be such discipline, such loving, kindly, sympathetic 
discipline in the home that there will be proper and adequate respect 
for the head of the household. No good woman will ever begrudge 
to her husband his rightful position as the head of the household, and 
I am constrained to think that very much of our lack of respect, much 
of the flippancy and lawlessness arise from the fact that there is no 
well organized, clearly recognized authority in the home. It seems now 
to be the attitude of parents, in many cases at least, that a child shall 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 97 

have the liberty and privilege of doing what he wants to do. I have, 
heard many a parent say : "I want my boy to do what he wants to do." 
As for me I want my boy to do what he ought to do. I hope that he 
will want to do what he ought to do. So much of license, so much of 
so-called liberty prevails that boys and girls are not constrained as I 
feel that they should be constrained in sympathy and mercy and kindness 
to take the proper course in life. I rejoice in the fact that the heads of our 
households are men who hold the priesthood of Almighty God, and I 
know of no place or no institution in which the dignity, the power and 
the influence of the priesthood may be more effectively exercised than 
in the institutions of our homes. 

THE SIN OF PROFANITY 

Men, do not swear. God has said he would not be mocked. "Thou 
shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." Perhaps there 
are few things that tend more to produce an irreverent attitude than 
this pernicious, vile habit of profanity. What a useless thing it is. 
What a defilement it is of the pure language which we have. I plead 
with men everywhere not to use the name of God in vain. I do not 
see how a man can love God and damn him any more than he could 
love his wife and damn her. We shall tear down the respect of the 
youth of the land for the name of Deity if we use that name in pro- 
fanity. We read the words of the Savior : 

"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt 
not foreswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : but I say 
unto you, Swear not at all." 

When men have the knowledge that we possess and they blaspheme 
the name of God, I fear for the penalty that may accrue from that sin. 
God help us to speak pure English, to control our tempers, and to set 
an example in that respect worthy of the emulation of our juniors. 
Men of the world blaspheme — I sometimes feel a degree of charity 
toward them — in ignorance of that which they do. It is not so with us. 

RESPECT FOR LAW 

Respect for the law is an old theme. It is commonly brought to 
our attention these days. I think that there are two classes of people 
who are chiefly responsible for the lack of respect which exists for the 
law and for established institutions of government. One class is those 
who hold office and the other class is those who do not. I don't mean 
by that to say that all men who hold office are responsible for the 
condition which exists ; not by any means ; nor are all citizens. I have 
always felt that one of the essential things to breed a wholesome respect 
and regard for the law of the land and the established institutions of 
government is the honorable, worthy conduct of the men who are elected 
to office, and whenever any man who is entrusted with a public duty 
and public authority abuses his office and attempts to reward himself at 
the expense of his government and the citizenry, and does not conduct 
himself with that dignity and propriety which is becoming one invested 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with his authority, he does more to tear down respect for law and 
authority than dozens of good men can do to build it up. I want to 
tell you that the youth of the land are wise in their day and generation. 
They are sophisticated, they are observant, and when they see men 
plead in fiery oratorical fashion for the support of the Constitution 
and in their grandiloquence wildly protest allegiance to the flag of 
the country, and then come to know that those same men are grafters, 
corrupt in office, they at once lose regard for the institutions of govern- 
ment and for the officials who stand at the head of government. And 
too on the part of the citizenry : Men who support such men, men who 
go around campaigning for them and men who become the bene- 
ficiaries of their dishonest practices, are likewise doing more to tear 
down that attitude which is essential to the preservation of good govern- 
ment than thousands of good people can do to sustain it. It takes 
honor, real genuine integrity, in order to beget a respect for law and 
for her institutions. It is such people who today are setting at naught 
the laws of the country, and such public officers who with seeming 
ease of conscience are failing to observe their oaths, who are sowing 
the seeds which may mature some time in the violence of rebellion and 
revolt against the great principles of equity and liberty and justice 
which lie at the foundation of our beneficent government. It hurts me, 
it grieves me every time I see men of influence violate any ordinance, 
any statue, any law which has been passed and established by proper 
authority in this country. Enough has been said in this conference 
on that subject. I here pronounce the recognition of those laws and 
their observance as indispensable to the creation and maintenance of 
reverence and respect for the Constitution and for the established orders 
of society. 

THE FATHERHOOD OF GOD 

Reverence for God, as I said in the beginning, is the fundamental 
thing. Reverence for God comes of love for God, but love of God 
arises out of faith in him, and out of an understanding of his greatness, 
his majesty, his goodness, his kindness and his mercy. My God is my 
Father, my eternal parent, the giver of every good gift to me, the 
conservator of my life, my relationships, my family, my blessing. Do 
I revere him? I bow at his feet. I humble myself in sheer praise and 
thanksgiving and gratitude for the manifestations of all his kindness to 
me. There is no question about reverence because the seed and 
foundation of reverence are in my philosophy, in my testimony, in my 
soul and in my heart. So it is essential that the gospel of Christ be 
preached to the people of the world that they understand this fatherhood 
of God, that they understand that all the progress made in this life 
is by and with his consent and his guidance. 

God bless us, my brethren and sisters, that his holy in- 
stitutions, our places of worship, our homes, the sacred ordinances of 
the gospel, our temples, our families, old age, all sacred things may 
receive our deference, our undying respect and our reverence, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 99 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Truth does not change ; it is immutable. This statement has been 
made in substance several times during this conference; the thought 
is not original. It has come down through the centuries from the 
beginning, for even in the days of Adam it was made known by 
revelation. Truth never grows old, it is always new, because it is that 
which remains when all else passes away. 

The Lord has given to the Church the best definition of truth that 
I have ever heard. We find it in one of the revelations : "And truth 
is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are 
to come." In other words truth is that which endures forever. 

A WORLD OF CHANGE 

We live in a world of change. Men are born into this world 
helpless infants. They grow and reach maturity ; they gain knowledge 
and experience, then become old and die. The earth itself is growing 
old and changing because it too is mortal, as man is mortal upon its 
face. All things on the earth must pass away. The earth also shall 
pass away, for it is decreed that it shall die. The whole universe, that 
is the material universe which we see, is changing. This truth men of 
science have discovered through their research. Not only this earth 
and our solar system but the stars of the heavens are changing, if we 
may rely on the information which comes to us. In fact the Lord has 
said that they shall pass away, and these changes are going on eternally; 
"And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so 
shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my 
words," said the Lord. 

THE PLAN OF ETERNAL PROGRESS 

In observing these changes throughout all nature a man may be 
led to conclude, without the aid of the Spirit of the Lord and divine 
revelation, that death is the end of all things ; that the universe itself 
shall pass away and cease to be ; but this is not the case. These things 
which we see changing, growing old and dying, do not come to their end. 
Death is not the end, neither of man nor of the earth, nor of the, 
elements of which the earth is composed; neither of the material 
universe. The Lord created all things for a purpose. Nothing has 
he created to be destroyed, but that all things might endure forever. 
This mortal condition with all its changes and eventually death, is part, 
of the great plan of eternal progress. As it has been pointed out, we 
lived, before we came here, in the spirit existence and in the presence 
of God. In his presence we walked by sight, but now we are called 
upon to walk by faith and pass through the various vicissitudes of life, 
gaining the experiences which could come to us only through this mortal 
probation. After death we pass on eventually through the resurrection! 
and receive the fulness of life in the mansions which are prepared by 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our Father. Death is a part of the great plan of life, for after the 
resurrection comes immortality. 

UNIVERSAL SALVATION 

In one of the revelations to Joseph Smith the Lord said to the 
Church and to all who are willing to receive it : 

"And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years 
are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the 
earth but for a little season." 

The Lord here is speaking of his second coming, of the millennial 
reign which shall be followed by a shdrt period of wickedness and 
then the end. The revelation continues : 

"And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed 
and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth." 

This does not mean that this earth shall pass away and another 
take its place, and the heaven thereof shall pass away, and another 
heaven take its place, but that the earth and its heaven shall, after 
passing away through death, be renewed again in immortality. This 
earth is living and must die, but since it keeps the law it shall be restored 
through the resurrection by which it shall become celestialized and 
the abode of celestial beings. The next verse of this revelation ex- 
plains this as follows : 

"For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even 
the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts, the 
fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; 

"And not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship 
of mine hand." 

So we see that the Lord intends to save, not only the earth and 
the heavens, not only man who dwells upon the earth, but all things 
which he has created. The animals, the fishes of the sea, the fowls 
of the air, as well as man, are to be re-created, or renewed, through 
the resurrection, for they too are living souls. 

DIVINE GUIDANCE NECESSARY 

Men, when they observe conditions upon the face of the earth — 
and our knowledge is largely limited to our observations through the 
aid of our natural faculties — are in danger of reaching false con- 
clusions. It is not enough that men be guided by reason and by 
what they may discover through the natural faculties of the mortal 
body, but also by the guidance of the Lord. We are all dependent upon 
divine revelation to know the truth concerning the destiny of man. Man 
by searching cannot find out God without the divine direction. The 
mistake made by many who seek for truth through the channels of 
scientific research is that they depend solely upon their own natural 
ability to discover, without taking God into account and seeking for 
his direction. The fulness of truth can never be obtained by the man 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 101 



who eliminates God and divine guidance from his understanding. I 
was informed one time by one of our scientific brethren that the 
scientist does not take God into account in making his investigations, but 
endeavors to find truth by research and the aid of his natural faculties. 
I answered him by saying, "More the pity, for if they would only go 
before the Lord and seek him through his Spirit and ask him for his 
guidance, they would be more likely to find the truth for which they are 
seeking." That they discover many truths is true, but divine guid- 
ance, the inspiration of the Lord, the knowledge that comes through 
revelation, would save them from falling into many errors and reaching 
false conclusions. I believe it to be a mistake to search for truth inde- 
pendently of what the Lord has given through revelation to his servants 
the prophets. 

A FULNESS OF TRUTH 

Now I must not take more time, but let me read to you one more 
expression coming to us through revelation from the Lord : 

"The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore 
record of me, saying : He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth ; 

"And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments. 

"He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is 
glorified in truth and knoweth all things." 

I have full confidence in this word of the Lord. Surely the 
Spirit of truth will be bestowed upon all who seek through the proper 
channels and in obedience to the proper laws. There is no other way. 
by which the fulness of truth may be known. Man, in and of himself, 
cannot find it ; he may be "ever learning, and never able to come to 
the knowledge of the truth." 

The Lord has held in reserve for those who obey him this great 
blessing of the fulness of truth, and through obedience it is received and 
in no other way. So with all their searching, with all their delving 
into the earth and examining of the heavens, man cannot discover 
the fulness of truth without submission to the principles of the gospel 
and placing their lives in harmony with the Holy Spirit and walking 
in obedience to the commandments of the Lord. There is no other way 
in which all truth may be obtained. It is the destiny of those who keep 
the commandments of the Lord, through their obedience, to gain all 
truth. The Lord has spoken it. So I understand the words spoken by 
the Savior in this revelation and also to his disciples wherein he said : 
"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and 
all these things shall be added unto you." And again, in the same 
sermon: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is perfect." 

May we walk in the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ and let 
our hearts be so touched by the Spirit of truth that we shall turn 
neither to )the right hand nor to the left in our investigations, but 
pursue a steady course, seeking always the light which comes from 
the Lord. Then will we become teachers of men in truth and able to

declare the things of God. So I pray in the name of our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

There are a number of visitors here this morning who have come 
from many parts of the world. We bid you welcome. Though you 
come from the remote parts of this country or from Asiatic provinces, 
we are very glad that you are here to join us in the worship of God. 
It is the Sabbath day and we have come together in his name. 

There are in this congregation followers of Buddha representatives 
of one of the oldest religions of the world. We bid you welcome and 
you can add your understanding to ours. One of your great sayings 
is: "I am the Goddess of Karma! Thine eyes, mine eyes shall meet 
in the end." You know also that your word Karma means immanent 
justice. Karma is the immortal entity, which man should follow. 
According to this thought man's thoughts build his character ; his deeds 
make his environment. What a man thinks, so he becomes. His 
qualities and natural gifts adhere to him as a result of his ideas. Man is 
responsible for all that he is. We believe this, my friends from India. 
We are endowed with free will to work out our destinies. Man is 
a divine creation, and he is able to set himself free from bondage. 

God holds us responsible for our thoughts and acts in this life. 
We bear testimony that 'Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God, 
and unto him all must come eventually, and in the end find eternal 
life in the kingdom of God. May God bless you while you are here and 
protect you on your journey. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the gospel 
of love. You are his children. We are all his children, and in an 
abiding faith in him will we find our salvation. 

There was recently held in New York City the International Con- 
gress of Americanists to which delegates from seventeen nations of the 
world came, to deliver papers and discuss the Origin and History of 
the American Indians, Among the most noted scientists to take part 
on the program were Dr. Eugene Q. Oberhummer of the Geographical 
Society of Vienna ; Dr. Jose Medina of the University of Chile ; Dr. 
Max Uhle of the University of Ecuador; Dr. Louis Cozaman 
of the University of Paris; Dr. Albrecht Penck of the Uni- 
versity of Berlin ; Dr. William Yhalbitzer of the Danish Academy 
of Science; Dr. Lidio Cipriani of the Italian Museum of Anthropology; 
and Dr. Hugo Obermaer of the Royal Academy of History, Madrid. 
These are only a few of the noted archaeologists of the world who 
came to discuss a subject that is interesting to every Latter-day Saint. 
Mexico sent three delegates, and the American delegates included Dr. 
Alfred M. Tozer of the American Academy of Arts and Science; Dr. 
John M. Cooper of the Catholic University; and Dr. Walter Hough 
of the Smithsonian Institute at Washington. Most of the sessions 
were held at the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia

University. I had the honor of being made a member of the Congress, 
and for one week, I listened to papers given by these scientists on this 
important question. 

The results of recent scientific researches on the racial resemblances 
of the American and Siberian Eskimo to the Indian ; and the supposed 
kinship between the American Indian and 'some of the Asiatic tribes 
by Russian, Scandinavian, and American anthropologists were given. 
In all there were one hundred and forty papers read in general and 
departmental meetings. Dr. A. L. Kreber of the University of Cali- 
fornia discussed the subject Cultural Relations Between North and 
South America; Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, Migrations from Asia to America 
and their Tracers; Dr. J. E. Teeple spoke on The Factors Which May 
Lead to a Correlation of Maya and Christian Dates; and Dr. Albrecht 
Penck of the University of Berlin gave a scholarly and elucidating paper 
on the subject When did the Indians Come to America? These are 
but a few of the papers that were given, and I assure you that to me, 
they opened up the subject of the history of the American Indians as 
no other source has done before. I know what you all wish to ask: 
Did the papers or discussion show or indicate anything of the 
authenticity of the Book of Mormon? 

The theory that prehistoric American cultures reached this con- 
tinent from Asia, not so long ago receives a strong recruit in the 
person of Dr. Max Uhle. Unlike many theories about America's for- 
gotten past, Dr. Uhle knows at first hand the material of which he 
speaks. It makes a difference whether one looks at the picture of a 
bit of prehistoric pottery in a book or digs the jug with one's own 
hand out of some ancient grave. Dr. Uhle's experiences convince him 
that the famous ancient civilizations of Central America and Peru took 
their roots in Asia, instead of growing up germlessly on American 
soil. China and India or Mesopotamia, he believes, may have been the 
chief original sources. 

There must be a clear distinction, it grows every year more 
evident, between the origins of America's ancient people and the 
sources of their culture. The human material of the pre-Columbian 
societies probably came from Asia by way of Alaska, the orthodox 
route long accepted for the American Indians and fully confirmed by 
the recent investigations of Dr. Ales Hrdlicka. This journey must 
have taken more than one lifetime. It purged and refined the people 
far more severely than the wanderings of the Children of Israel in 
the Wilderness. Among many social belongings abandoned along the 
route seem to have been most of the things called intellectual. The 
men and women who peopled America arrived, intellectually, with the 
clothes they stood in. 

Yet cultures undeniably high soon arose among indubitable de- 
scendants of this migration. One theory, still prevalent among pre- 
historians living in the United States, believes this pre-Columbian science 
and technology to have sprouted, by internal energy, from societies 
founded by the Alaskan migrants. Dr. Uhle urges an alternative at 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



once more reasonable and more romantic. Occasional cultured mariners 
from India, China, Japan or other lands may have landed, he believes, 
few in numbers, but full of ideas, to bring to the rude American 
societies, already purged of bodily or mental weaklings by their long 
migration, just the hint that culture was possible. Small numerically 
as this source of inspiration must have been, it may conceivably have 
been the seed from which sprouted the great achievements of Peru 
and Central America. 

These men of the Americanists' Congress are some of the greatest 
scholars living, and they are but blazing the trail and pioneering into this 
new land of archaeology. They are opening up a new country, in which 
will be able to follow new paths of study and behold new vistas of 
truth. What archaeologists have done for the Holy Bible in the 
Holy Land, archaeologists will do for the Book of Mormon in this land 
of America. We must remember that the Book of Mormon is not a 
book, but a library ; the product not of one mind and age, but of many 
minds and ages. It is a record of God's dealings with his children 
at various times, and the actions of those peoples in the many problems 
that arose before them. Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon "is a record 
of the unfolding of the divine revelation to a remarkable race of people." 
This people we believe were the forebears of the American Indians. 

The Book of Mormon is a history of Hebraic institutions of the 
American Continent as well as an exposition of Judaism. Centuries 
before Christ the Jaredites and Nephites came to America, the 
former at the time of the tower of Babel and the latter from Jerusalem. 
According to the Book of Mormon one Lehi and his family were 
colonized in this New World about 600 B. C. They had inherited all 
the old traditions of the Hebraic people, and in their teachings one 
finds the same beliefs and ideals concerning God and the righteous 
laws of life as one finds in the writings of Isaiah, Moses, Jeremiah, 
etc. Religious, social and economic life lie at the very root of the 
story of the Book of Mormon. The fundamentals of the old religion 
of the Jews are given ; as well as a clear explanation of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, for according to the Book of Mormon, Christ visited 
the people on this continent after his resurrection. Judaism is a re- 
ligious system. Its fundamental message concerns the One and Holy 
God and one undivided humanity, with a world-uniting Messianic 
goal. It is a message entrusted by divine revelation to the Jewish 
people. Judaism teaches that man is created in the image of God, 
and its teaching of righteousness is the true pathway of life. All 
these doctrines are likewise set forth in the Book of Mormon, written 
by divinely inspired prophets. Jewish writers tell us that faith to the 
Jew is firm reliance on God and adherence to him. Hence it stresses 
both faith and faithfulness. The second fundamental of Jewish faith 
is divine revelation ; and the third is belief in a Moral Government 
of the World, which manifests itself in the reward of good and the 
punishment of evil. The fourth great doctrine of Judaism is belief 
in the resurrection of the dead. Judaism holds that the spirit of man 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



105 



comes from God unsullied by inherent sin or evil. Thus man through 
the exercise of his free will is capable of attaining an ever greater 
perfection, by unfolding and developing to a higher degree his mental, 
moral, and spiritual powers. 

The Book of Mormon idea of immortality is the Christian idea. 
The Prophet Alma says: "Behold, there is a time appointed that 
all shall come forth from the dead. Now when this time cometh, no 
one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed. * * * 
Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of 
all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body * * * 
whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave 
them. * * * Then shall the righteous shine forth in the king- 
dom of God. * * * The one raised to happiness according to his 
desires of happiness; or good according to his desires of good; and 
the other to evil according to his desires of evil." 

The Book of Mormon idea is based on a belief in a supreme 
personal being, who has revealed himself in the beauty and order of 
the world to saints and prophets, and finally in his Son Jesus Christ. It 
sets forth the doctrine of man as a self-conscious moral being, and makes 
him kin to God. Man is a part of the physical world, in which he works 
out the purposes of God as a free agent within the limits of a finite 
being. But he belongs essentially to the spiritual, and the spirit of 
man and the Spirit of God have relations of dependency and obligations, 
it is in this relationship to God, who is life, that the Christian idea of 
immortality has its source and inspiration. The Prophet Alma has 
made it clear that immortality is existence with God, fellowship with 
him, which creates the whole interest in a future life. "We shall be 
like him, for we shall see him even as he is." It has God first in mind, 
and fellowship implies a likeness of character. The Book of Mormon 
shows so distinctly that Christianity is more or less the heir of 
Judaism or the Hebrew religion, and teaches that profound sense of 
sin which recognizes that it means separation from God. Its ideal 
is to be perfect "even as your Father in heaven is perfect." 

It must not be supposed that all ideas of immortality are the same. 
The Egyptian conceptions were far different from the Hebraic; so 
were the Greek views and the Indian thought. This is clearly shown by 
a reading of the book so well edited by the Rev. Sir James Marchant 
of Oxford. For example, the Greek mind held that Gods and men are 
the same in birth, and evil is metaphysical and not ethical. To the 
Christian, sin is not so much a breach of the law as a violation of love. 
The filial relation to God is everything to Christianity. So the Prophet 
Alma taught clearly that immortality is a restoration to the fellow- 
ship of God through Jesus Christ. It all requires the imparting of a 
new principle of action, or the possession of a new life giving power, a 
kind of new birth, in short, a Christ likeness. * * * "He that 
believeth on the Son hath eternal life, and is passing on to fulness of 
life, to 'more abundance.' " Immortality therefore to the Christian 
sense and Book of Mormon meaning is not due to any metaphysical 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



quality of the soul, but to a personal relationship to God, "Because as 
1 live, ye shall also live." 

Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon shows God at work in the 
life of the human race. Its supreme revelation is of the human heart, 
and life touched by the Spirit of God. Its power and value is this, and 
it is from beginning to end a book of life. It becomes in this light, 
colorful, gripping, vivid, laying its hold on our imaginations and our 
souls. It inspires, it lifts our minds to God, and herein is its power. 

To your question then : Archaeology and the Book of Mormon. 
Man has brought to light great cities and temples in this America. 
Statues, pottery, buildings, and jewelry are discovered almost daily, and 
today, America is considered one of the richest fields of the world for 
the student of archaeology. Not yet have scholars found definite 
remains or ruins that coincide with Book of Mormon history. Yet the 
scientist, the archaeologist is discovering remains that not only indicate 
that in the not far distant future may be clearly related to Book of 
Mormon history, but Semitic origins will be found in this land, and 
the institutions so well described in the Book of Mormon will be 
made clearer by archaeologists, as they have done in Mesopotamia, 
Palestine, and Egypt by finding remains and ruins that absolutely 
verify Biblical history and life. 

Among the Indians of our continent, both north and south, we have 
traditions as to their lives in the past, and according to the light of 
sociology that has recently been given by one of our leading socioligists, 
no legend or myth or tradition comes down to us from the remote 
past, but what it shows something of the belief and the lives of the 
people who gave it. So we have a great work to perform among these 
American Indians. There are some three hundred thousand of them 
in the United States at the present time, and over three thousand in 
the State of Utah alone. They have had fine conceptions of life, and if 
the truth of God, the principles of the saving grace of Christ can be 
carried to them as they are elucidated in the Book of Mormon, I firmly 
believe that the American Indians, the aborigines of this continent will 
yet be brought to a knowledge of the truth. An old song of the 
Pawnees is a song to the new day. 

"Day is here ! Day is here, is here ! 
Arise, my son, lift thine eyes, 
Day is here ! , Day is here, is here ! 
Day is here ! Day is here, is here ! 
Look up, my son, and see the day. 
Day is here! Day is here, is here!" 

May we become more interested in the American Indian and in 
his cause, I hope and pray. May the government of the United 
States come to a fuller realization of how unjustly he has sometimes 
been treated in the past, and that from now on justice may come to 
this man, to these people; and that God may inspire us to carry 
the message of salvation to them all, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I desire to read a poem recently discovered among the writings 
of our gifted hymn writer, Elder Parley P. Pratt : 

"Truth eternal, truth divine! 
In thine ancient fulness shine; 
Burst the fetters of the mind 
From the millions of mankind, 
Set the longing nations free, 
Give the world a jubilee. 

"Ages past have owned thy sway, 
Prophets hailed thy joyful day; 
In thy cause in days of yore 
Battle-fields were stained with gore, 
Saints and seers and heroes fought, 
Men and angels wonders wrought. 

''Truth again restored to earth, 
Opened with a prophet's birth, 
Priests of heaven's royal line, 
Bearing keys of truth divine, 
Wide o'er earth the tidings flew, 
Truth into a kingdom grew. 

"Truth shall triumph as the light 
Chases far the misty night, 
Hurl the tyrant from his throne, 
Conquer death, and reign alone, 
Endless ages own its sway, 
Clad in everlasting day." 

TRUTH WILL PREVAIL 

I desire in this connection to read the following verses from the 
88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

"And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also 
preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same. 

"That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become 
a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, 
cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, 
they must remain filthy still." 

I desire to add, in connection with these inspired utterances, a 
word of warning and testimony in connection with that which has 
been borne by my brethren to the Latter-day Saints assembled in 
conference this morning. I am happy to find myself in full accord 
with all that has been expressed. But I do feel in my soul that we 
have reached the day spoken of by the prophets of old, and by the 
Lord himself in this generation, when everything will be shaken that 
can be shaken, and nothing shall remain except that which is truth 
and is established by the Lord. It was easy, in the dark ages, for a 
glimmer of truth to attract the attention of men who were in such dense 
darkness, but it is not easy for a small glimmer of truth to attract 
attention in an age when the blaze of light is so resplendent as to be 
seen everywhere.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A TESTING TIME 

More light and knowledge has come to the earth in this genera- 
tion than in all ages before — and a religion that can attract the 
attention of men and can stand the scrutiny of investigation and shine 
in the presence of light such as the world enjoys today, is an unusual 
religion. There is nothing so sacred, nor ancient, but must meet the 
sifting process that presently will be in operation. For it is the age 
when everything is being questioned. How has Mormonism stood? 
How will it stand in this period of testing? It has stood the trials 
of the past. It stands today vindicated in its teachings, even in the 
presence of science, learning, knowledge and history. It will stand 
in the future. 

I recognize the foundation upon which it has been established as 
the truth, and how my heart grows in faith, my understanding increases 
and my soul is filled with joy to witness the strength and power of 
this Church, even in this age of doubt and of uncertainty. 

A spirit of doubt and uncertainty is creeping over the faith of 
the world. We were told in an address by an eminent minister at a 
gathering of religionists in California during this last summer, that 
sixty per cent of the people of the United States have no religious 
affiliation; that twenty-five million young people in the United States 
are growing up without any religious teaching. 

I confess to you that it is also a time when institutions that God 
established, that are political, will be shaken, but, thank the Lord, they 
will stand, for they too are the truth. 

our nation's security 

The Prophet Joseph told us that he saw the day when even the 
Constitution of the United States would be torn and hang as by a 
thread. But, thank the Lord, the thread did not break. He saw the 
day when this people would be a balance of power to come to its 
defense. The Book of Mormon prophecies concerning the future of 
America have been referred to in our hearing during this conference, 
wherein it is stated that this nation, though it becomes a mighty nation, 
still it can stand in security here only as it serves the God of this land. 
That conception was in the hearts of the men who founded America. 

I was recently looking over some of the utterances of our fathers 
who established these glorious institutions. One of the great states- 
men of our land, Webster, jsaid : 

"If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible, our country will go on 
prospering and to prosper, but if we or our posterity neglect its instructions 
and authority, no man can tell how suddenly catastrophe may overwhelm us 
and bury all our glory in profound obscurity." 

Washington in his farewell address said : 

"Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, 
for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the 
instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution 
indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. What- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



109 



ever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar 
structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality 
can prevail in exclusion of religious principle." 

When Benjamin Franklin, eighty years of age, stood before the 
Congress of the United States, trying to produce an instrument on which 
they could frame the Constitution, and they being about to abandon that 
effort, he made this appeal which won these men to God and to the 
accomplishment of the great purpose of establishing our Constitution: 

"In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensi- 
ble of danger, we had daily prayers in this room for divine protection. Our 
prayers, sir, were heard ; and they were graciously answered. All of us who 
were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a 
superintending Providence in our favor. To that kind Providence we owe this 
happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the jmeans of establishing our 
future national felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? 
Or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance? I have lived, sir, 
a long time ; and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this 
truth — that God governs in the affairs of men; and if a sparrow cannot fall to 
the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without 
His aid? We have been assured, sir, in sacred writings, that 'except the 
Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it.' I firmly! believe this ; 
and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this 
political building no better than the builders of Babel." 

This was the spirit of the men who established America. May 
God keep that spirit burning forever in the hearts of the men who con- 
tinue to lead it. I want to say that I have discovered that that spirit 
has been in the hearts of the men and is in the hearts of the men 
who preside over the destinies of America, though it may not be in 
the hearts of all the people. They announced their faith when they 
blazoned upon our coin the motto, "In God we trust." They breathed 
it into their songs when they said: 

"Our fathers' God to thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To thee we sing — " 
r f ■ "Long may our land be bright 

With Freedom's holy light, 
Protect us by thy might, 
Great God, our King!" 

Other nations might boast of their kings, but the King of Amer- 
ica, proclaimed by the patriotic fathers who founded it and established 
it, is the great God of heaven. This must continue to be the senti- 
ment of the people of America if the'se glorious institutions shall be 
preserved, and in our hands is the sacred keeping of these great and 
glorious principles. 

THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH 

The Latter-day Saints have taken a very definite stand in reference 
to their attitude towards the government, and towards the great prob- 
lems of life. Have we had to shift our position? Has it been 
assailed successfully? When we have declared our loyalty and patriotism 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to the Constitution and the government, and that we recognize that 
the duty of the Latter-day Saints is to uphold and support the laws 
of the land as faithfully as they do the laws of the Church, were 
we right? Any people who depart from that will not be able to 
preserve a civilization very long. Are we right in the promulgation 
of the doctrine that we have advocated of the single standard of virtue, 
wherein we require the young man of our Church to be as clean and 
as pure as the girl he asks to be his wife, the mother of his children? 
Are we right in our conception of marriage for time and for eternity? 
Have we had to recede from that position? In the building of this 
family relationship, of which we have heard, forever and forever we 
stand upon solid ground and cannot be shaken from it. In the glorious 
conception we have of the redemption of our dead, extending to those 
who died and passed beyond the veil without opportunity, that through 
the vicarious work God has established in his Church, these holy 
blessings may come to them, are we right? Have we had to recede 
from that position? In the promulgation of the doctrine of the law 
of tithing, wherein each man is placed under a certain obligation to 
the Lord to pay his tenth, whether he be rich or whether he be poor, 
are we right? Have we had to recede from that position? No, men 
are growing in numbers who acknowledge the righteousness of the 
plan. Are we right in our missionary syistem that calls forth these 
thousands of young men and women who freely give themselves and 
pay their way to go to the ends of the world to preach this gospel? 
Are we right or are we wrong? We know we are right. The prin- 
ciple has been acknowledged as the finest plan by which the gospel 
message may be carried to the children of men. 

Recently an eminent professor said to the General Board of the 
Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, 
in discussing the question of the ills of modern youth: "The 'Mor- 
mon' Church is founded and established very well, better than any other 
institution in the world, and has opportunities to hold it;s young people, 
for you give them something to fight for. You put a responsibility 
upon them and send them forth to champion a cause. You will hold 
them as long as you have something worth fighting for." And we 
have. 

I could go through each principle of the gospel that has been 
revealed to us and show, I am sure, my brethren and Jsisters, that the 
attitude of the leaders of this Church affecting the lives of the people 
as to the solution of the great problems of this age is right, and that 
each principle is right. 

A NEW TEST 

I do not fear all the tests that are before us. I have recognized 
now for !some time past that a new test is coming to the Saints — the 
test of peace and of prosperity. The most severe test that has ever 
come to any people is the test of peace and prosperity. Having sur- 
vived the troubles of the past I am as sure as that I live that this 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



111 



Church, the great majority of thi!s people, will stand the test of peace 
and of prosperity. Though many may fall, though many may hesitate 
and falter, this work is established to stand forever, and never to 
fail. It is founded upon the truth. 

A GLORIOUS AGE 

Who wants to hesitate now? Who wants to desert the ranks in 
such a glorious cause which is presently to be triumphant and vic- 
torious? There never has been an age in all the glorious past when 
there was such an opportunity for the truth as today. This age of 
questioning is all in favor of truth. Let error vanish, let superstition 
and ignorance go; it is the age when the truth shall be triumphant. 
Those who know the truth have reason to take courage and to be 
affiliated with those who are the champions of truth, for it is the 
age of truth's victory. It will come. Yes, not only shall the doctrines 
and the theories of men be shaken, but the very earth itself. This is 
the age when it too is to be shaken; and this was all understood by 
the Master who built the earth, the Lord Jesus Christ. Worlds with- 
out number he has made, and he knows how they will behave and 
when they will misbehave; he knows the period of the earth's con- 
vulsions. Whatever may be the cause of our present unusual storms, 
cyclones and disturbances, whether they are caused by sun spots or 
what not — he who made this world knew when would come the period 
of its misbehavior, as accurately as the astronomer can forecast the 
coming of an eclipse. And he knew that this disturbance bore a 
certain relationship to other great and important events, namely, his 
coming to dwell among men in the flesh. 

I bear witness to you that God is speaking in the interest of truth 
and in the interest of the establishment of his work, even by the very 
elements : and he will speak in an effort to cause men in their mad 
rush for pleasure to stop, to ponder, to ask themselves whether or 
not God be in the affairs of men. May men repent, may they save 
themselves by accepting the principles of the gospel. God himself 
cannot save them, only as they comply with the rules of eternal truth. 
If they disregard them they put themselves beyond his power. He 
can do nothing for them. 

god's promises to be realized 

I bear witness that I know as I know I live that this is God's work 
and that Jesus Christ did visit the earth. I know that he did speak 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that the Book of Mormon is the very 
truth, and that Mormonism is indeed God's work, founded and 
established to endure. Let us go home and kindle the fire, where it is 
burning low, in the hearts of the wayward, the careless and indifferent. 
There is only one protection for us, and that is to keep the command- 
ments of God. If we will do that I will tell you that the period now 
before us will be full of blessings, full of promise, full of hope and 
full of glory for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



know that the glorious future is more wonderful than all the past. It is a 
time for men and women to re-dedicate themselves to God and his 
service, not to be tired nor weary in well doing. The future is so full 
of promise, the realization of all that has been promised in the revela- 
tions of the Lord to his servants will be realized. I am more grateful 
than I can express this day for my standing in this Church, in this 
glorious work. God speed it forward and keep us in its ranks, that 
we and our children may be counted with the victorious in that 
day of triumph which is to come. God 'speed that day, I prav in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Awake my soul." 
The benediction was offered by Elder Alonzo A. Hinckley, Pres- 
ident of the Deseret stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2:00 p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the conference was held in the tabernacle on 
Sunday afternoon, October 7, 1928, at 2 o'clock. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire is 
burning." 

The invocation was offered by Elder James W. Funk, President of 
the Benson stake. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Gloria." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for the privilege of attend- 
ing this remarkable conference, for to me it has been a most remarkable 
one in so many ways. The instructions given, the testimonies borne, 
the interest shown by the thousands attending each session, and no 
doubt other thousands listening in by radio, must be most gratifying to 
all who are interested in the welfare and growth of God's Latter-day 
work. 

WORK NECESSARY FOR PROGRESS OF CHURCH 

I pray that what I may say at this time will be acceptable to our 
Heavenly Father and will inspire in the hearts of the saints a greater 
determination to serve God, keep his commandments, and work, work, 
work, to bring about God's great plan as revealed to his Prophet, Joseph, 
in this the last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times. 
The .lazy, the indolent have little place in carrying forward God's 
plans. This is so in this age, and has been from the beginning, and 
will continue to be so until the end. The growth of the Church has 
not been accomplished by the idler, the fault-finder, the whiner, the 



ELDER REED SMOOT

mentally or physically unclean, but by the industrious, the faithful, the 
unselfish, the defenders of its principles, be they poor, well-to-do or 
wealthy. The gospel of Jesus Christ enters into the every-day life 
of every one of its adherents. 

I often read Solomon's exhortation to the study of wisdom against 
idleness and things hateful to God. I will read you one statement made 
by him touching the question of idleness, and it is as true today as 
when uttered by Solomon: 

"Go to the ant, thou sluggard ; consider her ways, and be wise : 
"Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 

"Provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest. 
"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy 
sleep? 

"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep ; 
"So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed 
man." 

For years on the front cover of the "Juvenile Instructor" there 
appeared these words : "There is no excellence without labor." 

The necessity and advantages of work have been stressed in all 
ages of the world, and I call to mind a revelation given through 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet, on February 9, 1831, in the presence of 
twelve elders, and I find in that revelation, Section 42, Paragraph 42, 
the following: "Thou shalt not be idle, for he that is idle shall not 
eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer." 

life's master word 

In an address by Dr. William Osier, to a group of young physicians, 
he made this statement on "Life's Master Word" : 

"Though a little one, the master-word looms large in meaning. It is the 
opening to every portal, the great equalizer in the world, the true philosopher's 
stone which transmutes all base metal of humanity into gold. The stupid man 
among you it will make bright, the bright man brilliant, the brilliant student 
steady. With the magic word in your heart all things are possible, and without 
it all study is vanity and vexation. The miracles of life are with it ; the blind 
see by touch, the deaf hear with eyes, the dumb speak with fingers. To the 
youth it brings hope, to the middle-aged confidence, to the aged repose. True 
balm of hurt, in its presence the heart of the sorrowful, is lightened and con- 
soled. It is directly responsible for all advances in medicine during the past 
twenty-five centuries. With it Virchow smote the rock, and the waters of 
progress gushed out; while in the hands of Pasteur it proved a very talisman, 
to open to us a new heaven in medicine and a new earth in surgery. Not only 
has it been the touchstone of progress, but it is the measure of success in 
everyday life. Not a man before you but is beholden to it for his position here. 
And, the master-word is WORK, — a little one, as I have said, but fraught with 
momentous sequences if you can but write it on the tablets of your hearts and 
bind it upon your foreheads." , 

Dr. Osier's forceful statement is wonderfully exemplified in the 
labors and activities of all great pioneers in all ages of the world that 
we have record of. There are thousands of them, but none greater 
than those whose lives were dedicated to our Heavenly Father's work 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and steadfastly lived, labored, and, in many cases became martyrs 
in its defense. 

PAUL, THE WORKER 

Consider Paul, the worker. He, by his strenuous activity, his 
zeal, his industry, must have impressed the people of his age that work 
or labor was honorable, that it occupies the place it richly deserves. 
Paul did not consider work a means of making a living, but as an 
opportunity of making a life. Paul preferred a laborious life to one 
of ease and pleasure. As all super-men, he rendered a service to 
mankind. He learned in his later years that work was the real secret 
of accomplishment, and further, that accomplishment was the real 
secret of happiness. Having a knowledge of these facts, Paul was 
able to say: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, 
I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of 
righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at 
that day." 

These were the words of Paul, the militant apostle, after suffering 
opposition, discouragement, imprisonment, threats of death — still he 
could tell the world in modesty, but convincingly, that he had met his 
task squarely and finished it thoroughly. 

HEZEKIAH A MAN OF ACTION 

I call to mind another remarkable character in the Bible, of whom 
it is said, "And in every work that he began, he did it with all his heart 
and prospered." His accomplishments were ordinary — simply one of 
that age performing his daily tasks unnoticed, but when a problem 
that he alone could solve came to him, he was aroused by divine 
enthusiasm. The real object of life was made manifest to him. It was 
a time for action, courage, determination. His decision would make 
or mar his career. "Forward" was the word, and Hezekiah obeyed. 
Life and all he possessed were at stake. He now realized that dreams 
meant nothing until they became realities. Hezekiah from that moment 
had no time for making excuses, no time to complain, no time to count 
the cost. His task was God's call, and it must and shall be accomplished. 

Notwithstanding that almost unsurmountable difficulties crossed 
his path, he never wavered in his determination to accomplish the work. 
No matter what happened, he had his work to do. Nothing could 
swerve him from it — he had learned the lesson that "There is no 
excellence without labor." He had not time to envy the success of 
others. He had a vocation to master. He had found his place. He 
believed implicitly in hard work. It is no wonder he never experienced 
drudgery, discontent, dissatisfaction. 

The characters of Paul and Hezekiah were just the opposite from 
that of the unfaithful servant who went away and hid his talent in 
the earth. In the latter case excuses were submitted for honest effort, no 
doubt whining because he was not forging ahead, always waiting for 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



115 



somebody to help him, ever watching the clock or listening for the 
whistle to blow, imagining that his pathway was strewn with difficulties 
and joining in the chorus of the army of failures and wails, "I've never 
had a chance ; there's no use trying." 

Too many people are quitters. They are always looking for bar- 
gains, discounts, short-cuts to success, rather than facing life's problems 
squarely. Some are good starters, but poor finishers. Edgar A. Guest 
expresses the tragedy of many a life as follows: 

"How do you tackle your work each day? 

Are you scared of the job you find? 
Do you grapple the task that comes your way 

With a confident, easy mind ? 
Do you stand right up to the work ahead. 

Or fearfully pause to view it? 
Do you start to toil with a sense of dread, 

Or feel that you're going to do it?" 

THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A PROPHET 

I now call to mind a more modern servant of God, one chosen by 
our Heavenly Father to open this gospel dispensation. See what he 
accomplished through direct instructions and assistance from our 
Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, as well as other ordained 
personages, having the authority to confer upon him the necessary 
powers to organize again the Church of Jesus Christ with all of its 
powers, authority and blessings, enjoyed by the Church over which the 
Savior presided during his mortal life. I refer to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Let me recite to you some of the things the Prophet Joseph 
Smith accomplished before he was thirty-nine years of age. 

He had seen the Father and the Son, and had held eight conver- 
sations with the Prophet Moroni. He had received the Aaronic priest- 
hood from John the Baptist and the Melchizedek priesthood from the 
apostles, Peter, James, and John. He had translated the Book of 
Mormon by the power of God, and had had it printed and in circulation 
among the people of the nation. Joseph Smith had organized the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by instruction from heaven, and 
had received a number of revelations from God. He had received the 
keys from (Elijah, turning the hearts of the children to the fathers, 
and from Moses he had received the keys of the gathering. He had 
communicated with Elias, who committed to him the dispensation of thes 
gospel of Abraham, and had planned two temples, one at Kirtland 
and one at Nauvoo. Before he was twenty-five years of age he had 
received nearly two hundred revelations from God and had translated 
the Book of Abraham from rolls of papyrus written by Abraham him- 
self while he was in Egypt, which came from the catacombs of Egypt. 
He had received revelations and visions of the writings of Moses as 
contained in the Pearl of Great Price giving, among other things, a 
minute account of the rebellion in heaven and of the creation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE NEED OF PERSEVERANCE 

What is needed by the saints today is more of that particular brand 
of perseverance which makes one unable to rest while important things 
are half accomplished, and urges him to keep up the pace until the course 
is run. We must be more than average workers. We must do something 
more than average work. "My son," said Bob -Burdette, "you have to 
work. Whether you handle pick or wheelbarrow or a set of books, dig- 
ging ditches or editing a newspaper, ringing an auction bell or writing 
funny things, you must work. Don't be afraid of killing yourself by 
over-working on the sunny side of thirty. Men die sometimes, but it is 
because they quit at nine p. m. and don't go home until two a. m. 
It's the intervals that kill, my son. * * * Take off your coat and 
make dust in the world. The busier you are, the less harm you are apt 
to get into, the sweeter will be your sleep, the brighter your holidays, 
and the better satisfied the whole world will be with you." "Keep your 
boys busy," said Brigham Young, "even if you have to have them dig 
a hole and fill it up again." Remember, "an idle brain is the devil's 
workshop." 

When a boy, Kipling accompanied his father on a sea voyage. 
The father was lying on his bed when a frightened sailor rushed to his 
door crying, "Your son ! Your son !" The frightened father sprang, 
to his feet exclaiming, "What is the matter?" "He has climbed out 
on the foreyard and if he lets go he will be drowned." "Oh, is that 
all ?" replied Kipling, Sr., as he lay down again. "He won't let go." 

I call to mind a statement of Alexander Hamilton, one of America's 
most brilliant statesmen, as follows: "People called me talented, but 
all the talent I have is the ability for hard work, and through that has* 
come all the success I have ever attained." 

Robert Louis Stevenson upon one occasion said, "I know what 
pleasure is, for I have done good work." 

We all remember the inspired words of M. D. Babcock, when she 

said: 

"We are not here to play, to dream, to drift; 
We have hard work to do, and loads to lift : 
Shun not the struggle ; face it ; 'tis God's gift." 

This gospel shall be preached to every kindred, tongue and people, 
and God is fast preparing the way for its accomplishment. We are 
living in the last dispensation — the beginning of the end. Give us 
wisdom and strength, O Father, that we may work for its advancement 
and not weary. 

I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the 
living God ; that Joseph Smith was called of God and under divine 
instruction organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
This Church will never be destroyed nor given to another people. 
Father, we thank thee for this conference; sanctify all that has been 
said and done to the advancement of thy Church and its mission on 
earth, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Among the many outstanding features of this conference one has 
appealed to me with unusual force, namely the sustained note of jubila- 
tion — righteous jubilation and thanksgiving, I believe — over the pro- 
gress of the Church, its growth, and, what is more, its development as 
shown in the facts set forth by statistics and other data, convincing us 
of the steady progress of this the Church of Jesus Christ. We have 
reason to be grateful ; the results show it. But this joy and rejoicing has 
been wisely tempered by advice and counsel regarding our important 
duties. There has not been lacking the note of warning lest we fail 
in greater or lesser measure, lest we begin to retrograde rather than 
advance. 

"ZION PROSPERS" IS ALL WELL ? 

It is well to sing "Zion Prospers," pleasing to be able to chant 
"All is Well;" and when we so sing in the spirit of thanksgiving and 
appreciation the Lord accepts our songs as praise. But it is possible for 
us to sing in another tone and speak the same words, chant the same 
melody, and yet be unacceptable unto the Lord. Indeed as I mention 
this, one of our popular songs, I call to mind that the very title of it 
was used by an ancient prophet by way of warning unto the people. 
The Prophet Nephi warned the people against lethargy and neglect, and 
pointed out that many were thus comforting themselves with the 
thought that they needed to do little or nothing, for all was well in 
Zion. Speaking of the wiles of the evil one, the devil himself, Nephi 
said : 

"And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that 
they will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and 
thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down 
to hell. * * * 

"Therefore, woe be unto him that is at ease in Zion ! 

"Woe be unto him that crieth: All is well! 

"Yea, woe be unto him that heakeneth unto the precepts of men, and 
denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost I" 

I would not place that pleasing song under ban, but when we 
sing it, let us sing it in the right spirit and not bring the woes upon 
ourselves for excusing our lethargy and our laziness by crooning, 
"Zion prospers, all is well." 

THE MOMENTUM OF THE CHURCH 

How much have I, how much have you contributed to Zion's 
prosperity, my brethren, my sisters ? Let each one take the question to 
himself. Many are being carried by the resistless momentum of this 
great Church, this wonderful work — swept along with it. And they 
are rather a drag than a means of power or a source of energy. True, 
the mathematical principle holds that the whole is the sum of all its 
parts, and consequently the state or the condition of a community must 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be the algebraic sum of the several conditions of its individual members. 
But we are not always able to judge of the members separately by the 
condition of the community. 

We are doing much now in seeking to improve the condition and 
the activities of our quorums, the quorums of the Holy Priesthood; 
and we have some quorums whose records are good as compared with 
others. With totals of activities high, it may appear that the members 
are energetic and that they never before have accomplished so much. 
But look a little deeper and you may find that of a quorum of 
ninety-six elders, sixteen perhaps have been doing the work and the" 
other eighty have been carried along without much effort on their part. 

COLLECTIVELY OR INDIVIDUALLY? 

The Lord has expressed himself forcefully with respect to such 
conditions, in these last days. In the first section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants — I pray you read for yourself— after reciting his purposes 
and plans and the partial realization of such in the bringing forth 
of this gospel in this age, he speaks of those who were charged with 
authority in that day to administer the affairs of the Church, those to 
whom these commandments were given, and explains that the com- 
mandments were given that his servants might have power to lay the 
foundation of this Church and to bring it forth out of obscurity and 
out of darkness. Please mark his words : "The only true and living 
church upon the face of the whole earth with which I the Lord am 
well pleased." But that is not the end of the sentence or paragraph : 
"with which I the Lord am well pleased, speaking unto the church col- 
lectively and not individually." 

There lies a vital distinction. It is expressed but we often over- 
look it. It is a distinction that should be heeded in all our organiza- 
tions within the Church, and without; the difference between the col- 
lective status or conditions or achievements and the work of the 
individual. A manufacturing plant may turn out a great total of 
product, it may have an immense output, and you may say that it is 
doing well ; but examine the units, look into the machinery, not simply 
inspect it in a general way, but test, try every machine, every part; 
and you may find that not one mechanical unit there is doing more 
than fifty or sixty per cent of what it could do, and yet the output 
is big. 

A great acreage may result in a very large yield, but when 
you come to consider the yield per acre you may find that you are 
gathering only thirty or even twenty fold when you ought to have 
been reaping seventy and eighty and even an hundred fold. 

We as individuals are not doing all that could be done, all that 
should be done. I have no concern for the Church as a whole; its 
destiny is foretold, it is going on to glorious victory. But that does 
not say that each of us who are members of the Church will go on to 
glorious victory ; we may be left behind entirely. What are we doing 
individually? I repeat. The tithing system of the Church has been 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



119 



referred to in this conference. It is a marvel to the people of the 
world, but look into it and see our tithing record. 

THE TITHING SYSTEM 

The law of tithe as revealed of God is not being practiced by any 
other religious organization on the face of the earth, nor has it been 
since the restoration of the Gospel or during the time of the great 
apostasy. We say that the results in this Church are very impressive. 
They are, but are they what they should be? How much have you 
contributed to making the observance of the law of tithing acceptable 
to the Lord? I do not mean how much in dollars and cents, I do not 
believe that is the way in which tithing is recorded above. The re- 
cording angels may have a system of bookkeeping that is a little better 
than ours. How much have you contributed by way of paying the 
tithe, whether it be ten cents or a hundred dollars? For be it known 
that the one who pays with honest heart the ten cent tithe, if it be a 
true tithe, will rank higher on those books than the one who pays a 
thousand dollars when that is only a tenth of a tithe for him. What are 
we doing individually? I know what some are doing, for they have 
told me. Some are very busy trying to find excuses in the matter of 
tithing ;as in other duties. Some come with strange questions : "Tell 
me please, ought I to subtract this or deduct that before I calculate 
the amount of my tithes?" Very seldom do I find it necessary to 
analyze the case and to give an answer direct. Sometimes I have 
smiled because I could see the perfidy of the questioner's coming to 
me for excuses, and I did not feel complimented. But I have given 
him a rule, and I venture to give it here. I have found it helpful 
myself, and I think that all may profit by it. 

A RULE FOR COMPUTING YOUR TITHES 

When you are in doubt as to just how you should calculate your 
tithes, reverse the terms as we sometimes do in solving complex 
mathematical problems, and suppose for the time being that the Lord 
had said this; let us postulate this as an assumed law given to the 
Church : "In order to show my love for my people, the faithful mem- 
bers of my Church, it is my will, saith the Lord, that each one shall 
receive from my storehouse, the storehouse of my church, at regular 
intervals during the year, an amount equal to one-tenth of his income." 
Now my dear brother, sit down and calculate how much the Lord owes 
you under that kind of law, and then go pay it to your bishop. 

CHURCHES AND jMEMBERS OF CHURCHES 

There is another phase of this distinction between individual and 
collective computation. The Lord was pleased with this Church in the 
day in which he spake as quoted and he is pleased with it today as 
a church; likewise he is pleased with a great many of its members; 
for there are many, many faithful members in this Church, men and 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



women who are doing well nigh all they could do save for the imper- 
fections of humanity. And the Lord is pleased with them; he is 
pleased with the Church, for it is progressing. There are churches with 
which he is not pleased. 

We are ofttimes charged with being very exclusive, and we admit 
the charge; we are exclusive, but in a rational sense. How can we 
solemnly testify that this is the Church of Jesus Christ and then ascribe 
that same high title to other organizations that have been formed, not 
under the direction of Jesus Christ, but according to man's thought and 
plans? Some people say that we are illiberal because we do not admit 
that all other churches are just what this church professes to be. We 
admit that other churches are what they profess to be, when their 
profession is based on facts. 

Now when we say that the Lord is not pleased with those churches, 
we do not mean that he is not pleased with the members thereof. We 
hold that God is no respecter of persons, but on the contrary that he 
will acknowledge good in any soul, no matter whether that person 
belongs to a church or not. But the Lord is not pleased with those 
churches that have been constructed by men and then labeled with 
his name. He is not pleased with those doctrines that are being taught 
as being his doctrines when they are only the effusion of men's brains, 
undirected by inspiration and utterly lacking in revelation. 

CHURCH OF CHRIST AND CHURCHES OF MEN 

He has expressed himself with regard to the churches that are 
built by man and has said they shall be overthrown. Indeed he has 
applied strong terms to some of those churches, or to church organiza- 
tions in general, that have been brought into being by man. Read his 
words to John the Revelator. See what he means by the synagogue of 
Satan to which some of the people belonged. Read what he has said 
about the great and abominable church, the mother of abominations- 
The church as such may be wholly corrupt because of the false claims 
that are being made for it, and yet within that church as members 
there may be people who are doing their best. They have been deceived. 
As to the degree of culpability that will be charged up to them for 
their having become subjects of deception, we may not be able to judge. 

But I do not understand that when the Lord states that those 
churches shall be overthrown — I mean the church of the devil, using 
his expression, and those that are making false claims, and shall be 
thrown into the fire, as he says — I do not understand that all members 
of those churches are to meet destruction, physically or otherwise. He 
is speaking there of the church collectively, and he is not pleased with 
it; but individually he may be well pleased with many of his sons and 
daughters who have been born under an environment that has led 
them into those churches which are not of God. 

I feel that we should give attention to the individual unit. Whole- 
sale farming is all right but we do not always get the yield that we 
would get if we were to pay greater attention to each particular plant. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



121 



And so with respect to members and membership in this Church. I 
trust that when the account shall be cast up, the Lord will be pleased 
with his Church, and I know he will be; but I hope that he will not 
be utterly displeased with me as a member ; and I have the same wish 
with respect to every one of you, my brethren and sisters. But I pray 
you, be not content with the progress of the Church as an organization 
unless you are progressing with it, and not simply being carried along 
by it. 

In brief reference to the olden parable : There are some who 
have just enough oil in their tiny lamps to show that they claim to belong 
to the organization, but their light goes out when a little trouble comes^ 
a little persecution; and they walk in the light of the Church without 
individual light. I pray that the Lord shall be well pleased with his 
people individually, as I know he will continue to be pleased with his 
Church collectively, in his name, Amen.

Bowen. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President ef the Northwestern States Mission 

Behold a great and marvelous work has come among the children 
of men. The spirit of this conference has evidenced that to a very 
marked degree to the thousands of people that are in attendance at 
this conference. 

I am delighted to bring good news from the Northwestern States 
Mission. I am thrilled beyond my power to express at the reception 
which I have received during the past two days from fathers and 
mothers who have sons and daughters now laboring in the Northwestern 
States. I have never seen before such a manifestation of faith in God 
as has been shown by these good parents, not only one, but many. 
Even today people who have driven hundreds of miles to be present 
at this conference have said, "President Sloan, my son, my daughter, 
is at the service of God as long as he desires them to remain in the 
mission field." 

I have a young man laboring with me now who eighteen months 
ago received a call to the mission field. He is the son of a widowed 
mother who is working hard to sustain her little family, and he is a 
twin. When the call came, the mother looked at it with tears in her 
eyes. She called on the Bishop and said, "Bishop, I pray you, do not 
separate my twins. Let them both go on a mission." The elder and 
his sister are laboring in the Northwestern States Mission. 

Last February one of the brethren in Montana passed away, leaving 
a wife and a family of children in almost destitute circumstances. As 
the spring opened up the good saints and friends of that branch united 
together, and in one day they plowed, disced, harrowed and seeded this 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



widow's ninety acres of sod. The Relief Society sisters were there 
playing their part and provided meals for the brethren. A month ago 
when I was there the crops were almost ready for harvest, all standing 
in the field to bless and sustain this widow and her family of children. 
"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to 
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world." 

I stood a few weeks ago at the bedside of one of the good sisters 
in the hospital at Helena. I want to leave her testimony with you, 
brethren and sisters. Many of you have probably heard it before. She 
recounted to me early experiences in the little town of Clarkston, Utah. 
Her sister was the wife of Martin Harris, Jr. One morning as she 
was a guest at her sister's home, Martin Harris, Jr., went to the bed- 
side of his father and found him failing very fast. Returning home 
he conveyed this message to his wife and her father, Brother Homer. 
They all immediately returned to the bedside of Martin Harris. Sister 
Costly took the hand of her father and walked across the street into 
the home of Martin Harris. Brother Homer walked to his bedside 
and said, "How are you, Brother Harris?" He answered, "I feel that 
I am not long for this world." Brother Homer spoke to him and he 
said concerning the Book of Mormon, "Brother Homer, the Book of 
Mormon is as true as the stars that shine in the heavens." Then turning 
to his son, Martin Harris, Jr., he said, "Martin, proclaim this truth 
to all the world. Tell them that the Book of Mormon is true." That 
was the testimony of a dying man to his son. Brethren and sisters, 
would he desire his son to go and tell a falsehood to the world ? 

The Mission in the Northwest is growing. We have recently 
opened up the district in Alaska. There are Indians there by the hun- 
dreds who are educated and are a fine type of manhood. They are 
seeking for the truth. Two of the elders laboring there have met with 
considerable success, not only among the white people, but also among 
the Indians. They seem to be anxious to know the contents of the 
Book of Mormon, and many copies have been distributed among them. 
They believe the teachings of that wonderful book. 

The work is growing. The missionaries are enjoying splendid 
health. They are enjoying the spirit of their calling. Do not worry 
about your sons and daughters. Please do not send them quite so much 
money, most of them. We prefer that they do not have so much and 
they will make better missionaries for the Church. 

The wonderful organization of this Church, its growth and de- 
velopment stand as a testimony to all the world, and yet there are those 
who cannot see its truth. Some day God will touch them and then the 
eyes of their understanding will be opened. They will know, I am sure, 
that in all the processes that God has instituted, this Church has been 
on the right side. 

One of our modern poets, Edgar A. Guest, has given us the follow- 
ing lines: 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



123 



"The non-believer is a man 

Who lets the morning sunshine in 
And thinks by chance this world began 
As men throw dice and lose or win ; 
He sees the violets bloom and blow, 
But not the power which makes them grow. 

"Chance charted every planet's course! 

By chance the summer follows spring! 
Chance gave to man the faithful horse 

And made the swallow fleet of wing! 
How these things came he doesn't know. 
He thinks they merely happened so. 

"Oh, what a jumble there would be 

If chance were shaping beasts and men, 

Could blind chance once repeat a tree, 
Or bring the June rose back again ? 

The simplest truth we've learned to know. 

Tomorrow chance might overthrow. 

"Without confusion or mistake 

There is a power which rules us all, 

A higher law we cannot break, 

An eye that sees the sparrow's fall. 

In every twig and leaf and blade 

I see God's handiwork displayed. 

I pray the blessings of God to be with this people, on its leaders, 
and in all Israel, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

• 

The choir sang the first two verses of the hymn, "An angel from 
on high." 

ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethen and sisters, I deem it a great privilege to have the 
opportunity of making a report of the Eastern States Mission. I have 
probably seen seventy-five per cent of the parents or close relatives 
of the missionaries who are laboring in the Eastern States. I would 
like to see the remainder of them at the close of this meeting. 

In the Eastern States we have a wonderful showing. Everybody 
is well. We haven't a sick missionary in the entire district. We have 
been very fortunate in having some of the general authorities come to 
New York and preach to the saints. During the last month Elder 
Whitney went through the entire mission. He and I saw every mis- 
sionary. We have had President Talmage preach to us in New York 
and Brooklyn ; we had Brother Widtsoe talk to us ; and we have had 
Bishop Sylvester Q. Cannon, Bishop Wells and other elders visit us. 
President Grant visited with us in New York and West Virginia. In 
the latter place he had never been heard before, and the saints were out 
in very large numbers. During the past month while Brother Whitney 
was there we had exceptionally large meetings. In the Brooklyn

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Branch every seat was taken, both in the body of the hall and in the 
gallery, and chairs were placed in the aisles ; yet there must have been 
fifty persons, I should say, who were unable to get a seat. On that 
Sunday he addressed perhaps eight hundred people, one quarter of 
whom were non-Mormons. 

In the Eastern States Mission we have started a new proceeding 
which I understand is being introduced very largely in other missions. 
We have something over six hundred children of non-members attend- 
ing Primary Associations. I am a Sunday School man, and we started 
out to make it a Sunday School affair, but we found we could not. 
So we instituted the Primaries, and practically every day of the week 
some Primary is being entertained by the sisters. I think they are 
doing a marvelous work. In the morning our sisters go out tracting 
from house to house, and in the afternoon they pick up these children 
and bring them into their Primary organization and teach them the life 
of Christ and some other Christian stories. 

When I was called on this mission I was not strongly in favor of 
young ladies coming into the mission field. I have had to change my 
attitude in that respect. I am now praying for more girls to come 
into the mission field. They can do a great deal of good. I want to 
say to you that they are preaching the gospel and they are visiting the 
parents of these children. True, we have not received very many 
converts yet, but they are coming, and great good has been done. 

I want to testify to the responsibility that the brethren and the 
sisters feel who are laboring in the Eastern States Mission. They are 
living lives of Latter-day iSaints ; they are preaching the gospel of 
Christ, and they are causing one to marvel at the miracle which God 
is performing. The young people as they come into the mission know 
comparatively little regarding the gospel. True, they have gone to 
Sunday School and to Mutual, and have been faithful and diligent in 
doing so ; but when they have been in the mission a year or so they 
have a testimony which I promise them shall never leave them. The> 
may apostatize from the Church, but they will have the knowledge 
that they have testified to the truth. When those young people come 
back — I join in the statement made by President Allred — then is the 
time I would like to see you give them a party. They have then done 
something for the Church of Christ. That is the time when I would 
like to see everybody come out and congratulate them on what they 
have done. 

Practically every elder in the mission can come home and do 
more than fifty percent of your own ward people. They are trained in 
visiting the saints. Take hold of them, make them ward teachers when 
they come home, and appeal to them in the proper spirit. I want to 
tell you there are no stronger young people in the world than these 
young missionaries. I am thankful that I have been called on a mission. 
I am getting old, but I am thankful that even at my age I received 
the call to do missionary work. I testify to you that I know this is 
the gospel of Christ, and that testimony has been with me ever since 



ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 



125 



I was upon a mission in England with President Nibley about fifty 
years ago. That testimony is still in my heart and has never been 
shaken, but this mission has made it conspicuous, so that I know not 
only what I can do, but I know what your children can do. Do not let 
them come home and become inactive. Some of us older ones should 
step aside and take hold of the younger ones. 

I testify to the truthfulness of the gospel. I pray God that he will 
bless us in the Eastern States Mission that we may grow, as we are 
growing, financially, spiritually, and in every other way. I ask it all 
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance at 
this conference and to have been able to listen to the sermons that have 
been delivered. 

While sitting upon my seat I have considered and remembered 
some of the things that President Grant said, one of which was that 
the Latter-day Saints should read the Doctrine and Covenants and the 
other standard Church works. In my years of experience in the mission 
field I have failed to find any one thing revealed by the Lord success- 
fully assailed. In all the experiences I have had I know of nothing 
else that has stood the test that the principles of the gospel have stood 
I am sure that they will endure unto the end, and the measurement of 
men's success and the glory of God shall be brought about through the 
principles he Iras revealed unto the world in these the last days. The 
Lord says that if men will read these scriptures with real intent and with 
a desire to know the truth he will manifest the truth unto them by 
the power of the Holy Ghost; by the power of the Holy Ghost they 
may know all things. i 

The Lord requires of all men, regardless of who they are, that 
they must be sincere, that they must have a real intent in their hearts ; 
and when they do, he will come unto them in the hours of the day 
and the night, and bring to them his blessings, and reveal unto them 
his truths as a father on the earth would reveal to his son, only in 
greater measure. Our Eternal Father loves his children and will reveal 
unto them his purposes and make known unto them why he sent them 
into the earth. The children of men are to be congratulated in this 
day and generation because of that which God our Eternal Father 
has delivered unto them. 

As I have sat today thinking of the thousands of people who are 
listening to these services ; who are hearing the remarks that are being 
made in the sessions of this conference by the servants of God — ■ 
the President of the Church and others who have spoken or who will 
speak — I have recognized that the word of God has been revealed anew 
to us. The plan has been revealed to many undoubtedly who have 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



never been able to listen before as they have at this time. Great are 
the purposes of God our Eternal Father. His power is everywhere, 
through all and in all. This is the work of God. He is with his 
children at home and abroad. His sons and daughters are doing much, 
and he is the one unto whom we should give glory and honor and 
praise forever and ever; for he is God, the King of all, the Father of 
heaven and earth ; he has planned everything for the good of his sons 
and daughters here in mortality. May we rally to him and to those 
wno represent him in the earth, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

In every dispensation the Lord has chosen men to lead and pre- 
serve Israel who were statesmen as well as prophets. This is deeply 
significant. These statesmen-prophets have pointed to nations as well 
as to the people of their own faith the means of escape from im- 
pending evils and calamities. 

In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that great statesman- 
prophet, nearly one hundred years ago, the Lord said: 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon 
the inhabitants of the earth, called upon mv servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave h"> commandments." (Doctrine and 
Covenants, Sec. 1 :17.) 

That awful hurricane in Florida, four weeks ago today (Sunday, 
September 16th) evidences the truth of the revelation in which it is 
declared by the Lord that the testimony of the elders would be followed 
by the testimony of earthquakes, and other events. 

"And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 

"For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes. * * * 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of 
lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the iwaves of the sea 
heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail 
them; for fear shall come upon all people." (Doctrine and Covenants, Section 
88:88-91.) { } _ 

Tennyson says that "things seen are mightier than things heard." 
I was a horrified eye witness of the ruin and desolation wrought by that 
fearful tempest. I beheld the hurrying floods going on to their work 
of destruction. The buildings, everywhere, in the storm-stricken dis- 
trict were in ruins. The Lord, ever mindful of the safety of his 
missionaries, caused them to come out of that part of Florida devastated 
by the storm several days before the hurricane came upon that region. I 
know it is said that such calamities have always been in the earth. That 
may or may not be true. But it is certainly true that the God of heaven, 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



127 



down through all the ages has thundered his warnings by the voice of 
judgment to unrepentant people, and by that means, when the voice of 
admonition and mercy has failed, has urged them to forsake the paths 
of wrong-doing and return unto him. 

There were good men and good women who lost their lives in that 
tempest, but I cannot believe that these unfortunate people died in vain. 
We have had martyrs to science, education and religion. The Holy 
Bible and the Book of Mormon cost some of the best blood of Adam's 
race to bring them forth for the purpose of blessing the people: for 
these sacred records testify to the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ij 
believe that the Christian men, women and children who died in the 
storm have gone to an eternal reward ; and if the people of the world 
are impressed by that awful destruction from the Almighty, if they 
will profit from the lesson of that fearful calamity, these men and 
women shall not have died in vain. 

When we see the judgments of God coming upon the earth it is 
proof that the Savior, who said to the troubled sea and angry elements, 
"Peace, be still," will say to the troubled world, "Peace, be still." He 
will, at his second coming, inaugurate the Millennium, bring to pass the 
glorious resurrection, and all the things he has promised to those that 
obey him. 

Brethren and sisters, the scriptures ring with the call to the 
repentance that will move a man to "put on the new man," the re- 
pentance that will give the sinner another heart. Of such vital im- 
portance to a man's salvation is the cleansing of the soul, that the 
Lord has said: "Say nothing but repentance unto this generation." 
And in another place he says: "Behold, the world is ripening in 
iniquity ; and it must needs be that the children of men are stirred up 
unto repentance, both the Gentiles and also the house of Israel." (Doc- 
trine and Covenants, Section 18:6.) 

And this is the mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. This is the glorious and sacred work your sons and 
daughters are doing in the mission fields ; and God is with them. His 
promises are being fulfilled to the very letter. 

The Apostle Paul said : "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." 
We appeal to all people to come unto repentance. Obey him whose 
voice not only shakes the earth, but also heaven. Come unto Jesus 
Christ and get that peace and rest for your souls that is beyond all 
price. 

God help us to serve the Lord acceptably, in reverence and in 
Godly fear, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

REORGANIZATION OF RELIEF SOCIETY 

Sister Clarissa S. Williams has been President of the Relief Society 
for a number of years. Her husband was sick for a year or two prior 
to his death, and her own health has not been first-class. It has, 
therefore, been decided by the Council of the First Presidency and 
Twelve, after consultation with Sister Williams and with her approval, 
to release her from this position with our thanks, love and blessings. 

This action also involves the release of her counselors, Sisters, 
Jennie B. Knight and Louise Y. Robison, and as the new president 
wishes Sister Amy Brown Lyman to be her first counselor, it also 
involves her release as secretary and treasurer of the organization. 

These good sisters carry our love and blessings for the splendid 
labors that they have performed. 

(The congregation then indicated their approval of this action 
by unanimous vote.)

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I can say that I have rejoiced beyond my power of expression 
in the very excellent attendance that we have had at this conference, 
in the rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord upon those who have 
spoken and in the splendid attention that has been given by the 
audiences. I believe that we have had a larger number at this con- 
ference than at any previous one that I can recall during the time I 
have been President of the Church. In addition there have been 
hundreds and thousands who have been listening in over the radio. 

We rejoice in the gospel of Jesus Christ, those of us who have 
received it, and we are anxious that all the world should hear the 
message of life and salvation that has come to us through the instru- 
mentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

REJOICE BECAUSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

We had a very wonderful gathering here last night of the priest- 
hood of the Church, almost completely filling the main floor of this 
great auditorium with men holding the priesthood of the living God, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

with authority to administer in the name of Jesus Christ, with power 
from God himself. 

We rejoice in the wonderful work that is being accomplished by 
the Relief Societies, by the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Associations, by our Sunday Schools and by the Primary 
Associations. We rejoice exceedingly in the remarkable work that is 
being accomplished in the educational department of the Church and 
particularly by the Religion Class organization. Sixty-one thousand 
of our young people are receiving instruction in our Religion Classes. 
I rejoice in the work of the Lord and all that is being accomplished. 

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS 

We are grateful for the beautiful singing by our choir. We are 
grateful to the soloists who have entertained us. We are thankful for 
the wonderful organ and for the faithful and efficient men who officiate! 
at the organ. 

My heart went out in gratitude as I listened to the prayer by 
Brother Stephen L. Chipman, thanking the Lord for this wonderful 
Temple block, for the flowers, and for all the buildings that are here. 

May the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints. May we so order 
our lives that by our diligence, our faithfulness, our honesty, our 
integrity, our uprightness in all the walks of life, we can preach the 
gospel, is my most sincere and earnest prayer for every soul who has 
a testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Even so, amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Worthy the Lamb." 

The benediction was pronounced by President Anthony W. Ivins* 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by B. 
Cecil Gates. Accompaniments and interludes were played on the* 
great organ by Edward P. Kimball, Tracy Y. Cannon, Frank W. Asper, 
and Alexander Schreiner. 

Stenographic notes of the conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

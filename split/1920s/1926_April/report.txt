Latter-day Saints 



FIRST DAY 

The 96th Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints convened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah, 
Sunday morning, April 4, 1926. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. The conference opened 
promptly at ten o'clock a. m., at which time every available seat was 
occupied and hundreds were standing in the side aisles and in the 
gallery. There was an over-flow meeting at the Assembly Hall, which 
building was also packed to capacity. The services in the Tabernacle 
were broadcasted by radio to the surrounding country, so that it is 
estimated that at least fifty thousand people heard the proceedings.

2 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The Priesthood Quorums, including the high priests, seventies and 
elders, and bishops and their counselors, from all parts of the Church, 
were in attendance ; officers of the auxiliary organizations both of men 
and of women were present, and also members of the Board of 
Education. 

Mission Presidents were in attendance, as follows: John H. 
Taylor, Northern States; Samuel O. Bennion, Central States; John 
M. Knight, Western States; Joseph W. McMurrin, California; Brig- 
ham S. Young, Northwestern States; Joseph Quinney, Jr., Canada;

States ; Benjamin Goddard, Bureau of Information, Temple Block, 
Salt Lake City, Utah, and Kenneth Haymore, acting president of the 
Mexican mission in the absence of Elder Rey L. Pratt who was in 
South America. 

President Grant announced that Elder J. Golden Kimball would 
preside at the Assembly Hall overflow meeting; and that the music 
would be furnished by the Murray First ward and by Millcreek ward, 
of the Cottonwood stake. Appointments were also made for speakers. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn on page 198, "Now 
let us rejoice in the day of salvation." 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. Clarence Neslen, bishop of the 
Twentieth ward, Salt Lake City. 

The choir sang : "The morning breaks, the shadows flee." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

This is a very wonderful gathering of Latter-day Saints, the 
Tabernacle being crowded to overflowing. It is certainly an inspiring 
sight, and bears witness to the interest and devotion of the Latter-day 
Saints. I humbly pray that while I stand before you this morning I may 
be able to say something that shall in some small degree fulfil my 
share of this conference, and which you can take away with you and feel 
that you have received some benefit by leaving your homes, some of 
you from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south, and from New 
York to San Francisco. 

CAUSE FOR REJOICING 

I rejoice in the growth of the work of God. I rejoice in the in- 
tegrity and devotion and the willing self-sacrifice of the people. I am 
very thankful for all of the many blessings that have come to us as a 
people, from the time when that great pioneer, Brigham Young, and that 
wonderful band of men and women, one hundred and forty odd, first 
came to this valley. I am thankful for the blessings of the Lord that 
have attended the Saints, notwithstanding the drivings and the persecu- 
tions and the mobbings that they have had to endure during the 96 years 
since the organization of the Church. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 3 

It is generally expected that at the April conference of the Church 
something shall be given in the nature of statistics regarding the con- 
dition of the Church. Therefore, before making any special remarks, 
I shall give you a few items of interest. 

CHANGES IN OFFICERS, AND CHURCH STATISTICS 

Stake Presidents Honorably Released. 

Mark Austin, Fremont stake; Peter M. Hansen (deceased), Bear River 
stake ; Nelson J. Hogan, Idaho stake ; Heber C. Austin, Idaho Falls stake. 

New Stake Presidents 

George S. Romney, Fremont stake; Milton H. Welling, Bear River 
stake; J. Fred Corbett, Idaho stake; Frederick A. Caine, Idaho Falls stake. 

Mission Presidents Honorably Released

Tahitian mission (acting). 

Mission Presidents Appointed 

Martin Christopherson, Norwegian mission; Joseph L. Peterson, Danish 
mission; John P. Lillywhite, Netherlands mission; Alma G. Burton, Tahitian 
mission. 

STATISTICS 

There are at present: stakes of Zion, 94; wards, 909; independent 
branches, 76; missions, 26; branches in missions, 716, making atotal of 1701 
wards and branches now in the Church. 

There were less than twenty stakes of Zion at the time I was chosen 
to be one of the twelve apostles of the Church, 43 years ago. 

Since our conference in 1925, 69 stake and ward meeting houses have 
been erected and 24 buildings in our missions, which makes a total of 93 
structures during the year. 

We have not yet completed the Arizona temple, but the expenditures 
up to the 31st of December, 1925, on that building were $540,000. 

We rejoice in the wonderful growth of work in our temples. In the Salt Lake 
temple, I learn from brother Geo. F. Richards, we have had as high as 
1800 people go through in a single day. Many companies go through there each 
day, laboring for the salvation of their dead. 

In our Church educational system we have enrolled: in Church schools, 
4,184; in Seminaries, 10,341 ; in Religion Classes, 57,000; 

Total number receiving week-day religious education, 71,525. 

This says nothing of religious education that is being given to 59,000 
women in our Relief Societies, 100,000 in our Young Men's and 
Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, and a qu?iter of a million 
in our Sunday schools. And I am informed that the enrollment of our children 
in Primary Associations now reaches 100,000. 

There were ordinances performed in the temples for the living and the 
dead last year, 986,321. 

Number of people recommended to the temples, 55,695. 

We have somewhat more than 2,500 missionaries in the field at the 
present time. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

Following are the expenditures from the tithes of the Church for the 
year 1925:

Divorces — There was one divorce in every 20 marriages. Average in 
the United States is one divorce in every seven marriages. 

Families owning their own homes, 73 per cent. 

OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

There is at the present time an agitation going on in the United 
States against the enforcement of prohibition. Straw votes are being 
taken which show that the overwhelming sentiment of those who have 
seen fit to vote on this straw ballot are in favor of the repeal or modifica- 
tion of the present law. 

There is also a wave of crime sweeping over the country. Perhaps 
there is nothing of greater importance, next to our spiritual growth, 
than a determination on the part of the Latter-day Saints to observe 
the laws of our country. I wish to quote from the immortal Lincoln : 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 5 

LINCOLN ON THE SUBJECT 

"Let every American, every lover of Liberty, every well wisher to his 
posterity, swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least 
particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by 
others. As the patriots of '76 did to the support of the Declaration of 
Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws let every 
American pledge his life, his property and his sacred honor. Let every 
man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his 
father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let 
reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping 
babe that prattles in her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and 
in colleges; let it be written in primers, in spelling books and almanacs; let 
it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, enforced in 
courts of justice. In short, let it become the political religion of the nation." 

One of the Articles of our Faith declares that we believe in sus- 
taining the law and supporting the rulers. So that not only should 
Latter-day Saints follow the advice of the immortal Lincoln, but they 
should follow the doctrines of the Church to which they belong. 

THEODORE ROOSEVELT 

Theodore Roosevelt has the following statements to make that 
would apply more or less to sustaining the law : 

"In character we must have virtue, morality, decency and square dealing 
as the foundation. 

"Any man who claims there can be liberty in spite of and against the 
law is claiming that anarchy is liberty . 

"We need strong bodies; more than that, we need strong minds, and 
finally we need what counts for more than body or mind — character." 

"The man who counts is the man who is decent and who makes himself 
felt as a force for decency." 

THE WORD OF WISDOM A REVELATION TO THE SAINTS 

The Latter-day Saints have a revelation from God regarding 
strong bodies. In that revelation it is recorded that tobacco is not 
good for the body. It is also recorded there that strong drinks are 
not to be taken internally, but are only for the washing of the body. 
We are told in this same revelation that hot drinks are not good for 
man. This revelation was given to the Latter-day Saints in 1833, only 
three years after the organization of the Church. Yet, there are many 
of the people who have never lived up to that revelation. But I am 
thankful that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints are observers 
of the Word of Wisdom — that tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco are let 
alone by the Latter-day Saints. 

I have read to you that we have seventeen hundred wards and 
branches in the Church. In each of the wards of the Church there is a 
bishop and two counselors and a ward clerk, and in each of the inde- 
pendent branches there is a president and two counselors. There are 
sometimes three presiding officers in the branches throughout the 
missions, and sometimes only one. But we have an army of men presid- 
ing amounting to four or five thousand, and every one of those men must 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

pledge his honor that he will observe the Word of Wisdom. We have 
now ninety-four stakes, with a presidency of three men, and a stake 
clerk, and we have twelve high councilors in each of these stakes. 
In addition we have many alternate high councilors. It will average, I 
am sure, twenty men to the stake, So we have an army of two thousand 
there, and every one of these leading men must obey the Word of 
Wisdom. 

ON WOMEN AND SMOKING 

I read recently in a paper published in our city : 

"The woman smoker is the prominent professional and business 
woman in every community." I desire to broadcast all over the world 
that that statement is an absolute falsehood so far as the Latter-day 
Saints are concerned. Never in my life have I seen a Latter-day Saint 
woman or girl smoking a cigarette. This article states that last year 
there were 9,000,000,000 cigarettes smoked by the women of these 
United States, and that there were 7,000,000,000 cigarettes smoked by 
women the year before, an increase in round numbers of thirty per cent. 
The writer said that the woman smoker is "the prominent commercial 
and business woman in every community." I say : Leave out every 
Latter-day Saint community, because it is a falsehood. 

"She is the wife of your local physician." She is not the wife of 
any physician in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints so 
far as I know. "She is the wife of the town banker, the attorney. 
She is the president of your parent-teacher club, your literary club." 
These statements are reputed to have been made by Cynthia Grey. I 
would not be a bit surprised if Cynthia Grey is but a newspaper name, 
and it is one of the tobacco trusts who furnished the article. 

"In other words, it is stuff and nonsense, nowadays, to say that 
the women who smoke are scarlet ladies." We do not say that. So 
she has put that in to weaken the fight against this awful curse, 
cigarette smoking. 

"Does nicotine harm the woman any more than the man, if it 
harms either?" Nicotine harms every man, woman and child that 
uses tobacco, and we as Latter-day Saints have the word of the Lord 
God Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, to that effect, this 
lady (or perhaps man), to the contrary notwithstanding. 

"I am inclined to believe that even a woman smoker, quite firm 
in her conviction that she is doing the proper thing" [I do not be- 
lieve that any woman smoker believes she is doing the proper thing] 
"would stop smoking, if any real authority could prove she was 
harming any possible future child of hers." The trained athletes of the 
nation are pretty good authorities on the harm to the physical body, and 
they are practically a unit that tobacco and liquor do harm the body. 
Some of the great baseball clubs of America, who have won cham- 
pionships, won't allow liquor or tobacco to be used by their men. 

The head of the New York Athletic club, one of the greatest in 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

this country, announces that there is no prospect of success in the 
athletic line to the man who uses tobacco and liquor. 

"But medical savants, when pushed to the wall, seem not much 
alarmed." When they are not pushed to the wall, the great majority 
of them acknowledge the harmful influence of these things. 

"The president of the Association of Railway Chief Surgeons is 
quoted as saying 'Fags help men work out problems. Why not women?' " 

A whip helps a horse to go a little bit further, but it does not 
add any strength to the horse, and no narcotic or stimulant that creates 
an appetite for itself is good for man or woman. And thank the 
Lord we have his word to that effect. 

I will not take any more of your time reading from this article, 
for it is "rot." 

COMMENTS ON SUSTAINING THE LAW 

I meant after reading Lincoln's wonderful appeal to sustain the 
Constitution, to read the following: 

Gladstone said, speaking of the Constitution of the United States : 
"It is the greatest document of its kind that ever sprang from the 
mind of man." 

The faith of the Latter-day Saints and the teaching that I have 
had since I was a child at my mother's knee, as well as from this 
stand, is that the Constitution of our country was written by men in- 
spired of the Lord God Almighty. Therefore we, as Latter-day Saints, 
more than any other people, ought to be supporters of the Constitution, 
and all constitutional law. 

I read a clipping from a great financial paper, as follows : 

" 'Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.' 
is as true today as it was 2,500 years ago. The indications of surface con- 
ditions are not satisfactory. A crime wave is sweeping the country; hope is 
necessary to give a thrill in the movies; temperance and self-control have be- 
come a joke; observance and respect for law are considered old-fashioned; 
honest labor is looked upon as something to be avoided; too many are trying 
to get something for nothing and are going into debt for needless luxuries 
and harmful pleasures." 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS WARNED AGAINST DEBT AND WEALTH 

Right here let me warn the Latter-day Saints to buy automobiles 
and to buy the ordinary necessities of life when they have the money 
to buy them, and not to mortgage their future. I have heard of people 
over in England who regularly mortgage their Sunday clothes Monday 
morning and take them out of "hock" the next Saturday night. I want 
to say to you that those who discount their future, who run in debt 
for the ordinary necessities of life and for the luxuries of life, are 
laying burdens upon themselves that will come back with compound 
interest to cause them great trouble and humiliation. To quote again : 

"Nasty magazines are building up great circulations, while the colleges are 
closing up their chapels and opening up smoking rooms for the women students." 

Again let me say that that cannot be found in any of the Church 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

schools or seminaries. Once more, please leave out the Latter-day 
Saints. 

"I sincerely hope that these things are merely a phase and that the American 
people are still a God-fearing race. If not, these things are a tremendous in- 
dictment of schools and colleges as well as parents. Yes, America has every 
material blessing at the present time and if we will keep our feet on the ground, 
the present era of prosperity should continue for years. On the other hand, 
all wealth is a mere tool which can be used either to upbuild or to destroy. 
Everything depends on the motives, ambition and tastes of the people who have 
this tool in their hands." 

Wealth is leading to folly and almost to that which would be 
counted as sin. Pope says: 

"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, 
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; 
But seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace." 

AVOID SERVING THE GOD OF FASHION 

I am ashamed, as I walk the streets of our cities, at the lack of 
modesty in the dresses, not only of our young people, but our mothers 
and even grandmothers. I will rejoice when there shall come over 
this land again an increased respect for the sacredness of the body 
and a willingness on the part of our good, pure, upright ladies to dress 
themselves in a more becoming manner. I shall rejoice when the 
Latter-day Saints shall endeavor to find out that thing which will 
bring to them and to their posterity peace and comfort of body and of 
mind. The Lord said that he was a jealous God, and that we should 
serve no other God before him. So we should not serve the god of 
fashion. When our Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations 
were organized they were organized under the title of the Young 
Ladies' Retrenchment Associations, and one of the purposes was re- 
trenchment and more modesty in dressing; and I shall rejoice if the 
Lord will inspire the Latter-day Saints to set a better example in the 
future than they are setting at the present time. 

I want to announce that I shall be glad if we will quit giving no- 
tices to the papers of what is termed "teas" that are being held in our 
homes. I read of a "tea" being given in the home of President Heber 
J. Grant, and of the "tea" table being decorated. There is no tea table 
in the home of President Heber J. Grant. There has been no tea 
served either to our friends or visitors, in the home of Heber J. Grant. 
I would like us to change that name in our newspapers, at least so far 
as Latter-day Saints are concerned, and have it a "social gathering," 
or a lunch, or anything you have a mind to call it, and quit calling 
it a "tea" when every Latter-day Saint is asked by the Lord to leave 
tea, coffee and tobacco alone. 

PROMISE OF GOD TO OBSERVERS OF THE WORD OF WISDOM 

And for fear I forget it, I want to read to you one of the most 
marvelous and wonderful promises that God has made to every Latter- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 9 

day Saint that keeps this Word of Wisdom. The Word of Wisdom 
was given, as stated, only three years after the Church was organized : 

"All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff 
of life, not only for man but for beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, 
and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; 

"And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger." 

It is being acknowledged by the great doctors today that an ex- 
cessive use of meat is not good for humanity, and the Word of Wisdom 
teaches us that: 

"All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; 
that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground — 

"Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the 
horses, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, 
and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain." 

Now listen, all ye Latter-day Saints, to the word of the Lord 
and the promise of the Creator of heaven and earth : 

"And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and 
marrow in their bones; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures; 

"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 

"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen." 

What a marvelous promise! And as there is no promise made by 
the Lord only upon the condition that we fulfil the law upon which 
that promise is predicated, the law of life and health to the Latter- 
day Saints is to obey the Word of Wisdom. 

THE SUPPORT OF HOME INSTITUTIONS 

Generally at these conferences I have made just a few remarks 
about supporting our home institutions, I thought I would simply read 
what I said once before : 

"The support of home institutions is the main foundation of any 
state's prosperity. The support of home industries keeps money at home, 
furnishes employment, reduces cost and insures prosperity. If all the people 
of Utah and the other intermountain States would adopt the principle of 
buying the product of the factories of the Intermountain territory, most of 
our industrial problems would vanish. 

"From the earliest days the people of Utah have been taught to support 
home industries, and to keep money at home. Where the advice has been 
followed prosperity has resulted. Now, more than ever, the people of the 
Intermountain country should stand together and support the institutions 
which are assisting in the up-building of the territory." 

APPEAL TO FARMERS ON THE SUGAR INDUSTRY 

I want to say a word to the Latter-day Saints regarding the beet 
sugar industry. The credit of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

day Saints was utilized to the extent of something over $3,000,000 a 
few years ago in borrowing and loaning money to the sugar industry, 
to keep it from going into the hands of the receiver. This industry 
was established by the Church running in debt to secure the money 
to build the very first factory that was ever built in the United States 
of America with American machinery, for the manufacture of beet 
sugar, and the Church has always fostered the industry. 

I appeal to you farmers, every one of you, in all the various parts 
of Utah and Idaho, and in Canada now — wherever a sugar factory 
has been established — to support those factories by planting a goodly 
portion of suitable land in beets which may be manufactured into 
sugar. A great many of the farmers seem to feel that they are under 
no obligation whatever to support these factories, some of which have 
been built upon the earnest solicitation and upon the absolute pledge 
of the farmers that they would furnish so many thousand acres of beets 
for each factory. Several of these factories have had to remain idle. 
Why ? Because these pledges have not been fulfilled. 

Our Lord and Savior said: 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind. 

"This is the first and great commandment. 

"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 

As one of your neighbors, who has labored diligently and invested 
all he had originally, and lost every dollar of it, in establishing this 
great industry, I appeal to you farmers to love me and others who 
established it. My personal stock amounts to very little, I could not sell 
it today for $500, but the Church has invested several million dollars 
in establishing and maintaining this industry for the benefit of the 
farmers. Therefore, I appeal to you to have no idle beet sugar factories 
in your communities ; and by supporting these factories you will bring 
additional money into your communities, and will be fulfilling the 
second great commandment ; to love your neighbors. 

WHAT THE CHURCH REQUESTS AS TO CARD PLAYING 

By the way, I hear that card playing is becoming very, very 
popular, and that the Church must be in favor of card-playing because 
the Church authorities never say anything against it. From the time 
I was a child and read the Juvenile Instructor, published for the benefit 
of the people, I have read nothing except condemnation of card-playing 
and the wasting of your time in doing something that brings no good, 
bodily, intellectually or in any way, and sometimes leads your children 
to become gamblers, because they become expert card-players. The 
Church as a Church requests its members not to play cards. I hope 
you understand me, and I want you to know that I am speaking for 
the Church when I ask the people to let cards alone. 

SUSTAIN THE DESERET NEWS 

Again I am speaking for the Church when I ask Latter-day 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 11 

Saints to sustain the newspaper published by the Church. I have 
gone into the homes of bishops and other leading families in this 
Church, and have failed to find The Deseret Evening News. We desire 
the support of The Deseret News because it is your paper. We are 
the Church and the Church owns The Deseret News, and if you make 
it a great financial success you will be sharing in that success be- 
cause it is your paper. And I want to say to the Latter-day Saints 
that there have been a score or more of speeches published in The 
News in the past year, nearly every one of which to my mind was 
worth the price of The Deseret News. I called up an influential 
man the other day and asked if he had read one, two or three of those 
sermons. He said no. I want to tell you that a sermon by one of the 
greatest educational minds in Utah, (I doubt there is a superior 
one) Dr. Joseph F. Merrill, over the radio and subsequently enlarged 
upon from this stand, was published in The News. I would not take 
a fifty dollar bill for it if I could not get it again. 

We are here — for what? For the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and we get it in The Deseret News. I will say to you that one of the 
finest sermons on Priesthood that I have listened to — (by the way, I 
did not listen to it," but I read it in The Neius) — was by one of the 
great lawyers of America, one of the international lawyers, a man 
honored by our country to be called to Washington in the great con- 
ference on disarmament, J. Reuben Clark. You did not read it if you 
do not take The News. It was a splendid talk. I want to say to you 
that the talks by Adam Bennion and by Milton Bennion are worth the 
price of The News for a year. I will have to stop talking about The 
News, or I won't get through with the other things I want to say. 

AUTHORITIES ABSENT FROM CONFERENCE 

There are absent today of the General Authorities, Elders Reed 
Smoot, James E. Talmage, and Melvin J. Ballard of the Council of the 
Twelve. Elder Reed Smoot, as you all know, is a Senator from Utah, 
and thank the Lord for such a senator, a man who has gained for him- 
self a national and an international reputation for his honesty, for 
his integrity, and for his great and wonderful ability, and he stands 
today at the head of the greatest committee in the senate of the United 
States. I remember when ex-President Taft was here he said, with 
that little chuckle of his that made us all laugh, "And to think that 
when he first came down to Washington nearly everybody tried to keep 
him out of the senate. Now I have come all the way to Utah to plead 
with the people to be sure and send him back again." 

Elder James E. Talmage is doing a wonderful and splendid work 
in the British Isles as president of the European mission. Elder Tal- 
mage, as you know, is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 
and the distinction of being a member of one of the greatest scientific 
societies in the world has enabled him to get favorable articles into 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the newspapers, in such a way as we have never been able to do before 
in the British Isles. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard is opening a mission, as you all know, 
in South America, and is meeting with some success. 

Elder Brigham H. Roberts of the First Council of Seventy, has 
appointments in the East, and on account of the death of his wife 
and having to come here to her funeral, he has been excused from 
this conference. He is accomplishing a remarkable and wonderful 
labor in the Eastern States. 

Elder Rey L. Pratt of the First Council of Seventy is with Brother 
Ballard in South America. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells of the same council went to South America, 
as you all know, but on account of ill health had to return. 

Splendid missionary work is being done by all those who are en- 
gaged in the different missions in the United States and all over the 
world, for which we are grateful. 

CALLS FOR MISSIONARIES 

We have calls for missionaries from every quarter of the globe — 
more missionaries, more missionaries. The lady missionaries, we want 
it understood, are called to labor only in the United States. There 
are requests coming constantly that we send lady missionaries to other 
parts of the world, but we feel it is a mistake to send our sisters further 
away. 

A very remarkable and splendid work has been done by the short 
term missionaries that were sent out. We regret that the call came 
so late, and many of them have only been able to stay in the field 
three months, some of them four and some of them five months. We 
hope we can have more short-term missionaries, and that they will 
be able to spend the full six months in the mission field. Some of the 
accomplishments of these men have been very remarkable. Men of 
experience, men of testimony, and of undying faith in the gospel have 
brought many souls to a knowledge of the truth. Perhaps some of our 
school teachers during their vacations can volunteer and will be willing 
to do missionary work. 

AN EASTER GREETING 

This is Easter, and I wish to read to you a greeting that was 
published in The Deseret Evening News for Christmas and I believe 
it is equally as appropriate for Easter Sunday : 

Greetings from the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints: 

As Christmas tide approaches our minds revert to that never to be for- 
gotten night when shepherds who were watching their flocks on the hills of 
Judea were startled as the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and the 
angel of the Lord stood before them and said : "Fear not, for behold I bring you 
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 

"For unto you is born this day, in the City of David, a Savior which 
is Christ the Lord. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 13 

"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts, 
praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good 
will toward men." 

It was a night which was distinct from all other nights which had come 
and gone since the creation of the earth. 

The birth of Christ our Lord was more than an incident, it was an epoch in 
the history of the world to which prophets had looked forward, of which poets 
had sung, and in which angels joined their voices with mortals in praise to 
God. It was the day decreed and foreordained by our Father who is in 
heaven when he would manifest himself to his children, who are here upon earth, 
in the person of his Only Begotten Son. 

Whether or not the 25th day of December is the proper date of the birth 
of Christ, our Lord, matters little. We join with other Christian people in 
celebrating it as such and if we observe it in the true spirit of the Master, 
renewing the covenant which we have made that we are willing to take upon us 
his name, and keep the commandments which he has given, our offering will 
be accepted. 

He came that man might see and know God as he is, for he bore witness 
that whoever had seen him had seen the Father, for he was the express 
image of his person. 

He came to teach us the character of God, and by example and precept 
pointed out the path which, if we walk in it, will lead us back into his presence. 
He came to break the bands of death with which man was bound, and made pos- 
sible the resurrection by which the grave is robbed of its victory and death 
of its sting. 

After his crucifixion and the death of the apostles whom he had chosen, who 
suffered martyrdom at the hands of those who were opposed to the truths which 
he taught, it appeared that his mission and ministry had been a failure; but 
as time passed, and the doctrines of Christianity became better understood, 
thoughtful men turned to him as their source of light and strength, thus pre- 
serving faith in his mission and ministry, with the result that Christianity became 
the dominant influence in the civilization and development of the world. 

As time passed dissensions occurred in the primitive church. The laws 
governing the church established by the Redeemer, were transgressed, the ordin- 
ances were changed, the everlasting covenant was broken. Men began to teach 
for doctrine their own commandments ; a form of worship had been established 
which was called Christianity, but was without the power of God which char- 
acterized the primitive church. Spiritual darkness covered the earth and gross 
darkness the minds of the people. 

Then there came another epochal period in the history of the world. The time 
had arrived, fore-ordained by the Lord, and foretold by his prophets, when an- 
other gospel dispensation was to be ushered in, when the gospel of the kingdom 
was to be restored, and preached in all the world, as a witness unto all people 
before the end shall come. 

Again the heavens rejoiced, again heavenly beings communicated the will 
of the Father to his children who are here upon the earth, and men were made 
glad as the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times was ushered in. 

Joseph Smith was the agent through whom the Lord saw fit to begin 
the great latter-day work. To him the Father and Son appeared in heavenly 
vision, upon him the keys of the everlasting priesthood were conferred, with 
authority to transmit them to others, with the promise that the priesthood should 
never be taken from the earth again, until the purposes of the Father were 
accomplished. 

Under his direction the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
organized on the 6th day of April, 1830, and the command given to its members to 
bear the gospel message to all people, calling them to repentance and faith in 
Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, with the promise that who- 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

soever should repent and obey would know, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, that 
the message which they brought was true. 

As the result of this message many thousands of people have been gathered 
out from the various nations where the gospel has been preached and brought 
to Zion, the place designated by the Lord as the gathering place of Latter- 
day Israel. The desert has been made glad because of them, and has been 
converted into fruitful fields. Springs of living water have broken out to moisten 
the thirsty land, and cities have sprung up where before was only desolation 
and wilderness. Music and the voices of children are heard in the streets where 
silence had reigned supreme. 

It is the Lord our God, through his Only Begotten Son, who has done it. 
To him be the praise and glory forever. 

We exhort our brethren and sisters of the Church, wherever they may be, 
to remain steadfast in their faith. Hold fast to the word of the Lord, which 
is the iron rod that will lead us to the Tree of Life. 

To the people of the world we appeal to come unto Christ, through whom 
redemption cometh to all those who take upon them his name, and keep the 
commandments which he has given. We bear witness that the fulness of his 
gospel has been restored, that his Church is established, and will continue to 
spread until peace shall prevail among men, and his kingdom come and his will 
be done upon earth as it is d.one in heaven. O Lord, hasten that glorious day. 

HEBER J. GRANT, 
ANTHONY W. IVINS, 
CHARLES W. NIBLEY, 

First Presidency. 

God bless you. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I sincerely desire, my brethren and sisters, during the few moments 
of time that I may occupy, that I may have the benefit of your faith, 
exercised in my behalf. I appreciate fully the responsibility which I 
assume, as I stand here professing to teach the doctrines of our Lord, 
Jesus Christ. 

THE ADVICE OF GAMALIEL 

The scripture which I am about to read I have often quoted 
before, but it appears so appropriate to the subject which I desire 
briefly to discuss that it will bear repetition. The apostles who had 
been chosen by our Lord had been imprisoned by those who were op- 
posed to the doctrines which they taught, and had been arraigned 
before the Jewish high priests, by whom they were accused of violating 
the law. When opportunity was granted them to speak in their 
own behalf, Peter stood up and said : 

"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged 
on a tree. 

"Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, 
for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 

"And we are his witnesses" of these things ; and so is also the Holy Ghost, 
whom God hath given to them that obey him. 

"When they heard that, they were cut to ,the heart, and took counsel to 
slay them, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 15 

"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a 
doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put 
the apostles forth a little space ; and said unto them : 

"Ye men of Israel, take* heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as 
touching these men. * * * 

"For if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: 
But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it." 

NORWAY DECIDES THE "MORMONS" ARE NOT CHRISTIANS 

During the past ninety-six years the restored gospel of Christ 
has been preached in both the old and the new world without serious 
governmental opposition, or objection on the part of the people at large. 

From the time of its introduction into the Scandinavian, and other 
countries of Europe, people who appear to have been prepared for the 
gospel before they heard it have joyfully accepted the message which 
the elders of the Church have carried to them, and the converts who 
have been gathered out from among those nations have become a 
pillar of strength to the Church. 

To our surprise and regret the friendly relations which have so long 
existed have recently become greatly disturbed, because of the fact that 
our missionaries have been refused admittance to Norway, where, 
before, they had enjoyed the privileges accorded to other religious 
organizations. Upon inquiry regarding the reason for this changed 
attitude we were informed that representatives of the Christian churches 
of the country, in convention assembled, had passed resolutions to the 
effect that the "Mormon" Church is not a Christian organization, and 
consequently we were not entitled to the privileges, and protection 
under the law which we have hitherto enjoyed. 

Our protest against this ruling was answered by the statement 
that the only means by which it could be modified would be for a con- 
ference of churches to assemble, and officially declare that the jury 
which, without having given us an opportunity to be heard in our own 
behalf, had decided that we were guilty, must meet and reverse the 
decision which they had rendered, a court before which we could ex- 
pect no more of justice than was accorded the Redeemer of the world, 
when arraigned before the Jewish Sanhedrin. 

A CONVENTION OF CHURCHES IN THIS LAND DECLARES US UNCHRISTIAN 

From the published account of the proceedings of the general 
assembly of a convention of representatives of one of the great churches 
of our own country, held during the year just passed, I quote as follows : 

"The American Islam. Thus has the 'Mormon' area often been 
characterized. It is an apt figure of speech. Those who live and labor 
in the atmosphere of this Islam of America, know what it means to go 
up against a stone wall, with scarcely ever feeling it give a little. The 
'Mormon' has, to date, been far more zealous to convert the Christian, 
than the Christian has to convert him." 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Islamism, as you are aware, is the religion of Mohammed. In one 
respect it is a good religion, for it at least teaches faith in, and service 
to a living God, the God of Abraham, but it does not recognize Jesus 
Christ as the Redeemer of the world, or as the Son of God. 

From the foregoing, my brethren and sisters, you will observe that 
the Church of which you are members is declared, both in the old 
world, and here in our own country, to be an un-Christian organiza- 
tion, and as a consequence you are declared to be not Christians. 

BOTH DECLARATIONS INEXCUSABLE AND UNTRUE 

Had statements such as those been made ninety-six years ago, 
soon after the organization of the Church, when means of obtaining 
information was limited, and the history and accomplishments of the 
Church were before it, and not behind, there might have been some 
reason for the exercise of charity towards the persons responsible for 
the publication of such statements to the people of the world, but now, 
after the lapse of nearly a century, after the doctrines of the Church 
have been expounded to the people of all civilized countries, after 
millions of publications setting forth the doctrines of the Church have 
been distributed, such statements can only be regarded as the result 
of either inexcusable ignorance or wilful desire to deceive the people, 
by statements which are known to be untrue. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES A CHRISTIAN? 

The situation suggests the question : What constitutes a Christian 
Church, a Christian community or individual, and by what rule, of 
tribunal is a question of such vital importance to be decided ? 

I suppose the general answer would be : A! Christian is one who 
professes faith in, and follows the teachings of Christ, and that a body 
of people, organized as a worshiping assembly, professing faith in 
the Redeemer, would be regarded as a Christian church. 

During the earliest history of the Primitive Church its members 
were not referred to as Christians, but as brethren, disciples or 
saints. It was at Antioch, as I remember, about ten years after the 
crucifixion, that the followers of the Redeemer were first called 
Christians, a name applied to them in derision, or contempt which 
they accepted very much as we have accepted the name "Mormon," 
because we accept the Book of Mormon as a divine revelation from 
the Lord. 

The first use of the word church, applied to the followers of 
Christ, so far as I am aware, was by the Redeemer himself when he 
declared to Peter that upon the rock of revelation he would build his 
Church, and that the gates of hell should not prevail against it, a very 
significant statement, a plain declaration that revelation is the founda- 
tion upon which the Church must rest. 

We are told that the apostles, as they traveled from place to place, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 17 

preaching to the people, ordained elders in every church, and after 
commending the converted members to the Lord passed on to other 
fields. Thus the entire body of converts became known as the Church 
of Christ, he being declared to be its head, the Church being subject 
to him in all things. 

THE ANSWER GIVEN IN THE WORDS OF OUR LORD AND HIS DISCIPLES 

I know of no better authority on the question than the words of 
our Lord, and those of his disciples, who followed after him. 

Before an organization could be formed which could be designated 
as a church, it was necessary that converts be made to the divinity of 
the Redeemer, and the importance of the message which he brought 
to the people of the world. His doctrine, or as he taught, the doctrine 
of his Father who sent him, as he expounded it in his memorable sermon 
on the mount, teaches us the manner of life we should lead in order 
that we may be worthy to be called Christians. 

He taught us to overcome the evil habits of the world, its pride 
and selfishness, becoming humble in spirit, and promised that by so 
doing we should inherit the blessings of the earth. He taught us that 
we are to be peace-makers, if we are to become the children of God. 
That our example should be such that others seeing our good works, 
would be led to glorify the name of our Father who is in heaven. 
That, as we hope for mercy, we should be merciful. That we should 
not sit in judgment upon others, for by the judgment with which we 
judge, so shall we be judged. That we should not seek to exalt 
ourselves, for he who exalteth himself shall be abased. That we 
should be charitable, but admonishing us that if we give alms to be seen 
of men, for our own glory, it availeth us nothing. 

His entire doctrine was one which requires that men withdraw 
from the ambition, selfishness and strife of the world, and dedicate 
themselves to the service of the Lord, and their fellow men, and he 
covenanted that if they will do so the necessary temporal blessings 
shall be conferred upon them, as a reward for righteousness. 

He declared another doctrine of great importance in that remark- 
able discourse, that not all who say Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven, but he who doeth the will of our Father who 
is in heaven. 

Therefore he said, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine 
and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house 
upon a rock. And the rains descended, and the floods came, and the 
winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was 
founded upon a rock. And he who heareth these sayings of mine and 
doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house 
upon sand, and the rains descended, and the floods came, and the winds 
blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, for it was founded upon 
sand, and great was the fall of it. 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The acceptance of these first principles of the gospel were in- 
dispensable, but not sufficient to entitle one to be called a Christian. 
He must manifest his faith by accepting the ordinance of baptism, 
an ordinance which was administered to the Redeemer himself by John 
the Baptist, an ordinance without which our Lord declared a man 
cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. 

Nor was baptism alone sufficient. John declared that his baptism 
was with water for the remission of sin, but that one who would come 
after him would baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. 

THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH DEFINED 

When Paul came to Ephesus he found certain disciples and asked if 
they had received the Holy Ghost. They answered we have not so much 
as heard that there be any Holy Ghost. Unto what then were you 
baptized, he asked, and they replied unto John's baptism. They were 
then baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and when Paul had laid 
his hands upon them they received the Holy Ghost. 

Those who believed, and subjected themselves to the administra- 
tion of these simple first ordinances of the Church became Christians. 
They had manifested their faith in Christ, in his divinity, his death, 
and above all his resurrection from the grave by being buried in the 
water of baptism, in similitude of his death, and coming up from it with 
their sins washed away, born to newness of life, as he arose to newness 
of life, with his glorified, resurrected body. 

Then came the climax, when, by laying on of hands by those in 
authority the Holy Ghost was conferred upon the baptized believer : 
The Holy Ghost, which takes of the things of the Father and mani- 
fests them unto man, which bears witness of the Father and the Son, 
not in a voice audible to our ordinary sense of hearing, but at the same 
time more potent and convincing than any words the human voice 
can utter; the Holy Ghost which leads us into all truth and is 
an unfailing source of strength, wisdom and knowledge so long as 
we permit ourselves to be guided by its unerring counsels. 

Such a person became a Christian, and an association of such 
people became a Christian church. 

That a church may be brought into existence and endure it must 
be properly organized, with officers to preside over it and direct the 
conduct of its affairs, and these our Lord provided through the Twelve 
Apostles whom he chose, and the quorums of the lesser priesthood with 
their helps in government, an organization complete in every detail, 
conferring upon the men chosen the keys of authority which belong 
to the priesthood, and which authorize them to act in the direction 
of the affairs of the Church. 

That any group of persons may associate themselves together as 
a worshiping assembly, and call themselves a church is conceded, and 
they are at liberty to choose any name they may desire by which their 
organization shall be known. For all the good which such an organ- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 19 

ization may accomplish the Lord will give them credit, and they will 
be rewarded for their efforts to establish faith in the hearts of peo- 
ple, I believe far beyond their expectations, for everything that 
is good, and persuadeth men to do good, cometh from God. The 
Latter-day Saints wish all people who are thus striving God-speed. 

CALAMITIES THAT FOLLOWED 

After the crucifixion of the Redeemer, and the death of the apostles 
whom he had chosen, all of whom suffered violent death because of 
their faith, with the exception of John the Revelator, many different 
religious sects came into existence, numbers of them professing Christ- 
ianity, but teaching doctrines at variance with those taught by the 
Redeemer and his disciples. 

Prior to his crucifixion, our Lord plainly outlined to his disciples 
that the time was approaching when he would be offered up, when 
he would leave them, but promised that at a future time he would return 
and consummate the work which he had commenced. Upon one oc- 
casion, as he sat on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him 
and asked when these things should be, and what would be the sign 
of his coming and of the end of the world. 

The Redeemer outlined the conditions which would prevail at 
the time when he would come in glory, in the clouds of heaven, with 
such detail and accuracy that one who lives at the present time may 
read as he runs, and know that he lives in the day to which Christ 
referred. Read the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth chapters of the 
Gospel according to St. Matthew, my brethren and sisters, if you 
desire to know more of the tremendous importance of the dispensation 
in which you live. 

Upon this occasion he said to his disciples : "Take heed that no 
man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; 
and shall deceive many." For there shall be false Christs and false 
prophets, who if it were possible would deceive the very elect. And 
they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and you shall be hated of 
all nations for my name's sake, and, most important ' of all, this gospel 
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, as a witness unto 
all people, and then shall the end come. 

The Prophet Isaiah says: "Behold the Lord maketh the earth 
empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth 
abroad the inhabitants thereof. The land shall be utterly emptied and 
spoiled." 

THE REASON FOR APOSTASY AND CALAMITIES 

Why are these dire calamities decreed? The prophet makes the 
reason clear, it is because both priest and people have transgressed the 
law of the Lord, changed the ordinances of his Church and broken 
the everlasting covenant. Our Lord gave us the key by which we may 
know the voice of the good Shepherd when this time of confusion and 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

distress is upon us. When his disciples asked him whither they should 
go, or look, he replied : "Wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles 
be gathered together," and, wherever the true Church of Christ is, there 
will the fruits of his gospel be manifested in the lives of the people. 

WHY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS IS A 
CHRISTIAN CHURCH 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Christian 
Church in the fullest sense of the word, the declarations of the so-called 
Christian churches of the world to the contrary notwithstanding. In its 
establishment and accomplishments the words of the Redeemer, and 
the declarations of the prophets who lived before and after him are 
fulfilled. In justification of this declaration permit me to make the 
following statement, briefly, because a subject of such tremendous im- 
portance can only be touched upon in one brief discourse. 

BRIEF STORY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CHURCH 

One hundred seven years ago, Joseph Smith, at the time 
in his fifteenth year, lived with his parents at Manchester, in the state 
of New York. While a great religious revival was being held in the 
neighborhood he found himself in doubt as to which of the contending 
sects he should join, for there was great rivalry among them in their 
efforts to secure converts. 

Profoundly religious he had never conceived the idea that all were 
wrong, neither could he believe that all were right, because of the great 
difference in doctrine and organization which existed. Familiar with 
the scriptures he knew that the Lord had promised wisdom to all 
who lacked it, if they would go to him in faith, and believing that 
the question which he was not able to decide would be answered by the 
Lord, he retired to the woods and engaged in earnest prayer. 

While thus occupied a vision was unfolded in which he saw two 
glorious personages, whose brightness and glory, he says, defied all 
description. One of these personages, pointing to the other, said: 
"This is my beloved Son, hear him." 

The Person referred to told Joseph that he should join none of 
the existing churches, that all were wrong, that they drew near him 
with their lips, but their hearts were removed far from him, and they 
taught for doctrine the commandments of men. 

Nothing of importance occurred in the life of Joseph Smith, except 
that he was persecuted and ridiculed because he maintained that he had 
seen this vision, until three years later, when, while engaged in prayer 
in his bed room, Joseph says that a light began to appear, which 
increased in brilliancy until the room was brighter than at noon-day, 
when a personage appeared at his bedside, clothed in a robe of ex- 
quisite whiteness. 

This personage said that he was a messenger sent from the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY IV. IVINS 21 

presence of God, and that his name was Moroni, that the Lord had a 
great work for Joseph to do, and that his name should be known for 
both good and evil among all nations, that among some it would be 
held in honor, and among others in reproach. He also told him that there 
was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, containing the history 
of the ancient inhabitants of this continent, and that it also contained 
the fulness of the everlasting gospel, as it was delivered by the Savior 
to them, and that there was also deposited the Urim and Thummim, 
by means of which the characters engraven on the plates could be trans- 
lated. This was the Book of Mormon, which was later delivered to 
Joseph Smith, translated by him and first published to the world in 1830. 

While engaged in the work of translation, assisted by Oliver 
Cowdery, Joseph observed the importance which attached to the ordin- 
ance of baptism, and desiring greater light he and Oliver went to a 
secluded spot, on the bank of the Susquehanna River, and engaged in 
prayer. While thus occupied they bear witness that a messenger from 
heaven descended in a cloud of light, and laying his hands upon their 
heads said : "Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah 
I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the minister- 
ing of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins, and this shall never be taken again 
from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto 
the Lord in righteousness." 

This messenger told them that he was John the Baptist, that he 
acted under instruction from Peter, James and John. That the Aaronic 
Priesthood, which he had conferred had not the power to lay on hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that the keys of the Melchizedek 
Priesthood would be later conferred upon them. This latter priesthood 
was conferred upon Joseph and Oliver at a later date under the hands 
of Peter, James and John, who ordained them to the Apostleship, and 
committed to them the keys of the kingdom, and of the Gospel Dis- 
pensation of the Fulness of Times. 

It is upon this authority that the Church assumes to speak and act 
in the name of the Lord. 

THE CHURCH NOT A FACTION, BUT THE RESTORED CHURCH OF CHRIST 

The Church is not a protestant faction which has broken away 
from the mother church, or from any other religious body. It is the 
Church of Christ, our Lord, restored to earth as he and the prophets de- 
clared it should be, restored for the purpose of gathering the out- 
casts of Israel, that the way may be prepared for the coming of the 
Redeemer of the world, and the consummation of the purposes of 
the Lord, in so far as they pertain to the present generation of mankind, 
who occupy the small portion of the universe, which we call the world. 

WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT, SAY OBJECTORS 

Yes, says the objector, if this story were true your authority would 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

be sufficient, but we do not believe it. We do not believe that Joseph 
Smith, in vision, saw and communed with the Father and Son. We 
do not believe that heavenly messengers visited him, nor that the keys of 
the Priesthood were conferred upon him by John the Baptist, nor by 
Peter, James and John. These men died more than a thousand years 
ago, and the dead do not return to visit the living. Visions and 
the visitation of angels have long since been done away with, there 
are no such things in the age in which we live, Joseph Smith was 
either a visionary dreamer, and these imaginings were the result of a 
disordered mind, or else he was a wilful impostor. 

Neither did the people believe the words of the Redeemer of the 
world. They declared him to be an impostor, a disturber of the peace, 
that he was guilty of sedition, and was a blasphemer, because he de- 
clared himself to be the Son of God, and it was upon these and other 
similar charges that he was condemned to death upon the cross. The 
people did riot believe that Moses and Elias appeared to Peter, James 
and John, at the time of the transfiguration of the Redeemer, they had 
long been dead, and could not return. 

Nor did they believe Paul when he declared to King Agrippa and 
Festus, that as he journeyed toward Damascus, at noon day a light 
brighter than the sun descended from heaven which caused him, and 
those who were with him to fall to the earth. That a voice called to him 
declaring that it was Jesus of Nazareth who spoke, telling him to 
arise, and stand upon his feet, and said: "I have appeared unto thee 
for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness" to the people, 
especially to the Gentiles, "to open their eyes, and to turn them from 
darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God." The 
Redeemer had been crucified, declared dead, and Festus, who could not 
understand how he could appear to anyone, cried out: "Paul, thou 
art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad." But Paul 
answered, "I am not mad, most noble Festus ; but speak forth the 
words of truth and soberness." 

WE BEAR WITNESS OF THE RESTORATION 

So do we in soberness and truth bear witness to the people of the 
world today, to king and subject, to patrician and plebeian, to rich and 
poor, to Christian and heathen ; that Joseph Smith was divinely called to 
be the instrument in the hands of the Lord in the restoration of the 
gospel of Christ ; that the keys of the Priesthood were conferred upon 
him as has been stated, and have come down through his successors 
to the present. Another thing to which we bear witness is that all 
men may know the truth of the testimony which we bear by asking 
the Lord for it in faith. It is not by the words of men that you have been 
converted, my brethren and sisters, but by the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
which has borne witness of the truth of these things, and this great 
congregation of people would arise and testify to the truth of what I say 
if requested to do so. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 23 

WHAT WE BELIEVE 

We believe in the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, and 
that the Child born at Bethlehem of Judea was in very deed the Son of 
God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. That he is our 
advocate with the Father, the medium through which we reach the 
throne of grace. 

The foundation of the Church is laid in God the Eternal Father, 
his Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost, which constitute the God- 
head. No person can become a member of the Church until he has 
taken upon him the name of Christ, and entered into the covenant that 
he is willing to serve him, and keep the commandments which he 
has given, to the best of his ability. He must accept the ordinance 
of baptism, which is administered in the name of the Father, Son and 
Holy Ghost, in other words he must accept Christ as the Redeemer of 
the world, without reservation. 

The members of the Church meet together once each week and 
partake of the sacrament in remembrance of the body and blood of 
our Lord. Every ordinance of the Church, every act performed, is 
administered in the name of Christ. 

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK OF MORMON, SAY OBJECTORS 

But, says the objector, you accept the Book of Mormon as a 
revelation from God, thus bringing a new iBible into use when there 
can be but one Bible, and this we cannot accept. Even if such a record 
were to be brought forth, would the Lord undertake to accomplish it 
through the medium of an unlearned young man, when we have many 
profound scholars among us? 

Our reply to that objection is, he did choose Joseph Smith to 

accomplish it, and that should be sufficient answer. It is the same 

question asked regarding the Redeemer: "Is not this the carpenter's Son? 

■ is not his mother called Mary?" and are not his brothers and sisters all 

with us, whence hath this man all of these things? 

Why do Christian people reject the Book of Mormon? It is 
the strongest corroborative evidence of the truth of the Bible, and the 
divine mission of the Redeemer that exists in the world, and should be 
welcomed by all Christian people. It is of special value to America, and 
particularly to the people of the United States. It is the Holy Scripture 
of the American continent, and it outlines the establishment and destiny 
of our nation, asserting that our government was established by inspira- 
tion from the God of the land, whom it declares is Jesus Christ, and 
warns us that if we turn from him, and cease longer to recognize and 
serve him, his protection will be withdrawn, and the great promises 
which he made in regard to our destiny will be of no effect. 

ALL THE "MORMONS" ASK IS PERMISSION TO BELIEVE AS THEY CHOOSE 

The Latter-day Saints recognize and appreciate the great work ac- 
complished by the Christian churches of the world since the Reforma- 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

tion, in breaking down kingcraft, and priestcraft, thus preparing the 
way for the establishment of free government, freedom of worship, and 
the coming of our Lord Jesus. 

When brought before the Jewish high priests, Peter speaking for 
the Twelve declared that God had sent his Son to bring salvation to 
Israel. Hearing this truth they took council to slay them. 

So it is with us today. The world says if you will renounce this 
fable regarding visions and heavenly visitations to Joseph Smith, we 
will accept you as Christian people. Like Peter and Paul we answer : 
This we can never do, because it is the truth, and the experiences of the 
past teach us that it is dangerous to ignore the truth. 

All that we ask is to be permitted to believe as we choose, and 
we grant all men this privilege. We ask the people of the world to 
rely upon the words of Gamaliel, which have been quoted, for the;v 
are as true today as they were when uttered. If this work is of men it 
will come to naught, but if it is of God you cannot overthrow it. 
Like the primitive church, being defamed we entreat, being ridiculed 
we revile not; being persecuted we patiently submit, knowing that error 
must eventually yield to truth, and that time is the friend of innocence. 
We submit our cause to the Lord, our God, to whom be glory and praise 
and honor, through Jesus Christ, his Son. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem, "O blessed be the Lord," with music 
by B. Cecil Gates, and the solo by Delores Seal. 

Closing prayer was offered by Elder Joseph B. Keeler, of Provo. 
The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock the congregation was asked by President Heber J. 
Grant, who presided, to sing with the choir the hymn, "How firm a 
foundation, ye Saints of the Lord." The hymn was sung with spirit 
and earnestness. 

Elder Winslow Farr Smith, president of the Ensign stake of Zion, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The choir sang the hymn, "An angel from on high," the duets 
being sung by Mrs. Alfred W. Davis and Hyrum Christensen, with 
sympathetic interpretation. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

I read from the twenty-fourth chapter of Luke, beginning at the 
first verse: 

Christ's resurrection 

"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came 
unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain 
others with them. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 25 

"And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 

"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 

"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two 
men stood by them in shining garments : 

"And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said 
unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 

"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he 
was yet in Galilee, 

"Saying, the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, 
and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 

And they remembered his words." 

DOUBLE ASSURANCE OF THE RISEN LORD 

Throughout the Christian world today this event is celebrated, the 
theme discussed, the thought memorized, and appropriate words are 
spoken upon this and kindred scripture concerning the resurrection 
of our Lord. Our flowers here, these Easter lilies, symbolize that 
thought, and we, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, believe every word of the scripture which I have read. We 
accept it literally. We believe that the same body which the Lord Jesus 
had in his mortal life was resurrected and became a glorified body of 
flesh and bone. We have evidence of this in addition to that contained 
in the New Testament; for as Latter-day Saints we believe that this 
same Jesus, who was crucified and who rose from the dead, did in 
these latter days appear and reveal himself to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and taught him how to lay the foundation of this great latter- 
day work. 

So we have a double assurance, not only the assurance of the 
scriptures which Christians generally accept, but the further assurance 
that the same Jesus has come to earth in these latter times and has 
established the same Church, the same doctrines, the same principles 
of salvation, with the same power and authority which he instituted in 
the meridian of time, before his crucifixion and after. 

PRINCIPLES AND DOCTRINES THE SAME AS CHRIST TAUGHT 

He has given to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
in these days the same authority and principles and has empowered it 
to perform the same work which he instructed his apostles and disciples 
to perform in former times, namely, to go into all the world and 
preach the gospel to every creature. It is the same doctrine, without 
any change. The Savior commanded his disciples to go forth and 
depend not upon themselves, but upon the Lord, and he promised that 
he would feed and clothe them and take care of them. In other words, 
they were not to ask : "Is there a salary connected with it ? How 
much are we going to get?" In the olden time, as you read in the 
scriptures, he said nothing of salary, but on the contrary, his instruc- 
tions were that they should go without purse or scrip, and depend upon 
the Lord. 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

THE SAME DOCTRINE 

The same doctrine is preached today by the Church of Jesus 
Christ; and as we heard from President Grant this morning, over 
2,500 of our missionaries are out in the world today, doing that very 
work and doing it in the very same way. They maintain themselves, 
they depend upon their own efforts. The Church does not hire them. 
There is no hiring in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
in that sense. It is true that when a man is asked to devote the whole 
of his time to Church work, he must be supplied with sufficient to live 
on. The people among whom the elders labor in the missions of the 
world usually take care of them where they can. If they cannot, and 
converts or friends cannot assist them, then these men are expected 
to furnish the means themselves and make that much of a sacrifice 
for preaching and teaching and delivering this wonderful message to 
the world. 

THE WORK IS DONE WITHOUT PAY 

Here at home our bishops are called to act as fathers to the peo- 
ple in their wards. Are they paid any salaries ? No. It is true that 
they are allowed a little, the general average of which amounts to 50 
cents a day, for taking care of the tithes and for being responsible for 
the money, but not for presiding over the ward, and not for administer- 
ing in the authority of the priesthood. It is given for the special work 
he performs as bishop — that of taking in the tithes, looking after the 
hay, the butter, the eggs, or whatever is turned in on tithing. For 
this particular work a meagre allowance is made which amounts to 
about 50 cents a day per bishop; but no salary is paid to our bishops. 

Then there are others, such as the men on this stand, and mission 
presidents also, who are called to devote their entire time to the Church. 
They have no time to look after temporal affairs of their own ; they 
must work and go where they are sent. They are liable to be called 
to go to this mission or the other mission, even to the ends of the 
earth, any day, any hour, and they are expected to comply, and do 
comply. So they have no time to provide means for their families, or 
to speculate in this or the other. It is necessary, therefore, for the 
Church to provide for them. But even they do not receive "salaries," 
because a salary is what a man receives when he hires himself out. 
Over there in the office of the Short Line Railroad company, or in any 
of the big offices or stores, men are hired for certain amounts, and 
if they do well, the salary is increased. A man may go from one job 
to another, and do the best he can for his family and for himself, and 
that is all right; he is entitled to do it. That is working for hire, 
or for a salary. But could you get one of the mission presidents to leave 
the Church work and hire himself out for money? No. Could you 
hire any of these seventies, the presiding bishopric, the apostles, the 
presidency of the Church? Not one, not one. Of necessity, when a 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY 27 

man has not the means to support himself, the Church must support him, 
so that he can continue his work. 

.Such men as I have mentioned, therefore, who are devoting their 
entire time to the Church, receive an allowance, though a very meagre 
one in comparison to what is usually allowed men of that kind in other 
walks of life. There are men on this stand, and throughout the Church, 
who, by devoting their entire time to their own affairs, could double 
or treble or quadruple the small allowance that is given them by the 
Church for their support. 

So I can safely say that in this Church, as in the primitive church, 
there is no hireling service. The same spirit of sacrifice that the Lord 
then required obtains now in his Church. Our parents sacrificed for 
this work in coming to this land and redeeming it from the desert it 
was. Our missionaries go out now and sacrifice. It is essentially a 
work of sacrifice. They give the best years of their lives for the 
work of the Lord without any thought of compensation. There is a 
continual stream of missionaries coming and going. What for? To 
deliver this message to the world, namely : that the Lord God of heaven 
■ — this same Jesus Christ of whom I have read who was crucified and put 
to death, and who obtained through the keys of the resurrection power 
over death and the grave ; for he said : "I am the resurrection and the 
life" — has established the same kind of a Church in this day, and has 
restored the same gospel as was preached in his day ; and he expects us 
to deliver that most important message. 

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE WORLD TO KNOW 

Now let me tell you, my brethren and sisters, the most important 
thing for the world to know today is that God lives, and that Jesus 
is indeed the Christ, the Son of the living God, and that he has restored 
his work to the earth through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith the 
Prophet. The same doctrine of faith is here today that was in the 
primitive church. The same doctrine of repentance is here. The same 
doctrine of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is here. The 
same doctrine of the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost is here. The same power of the Holy Priesthood is here. The 
power of God unto salvation is here today in this Church as strong, 
as powerful, and as potent as it was in the days of Jesus Christ, when he 
dwelt here in the flesh. The same principles are advanced — love, 
patience, integrity, sacrifice, everything that makes for righteousness 
and the well-being of mankind. Every principle, every ideal, every 
thought that makes for the betterment and the salvation of mankind is 
here in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today, as it was 
nineteen hundred years ago in the primitive church. And the beauty 
of it all is that you know it ! You are not deceived. 

THE CHURCH BUILT UPON THE ROCK OF REVELATION 

We would be foolish to try to deceive ourselves. We know by 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the same power that Peter knew; and what was that? "Whom do 
men say that I the Son of man am?" the Savior asked. And they 
said: "Some say thou art John the Baptist; some Elias; and others, 
Jeremias, or one of the prophets." The Savior said: "But whom say 
ye that I am?" Peter answered and said unto him: "Thou art the 
Christ, the Son of the Living God." And the Savior answered, 
"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: [as much as to say, it is a fine 
thing to have that testimony, that knowledge] for flesh and blood hath 
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven * * * '* 
and upon this rock [this rock of revelation] I will build my Church; 
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." 

We are built upon the same rock of revelation. We have the 
knowledge of God. The key to the knowledge of God is in this Church. 
The power of the Priesthood is here, the same power as formerly, to 
lead the people, and the people know it. It is written here in the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants that it shall come to pass that God's 
people shall come to know who are the servants of the Lord, and who 
are not, and they shall judge all things, and so forth. 

This individual testimony, this positive assurance which is given 
to every Latter-day Saint through revelation, by the power of the 
Holy Ghost, is the same testimony and spirit that our fathers and 
mothers received when they joined the Church in the old countries. 
And every man and woman in all the world may receive it if they 
only will. There is a challenge here in the last chapter of the Book of 
Mormon, which is to all people, that any man who, with real intent, 
not half believing, but believing fully, shall say in his heart: "Oh, 
God, show me thy way, thy truth, thy light, the right path, and I will 
follow it, no matter what its name is or how discredited it may be by 
the world," will receive in his heart a testimony, if he so ask of God. 

FOR A TESTIMONY, GO TO THE LORD 

So all we say to our friends, our neighbors, our brethren and sisters 
everywhere, is : Take it to the Lord. You need not take our word ; go 
to the Lord in prayer, but in the true spirit of faith, for no other spirit 
will avail, and you have my word for it, and the word of ten thousand 
Latter-day Saints here assembled, that you will receive the same testi- 
mony, for the Lord does not fail. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in being permitted to labor in 
this great cause. I have been at it for more than sixty years, and more 
and more I see the splendor of it, the glory of it, the power of it, the 
strength, the salvation that is in it. I know it is true, it is of God. You 
cannot fail, my brethren and sisters, if you but put your trust in him. 
And if we have erred or done ought amiss, that blessed principle 
of repentance which he has implanted in his Church is here to save us 
if we will but correct our error, forsake evil, and cleave to that which 
is good. 

Where can we find anything -like it ? Where else in all the world is 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY 29 

there such an organization. There is within it that power, that im- 
pelling force that brings you and me and Latter-day Saints everywhere, 
in joy, in gladness, in pleasure, to serve the Lord. It brings us to 
respect the Priesthood — the apostles, the bishops of the wards, the 
presidencies of stakes, each in his order and in his place, because the 
Lord has called them, by that same power and spirit that I have spoken 
of, namely, by the gower of revelation. How are we to acquire that? 
If you will read the eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
the Lord tells you this, if you will pray about it : 

"Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, 
which shall come upon ycu and which shall dwell in your heart. 

"Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation ; behold, this is the spirit by 
which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground." 

This is the spirit that he gave to all his ancient prophets and 
apostles. 

I testify that this is the same spirit and influence' that he gave 
to President Young in his ministry, and to every succeeding president. 
It is the spirit that he gives to President Grant today in his ministry, 
and he receives it in the same way, by prayer, by faith, by righteous 
living, by being worthy to receive it. That counts for a lot, I want to tell 
you. "Worthy art thou, O Lord," it was said of him, "to sit on high." 

THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE IS THE SPIRIT OF THIS WORK 

The president of the Church today gives us, by counsel, by advice, 
by the inspiration of the spirit, that admonition which is for our salva- 
tion. After the president talked this forenoon and after President Ivins' 
splendid discourse, I was going over all these items in my mind and 
I thought : "What sane man — I don't care what his religion is, or if he 
has no religion — what sane man anywhere could object to the teachings 
of these brethren?" Now put that question to yourselves, my brethren 
and sisters and friends. Were they not good, were they not wholesome, 
were they not for the betterment of mankind for the best that is in men, 
for good government, for good order, for good citizenship? The gospel 
of Jesus Christ is intended to make me a better husband, a better father, 
a better citizen, if I will only obey its laws. 

Let us, my brethren and sisters be willing to sacrifice for the Lord, 
for his work. There is a great work yet to perform in all the world. 
As we have heard from the president, missionaries are called for from 
every quarter. We have had volunteers, and many who have been 
called, who have gone and have done a splendid work. I recall now 
one of them, and I am going to mention his name: Brother A. A. 
Hinckley. He wrote to the presidency sometime ago and said : "I 
see that there has been a call for missionaries to go out for six months." 
And he further said : "The Lord has blessed me very much, I ought 
to be very grateful, and I am very grateful ;" and he went on to mention 
the blessings, for the spirit of gratitude was in his heart. "Now I am 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

willing to go, I am willing to stay, I am willing to do whatever you want 
me to do." With tears in my eyes, I listened as the president read that 
letter, and I thought, "God bless such a man." 

THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE 

There is the spirit of this work, there is the spirit that makes this 
thing go, that holds me and holds you — the real spirit of sacrifice. 
Willing to go on missions ? Yes, anxious to go, to let everybody know 
that God has spoken, that we have the knowledge of God, the testi- 
mony of it, the same Christ our Lord that was crucified, whose resur- 
rection the people in all the world are celebrating today. He has put 
into our hearts the knowledge that the greatest thing that we have to 
do and that his Church will forever have to do, so far as I know, is to 
proclaim this gospel, to spread this truth, to bring people into the same 
way of thinking, the same spirit and power that is in the priesthood 
and in the Church, the same happiness, the same joy, the same blessing, 
the same salvation. That is the greatest work that is before you and 
me, and we ought to be anxiously engaged in such a work, and not 
wait until we are commanded in all things; for he that waits until he 
is commanded, and does nothing until he is commanded, the same 
is a slothful servant and unworthy. 

MAY THE LORD GLORIFY HIS WORK 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will magnify and 
glorify his work. We can't do it; but he will do it through us, — 
through you, through me, and men and women like you and me ; for it 
is his work. It is by his power, as President Grant read to you, in 
that greeting this morning. It is the Lord we say who has done it. As 
stated in the Holy Bible (Psalm 100): "It is he that hath 
made us, and not we ourselves," so it is he that hath made this work 
and brought it to pass, and put the power and the spirit in it, which 
no man can do; but with that spirit in us we can conquer the world 
for righteousness, for peace on earth, good will toward all men, which 
I humbly pray he will hasten, in his time, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Following the sermon by President Nibley, the choir and con- 
gregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

APROPOS OF EASTER DAY: "WE STAND FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TESTIMONY 1 
OF THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST" 

The adoption by the Mutual Improvement Associations of this 
their latest slogan was most opportune. For it comes at a time 
when the question of Christ's divinity is being widely agitated. 
Someone has wittily said that the automobile is fast resolving the 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 31 

human race into two great classes — the quick and the dead. 
Even so, though in quite another way, the controversy over the 
divinity or non-divinity of Jesus of Nazareth is dividing the Christian 
world into two opposing militant camps — the Fundamentalists and the 
Modernists, so-called. 

FUNDAMENTALISTS VS MODERNISTS 

The Fundamentalists, with whom I class myself and all Latter- 
day Saints, in a general way, are those who adhere to the old 
and established belief that Jesus Christ was the very Son of God, 
born of a virgin mother; that he was the author of the resurrec- 
tion, the giver of eternal life, and withal a worker of miracles. We 
verily believe that he walked upon water, turned water into wine, 
healed the sick, cast out devils, gave sight to the blind, caused the 
lame to walk, and did many other mighty and marvelous works, 
all by virtue of the divine power within him. 

The Modernists, who regard themselves as advanced thinkers, 
as the intellectually "quick," while their opponents are the spirit- 
ually "dead," look upon Jesus as a good and great man, the wisest 
and noblest teacher that the world has ever known. But they 
scout the idea of his being a miracle-worker, or the author and 
giver of eternal life. They do not positively deny that he could 
have worked a miracle, had he been so minded; they are simply 
not convinced that he could or did. This I believe is a fair 
statement of their position. 

Many years ago, when I was a ward bishop in this city, a 
Primary Association conference was held one Sunday evening in 
the ward chapel. One of the sisters, gathering the little tots around 
her on the stand, told them the story of Jesus feeding the multitude 
in the miraculous manner set forth in the New Testament. Going 
home that night, one of the mothers, anxious to impress the lesson 
upon the mind of her little son, asked him certain questions con- 
cerning it. "What did Sister Blank tell us this evening?" The 
boy replied: "She told us how the Savior fed the people.'' How 
many people?" "Five thousand." "And what did he feed them 
with?" "Five loaves of bread and two fishes." "Well, now," said 
the mother, "how do you suppose he could do that?" The little 
fellow mused a moment, and then blurted out: "Well, I don't 
believe those in the middle got any." 

He was a Modernist. He did not believe in miracles. He did 
not realize that it was by divine power that this marvelous deed 
was done. His child mind could not allow for the difference — 
the vast difference between the omnipotence of Almighty God and 
the puny strength of mortal man. And that's the trouble with 
many grown up children at the present time. 

They who doubt the divinity of Jesus Christ can hardly be 
expected to believe in the wonderful works wrought by him. But 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

they who accept him as the Son of God can accept his miracles also, 
the problem resolving itself into a simple question of cause and 
effect. 

"natural supernaturalism" 

Men say that they do not believe in miracles because they 
are contrary to the laws of nature.- "What are the laws of Na- 
ture?" asks Carlyle, and answers his own question thus: 

"To me perhaps the rising of one from the dead were no 
violation of these laws, but a confirmation, if some far deeper law, 
now first penetrated into, and by spiritual force, even as the rest 
have all been, were brought to bear on us with its material force. 

" 'But is it not the deepest law of Nature that she be constant?' 
cries an illuminated class. 'Is not the machine of the universe fixt 
to move by unalterable rules?' Probable enough, good friends * * * 
And now of you, too, I make the old inquiry : What those same un- 
alterable rules, forming the complete statute book of Nature, may 
possibly be ? 

"'They stand written in our works of science,' say you; 'in 
the accumulated record of man's experience.' Was man with his 
experience present at the creation, then, to see how it all went 
on? Have any deepest scientific individuals yet dived down to the 
foundations of the universe, and gauged everything there? Did the 
Maker take them into his counsel, that they read his ground-plan of 
the incomprehensible All, and can say, This stands marked therein, 
and no more than this? Alas, not in any wise! 

"To the minnow, every cranny and pebble and quality and ac- 
cident of its little native creek may have become familiar; but does 
the minnow understand the ocean tides and periodic currents, the 
trade winds and monsoons and moon's eclipses, by all of which the 
condition of its little creek is regulated, and may, from time to 
time (unmiraculously enough) be quite upset and reversed? Such 
a minnow is man; his creek this planet earth; his ocean the im- 
measurable All ; his monsoons and periodic currents the mysterious 
force of Providence through aeons of aeons." — Sartor Resartus. 

MIRACLES, THE FRUITS OF FAITH 

I need but add to this masterly philosophic defense, that it 
were indeed a pitiful begging of the question for any one to say : 
Because I cannot do a certain thing, therefore it cannot be done; 
I cannot work a miracle, consequently no miracle was ever wrought. 
Miracles are the fruits of faith. Nobody claims that unbelief can 
perform them. 

Time will not permit me to pursue this subject further, nor is 
it necessary that I should do so. Before sitting down, however, I 
would like to touch upon another topic, suggested by Carlyle's 
pointed question: "Was man present at the Creation?" 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 33 

WHEN MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER 

A similar question was once put to a righteous man named 
Job, whom God answered "out of the whirlwind/' saying: "Where 
wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare if 
thou hast understanding * * * When the morning stars sang 
together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (Job 38:1-7.) 

Job does not seem to have answered the question. Perhaps 
he did not have sufficient "understanding," and, unlike the "il- 
luminated class" mentioned, would not assume to know what he 
did not know. But another righteous man named Abraham, who 
lived four centuries before the time of Job, had virtually answered 
that question; and his answer slept for two thousand years in the 
wrappings of a mummy in the catacombs of Egypt, awaiting the 
hour when Joseph Smith would give to the world his translation of the 
Book of Abraham. Therein the Father of the Faithful says : 

ABRAHAM AND PRE-EXISTENCE 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences 
that were organized before the world was; and among all these 
there were many of the noble and great ones; 

"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood 
in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; 
for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they 
were good ; and he said unto me : Abraham, thou art one of them ; 
thou wast chosen before thou wast born. 

"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, 
and he said unto those who were with him : We will go down, 
for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we 
will make an earth whereon these may dwell; 

"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all 
things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them ; 

"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; 
and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the 
same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and 
they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their 
heads forever and ever." (Abraham 3 :22-26.) 

How majestic! How sublime! And how wonderfully com- 
prehensive! Surely the Book of Abraham bears testimony to its 
own divine origin. The sublimity of its doctrines and the spirit ac- 
companying them are proof positive that they came right down 
from heaven. 

BISHOP SPALDING AND THE SPEAKER 

I bear in mind a conversation that I had with the late Bishop 
Franklin S. Spalding, of the Episcopal Church, whose untimely 
accidental death some years ago we all deeply deplored. He had 
attacked the Book of Abraham in a published commentary, and was 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

answered by a number of our brethren through the press. Soon 
afterwards I met the Bishop, with whom I was quite well ac- 
quainted, and he said to me : "Why have you not answered me ?" 
"I have," was my reply; "I have been answering you all over the 
country, but it hasn't gotten into the papers." "Oh, indeed, and what 
have you been saying?" he inquired. "I have been saying this: 

" 'Truth is truth, where'er 'tis found, 
On Christian or on heathen ground.' 

"And whether it be taken from an ancient hill in North 
America, as was the Book of Mormon; or from the catacombs of 
Egypt, as was the Book, of Abraham, if it's true, it's true, no 
matter who translated it, or how many supposed flaws appear in 
the translation. The character of the content and the spirit that 
goes along with it, determines better, than all else its truth, its 
authenticity. We know Shakespeare's writings by the very sound 
of them — they have the Shakespearean ring. Literary experts can 
tell the difference between those writings and all others. We 
recognize Milton's poetry by the Miltonic ring; the poetry of Byron 
and Tennyson by the Byronic or Tennysonian ring. Then, if God 
speaks, why should it not have a Godlike ring, something that no 
man can counterfeit, nor any but a spiritual expert fully appreciate?" 

Bishop Spalding agreed with me. Not as to the Book of 
Abraham, but as to the best way of testing any book. "I am 
one with you," he said, "in the belief that the highest evidence of the 
truth of any work is the spirit that it breathes and the wisdom 
that it inculcates." "Then," said I, "this Book of Abraham needs 
no defense from me, nor from anyone else. It speaks for itself; 
it defends itself. By the majesty of its language, by the sublimity of 
its teachings and by the Spirit that permeates them, it proclaims 
itself divine." 

A GRAMMATICAL ERROR 

Prior to that time I had a conversation with another would- 
be censor of our sacred books. He accosted me on the street with 
the question: "Bishop Whitney, do you believe the Book of Mor- 
mon to be the word of God?" "I certainly do," said I. "Well, can't 
God speak grammatically?" "Of course he can." "Then why was 
this grammatical error left in the Book of Mormon ?" — and he 
quoted it. "Do you really want to know?" "Yes," he said. 
"Well, I think that was left there just to keep you out of the 
Church." 

He seemed surprised: "Doesn't God want me in his Church?" 
"No," I said; "he only wants, honest seekers after truth; and if you 
think more of a grammatical error than you do of your soul's 
salvation, you are not fit for the kingdom of heaven, and the Lord 
doesn't want you." 



ELDER ORSON E. WHITNEY 35 

He was astonished. It was something he hadn't thought of. 
He felt very much as Goliath did when the stone sank into his fore- 
head — such a thing had never entered his head before. 

THE CREATION TWO-FOLD 

Back now to the Book of Abraham: "And then the Lord 
said, Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning, and 
they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the 
earth." 

The creation was two-fold, firstly, spiritual ; secondly, tem- 
poral. All divine creations have a spirit, even the trees and the 
flowers. In other words, they are souls, spirit and body combined. 
A learned man who was a chemist set himself to the task of making 
a grain of wheat, in imitation of one produced by the God of nature. 
Taking such a grain, he separated it into its component parts, find- 
ing that there was so much lime, so much silica, so much of this 
element and that, in its composition. Then, taking just such 
proportions of each element, he brought them together by his 
chemical skill and created a grain of wheat, so exactly similar to 
the natural grain, that the eye could not detect the difference. 
But there was a difference — a vast difference. He planted the 
two grains, and the one that God made sprang up, while the one 
that man made stayed down. God's wheat grain had a spirit; 
the other had none. 

"There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty 
giveth it understanding.'' There is a spirit in all of our Father's 
creations. They were made "for a wise and glorious purpose," 
and will be perpetuated in the great hereafter. The poet Byron, 
in a cynical epitaph on the monument of his favorite dog, wrote: 
"Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth." But "Mormonism"' 
teaches no such doctrine. Joseph Smith declared that not only 
the human race, but the lower orders of the animal creation were 
designed for eternal felicity. And John the Revelator teaches the 
same doctrine in the sublime symbolism of the Apocalypse. 

PURPOSES OF EARTH LIFE 

This earth was created, not out of nothing, as antiquated 
theology asserts ; but out of eternal spirit and eternal element ; and 
it is but one of millions like it that have been created, peopled and 
redeemed by the same All-wise God, who has placed his children 
here, primarily to give their spirits bodies, that they might be- 
come souls, capable of endless increase and advancement; also that 
it might be seen whether they would do all that the Lord requires 
at their hands. 

We are here for education and development, through joy and 
sorrow, through smiles and tears, through pleasure and pain, 
bitter and sweet, light and darkness, enduring the vicissitudes 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and contrasts of mortal life, that we may become wise and gain 
a glorious experience. And if we now walk by faith, as we once 
walked by sight, and keep this second estate as we kept the first, 
or spirit estate (and were "added upon" for so doing), we shall reap 
the promised reward and "have glory added upon our heads for- 
ever and ever.'' 

CARLYLE ANSWERED 

Yes, Carlyle, man was present at the creation — but not with 
his mortal experience, nor yet with his mortal blindness. With 
clear, unclouded vision we looked on while the foundations of the 
earth were laid ; and it was because we could see past the gloom 
to the glory that lay beyond, that "the morning stars sang to- 
gether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.'' 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"Wherefore of these men * * * must one be ordained to be 
a witness with us of his resurrection." 

THE GREATEST OF ALL MIRACLES 

The greatest of all miracles is being celebrated by the Christian 
world today in the world-wide festival called Easter. Elder Whitney 
has referred to the reasonableness of the miracles of Jesus Christ. I say 
the greatest of all miracles is his resurrection from the dead ; professed 
followers of the risen Lord are celebrating, in form at least, this great 
miracle. We have heard today that many people reject the reality of 
the resurrection of the Lord. They believe, or profess to believe, in 
his teachings, but do not believe in the immaculate conception, nor in 
his literal resurrection from the grave ; yet, this latter fact was the very 
foundation of the early Christian church. The passage I have just read 
in your hearing is contained in the first chapter of Acts, and is 
accepted as being the testimony of Peter, the chief apostle on the 
occasion when the eleven had met to choose one to take the place of 
Judas Iscariot. It always interests me to study about the class of men 
that surrounded the apostles at that time, from whom the apostles 
chose this special witness. They were men who had been "witnesses" 
of the resurrection. Only such a one was considered eligible and worthy 
to be chosen one of the Twelve Apostles. I read further: 

"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 

"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received 
of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which 
ye now see and hear." 

Peter then continues : 

"Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved 
of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him 
in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know : 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 37 

"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 
"Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death." 

THE REALITY OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST 

There seems to have been no question about the reality of Christ's 
resurrection in Peter's mind when he spoke to the very men, some of 
whom at least, had been witnesses of Jesus' death. Prior to this, as I 
have said, Peter had declared to the eleven that "we must choose from 
among those who are such witnesses, one who will stand by us as eye 
witness of the Lord's resurrection." There is no doubt, so far as the 
first chapter and the second chapter of Acts are concerned that the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ was a reality. No Christian can read 
it without being convinced that these early apostles, were firmly con- 
vinced that the resurrection of the Lord was real. Jesus their Lord 
was as real to them after his resurrection as he had been prior to his 
crucifixion, a man among them, though divine. 

Later another man testified to the same thing. He was Paul, known 
as Saul of Tarsus. In his early life Saul did not believe that Jesus Christ 
had risen from the dead. When he was sitting at the feet of Gamaliel, 
studying the philosophy of the times, he undoubtedly would have_ ridi- 
culed the idea. To that extent, Paul was a modernist in every sense of 
the word. Just before his conversion he not only ridiculed the idea, but 
secured papers that authorized him to punish all who did believe in the 
resurrection of Christ, and yet Paul was a Pharisee, the members of 
which sect believed in the doctrine of the resurrection. However, there 
came a wonderful change in this persecutor's life. This same Jesus who 
had been crucified and who had risen from the dead, appeared to 
Paul when he was on his way to Damascus with papers in his pocket 
to- arrest the saints who dwelt in that old city. 

"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" said the voice. "Who art 
thou, Lord ?" "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee 
to kick against the pricks." "What wouldst thou have me do?" "Arise 
and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do." 
Later Paul wrote that testimony, and we have it today as the oldest 
authentic written record testifying to the literal resurrection of the 
Lord. That oldest written testimony is not the one I have just read 
in Acts, it is not found in Matthew, the first book in the New Testament, 
it is not in Mark nor Luke nor John, but the first epistle to the Corin- 
thians. If you will turn there to that epistle you will find a wonderful 
array of testimony to the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
In the Fifteenth Chapter I read the following : 

"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that 
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ; 

"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according 
to Hie scriptures : 

"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"After that, he was seen of above five thousand brethren at once ; of whom 
the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. 

"After that, he was seen of James ; then of all the apostles. 

"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 

"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an 
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God," 

WITNESSES TO THE RESURRECTION 

Some may say : "If we knew that these testimonies were the direct 
testimonies of these men, then we should give full credence to them." 
"But," say the critics, "we do not know that Peter's testimony as 
recorded in Acts is as he gave it, because he did not write the Acts of 
the Apostles." True, but we do know that Paul and Luke and Mark 
and other writers of the New Testament did communicate with Peter 
as the chief of the apostles. We do know from this authentic record 
from which I have read that Paul communed with some of these five 
hundred men, at least our inference that he did is justifiable. He 
watched them so closely that when one of those eye-witnesses died he 
evidently took note of it as much as to say: "There is another of the 
eye witnesses to the resurrected Lord gone to the other side." What 
else can you read in that phrase, "but some have fallen asleep?" Mark, 
Luke and Paul conversed with Peter. We have that testimony from 
Paul's own writings ; and what would be the nature of their conversa- 
tion? "Peter," Paul would say, "did you really see the resurrected 
Lord ?" Peter's answer was affirmative, because here Paul says : "He 
was seen of Cephas" or Peter. Paul in another place says : "I con- 
versed with James," who was then presiding over the branch in Jeru- 
salem. There can be no doubt that Paul would say : "James, did you 
see the risen Lord ?" James' answer is found in the fifteenth chapter of 
Corinthians. 

What can we do if we cannot accept such irrefutable evidence? 
To me their testimonies mean but one thing, and that is that Jesus 
Christ who was born of the Virgin Mary, who preached the gospel after 
his own name, who sought the lost ones, whose life as we know' it, even 
from the fragmentary accounts thereof, is an inspiration and has been 
an inspiration to millions, for two thousand years, who was crucified in 
ignominy and who was buried; that this same Jesus Christ arose from 
the grave literally, and that the early Christian church was founded 
upon that divine fact. 

THE GREAT AND COMFORTING MESSAGE 

Marvelous miracle it is ! but oh, what a message to your soul and 
to mine! If he, Lord and Savior, conquered death after having taken 
upon himself mortality, then we have the divine assurance that our 
spirits shall transcend that thing which we call death. We have the 
assurance that our loved ones who have gone before, now live, for death 
cannot touch the offspring of God, the spirit which is divine. That is 
the message. 



ELDER DAVID O. M.cKAY 39 

As was stated here on another occasion, we have witnesses nearer 
to our day than Peter, Mark and Paul and the others. This vast 
congregation is assembled on this Easter day because of witnesses in 
this dispensation, of the reality of Christ's resurrection, and the integrity 
of these men is unquestioned, too, by all honest persons who have 
studied the characters of these witnesses. Those who misunderstand it are 
those who in ignorance or through wilfulness desire so to do. 

A LATTER-DAY WITNESS 

The latter-day witness is this : that Jesus Christ, the resurrected 
Lord, appeared by the side of his eternal Father who introduced him in 
this dispensation as follows : 

"This is my beloved Son, hear him;" As the Christian church 
in the meridian of time was founded upon the reality of the living 
Christ, — not merely upon the teachings of the Great Teacher — so the 
Church of Jesus Christ in this age was founded upon the reality of 
Christ's existence and upon the reality of his appearance in this dis- 
pensation to the earnest seeking boy, Joseph Smith. 

OTHER CORROBORATIVE WITNESSES 

Other witnesses corroborate the testimony of the reality of Christ's 
appearing, and also to the reality of the appearing of resurrected beings, 
which confirms the reality of the resurrection from the dead. Christ's 
personality, as his divinity, persisted after death. This being true, then 
God is beyond all doubt a resurrected personal being. 

"It is the eye of faith that sees the broad horizons, the color and the gleam. 
Religion standing on the known experience of the race, makes one bold and 
glorious affirmation. She asserts that this power that makes for truth, for 
beauty and for goodness is not less personal than we." [And that is the declara- 
tion of the Church of Jesus Christ, that he is not less personal than we, and that 
his Father, the eternal Father, is a personal God.] "This leap of faith is justified 
because God cannot be less than the greatest of his works, the cause must be 
adequate to the effect. When, therefore, we call God personal, we have inter- 
preted him by the loftiest symbol we have. He may be infinitely more. He can- 
not be less. When we call God a spirit, we use the clearest lens we have to look 
at the infinite. As Herbert Spencer has well said : 'The choice is not between 
a personal God and something lower, but between God and something higher.' " 

So wrote Charles Dinsmore of Yale. 

WHERE THE L. D. S. CHURCH STANDS ON THE QUESTION 

So, the Latter-day Saints declare to the world that God is a per- 
sonal God, not just a power, and force, he is that and more. He is 
all that because of his divine and eternal personality, and the Church 
stands on the reality of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus 
Christ. 

AN APPEAL TO THE YOUTH OF THE CHURCH 

Fellowworkers, young men of Israel, standing on that platform, 
having in our hearts the testimony that Christ lives, and that this is 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

his Church, I ask you how can we turn an indifferent ear to the appeal 
made this morning by the President of our Church to defend, to honor 
the laws of our land, to labor by example and by precept to establish in all 
our communities, a determination to keep the communities pure from the 
contaminating influences of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. I should 
like to see the application of this testimony, the reality of Christ's resur- 
rection and belief on his gospel, made manifest in a high moral and spirit- 
ual condition that would radiate righteousness from the individual lives 
and the communities of those who make that profession. Latter-day 
Saints, a message was given this morning in an appeal to sustain the 
Eigtheenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and I 
hope we shall never hear of officers in the stakes or in wards, nor of 
young men, nor young women who are led astray by the propaganda that 
is now being spread over this country with the avowed intention 
to bring about a modification of the prohibition law. If you have the 
testimony of Jesus Christ, if you know that the principles he has revealed 
are true, then you will obey the Word of Wisdom, and also stand by 
the prohibition laws of this country. Knowing as I do that the gospel 
of Jesus Christ is true, I pray God to help me and mine and my friends 
to be true to those principles, which we all know Christ will be pleased 
to have us incorporate in our lives. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I will read a verse or two from the fifth chapter of the Gospel 
according to St. John : 

"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself 
doeth ; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 

"For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so 
the Son quickeneth whom he will. 

"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment 
unto the Son: 

"That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. 

"He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which hath sent him. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth 
on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into con- 
demnation ; but is passed from death unto life." 

CHRIST THE FIRST' FRUITS OF THE RESURRECTION 

During this conference we have had presented the evidence 
from the scriptures that Jesus Christ arose from the dead and 
was the first fruits of the resurrection. The witnesses of this 
wonderful occurrence cannot be impeached. In this day the ten- 
dency of the religious world is away from this fundamental truth, 
and ministers and teachers are denying that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Only Begotten Son of God. I have read this passage to show 
that the Savior taught that no man can testify of God and reject 
his Son ; and that no man can deny that Jesus Christ is the Re- 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 41 

deemer of the world and believe in the Father who sent him. We 
must honor the Father through the Son, and he who rejects the Son 
and denies the power of the resurrection knows not God. Again 
the Savior said: 

"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he 
that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God 
abideth on him." 

This does not mean that those who reject the Son shall not 
come forth in the resurrection, for all shall be raised from the 
dead, but the unbeliever shall not partake of eternal life in the 
kingdom of God where dwell the Father and the Son. It is, 
however, the purpose of the Father to extend the power of the 
resurrection to all men, through the atonement of the Son, and 
thus give immortality to all his children. The fact remains, 
however, that we cannot be in fellowship with God and not accept 
the Sonship of Jesus Christ and believe in his power to redeem 
us from the grave. Therefore all who reject the authority of the 
Son have the wrath of God abiding on them. 

WHY THE RESURRECTION ? 

At this point the question arises in my mind : Why the resur- 
rection ? That it is a fact we know, that is, we who are Latter-day 
Saints, for the Lord has revealed it unto us, and the scriptures 
on this truth are clear. We know that Christ appeared to his 
disciples after his resurrection and they have testified of his ap- 
pearance unto them. Now, why should there be a resurrection and 
the promise made that all men shall come forth from their graves? 
A great many people believe that the mortal body has served its 
purpose in this life and will not come forth from the dead, but that 
the spirit rises to dwell with God. Then why did Jesus Christ 
come into the world to die? Was it because the plan that the 
Father had arranged in the beginning had been frustrated, or 
destroyed, through the fall of man? Adam had a body before 
death came upon him and his fall was a part of the great plan 
of man's salvation. Mortality, and consequently death is due to the 
fall, and Jesus Christ came into the world to make reparation and 
to give man, through the resurrection, immortality and eternal life. 
In the Book of Mormon we are informed that man partakes of 
mortality that he may obtain experiences that could not come to 
him in any other way, and that through his obedience to the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, which is based on the infinite sacrifice of the Son 
of God, he may obtain salvation and exaltation in the presence 
of the Father and the Son. 

Surely the Lord understood the end from the beginning, and it 
was perfectly understood in the councils in the heavens before the 
world was made, that Jesus Christ was to come into this world 
to die and thus repair a broken law and again restore life to man- 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

kind that they might have it more abundantly. Peter testifies of 
this in the following words : 

"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible 
things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition 
from your fathers; 

"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish 
and without spot: 

"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but 
was manifest in these last times for you." 

So Peter has testified that Christ was called and foreordained 
to come into the world to bring to pass the resurrection and the 
redemption of man through the shedding of his blood ; and this 
is according to a plan devised before the foundation of the world 
was laid. Moreover, the Lord, speaking to John on the Isle of 
Patmos, says : 

"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches and 
wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory and blessing." 

'Then again in the same vision it is written : 

"And it was given unto him (the beast) to make war with the saints, and 
to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, 
and nations. 

"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are 
not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the 
world." 

By these scriptures we are informed that Christ was chosen 
before man was on earth to make atonement for death and sin in 
this world and thus give to man immortal life through the resur- 
rection. This doctrine was fully understood by the prophets of 
old. The Redeemer, himself, while walking along the road with 
his two disciples after his resurrection instructed them in these 
things, as follows : 

"And he said unto them, O fools and slow of heart to believe all that 
the prophets have spoken: _ . 

"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his 
glory? 

"And beginning with Moses and the Prophets, he expounded to them in 
all the scriptures the things concerning himself." 

EXISTENCE IN MORTALITY MOST IMPORTANT 

After this conversation he met with the eleven apostles and 
again repeated these prophecies and later sent his disciples forth 
as witnesses 'to testify of him in all the world. 

When men deny the resurrection of Christ and the coming 
forth from their graves of all mankind, it is a confession on their 
part that they are ignorant of the work of the Lord regarding the 
destiny of man. Our existence in mortality is most important. 
It is not accidental. It was never intended that we should pass 
through this life without coming in contact with sin, without 
temptation, without mortality. Adam was sent into the world to 
perform a mission including the bringing to pass these very things 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 43

i 

that we in the mortal state might obtain experiences by coming 
in contact with all the vicissitudes of mortal life. In this way we 
receive an education that could not be obtained in any other way. 
So mortality came through the will of God, and through the fall of 
man death has passed upon all men. Through the atonement of 
Jesus Christ life is restored again and death is overcome and 
destroyed. Immortality and eternal life constitute the great work 
of the Father and the last enemy to be destroyed, we are informed, 
is death. When Christ has destroyed death by bringing to pass 
the resurrection of all mankind from the grave, he will have fin- 
ished his work and then he will deliver up the kingdom to his 
Father. 

man's resurrection assured 

These bodies which we have received are not to be laid away 
in the grave never to be taken up again. Those who believe such a 
doctrine have no understanding of the work of salvation. These 
bodies were given us that the spirit might dwell in them, and after 
passing through this mortal life, and death, they will be brought 
forth in the resurrection, spirit and body inseparably united — 
"Never to be divided" — and in this condition the righteous shall 
receive a fulness of joy. Those who have not been righteous and 
have failed to heed the counsels of God shall then receive such 
rewards as they are entitled to receive according to their works, 
but even they shall die no more the temporal death. 

The great work of the Lord is to bless all men and to do by 
them the very best that he can; but our Father in heaven is 
governed by law, as his children are subject to law, and he, there- 
fore, will measure out to each man that which he is entitled to 
receive according to his works. 

Without these bodies a spirit could not be made perfect, for it 
is incomplete. The body without the spirit is dead. It takes both 
the spirit and the body to constitute a perfect soul. We came here 
to this earth to obtain the greatest boon that could be given, 
physical bodies to clothe our spirits. The punishment of Satan and 
his angels is that they were denied the privilege of mortal existence 
in bodies of flesh and bones because of their rebellion. The spirit 
of man, clothed in a tabernacle of flesh and bones, as Jesus Christ 
was after his resurrection, will have power through obedience to 
the laws of the gospel to advance in righteousness, truth, wisdom 
and power, to the fulness, and thus become a son of God. 

So, we see, our lives here in the flesh, where we endure all the 
ills and the joys of mortality is not accidental, but a part of the 
great plan of eternal progression according to the decrees of our 
Father in heaven before this world came into being. Here we are 
proving ourselves through our free agency for a place in eternity. 
If we are faithful and live in keeping with the laws that govern in 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the kingdom of God, accepting the mission of our Lord, Jesus 
Christ, the Redeemer of all mankind from the grave, and, on 
condition of our repentance, our Redeemer from our individual sins, 
we shall be counted worthy of a place in the Celestial Kingdom of 
God. 

May we as Latter-day Saints be faithful in the discharge of 
all obligations, commandments and principles that pertain to our 
salvation, that we may obtain these great blessings which are 
promised by the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, and 
which cannot be received only through obedience, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have received somewhat more than seventy telephone calls since 
the meeting started, announcing that people are listening in at various 
places. I received one from a .nephew-in-law of mine, Edward W. 
Spencer, of Evanston, in which he said : "I got every word of your 
opening address over the radio." 

I remember being ridiculed because I believed in the Book of 
Mormon, because an alleged absolute impossibility was recorded in that 
book, namely that the Savior's words were heard all over the land. I 
remember saying to the professor (I was a young, unmarried man at 
the time), that I believed in a God who could arrange, if he saw fit 
to do so, that the words of Jesus Christ could be heard all over the 
world. I remember reading recently of a man who heard a song nine 
thousand miles over the radio. He was in a house with the doors closed, 
and the song was sung in a house or station with the doors closed, 
nine thousand miles away. Thank the Lord for faith as a boy, in the 
truths that are being demonstrated, which were miracles beyond all 
belief in early days ! Thank the Lord for the testimony of Joseph Smith 
and Sidney Rigdon: 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is 
the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and, through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 



Following the announcement of the general Priesthood meeting 
to be held in the Tabernacle on Monday evening at 7 o'clock ; the 
Sunday School Union conference meeting to be held at 7 o'clock on 
Sunday evening ; and the special Priesthood meeting to be held Wednes- 
day morning, April 7, the choir sang the "Hallelujah Chorus." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Charles E. Rowan, Jr., president of 
the Garfield stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until Monday morning, at 10 o'clock, 
April 5. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 45 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, April 4, 1926. 

Elder J. Golden Kimball, of the First Council of Seventy, 
presided. 

The combined choirs of Murray First ward and Mill Creek ward, 
of the Cottonwood stake, W. F. Robinson directing, Tracy Y. Cannon 
at the organ, provided the music. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Come, dearest Lord, descend and 
dwell." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Nicholas G. Smith, 
bishop of the Seventeenth ward, Salt Lake City. 

The choir sang, "In our Redeemer's name." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

As I approached the door of the Tabernacle this morning, though 
I had ample time if I could have gotten in, I was caught in a jam and 
I could not get one way or the other; and finally I heard my name 
announced by President Grant. I was to take charge of the meeting 
in the Assembly Hall. I did not take time to find out who was ap- 
pointed with me ; my difficulty was to get out. You know, sometimes 
you cannot get in and other times you cannot get out; that was my 
case his morning. So I rushed over here, but was somewhat disturbed, 
as it is a little unusual for me to preside over any of our general con- 
ference assemblies. Brethren and sisters, I do not know much, but 
what I do know, I know well ; I am a well-trained soldier ; I have 
been laboring in the Church under the direction of the general author- 
ities for over 35 years; I have seen a whole council of the Twelve fill 
their missions and pass over, and still live, and I know from my 
missionary experience in the world and at home, that we are the 
servants of the living God ; that we hold divine authority ; that every 
member in this Church, from the least unto the greatest, is entitled 
to revelation and inspiration and the spirit of prophecy for his own guid- 
ance. If it is otherwise, the only answer we have is that since the 
Holy Ghost was conferred upon you by the laying on of hands, you have 
not had faith and kept the commandments of God. That is the 
inspiration that gives life to this Church, and as long as the members 
of this Church, together with the general authorities, are under the 
inspiration of Almighty God, there is no use of being non-plussed or 
overcome, for God will put it into our mouths what to do, what to say, 
and will guide and lead us into all truth. I thought I would like 
to say that to you good people. Several of the brethren named by 
President Heber J. Grant to speak at this meeting have failed to receive 
word of their appointment. Up until now only three of us have 
arrived. But we are here, and we are dependent upon the Lord to guide 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and direct us. I would like to ask you good people if you are in the 
habit, in our assemblies and places of worship, of offering a few words 
of prayer in your heart for those who are to speak to us? Very few 
know just who is going to be appointed; and I am a believer that our 
people are very careless about those things and place the whole responsi- 
bility upon the speaker. My experience has been that there is a great 
responsibility resting upon the Saints, and that we need to call in the 
wanderings of our minds and centralize them upon God the Father 
and upon his Son Jesus Christ, in behalf of God's servants — not only 
to pray for them, but to ask God to give them inspiration, so that they 
will open their mouths and use the talent which the Lord God "has 
given every one of us, I am getting somewhat timid myself, because 
once in a while I make a mistake. But if God ever created a man, 
aside from the Savior, who has not made any mistakes, I would like 
to have him pointed out. We make mistakes, hence, when we speak 
in the name of the Lord and when we prophesy, we need the Spirit 
of God. 

I saw an old gentleman yesterday whom I met way down in 
Arizona, years and years ago, when our people were in poverty and were 
about to disorganize the stake, because everything had gone to pieces 
for the time being ; and he said, "Brother Kimball, I want to call your 
attention to something that happened years ago. You were in the 
little one-horse town, as I called it then, with the presidency of the 
stake, and you were there alone representing the brethren of the 
Church." The presidency of the stake presented the name of a man 
to be bishop of that ward. I said to them, "That bishop will not remain 
long." "Well," they said, "Brother Kimball, whom would you choose?" 
"Well, if I were choosing, I would choose that fellow over there 
sitting on the end of the seat ; he will make you a good bishop." 
But they put the first man in, and he did not hold out two years, and 
afterwards they put in the other man, whom I suggested, and he is one 
of the best bishops they have had. I merely speak of this to impress 
you that God can inspire his servants, and they can prophesy and it 
will come true. 

Now, brethren, pray in your hearts ; you need not make any to-do 
about it, but ask the Lord to inspire his servants to say things that will 
answer the questions and doubts that are creeping into the hearts of 
God's people ; for doubt and uncertainty is creeping into the hearts of a 
number of our people. I want to say to you, in the name of Israel's 
God, that if we do not live the right life and keep that light burning in 
our hearts as a living fire, so that you may know always that Jesus 
is the Christ, we may lose that knowledge on the morrow or during 
the year — if we are careless and indifferent. My father said before he 
died, and kept saying, "O the test, the test, the test ; who will be able 
to stand?" He came, to his home on the Kimball block at the south 
door, where my mother lived, and where I was born, and said, "O the 
test, the test, the test; who will be able to stand?" It was but a very 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 47 

short time after repeating this statement that he was stricken with 
paralysis and never spoke a word afterward. My mother said, "Brother 
Kimball what is the test?" and he said, "I don'* know, but only those 
who know that Jesus is the Christ will be able stand." 

Now, brethren, you can judge yourselves. L>o not bother about me. 
Be concerned about yourselves, and I will get along the best way I 
can. If I do not make it, there is no reason why you should not; 
and if I can make it, anybody can make it. That is my personal idea. 
I do not know whether that is an encouragement to you or not. 

ELDER JAMES H. ROBINSON 

President of the South Davis Stake 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, and very much de- 
pendent upon our heavenly Father. This is the first time in my life 
that I have been called upon to address the people of God in one of 
our general conferences, and I can assure you that, while I feel very 
grateful for this opportunity, I feel very humble and very dependent 
upon our heavenly Father. I realize most fully that we are engaged 
in the work of our Father, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, 
and the Father of our spirits ; and I know, too, that to speak to 
his people, who have listened to the servants of the Lord and obeyed 
the promptings of the spirit, who have embraced the faith and are 
endeavoring to carry out the work of our Father upon the earth — to 
feed you people — a man must be inspired of our Father. This is his 
work, and we know and understand the things of God only through 
the Spirit of our Father. It is not the elegant words spoken by 
masters of the English language, or the learning of men that can 
send that prompting and that inspiration and conviction to the hearts 
of God's people. It can only be sent there through the inspiration of 
our Father. And while I know, too, that we as individuals are not 
permitted to have inspiration or revelation for the Church, I know by 
experience that we are entitled to that revelation and that inspiration 
for our own guidance, and to help us in the discharge of all the duties 
and responsibilities that rest upon us. And if we are not in communion 
with that spirit, it is because our receiving instrument is out of tune; for 
our Father in heaven will never neglect his people, will never fail to 
do his part; and if I am not receiving the inspiration of the Father, it 
is because of some act in my life or some neglect, or something, that 
has gotten the instrument God has given to me in his Spirit out of 
tune with the sending instrument of our Father. Our Father has told 
us, through the Prophet Brigham Young, that every spirit is born 
pure into the earth, and it becomes contaminated only as the spirit 
is subject to the tabernacle of flesh in which it is encased; for our 
tabernacles are earthy, and made up of the earth and are subject to death. 
And just as our spirits are overcome by the weaknesses of that body, 
are we out of harmony with our Father. 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I know that this work is true ; I know that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith was indeed a prophet of God ; and I know that the Savior is 
the Son of God; and that this work has been established in the 
earth in these last days never again to be thrown down or 
given to another people. And I realize, too, that simply 
to be a member of this Church does not mean exaltation; for just as 
surely as the Lord has given us our free agency, just so surely 
must we exercise that agency in the right direction. Joining this 
Church and doing nothing in it will not bring us salvation or 
exaltation ; for the Lord has given us the plan, and he has given us 
the knowledge that he lives and that this is his work, and then 
he has left us to work out our own salvation. And we have a 
mighty responsibility resting upon us as Latter-day Saints ; for 
we not only have to live the gospel at home, but it is our mission 
to take it to every nation of the earth. And when we consider the 
few Latter-day Saints that there are, compared with the numerous 
hosts of the whole world, we can understand to a small degree the 
responsibility that this is. Wben the beloved John was cast upon 
the isle of Patmos and he was permitted to look down through the 
stream of time ; when he saw that angel flying through the midst of 
heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to all the inhab- 
itants of the earth, he saw our day, and we are living in fulfilment 
of that revelation that was given to John the divine, for that angel 
has flown from the midst of heaven, and has delivered this message 
to the inhabitants of this earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
We are carrying out that vision and that prediction that was made 
by our beloved prophet when he saw these things. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that we may be able to live 
up to all of the duties, obligations and responsibilities that rest upon 
us. We sometimes speak of its being our duty to do the things 
in this Church that we are called upon to do, but I take it that 
it is more of a privilege. We ought to assume it as one of the 
highest privileges in our lives that we are permitted to hold the 
Priesthood of the Son of God, that we are permitted to act 
in the name of our Father in heaven and to be his ambassadors 
upon the earth to carry out his work. This is a privilege of which 
we ought to be proud and glad to receive and glad to carry out in 
our lives. I pray that we may be loyal and devoted to this cause, 
spending our energies and efforts and all that we have and are in 
helping to establish God's work in the earth, I pray, in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK 

President of the Wasatch Stake 

My brethren and sisters: I certainly desire an interest in your 
faith and prayers, that the Spirit of the Lord may be with me 



ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK 49 

during the few minutes that I may stand before you. Of myself, 
I have always felt a great timidity in speaking on the things per- 
taining to the kingdom of heaven in the presence of my brethren 
and sisters, feeling my natural weakness. It is not because I 
dislike to meet with them and listen to the remarks of my brethren 
and sisters, but rather it is a timid feeling about attempting to 
address them. It is easier for me to listen to good things than 
it is to say them. But I have a testimony of the truth just the 
same. I had a little witness of that this morning. In our meeting 
of Religion Class officers, in one of the buildings near the Bishops' 
Building, I was very much pleased with the remarks of a young 
lady, who told us of her experience in training the boys, impressing 
upon us the necessity of doing individual work with the boys 
and girls and not with the people as a whole so much. I have 
felt that the same thing may apply to our older brethren, to our 
men and women, who necessarily, it seems, have to be encouraged 
individually ; and the great truths and principles of the gospel 
which we have embraced give us an opportunity from time to time 
to explain, expound, encourage, and build up one another in the 
great work in which we are engaged. 

She gave some very nice illustrations of her work, which time 
will not permit me to repeat further than to impress upon you, or 
those of you who were not present at that meeting in the Barrett 
Hall, that there is such a work going on in this Church as 
Religion Class work. I do not know how many of you have ever 
attended the Religion Class in the respective communities from 
which you have come, or how many of you encourage your boys 
and girls to attend, that they may get the spirit of this work early 
in life. I want to encourage you, if there are any who do not, 
that you take this up. It may seem to some to be the. least im- 
portant work, but I want to tell you that it is not least in the 
Wasatch stake of Zion. More than 90% of our boys and girls 
who attend the district schools are attending Religion Class; and 
in .our seminary work, nearly that percentage of those in the high 
school attend our seminary and are instructed. And of that 
group, practically all of our missionaries from the Wasatch stake, 
numbering between twenty and thirty of the long-time missionaries, 
nearly 90%, are young men and young women who were in the 
seminary and were taught in the Religion Class. In the Religion 
Class the foundation was laid; they received their faith in the 
principles of the gospel, and such information as they should re- 
ceive at the age when they attend. I do not know of any other 
work that has been of greater result and benefit in the A¥asatch 
stake than the Religion Class work and the seminaries. I want to 
endorse most heartily the Religion Classes and to encourage the 
brethren and sisters in the respective communities to uphold the 
teachers, to recognize their work. It would not be amiss to say a 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

kindly word to those who are teaching your Religion Class in your 
respective wards and ask them how your boys and girls are getting 
along, whether they are truant or whether they are remaining for 
Religion Class. 

It was told to us today that some parents thought their children 
were attending Religion Class, and when they received the report, 
they found they were not there half the time. Whose boys and 
girls are they, and what are they worth to us? Without our boys 
and girls, it would seem to me that we have accomplished prac- 
tically nothing in the world. If we have permitted them to slip 
away from us and lose faith in the gospel and in Jesus Christ, in 
this great latter-day work, I would like to know what we have ac- 
complished ! We have made a living; may have accumulated wealth, 
which we do not take with us; but those of our loved ones are of 
the treasures of this earth which, if they are saved in the kingdom 
of heaven, thieves will not steal from us, moth and rust will not 
corrupt. They are the most important of all the treasures and of 
all the work that we may accomplish in this life. So I want to 
endorse with my full heart and support the work of Religion Class 
and seminary. It is no fifth wheel. It came in the due time of 
the Lord, when we needed that kind of instruction, and it should 
be carried out, and no doubt is in other stakes, if I got the spirit 
of that meeting this morning. 

Another speaker, Brother Bennion, said he was reminded of a 
question that one of our noted authors, Elbert Hubbard, had pro- 
posed and answered. He asked, "Is a lady as good as a man?" and 
he answered, "She is, if she is." Our ladies are just as good as our 
men, if they do just as well in accomplishing the work to which 
they are assigned; and they have a most splendid opportunity in 
Religion Class work, because we have so many sisters who are 
school teachers. I am pleased to report that the school teachers 
in the Wasatch stake are not adverse to teaching Religion Class. 

Attending the meetings on this occasion reminds me very much 
of a meeting I attended, about fifty or sixty years ago as a boy 
upon this block. In a recent issue of the Improvement Era I read an 
article in which reference was made to the conversion, if you please, 
or the second conversion or bringing to these valleys, of Martin 
Harris, a witness to the Book of Mormon ; how one of our elders 
found him in the world and brought encouraging words to him of 
the gospel and asked him why he left the Church. He said he 
did not leave the Church, but the Church left him, and I guess that 
was true. He remained in that country for a great many years, and 
finally through the encouraging words that were carried to him, he 
came to Zion. The thought occurs to me : How many are there 
of our brethren and sisters who are slack in their duties, probably 
negligent, doing nothing in the Church, as he had been doing for 
so many years, only bearing his testimony as one of the witnesses 



ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK 51 

to the Book of Mormon? Are there any other men of his age who 
need an encouraging word? Are there any of us who are willing to 
give it? Are we interested in their salvation? Next to our own 
immediate families, I do not know of anybody we are going to 
encounter in the next world who will bring to us the joy and 
satisfaction that our friends will bring, and especially those who 
have given us encouraging words in this life and who have helped 
us to set aside the cares of this world and turn our attention unto 
the things of heaven. I was particularly impressed with his 
testimony which I read in the Era, because it was my great 
pleasure, as a boy about ten years of age, to sit and listen to the 
testimony of Martin Harris, that an angel of the Lord showed him 
the records from which the Book of Mormon was translated and 
declared to him that they were true and were translated by the 
gift and power of God. It was a great encouragment to me at the 
time I heard it. It has been a great encouragement to me from the 
time I heard it up to the present time that this man, Martin Harris, 
was alive and testified in my presence on these grounds. I cannot 
remember which building it was in. But he testified that the 
angel of the Lord appeared to him. 

Did' the angel of the Lord appear to him? Undoubtedly he 
did. It was his testimony, and the testimony of those of his 
associates, that the angel of the Lord appeared to them, which 
carries to me the most convincing evidence that Joseph Smith actu- 
ally saw the Father and the Son. If Martin Harris saw an angel 
of the Lord, and the angel testified to him that this book was 
translated by the power of God, then it is not unreasonable to 
suppose that Joseph Smith actually saw the Father and the Son. 
And how important that is in this day of skepticism, when even 
the Christian world is denying that God is a personal being and 
that Jesus Christ is his Son, that faith might not depart entirely 
from the earth, but that there might be those who still believe 
in the divinity of the mission of Jesus Christ and that he was 
divine ; that God truly created us in his image ; that we are his 
offspring, and that Jesus Christ is our elder brother ; and that as 
he is, we may become. 

To my mind it was a great encouragement to me as a boy, 
and I thank the Lord that I believed it, and that the Lord has 
given me a believing heart in the testimony of the brethren. I 
have never heard a brother speak from this stand, or any other 
in this Church, but my heart seemed to respond to the statements 
that he made and I believed them ; and it has not hurt me. It 
has strengthened my faith in God and made life tolerable and 
desirable even in times of trouble. It has strengthened my faith 
that this life is not all of the mission which our Father in heaven 
has set for us. If God lives and Jesus Christ is the Son of God, 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

he was truly resurrected, though the Christian world today do 
not generally accept it. 

I have listened to a most beautiful sermon — so far as words 
are concerned — in one of our picture shows here in Salt Lake. It 
was said that an able speaker was going to talk, and I attended 
to hear what he said. He told us nothing about the Father, be- 
cause he did not know anything about him, his personality, nor 
even the image in which he is. He could not believe the Bible, 
that God created man in his own image. He told us nothing about 
Jesus Christ nor his resurrection, because he did not believe it him- 
self, and he did not understand and did not know. But he made 
a most sympathetic appeal and a speech which brought tears to the 
eyes of many of those who were in the congregation, speaking 
of the great labors and work that had been accomplished in the 
great world war and of our great nation and its achievements. But 
he did not have the testimony that there ever was a resurrection, 
that Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead. The world, even 
the Christian world — not as a whole, possibly, but individually — 
has denied that great accomplishment or work of our Father in 
heaven upon which, to my notion, all our hopes and faith are 
centered. If there be no resurrection, what will there be for us 
when we pass from this earth? Some may claim that we will still 
have an existence in the spirit world. "We will go back where 
we were before we came here," may be their argument, "as spirits, 
and be able to dwell on the top of a topless throne, or in the clouds 
of heaven ; we will be retrogressive, going backwards instead of 
forward." But the Almighty intended that the spirit should be 
united with the body and assume the responsibilities of this life, 
which are many. We have all seen that we can take care of and 
accomplish the things in this life, learning of those things which we 
cannot learn so well in the eternal world, because the knowledge 
which we acquire in this world goes with us ; and the memory of 
our first estate is taken from us, that we may be absolutely free 
to act, relying upon our owri agency and doing what is in our 
hearts and what we desire to do. And if our hearts are inclined 
unto righteousness and we love the works of God more than we love 
evil, we will become righteous; and if we overcome evil with good 
and serve God and keep his commandments, it will be largely 
through our own efforts and desire and love of the truth. So 
without the resurrection, it would be retrogression, going back into 
the spirit world whence we came — which may possibly be the 
lot of some — but I trust it will not be the lot of the Latter-day 
Saints. I trust that we will go on, having received our bodies again, 
and become as the Savior was after his resurrection, when he said, 
"Handle me, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me 
have." He was handled, he was seen, after his resurrection, by 
many of his disciples, his apostles, and nearly five hundred on 



ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK 53 

another occasion, in this life; and then again upon this continent, 
with a body such as we expect to receive in the eternal world, and not 
as a spirit without a body. 

May the Lord enable us to understand and appreciate the 
great blessings that we enjoy, and be able to grasp the encouraging 
things which he gives ; the testimony of the prophets, of Joseph and 
Hyrum, and of those who have succeeded them in the presidency 
of the Church, in the visitation of those brethren and the testi- 
mony of the witnesses. And may faith grow in our hearts and a 
testimony of God and of his purposes; for it is impossible, says the 
prophet, for us to be saved in ignorance; we must grow and obtain 
understanding of the mind and of the purposes of the Lord and 
develop the mind which God has given us, which is the most 
wonderful part of the human soul. It is after the order of God, the 
eternal Father, and as no man can comprehend all that man can do 
or may do in their day, it appears to me that there are none of 
us who comprehend what we can do, how faithful we can be, how 
many testimonies of the gospel we may have and what may be our 
lot, even in this life, if we strive for it ; or what shall be the 
blessings which God has in store for his faithful sons and daughters 
in the eternal world. May God enable us to strive and to continue to 
do his will and keep his commandments all the days of our lives, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, the risen Redeemer and 
our Savior. Amen. 

ELDER NEWELL K. YOUNG 

Of the L. D. S. University Faculty 

I feel very keenly my unworthiness and lack of preparation. 
Pray with me that I may be blessed to respond to the call of the 
servants of the Lord to say something about the resurrection of the 
Christ. 

First, I ,would tell you of the witnesses of that resurrection, the 
people to whom the Master appeared on that Sunday morning nearly 
1900 years ago — for this is Easter Sunday, the anniversary of that 
great day. 

But may I say a word of preface, that I would rather speak of 
Jesus Christ and his life, his self-sacrifice, his love, his manliness, his 
divinity, and of his death and resurrection than of any other theme in 
all the world. His death was voluntary, he gave his life, laid it down of 
himself, declaring that plainly, as found in the tenth chapter of John, 
in the sermon of the Good Shepherd. He had the power and authority 
from the Father to lay his life down and take it up. No man took it 
from him. I believe that I can say without error that in the last 
fifteen years I have scarcely had a waking hour, day or night, that my 
mind and thought and my heart have not turned for at least a minute 
or two to him, and many days I spend hours and hours thinking of 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

him. In these fifteen years I have lain awake much at night with 
bodily pain, and my thought of him, my communion with him — not to 
him — his communion with me, and the touch of his presence and 
Spirit, have turned hundreds of nights of pain and restlessness into 
benedictions and blessings to be remembered forever with gratitude 
and joy. 

I should like first to speak of the facts or incidents connected 
with the resurrection, and then say something of its meaning and 
significance. 

The first to see Jesus resurrected was Mary Magdalene, with 
whom he spoke and to whom he revealed himself. In her joy, she 
hastened to embrace or take hold of him, and he said, "Touch me not ; 
for I am not yet ascended to my Father." 

The second appearance was to a number of women, and as he 
spoke to them, he told them to tell his brethren that they should go 
into Galilee, and there they should see him. That ought to be a com- 
fort to mothers and wives and women, that the first message of the 
risen Lord to his brethren was sent by these anxious, devoted, eager 
women, who were first to the tomb in memory and reverence of his 
pierced body. 

During that day he appeared to two of the disciples who were 
walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, and walked with them and con- 
versed with them without their beholding or understanding who he 
was. They were astonished when he asked them what it was they were 
talking about as he approached, what the thing was that was in their 
hearts ; and they asked if he was a stranger in Jerusalem. They 
thought no man could have been there these last days without knowing, 
and told him of his own crucifixion and of his own burial in the tomb, 
and that certain women had been there with two of the brethren, who 
were Peter and John, and found the tomb empty. And then they 
said, "But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed 
Israel." 

That same day he appeared to ten of the apostles in an upper 
room, talked to them, ministered to them, let them see the nail prints 
in his hands and feet. Thomas was not with them ; he was away. 
Judas, of course, had gone. 

A week from that day he appeared to the eleven, including Thomas. 
In the mean time, Thomas had said, that he did not believe it. 
Thomas thought it was an illusion. Thomas thought their senses had 
deceived them. Thomas was a man who had to have, it seemed, the 
tangible evidence of the senses, and he said, "I shall not believe, except 
I see with my eyes and feel with my hands." When Jesus appeared, 
he said to Thomas, "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; 
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not 
faithless, but believing." And Thomas came and did so and dropped 
on his knees and said, "My Lord and my God." Then Jesus said, 
"Thomas because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed ; blessed are they 



ELDER NEWELL K. YO'UNG 55 

that have not seen, and yet have believed." He does not say, "more 
blessed," though I think perhaps they are. 

I am grateful with all my heart that it has been easy and natural 
for me to believe, but I do not want to be unsympathetic with men for 
whom it is not so easy. I want to have the patience that Jesus had 
and the willingness to give them all the evidence there may be. 

After that he appeared to seven disciples, five, at least, of whom 
were apostles, these being Peter, James, and John, and Thomas and 
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, at the Sea of Galilee, and ate with them. 
He had fish roasting on a fire of coals. They were fishing. That 
is the occasion on which he asked Peter three times if he loved him, 
and Peter answered, yes. And I do rejoice in the last time, when 
he almost seemed to question Peter's answer, that Peter could look 
him — the risen Christ, the Son of God in the face — and say, "You 
know I love you." Blessed is the man who can face those eyes that 
can see the secrets of the heart and yet say he loves or he believes ! 
There were seven there. 

He visited Peter alone, the Apostle Paul tells us. No one knows 
what took place in that meeting. I believe we are warranted in 
believing that no meeting after his resurrection, peihaps, was more vital. 

We do know that his four brothers did not believe in him during 
his ministry, but he visited his brother James after the resurrection. 
That is also given to us by Paul. And James believed and later 
presided in the Church at Jerusalem, the Christian Church, Christ's 
Church, after his brother had departed, for many, many years, and 
is believed to be the author of the Epistle of James, a letter of advice 
and inspiration to the Hebrew Christians of that day. Here he wrote 
that piece of advice that sent our believing boy prophet into the woods 
to pray. This prayer opened the heavens for the Father and Son 
to come. 

At a later meeting he visited five hundred men in a mountain 
in Galilee, almost all of whom were living when the Apostle Paul 
bore his testimony. 

Some time after, he visited the eleven and some others, on the 
mountain, called Olivet, when he ascended in glory ; and the witnesses 
from heaven said that as he ascended, in like manner should he come 
again. 

At a later time, he visited Paul and called him to the ministry 
and started him out upon that great mission of his. 

Then we must record the visit to the Nephites, when he came 
day after day. There is only time to mention this. 

And then his visit to our own prophet, in our time, with his 
gracious, humbling, chastening ministry to us ; for I do not know how 
you men of Israel feel, but if there is one time when I do not want 
to speak in a loud voice, if there is one time when I am chastened and 
when I am sobered, and when I am humbled, it is when I center 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

my consciousness on the fact that we are commissioned through the 
Priesthood to stand before him and for him in the midst of men. That 
is no testimony to bear lightly ; that is no testimony to shout in thought- 
lessness ; it is a testimony full of awe, full of responsibility, and a 
testimony that should be borne in great reverence. 

There is not time to say the word or two I meant to say about 
the significance and meaning of the resurrection, except this, that 
for the last year of his mortal life, or nearly that, he was trying to get 
his apostles to understand that his mission was not to set up an earthly 
kingdom. He was not to be a Jewish Caesar and set up the Jews 
to rule the world as Rome had ruled it. They could not understand 
it. We have evidence and plenty of it. After his death, Peter said, 
"I go a fishing." And the others said, "We also go with you." The two 
on the way to Emmaus revealed it ; "We trusted that it had been he 
which should have redeemed Israel." When he was arrested, the 
brethren went to safety. He said, "Take me and let these go," and 
they went. They were in gloom ; they were despondent ; they had 
hoped it was the Christ; but to them the evidence that he was the 
Messiah was for him to establish a kingdom, with the Jews as kings. 
That is what they looked for ; that is what their fathers had looked 
for; that is why they were so fearful, so despondent. But when he 
rose, when he came back to the Sea of Galilee, where Peter had gone 
to his nets — not for a day's vacation, not for an hour; if it had been 
that, he would not have fished all night. He went back to become 
a "fisher of fish, because he was disappointed and thought, with his 
brethren on the way to Emmaus, that he was not what they had 
hoped he should be. When he arose, when he visited them, it was far 
more to them than the sign that one shall rise from the dead. They 
believed in the resurrection. It was far more to them than to know that 
their Master lived ; it gave them the testimony, borne witness to, 
and made secure, by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, that he 
was the very Christ, the Son of God. That was the great sig- 
nificance of it — not only that he lived but that he was what he had 
tried to get them to understand that he was; and borne testimony that 
he was. He was all they had hoped for, and a thousand times more, 
because he was Lord of life and King of kings, the Redeemer, the 
Savior, the Son of God, the Revelator of the Father. 

On this Easter morning I am glad to remember these things with 
you ; somehow I feel that every Easter morning, early, out of doors 
if I could, just as the sun rose, I should like to meet with a band 
of responsive men and women and spend an hour or two hours in 
memory of his rising. For that is what it means to us — not only that 
there is no death ; not only that the grave lost its victory and death has 
been robbed of its sting ; but also that he was and is the Christ, the Son 
of God, the Redeemer and the Savior, and that we are his brethren, 
children of our Father. I plead that in our wanting to know our 
Father we may approach him as Father. That is the only way to 



■ELDER NEWELL K. YOUNG 57 

know him. He is Father, and we are his children. I bear record here, 
in memory of my faithful mother, my father, my grandparents, my 
people — I bear record that I know that God lives and is our Father, 
caring for us, watching over us ; that it is his work and his glory to bring 
to pass our immortality and eternal life, and that Jesus is the Christ, 
and we are commissioned to represent him, in helping in that work and 
that glory. May God help us to be true, I ask, and I leave with you my 
love, and pray our Father's love and blessing upon you, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The combined choirs sang, "An angel from on high." 



ELDER ELIAS A. SMITH 

Of the High Council of Liberty Stake 

My brethren and sisters: If anyone ever needed the sustaining 
power of our heavenly Father, I do at the present moment. I have had 
no intimation whatsoever that I would be called upon to stand before 
you this morning and speak to you a few moments regarding those 
things which are dear to my heart and to your hearts. I thank my 
heavenly Father daily that I was born of parents who, in the early days 
of the Church, embraced the gospel and remained faithful and true to 
the end of their days. Brother Kimball says his father impressed 
upon his family the saying, "Are we able to stand the test?" Are we 
able to endure ? I think that is the vital question ^ith all of us. I take 
it for granted that everyone here has a testimony of the divinity of this 
work. We absolutely believe that the Prophet Joseph Smith, in answer 
to his prayer, was visited by the Father and by the Son, and that he 
^conversed with them face to face ; and that they made known unto 
him that he was to be the instrument in their hands in the re-establish- 
ment of the Church of Jesus Christ here upon earth. If there is any one 
of us who doubts that fact, he cannot in any manner believe in what is 
termed "Mormonism." That is the foundation stone of this Church, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith's declaration that the Father and the Son 
did appear unto him, and made known unto him just what they ex- 
pected him to do in the establishment of his Church here upon the earth. 
Neither you nor I can save any one except ourselves. It is our duty while 
we live upon earth to obtain and retain a testimony of the divinity 
of our heavenly Father, and unless we do have that testimony, we are 
always in danger of slipping and falling by the wayside. The gospel, 
as I understand it, is a gospel that we must live day by day — not 
Sunday nor Monday, but every day of the week — seeking and striving 
to the best of our abilities to store up knowledge and get information 
and better our lives, and to assist others to live in a way and manner 
that they may obtain a testimony and better their lives. None of us can 
be independent of the other; each one of us is dependent upon our 
brethren and sisters to live in a way and manner that is acceptable to our 



58' GENERAL CONFERENCE 

heavenly Father. The biggest task I have on earth is to live in a 
manner that is satisfactory to me, and if I can do that, I know that I 
can satisfy my brethren and my sisters. 

As Brother Kimball says, I am a member of the Liberty stake 
High Council. In that way I am endeavoring to do my duty. I believe 
it is incumbent upon all of us when we are asked to do a thing to do 
it to the best of our ability, whatever that task may be. A great many 
of us say that' it is a task ; possibly we should say, like Brother 
Robinson, that it is not only a task but a privilege to work in the 
Church in every way in which we are called. In doing that we get more 
out of it than any one else. We are the persons benefited, and receive 
added testimony to what we already have ; as I know whenever I 
am called upon to do a duty and do it to the best of my ability, I am 
benefited ; the Lord makes known to me his approval, if I have done 
it in a way that is acceptable to him. And I bear you my testimony, 
my brethren and sisters, that if we will perform our duties as members 
of this Church day by day, as the leaders of this Church expect us to 
do, living in a manner that those with whom we associate may say 
to one another, he is endeavoring to live his religion ; he is endeavoring 
to be an honest, virtuous, truthful man ; that we will get joy and 
satisfaction out of our labor. I pray my heavenly Father that he will 
bless me, that I may be able to live in that way and manner ; and that 
he will bless you, and that each and every one of us may obtain 
a testimony of our Savior ; that we may have,that testimony burning in 
our hearts ; that we may be Latter-day Saints wherever we go, uphold- 
ing and sustaining those who are called to preside over us and endeavor- 
ing to do, to the best of our ability, what the Lord would have us 
do. May this be our lot, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

It may be considered unfortunate that some of our brethren who 
were appointed by President Grant failed to learn of their appointment 
and have not put in an appearance. Only three of us, as we are in- 
formed, have arrived — President Robinson, President Murdock, and 
myself. We appreciate the fact that we hold the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood, and believe that whenever we are appointed by those having 
authority, we are fully qualified to perform every duty and responsi- 
bility to which we have been appointed. I have had some experience, 
along with my brethren in the Church, and while I may not have 
accomplished everything that I was appointed to do to the very best 
advantage, I desire to say to you that I have never been appointed 
to do a single thing in this Church but that, when I got the spirit of 
my appointment, I was qualified and fitted to assume that responsibility. 

When I was an elder in the missionary field and was sent out 
in the woods — for that is about where we went in the years 1883-4 ; we 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 59 

did not go in cities, they were not a safe place to go ; we went to the 
woods, among the poor people, and preached the gospel, and we were 
sent forth without purse and without scrip — all it cost me to fill a 
mission was to get to my field of labor. I paid for that myself, and it 
was up to me to get back home as best I could. That is about all the 
money I had, with enough to buy a few clothes, and I remember they 
were rather poor. At one time I was up in the Blue Ridge mountains 
of Virginia, in the winter, with a straw hat and a duster on. It was 
not very suitable ; it was not very warm. We could not wear overcoats ; 
could not carry them in that country. All we carried was an umbrella. 
We never were at a loss to know what to do, my companion and I, when 
we had the spirit of our calling. We heard that voice — not very often, 
not as often as we should have done, but we heard it — behind us saying, 
"This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right and when 
ye turn to the left." I stand before you as a witness for God that he 
never forsook us. I walked — and I am a very poor walker; I am not 
built for it — hundreds and hundreds of miles, and I never lay out- 
doors but twice, though I want to confess to you I hustled. There is 
nothing I dreaded worse than lying outside on the ground. I prayed, 
and my companion prayed, and then we got up and moved on. I guess 
we would have starved to death if we had kept praying and had not 
hustled ; the Lord doesn't help people who do not hustle and move, after 
they pray, and do their duty. 

Brethren, I want to read to you. I do not read very often except 
to myself. When I find a good idea — which is not very often, for 
very few of us do — I write it down. When you get an idea, write it 
down. That is what the Prophet Joseph tried to teach this people. 
When the Lord gives you a sudden idea, write it down, and then watch 
it ; and if it comes from God, through his Spirit, it is inspiration ; and 
when it comes true, that is revelation. Try to remember that. I am not 
going to read anything to you that has come to me, but I am going 
to read to you something that I have tried to make work — though I am 
not making very great progress. I have written it down partly because 
I have a poor memory, like my father. The Prophet Joseph Smith told 
father, when he tried to teach him grammar, "Heber, if you don't repeat 
that, I'll whip you." Father said, "Well, brother Joseph, you will 
have to whip me ; I can't repeat it." Joseph said, "I would just as 
leave whip a child as you." The quotations I am about to read are 
such that I might repeat them a million times, or a multimillion times and 
never live up to them, and I am afraid some of us Latter-day Saints read 
a good deal, but do not think and put it into our every day life: 

"He that seeketh the Lord early shall find him, and shall not be 
forsaken." 

No wonder we are trying to teach our children. Some of us did 
not seek the Lord until we became old. It is a mighty good thing to 
begin early. 

"The Lord 'is my shepherd." Do you believe that? "The Lord 



60 • GENERAL CONFERENCE 

is my shepherd; I shall not want." Then why worry your head off for 
fear you will go to the poor house? But that is where some of you 
will go if you don't wake up. Because the Lord "tempers the wind 
to the shorn lamb." Haven't I just testified of that? In all my wander- 
ings in the south, God led me to the doors of the honest in heart, and 
they fed me and gave me a place to lay my head. And that is what 
I am telling our elders, these young boys going on missions. I am 
trying, when I set them apart, to impress them that the Lord is their 
shepherd and they shall not want. One good mother stated that her 
son wrote her and said, "I have only $3, and if you do not send me 
some money I will be licking the paste off the signboards." And the 
mother came to me somewhat disturbed and said : "Brother Kimball, 
what shall I do?" I said, "Let him lick paste for a while; he will 
find the Lord, but he never will with his pocket full of money." I 
have repeatedly told the "Mormon" elders that they never found God 
yet with their pockets full of money. I do not say that you do not have 
to have the money, but you do not worry much when you know where 
you are going to sleep and where you are going to eat. I know mighty 
well that I would not worry the Lord if I had a $5 dollar bill in 
my pocket ; I would go and get something to eat and have the agony 
over. I do not think the Lord respects a "Mormon" elder who will 
howl and whine around where he has money in his pocket and is hungry 
If he does, he ought to starve; that is my doctrine. 

"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden." God 
knows that we have thousands in this Church who have labored and are 
weary. And there are thousands of people in this Church, mothers and 
old men, the best people God ever created, who never had a banquet or 
a chicken -dinner in their lives unless they cooked it themselves. No 
wonder they get weary — they are made to feel they are no longer 
wanted. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I 
will give you rest." And that is the only place you can get real rest. 

"Cast your care upon him, for he careth for you." Can you be- 
lieve that? That is what I am trying to believe — but I want to tell 
you I am having a hard time to believe what I read, and put it into 
practice. As I tell our missionaries, do not let doubt and fear creep 
into your hearts, for God never planted in one of his children a spirit of 
fear ; it does not come from God ; for when you have faith in God, yon 
have no fear, you have no doubt ; you know. But you will have trials 
and be tested ; "you will eat the bread of adversity and drink the water 
of affliction." That is the only thing that will keep you humble. You 
have to knock some "Mormons" down every little while to keep them 
in the Church. It is too bad, but we as Latter-day Saints cannot be 
prospered without some of us getting arrogant and proud and forget- 
ting God. 

"I will strengthen thee," (I have quoted that over a thousand times) 
"yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of 
righteousness." Do you believe that? 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 61 

"Take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall 
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof." I have heard hundreds and hundreds of elders say, that 
applied to the twelve apostles in the days of Jesus Christ and did not 
apply to a "Mormon" elder, out preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ ! 
Think not of the morrow! I remember a story of two elders wander- 
ing in the South without purse or scrip, and they came to a corn crib, 
and one of the elders said, "We will sleep there tonight," and he 
called that faith ! It was, but it was a poor faith. Those boys 
wandered around and around and got lost, and traveled in a circle ; 
and when darkness set in there was the corn crib, and the elder said, 
"There, I told you we would sleep in the corn crib." The Lord fulfilled 
his word, and it served him right. It is where he expected to sleep. 
"As your faith is, so shall it be unto you." 

"As thy faith is" — I have it here, by the way — "so shall it be 
unto you." 

"I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." "There shall no evil 
happen to the just." You have read those things a thousand times, and 
so have I ; and then we never think of them. We are a good deal like 
Coue. Have you ever read Coue's book ? When I was sick, I read it 
from lid to lid, and I went trotting around, saying : "Every day, in 
every way, I am getting better and better." Every morning when I 
got up I was worse and worse. What good did it do me? I did not 
believe it. But thousands of people, according to the story, have gotten 
over physical ailments — they call it mental — by repeating, "Every day 
and in every way, I am getting better and better." It did not do me 
a bit of good, because I did not make it work. And they say it only 
cures mental trouble. My experience is, my brethren and sisters, that 
a large per cent of our troubles are imaginary and not real. We get 
an imaginary trouble, and we cling to it like death, and won't let loose. 
So it is with scripture; of what use is it to continue to repeat these 
things if you do not believe them? 

Here is another. "The God that I worship says unto me, T am 
with you always — ' " I can find that in my blessing given to me 
by Elder Moses Thatcher. "Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye 
shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you." 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, when but a boy, read this : "If any 
man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, 
and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, 
nothing wavering." Surely God reads our hearts; you cannot deceive 
God. You can deceive a bishop, sometimes, not all the time; you 
can deceive a president of a stake, not all the time; you may deceive 
the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, not all the time ; but you cannot 
deceive God any of the time. And don't ever try it. His ways are not as 
man's ways ; he is greater than sects or creeds or isms or fancies or the 
notions and caprices of men. 

Brethren and sisters, the time is up. I have only gotten started. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Why don't you read these things and write them down, like our fathers 
and mothers did of old, and think about them, and make them work? 
And when you are sick, have faith and be healed. Christ never 
diagnosed a case in his life; Christ never asked a woman what was the 
matter; he never asked her what kind of a disease she had. I know 
as I know I live and breathe, although I may never feel its power, 
that when sick, authority has been vested in me, as I have seen people 
healed, not many, it is true, but some were healed as soon as I took 
my hands off their heads. Yet doctors have said that those diseases 
were incurable, but they have been healed nevertheless. They tell me 
that epileptic fits are incurable. I cannot cite you to many cases, but 
I can point you out a poor widow, who lived in the sagebrush, in Idaho, 
that came to me after a conference. The bishop of the ward, and I 
administered to that good old woman, and she never had a fit after. 
I can cite you to a poor old widow in the north country who had a 
cancer. She had fasted for three days, and came to the same con- 
ference, and something said to her, "That is the man." I do not think 
I amount to much, but we administered to that poor old widow, and 
God healed her. I have had splendid success with widows ; especially, 
when they were in poverty ! But I have never had any success with 
rich people. I do not know why. May be it is because they have 
little faith. 

May the Lord bless you. Think of God. How many of us think 
of God thirty minutes out of twenty- four hours? There is not one out 
of five hundred that actually thinks of God and his Son Jesus Christ 
thirty minutes a day. I do ; but the first thing I know, my mind 
wanders off on something else. My brethren and sisters, God bless you 
and be with us and help this people, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choirs sang the anthem, "O grave, where is thy victory?" 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder John W. Walker, of the 

High Council of the Ensign stake ; and the meeting was adjourned 

until 2 o'clock p. m. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting of the conference was held in the 
Assembly Hall at 2 o'clock p. m., Sunday, April 4, 1926. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

Singing was furnished by the coihbined choirs of Murray First 
ward and Mill Creek ward, of Cottonwood stake; W. F. Robinson, 
director ; Frank W. Asper at the organ. 

The combined choirs sang "Author of faith." 

Prayer was offered by Elder William J. Robinson. 

The choir sang "Grant us peace, O Lord," Ada McDonald and 
Manasseh Smith singing the duet parts. 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 63 

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the North Weber Stake 

In attending conference this morning, in the Tabernacle, 
viewing the large congregation gathered there, and knowing that 
they came from almost every nation under the sun, I could but 
reflect upon the words of our Savior in the promise given early in 
the history of the Church to the Prophet Joseph, wherein he said, 
"Behold a marvelous work is about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men." I could but feel what a wondrous thing it was 'to see 
that Tabernacle filled with people from almost all nations of the 
earth and to know that they had heard the call of the Master; that 
they were of the honest in heart who had listened unto that call, 
who had forsaken that which was near and dear unto them in 
other lands — kindred, friends, wealth in many cases — and sacrificed 
for that which they believed to be true, and in various ways gathered 
unto the land of Zion, where they have reared their families under 
hardship, toil and struggle and sacrifice, and are watching the work 
of the Lord grow and prosper. I, myself, was born in far-off 
Stockholm, Sweden ; taught a foreign tongue ; trained then in what 
is now to me a foreign religion; trained in. other customs than 
we have here. And the Lord, in fulfilment of the promise that he 
would bring about a marvelous work, called upon those who had 
already accepted the gospel to visit those lands; preach the gos- 
pel there, and bring the message of joy and gladness unto other 
hearts ; and it fell to our lot to meet with those missionaries ; to 
hear their story and testimony, and have our own hearts touched 
with that testimony; recognize its truth and have courage and 
faith enough to accept it and to come to these lands, unto these 
valleys. It is 52 years ago last month since I had the privilege of 
being initiated into the Church and Kingdom of God by baptism. 
In the experiences that have come to me since, the privilege of re- 
ceiving the Priesthood, of using that Priesthood in various ca- 
pacities, I have gained an understanding to some extent of what the 
Lord meant when he said that he would bring about a marvelous 
work in the earth. To think that this body of people we saw this 
morning, and that are there now gathered; those who are here; 
those who are out in the grounds listening; to think that they have 
a knowledge and a testimony for themselves that this is the 
work of the Lord — with no doubt whatever — a testimony from God 
that this work is divine; that all our ideas of the future can be 
resolved into the mere admonition, "live the laws of God that he 
has given unto you and all those mysteries will be solved.'' Give 
it time; serve the Lord, and we will know all that we desire to 
know; we will reach to all that our aspirations have sought for, 
and we will have eternal life in the Kingdom of God. 

To me the having within our hearts of that testimony that 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

God lives; that Jesus is the Christ, his Son, our Redeemer; to 
know that we are his children; to be acquainted with our re- 
lationship with him, the purpose of our being here, where we came 
from, where we are going, and what lies before us in the way 
of possibility for advancement, growth, and eternal progress — 
to have a testimony of that kind — is the most glorious gift that 
our Father could give unto us; and once received, brethren and 
sisters, we ought to guard that testimony as the most sacred gift 
in his power to give unto us. 

Can we lose that testimony? Yes. We may have the Spirit 
of the Lord bearing testimony to our souls that this is the truth ; 
but if we will not live the laws by which that testimony can be 
retained, it will fade and grow weaker. We have experiences be- 
fore us of those who have stood up and borne testimony to the 
goodness of God, to the divinity of this work, having a knowl- 
edge of it for themselves and how they received it, and who have 
gradually drifted away until it is only a mere memory that they 
did such a thing; the knowledge has passed away. And why? 
Because they have not treasured it. They have not kept it bright 
and fresh in their minds. 'They have not served the Lord. They 
have not given of their talents that God has given unto them ; of 
their time and of their means and their thought and their strength. 
They have not given of it enough to retain a continuation of that 
testimony. In this very revelation, where the Lord said that he 
was to bring forth a marvelous work and a wonder, he added this: 
"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye 
serve him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength that ye 
may stand blameless before God at the last day. Therefore, if ye 
have desires to serve God, ye are called to the work; for behold 
the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in 
his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perish- 
eth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul ; and faith, hope, 
charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him 
for the work. Remember faith," virtue, knowledge, temperance, 
patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 
Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
Amen." 

Those are the promises of our Father. To me the very thought 
of losing this wonderful individual testimony that God has given 
me — I dare not think of it ! To have doubt come into my soul, 
where there is no assurance and knowledge and certainty, would 
unsettle all that I have so far been able to do in my life ; and it 
would be the same to you, my brethren and sisters, if you per- 
mitted that to be done. Many of us neglect the opportunities of- 
fered unto us. We do not develop them. We receive the Priest- 
hood and we do not magnify it; we do not honor and revere it and 
recognize that it is the power from God to act in his stead, that he 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 65 

has selected those to whom he has given the Priesthood to be his 
helpers in accomplishing the great work that he has before him. 
He says, "My work and my glory is to bring to pass the im- 
mortality and eternal life of man," and he calls upon his children 
who have heard his voice, who have accepted it and yielded 
obedience to his commandments ; he endows them with the Priest- 
hood and power to be helpers and assistants unto him to accom- 
plish that — he tells us that the worth of souls is great in his mind 
and he sends us out to seek for those souls; "for the field," as he 
says, "is already white to harvest, and he that thrusteth in his 
sickle with his might shall have store which perisheth not." In 
other words, he shall have the souls of men who have heard his 
message ; who have had faith brought into their lives ; who have 
yielded obedience to the commandments of God, and have accepted 
the truth and striven to shape their lives in harmony with the 
teachings of the gospel ; and in so doing he has added unto himself 
a store that cannot perish but will live eternally, a blessing, benefit, 
joy and consolation unto himself. Our Father says that if you 
should labor, as it were, all the days of your lives, and bring but 
one soul unto him, how great shall be your joy with that soul in 
the kingdom of our Father. And if ye bring many souls unto him, 
behold how great shall be your joy. That is why the Priesthood is 
given unto us. What will our Father think if we do not use that 
Priesthood, when we neglect to use it; or if we do use it, if we do 
it for our own aggrandizement, the advancement of our own pur- 
poses, our own personal gain? When we do that, we dishonor 
it, and instead of being helpers in his cause and laying up a store 
that shall not perish, we forfeit our rights and our privileges; 
we are not helpful, we do not obey that second commandment of 
which President Grant spoke this morning, "Love thy neighbor as 
thyself." We are not worrying, many times, about our neighbor; 
whether he is prospering, advancing, walking the path of right- 
eousness, or not; we are caring only for ourselves. Now, in the 
midst of that kind of a feeling, it is not conducive to a perpetuation 
of the individual testimony that God has given us. It begins to 
fade and weaken and finally it disappears from us. 

I would say unto you, my brethren and sisters, as a message 
that I would like to give to all with whom I come in contact : Guard 
and treasure that individual testimony of the knowledge of the 
goodness of God. Why, think what it means ! You are not afraid 
in your explorations; you can study any of the mysteries, branch 
out, seek to gain knowledge, investigate the things in science, 
go as far as you can; and yet there is no doubt in your mind. 
Whether you are able to solve the things that come before you ; 
whether you are able to explain them, means nothing; but you 
have a testimony that this is the truth, and for that reason nothing 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

on the outside can take it away from you. Only that which is 
within ourselves can rob us of that testimony. 

I have heard of brethren and quorums who are studying certain 
things, coming across certain passages, and having their faith 
weakened by the fact that they cannot harmonize certain things 
that they have read therein, certain things that they have heard. 
Many of them are carried away by alleged scientific principles, 
that make them feel, that that which they discover in researches 
concerning this earth does not warrant the beliefs that they have 
held, and yet I have heard some of those bear testimony to the 
truth of the gospel. To my mind it seems almost impossible that 
such a thing could occur. If I know a thing, I know it. How 
can any one take that away from me? I might as well stand on 
the rock, dive into the ocean, get out beyond my depth, and then 
begin to doubt that I ever did stand on land, when I have 
an absolute knowledge in me that only a few moments before 1 
dived from that rock into the water. If I am wise and have the 
strength, I swim back to the place from which I dived, and I am 
again on terra firma, on land. So it is in all our explorations, if we 
cannot understand them, all we need to do is swim back to that 
rock, our own individual testimony that God has given unto us and 
that we know is true. Having gotten back there secure again, 
we can start out, and we are strong on other explorations and 
thereby gather a little knowledge here and there, better knowledge, 
better understanding and interpretation of the things we read 
and discuss, and therefore strengthen our testimony instead of 
losing it. 

Whatever you do, do not permit anything in your lives, either 
of sin or transgression, of error, of misinterpretation, idleness, 
indolence, of failure to accept opportunity, failure to respond to a 
call — do not let any of these causes step in and begin to weaken 
that testimony, but treasure it with the beauty of the knowledge 
that you know where you are going. There is no uncertainty. You 
know what is required of you, and all you need do is to live unto 
it, and your lives will be shaped in harmony with God's wishes, 
and eternal life and joy and glory and everlasting exaltation shall 
be yours. 

May God bless us, that in our hearts we may have a desire 
for righteousness, live that which is noble and true and uplifting, 
and shun the things that are degrading and degenerating in char- 
acter; live the law of the gospel, the law of the land, the law of 
our own being, and serve God with full purpose of heart. And 
remember, his glory and his advancement is our glory and ad- 
vancement, and if we can go on with an eye single to his glory 
rather than to our own personal gains, joy and happiness will be 
ours everlastingly. May we be able to see this, get this portion 
of the philosophy of the gospel of Jesus Christ into our hearts, 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 67 

and shape our lives in accordance with it! Then we will find that 
we are sloughing off a little vice here, a little evil habit there, a 
wrong thought; and we are replacing them with proper thoughts, 
habits, and ideas in harmony with the gospel, and with God ; and we 
become naturally new men and new women, capable of carrying on 
God's work and serving him and being indeed his helpers in the 
accomplishment of his wonderful work. May it be our lot that we 
may retain these testimonies, in our hearts, live righteously all 
the days of our lives, and receive eternal life in God's celestial 
kingdom, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM H. RICHARDS 

President of the Malad Stake 

We are told that "prayer is the soul's sincere desire, uttered 
or unexpressed ; the motion of a hidden fire that trembles in the 
breast." If ever I experienced that in my life, my brethren and 
sisters, I experience it at this moment, for it is the earnest desire of 
my heart today that our Father in heaven will bless me, that I may 
be able at least to bear my testimony to the divinity of this great 
work in which we are engaged. I have enjoyed the remarks in 
this conference very much. I have enjoyed the remarks of the 
former speaker here this afternoon, in which he quoted the revela- 
tion which says, "Behold a great and marvelous work is about 
to come forth among the children of men." I have read that, time 
and time again, and I have wondered how the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, at the time he received that revelation and gave it out to 
the people, could have realized that a great and marvelous work 
was about to come forth, unless he was inspired by the influence of 
the Spirit of our Father in heaven. I feel with all my heart, 
my brethren and sisters, that the Prophet Joseph Smith was in- 
spired to bring forth this great work. I believe that when our 
Father in heaven and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared unto him, 
that they showed him the beauties and the marvelous work that 
was about to come forth through his instrumentality. There never 
has been a doubt in my mind with regard to his calling. 

I have always believed and have always pictured it in 
my mind as being fact, whenever I have read the account of the 
visitation of our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. There never has been a doubt in my mind 
with regard to that matter and the divinity of this work. 

My brethren and sisters, I received a testimony in my young 
days that has never left me; and while I have been thrown into 
the company of men who have ridiculed the gospel, that ridicule 
has never had any effect upon my mind, because our Father in 
heaven gave me a testimony with regard to the divinity of this 
work. I was almost constantly with my father, a man who ac- 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

cepted the gospel in his native land of Wales. He left all that was 
near and dear to him, and came out to this country all alone, not a 
relative of any kind with him ; came out here for the gospel's 
sake; and the testimonies that he bore to me on many and many 
occasions sank deep into my heart, and I believed with all my 
heart that he was telling me the truth, because I knew he was a 
truthful man. I knew that what he said was true, and he would 
relate the experiences that they had in the old world in the young 
days of the gospel, when people were possessed of evil spirits; 
and all of those things always had an interest for me; and while I 
was but sixteen years of age when he died, and was the only one of 
his family who happened to be present with him on that occasion — 
at the time of his death — out of nine of us in the family, I do 
not believe I shall ever forget, worlds without end, when a few 
minutes before his death he called me to his side. I knelt down 
by him, and he bore his testimony to the divinity of this great 
work. It had an impression upon me that has never left me and 
never will, worlds without end. I loved my father and knew he was 
a truthful man, and could not doubt the testimony which he bore 
to me upon his deathbed. He also gave me the charge that I should 
take that testimony back to my brothers and sisters. I have tried, 
in my weak way, to impress upon them the testimony as it was im- 
pressed upon me. I hope the day- will never come that I forget 
his last testimony. 

Since that time I have had some experience in this Church, 
and the Lord has been good to me and has blessed me with an 
individual testimony, that I can bear without fear of any one that 
I ever met in my life — and, as I stated, I have been thrown, 
upon many occasions, into rough company. I used to freight to 
Montana in early days and was thrown many a time into company 
that had no use for "Mormonism'' in any way in the world; but I 
never met a man in my life that I could not look in the eye and 
say that I knew the gospel is true, whether he knew it or not. 
The Lord has blessed me to that extent that I have never feared, 
wherever I was, in bearing that testimony to the children of men, 
and I hope such a day will never come, because I know that 
there is nothing in connection with the gospel that we need to 
be ashamed of or for which we need to hang our heads in talk- 
ing to anybody regarding it. Our town, Malad, has been a very 
much mixed town. Quite a large number of outsiders live with us. 
I have had to labor with them, have mixed with them upon many, 
many an occasion, but there has never been a time but I was willing 
to bear my testimony to them, and I believe that they respected 
me for it. I do not know of any of our Latter-day Saints who 
had more respect for me than the outsiders with whom I have 
labored in different ways, and this was exhibited when I was 
called to the position, that I occupy at the present time, of pres- 



ELDER WILLIAM II. RICHARDS 69 

ident of the stake. Almost without an exception, those men called 
me by phone and said, "We knew who were going to be the 
president." Well, I had not thought of it myself, and as I told 
the brethren when they came up there, that they might just as 
well have taken a shotgun, taken me out in the field, and taken a 
shot at me ; they would not have come any nearer to killing me. 
I love the work of the Lord, but for some cause or other it is a hard 
matter for me to preach the gospel. It is not, however, because of 
the fear of man or anything of that kind ; it is a weakness of some 
kind that is within me. Some of the Reorganized people up our 
way make considerable capital out of President Young's having 
said on one occasion that he was "not a prophet nor the son of 
a prophet." I can truthfully say that I am not a preacher nor the 
son of a preacher. My father was a very weak man when it came 
to preaching the gospel standing on his feet; but when the op- 
portunity came to him in social conversation around the fireside 
or anything of that kind, he was always ready an.d was able to 
defend the gospel, and always did it very creditably. 

I pray God to bless us, my brethren and sisters, that we may 
give heed to all that may be said to us during this conference ; 
that we may not be in the position that President Grant spoke of 
yesterday when he said that in nearly all the congregations that he 
attends, they sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet" — with 
the postscript, "provided he does not advise us to do things that do 
not suit us." I hope that whenever we receive any advice from 
those of our brethren who are called to those important positions, 
that we will be ready and willing to accept it, although it may pos- 
sibly not be according to our way of thinking at the time. We have 
to wait only a short time until the thing will be demonstrated to 
our perfect satisfaction that those called to such positions are called 
of God and have the inspiration of God, our heavenly Father, to 
advise us along that line. 

I remember on many occasions hearing my father discuss the 
question of the personality of God to people who did not believe 
in a personal God. I remember the objection that they brought 
up. They would say that it would be impossible for a man put 
in the position that we believe God is, if he were a personal 
being, to know what is going on throughout his creations. My 
father used to say, "I feel that he has an organization or some 
way whereby he knows what is going on through all his creations." 
We have had to wait only a few years, brethren and sisters, be- 
fore man has demonstrated that it is possible for us to hear people 
all around the earth, without any wires. The radio has demon- 
strated it and has demonstrated to my perfect satisfaction that our 
Father in heaven always has had some way, some means whereby 
he knows what is going on throughout all his creations. May God 
bless us, my brethren and sisters, that we may give heed to the 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

counsel given to us by our brethren, from time to time, because 
I know from my past experience that if we will heed, it will be for 
our benefit and that we will reap the benefits that we desire. 
May God bless us, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH B. WHITE 

President of the Hyrum Stake 

I feel very keenly the responsibility that rests upon one who 
attempts to address a congregation of this size. In fact my heart has 
been beating very rapidly ever since President Grant announced that 
I would be one of the speakers this afternoon. To be Latter-day Saints 
means service. We must be prepared on all occasions to defend the 
gospel ; to speak upon it whenever we are called. We sometimes feel 
that we have not anything to say, which may be true in some cases. I 
think as Latter-day Saints, we depend more upon the Spirit of the Lord 
to actuate our remarks than does any other denomination upon the 
face of the earth. I am very grateful for this. The Lord knows what 
is best to be said ; what is best to be done. If we will act in accordance 
with the dictates of that spirit, we will not go wrong. Whatever we 
do will be for the advancement of this great work. 

About five years ago, or a little more, I was called upon to preside 
over the Hyrum stake. I felt wholly incapable of performing that great 
work. But I want to bear testimony to you that this work is indeed a 
wonderful work, and if we will put forth the efforts necessary in 
order to carry the responsibility that is placed upon us, we will be 
able to accomplish this work. One of the greatest testimonies I have 
of the divinity of this work is the very rapid growth it has made since 
first established, through the prophet Joseph Smith, despite the great 
obstacles that confronted him, and by which the people have been 
confronted from that time up to the present. If it had not been for the 
help and work of the Lord, it would not have endured ; nor advanced 
from six members to more than about five hundred thousand, the 
present population of the Church. President Grant gave a report this 
morning of the wonderful work that we are doing throughout the nations 
of the earth; of the spiritual growth and development of this Church. 
No greater privilege can come to a Latter-day Saint than to be called 
to perform a service in this Church. A short time ago I was checking 
upon the number of people in the wards and in the stake who are 
holding office, and I find that over 50% of the entire stake population 
hold offices in this Church. We know that in order to advance we 
must work. Success is dependent upon continuous work. We have an 
opportunity to work all the time, if we only will to do it, and the 
advancement that we would make in the future would be wonderful 
if 75% or 80% of those who held office in this Church would only 
respond to the calls that are made of them in a whole-hearted way and 
be absolutely dependable. We could not do otherwise than grow and 
flourish. 



ELDER JOSEPH B. WHITE 71 

Our organization embraces all truth. It covers every good thing. 
The people of the nations, the people of the world today are seeking 
after organization. They find that it is necessary to organize in order 
to protect business, and to protect themselves in a social way, in order 
that men may succeed in any undertaking. We have this great or- 
ganization, and we could apply it, if we desire, to any line of business, 
and I believe it would be effective. I do not think there is any other 
organization in a business way that would be quite as effective as this 
one. 

I do not wish to continue my remarks, but I want to bear my 
testimony. I know this is the work of the Lord ; and I know that if 
we will perform the duties of Latter-day Saints, we cannot but 
advance, gain knowledge, wisdom, and understanding; we cannot 
but be prosperous, if we will heed the instruction of those who preside 
over this Church. I pray that this may be our happy lot, and I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Metropolitan Singers, W. F. Robinson, director, sang two 
selections: (a) "Prayer Perfect;" (b) "Holy Art Thou." 

ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 

President of the Ogden Stake 

One of the main reasons that we all so thoroughly enjoyed the 
chorus to which we have just listened is because of the almost perfect 
harmony of the voices. Not a discord did we hear. And I pray that the 
same harmony may continue in our midst during the time I shall 
stand before you ; and to the end that this harmony may exist, and we 
may each be in tune with the Spirit of God, I trust that each one 
present will offer up silently a prayer that we may receive a message 
that will be of benefit to us. We are God's children. He lives ; he is 
in very deed our Father. He loves us. He has a message for us be- 
cause of his love. And I do pray, and I have continued to pray in my 
heart since President Grant announced this morning that I was to 
be one of the speakers, that I may be instrumental in the hands of 
our Father in saying something that will be of value to us. 

I am grateful for my membership in this Church. I am grate- 
ful for the association of such men as our leaders. I am grate- 
ful for the association of you, my brethren and sisters, and for your 
loyalty to the Church. I am grateful for the loyalty of this Church 
to the Constitution of this great country of ours. And if there is one 
truth more than another that I should like to emphasize this afternoon, 
it is the necessity for this loyalty. An undivided and an unselfish 
loyalty is essential to success in any line; I do not care whether it is in 
a religious line, civic line, in business, or what not ; to succeed one must 
be loyal. And I say again, I am thankful for the loyalty of the 
so-called "Mormon" people, to the laws of this country. 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I often like to contemplate in connection with this theme of 
obedience, of loyalty, the experience of Samuel and Saul — Samuel the 
humble prophet of the Lord ; Saul the great general, large in stature, 
we are told, broad-minded, a big man. Saul, as king of Israel, was 
called and told through the humble prophet, Samuel, to go into the 
cities of the Amalekites and destroy them — not to spare any. Saul 
gathered his armies together and in obedience to that command went 
among the Amalekites, but he did not carry out the instructions of the 
humble prophet entirely. He spared the king, Agag, and some of the 
fat cattle and sheep. "Why," he thought, "of course, the prophet 
told me to destroy everything, but he does not know the conditions 
that exist here; if he did, perhaps he would not have told me to destroy 
everything. Why not spare these fat animals and take them back ; 
offer sacrifices; make a showing?" 

When the word came to Samuel the prophet, he was sad, we are 
told, and went out to meet Saul on the return of the victorious armies ; 
and he asked Saul what it meant, this lowing of cattle and bleating 
of sheep. "Why," Saul said, "I brought them back to offer sacrifice 
to the Lord." And, O those wonderful words that Samuel gave utter- 
ance to, "Obedience is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the 
fat of rams!" 

There are Sauls in our midst today, perhaps, who think that in 
the wards they know more than the bishops. "The bishop is only 
a boy, only a young man. Others are here full of experience. They 
know better than the bishop what the ward needs." No ; you do not, 
brethren or sisters. The bishop, no* matter how young he is, no matter 
how inexperienced he is, has been called and set apart by the authorities 
of God, our heavenly Father. It is our duty to give those in authority, 
whether bishop, president of the Relief Society, or Primary, the super- 
intendent of the Sunday school, or the Young Men, or what not — 
it is our duty to give that officer undivided and unselfish loyalty, 
if we wish to succeed in this Church. 

In the history of the Church, from the beginning, this truth is 
well illustrated. There were those in the days of the Prophet who 
knew more than he did. were better educated, had more experience, 
and were not in a position to give that undivided cooperation that 
was essential. And what became of them? So it was in the days of 
President Brigham Young. There were those who knew more than he 
did ; he is not the man for the presidency of the Church, they said. 
But what happened to them? You can go on through the history of 
the Church. It is full of examples of those who were not big enough — • 
I say big enough, to give undivided and unselfish loyalty. 

To be loyal is the only safe course to pursue. What is true of the 
individual is true of the community, is true of the nation. We are 
told in one of our Articles of Faith that we believe in being subject 
to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKA Y 72, 

sustaining the law. There are some among us, I am sorry to say, 
who seem to be wavering at the present time with reference to honoring, 
obeying, and sustaining certain laws. "It is alright," they say, as 
one of the brethren quoted from President Grant, "to sustain those 
laws when they do not come in conflict with our business or with 
our appetites ; otherwise they are not good for us !" 

I am thankful, I repeat again, for the loyalty of the "Mormon" 
people in sustaining the prohibition law, and I am sorry that some, ap- 
parently, from what they say and from their actions, are wavering. 
Let us, as a people, be loyal in support of those laws. They are 
constitutional, have been so declared. And it is the safe course, as 
far as the people of this Church are concerned, to honor, sustain, and 
obey those laws, whether we like them or not. And I want to tell 
you that it is the safe course for this nation to follow. When individuals 
or a community or a nation select only those laws that suit them, and 
obey them and break those other laws, they are in a dangerous position. 
When a constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery was passed, 
there were those who were not ready to sustain and uphold that amend- 
ment, just as there are those now who are not ready and willing to 
uphold and sustain the Constitution of the United States. The Volstead 
act is a part now of the Constitution of this nation, and is so declared 
by a large majority of the people of this great nation, and it is the duty 
of this nation to uphold and honor and sustain the Constitution. 

God help us, brethren and sisters, to be loyal, to be true, that we 
may succeed as individuals, as a community, and as a nation, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I feel sure that the Latter-day Saints who have assembled here 
this afternoon have been repaid a hundred fold in hearing the things 
that have been said. If we will hearken to the counsels that have been 
given in this conference, I am also sure that it will result in our happi- 
ness and exaltation. 

A great deal has been said in regard to the testimony that we 
have of the divinity of this work and the divinity of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. The ,Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement 
Associations during the present year have had for their slogan, "We 
stand for an individual testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ." 
In this great day and age of the world, when there is so much 
agnosticism and so much doubt and so much unbelief, it seems to me 
it is particularly fitting that emphasis shall be laid upon that great 
and important principle upon which we stand and for which we are 
laboring, that we may establish it among the children of men. 

How are we going to obtain a testimony that Jesus is the Christ? 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

How may we know and have a testimony of it, that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God? At no time in all the history of the world has the 
Lord left his children without divine guidance, without some way of 
communicating to them and letting them know where they stand and 
what is necessary for them to do in order that they may come to the 
knowledge of God; because to know him and to know his Son, Jesus 
Christ, whom he hath sent into the world, is in very deed life eternal. 
It is highly important, then, that in the community that is enjoying 
a dispensation of God's providence, a community to whom have been 
committed the revelations of the Lord, the building up of the Church 
and kingdom of God here upon the earth, it is very necessary that every 
man, every woman, and every child shall know that this is the work 
of God ; that Joseph Smith is a prophet whom God has raised up 
in the day and age in which we live to usher in his glorious dispensa- 
tion. Do we know it ? 

A great many people have some very peculiar ideas in regard 
to the testimony which ought to be in the hearts of every one of them. 
What is the testimony of Jesus Christ? What is the testimony that 
Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God? What is the testimony 
that God lives? What is the testimony that enables us to 
say that Peter, James, and John were apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
endowed with power from on high, and that they spake under the 
inspiration of the Spirit of God? How do we know these things? 
Let me tell you. There is only one way to know the things of God, 
and the Lord intends that his people shall receive that knowledge in 
his appointed way. There is only one way by which we may come to 
the knowledge of God; only one way in which we may know that 
Jesus is the Christ ; only one way that we may know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet sent of God, and it is within the reach of every member 
of this Church ; and it is a shame unto them if they have not received it. 

Have we obeyed the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; have we 
had faith in him ; have we believed in him ; and have we been repentant 
and turned away from our wrongdoing? Have we hearkened to the 
testimony and advice and counsel of the servants of God? Have we 
gone into the waters of baptism and received the remission of our sins ? 
Have hands been laid upon us for the reception of the Holy Ghost? 
If we can answer these questions in the affirmative, every one of us 
can rise and say, "I know that this is the work of God, because I have 
received the gift of the Holy Ghost," through which, and through 
which alone, any man can know of the things of God. 

What do you suppose this gift is for? Why do we receive it? 
O my brethren and sisters, we are living in a world of sin, of darkness, 
and of error, and the minds of the people are darkened regarding the 
things of God. Why? Because they have not obtained the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. That is the condition of the world at large. We have 
received it. There is nothing in all the world of more practical benefit 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 75 

to those who enjoy it than the gift of the Holy Ghost. There is nothing 
more important to us in our lives than to have within us that wonderful 
gift. Every man that has the gift of the Holy Ghost, every woman, 
every boy and every girl who has the gift of the Holy Ghost and 
will keep it, just as sure as they live, they will be exalted in the 
celestial kingdom of God ; and without it, no soul will ever obtain that 
salvation. And every one that has that gift knows that this is the work 
of God, for that is what the spirit within us knows. If we have it, 
then it is ours. Let the spirit speak within you, if you have received 
this wondrous gift, and I hope that all of you know that this is 
the work of God, for that is the office of the Spirit of God within you. 
If you do not, it is because your faith was not sincere, it is because 
you did not repent of sin and, therefore, you did not receive the re- 
mission of your sins, and consequently could not obtain that wonderful 
gift. 

But we possess that spirit in varying degrees. It manifests itself 
variously among the children of men, brought out by the experiences 
of our lives and the opportunities that have come to us, wherein the 
spirit has had opportunity to manifest itself in our lives. Have we 
given that spirit opportunity? Practical, I say, is this thing, the 
operations of the Holy Ghost, but some have allowed it to sleep within 
them; and even in that early day Paul had to write to Timothy, who 
was really a valiant servant of God, but became, no doubt, a little 
neglectful. Paul said: "Stir up the gift of God which is within 
thee, which thou receivedst by the laying on of my hands." That 
ought to be said to Latter-day Saints, if it is not awake and alive in 
them, bearing witness to the truth of this work. Then "stir up that 
gift within you," for you have the right to it. 

If you have kept the gift of the Holy Ghost, you have done so 
by keeping the commandments and keeping yourself sweet and clean 
and unspotted from the sins of the world. But if you have committed 
sin and grieved the Spirit of God, it may have departed from you, 
and that is a terrible condition to be in. 

Sometimes I have heard young men who were aftout to depart 
into the mission field get up in the congregation in their own ward 
and say that they did not know that this is the work of God, but they 
believed it ; and they were going out ! I dislike to hear a young man 
say that ; I do not like to hear any Latter-day Saint say that. Do 
not say that. Why? Because you grieve the Spirit of God that is 
within you. You might as well say, "I haven't received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost," for that is exactly what it means when you say, "I haven't 
the testimony of the truth of this work." It is a confession that you 
haven't the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit of God in you is 
continually crying out for utterance. Give it the opportunity, and when 
you do, you will find there will be a burning in your heart that will 
convince you that you speak the words of truth. You may not know 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

when you rise on your feet exactly what you are going to say, but 
give the Spirit a chance, it will declare the truth that this is the work 
of God, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ and Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God. That is what the Spirit wants to say to every 
child of God upon the face of the earth, because God knows that 
they need it. 

What is the purpose of our receiving that wonderful gift, the gift 
of the Holy Ghost? As I stated before, we are living in a world of 
sin; we have a battle to fight against the powers of evil; we have 
the knowledge of good and evil, and God is continually striving with 
us by the power of his Holy Spirit. But while he is doing that, there 
are other powers in the world, endeavoring to destroy the souls of 
the children of men. That conflict did not begin here upon this earth. 
It began in heaven, before the foundations of this earth were laid, even 
in that primeval day that we sometimes read about, when "the morn- 
ing stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy." Why 
did they shout for joy? Because the proclamation was made that these, 
the children of God — you and I and all the inhabitants of the earth — 
standing in the presence of our Maker, should receive this earth-life 
experience, and thereby, with a knowledge of good and evil, work out 
our salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord and be brought 
back into his presence and exalted, clothed upon with immortality and 
eternal life. That was the program, and we shouted for joy, you and 
I and all the sons of God, as we were assembled upon that great 
occasion. It was necessary that the fall should take place ; that Adam 
should introduce the race of mankind upon the earth ; that the law should 
be broken and the penalty brought into the world, the penalty of death, 
that came into the world as a consequence of original sin. 

But it meant an opportunity of development, of education, of 
growth of those qualities that are divine, to make us like our Maker, 
that we might become like him in very deed ; for as we were told, our 
eyes were opened to the knowledge of good and evil. And Jesus was 
chosen. "Here am I," said he. And his offer was accepted. It was the 
offer of doing the work that the Father would have done, carrying 
out the divine will. It was a law that gave to all mankind their in- 
dividual liberty, free agency, with the knowledge of good and evil, to 
choose between the two. That is what we obtained through the fall 
of Adam — the privilege of living here upon this earth, with this 
knowledge that we have, and with free agency, the right to exercise 
it; but with admonition to reject the evil and do the good, that we 
might inherit eternal life in the presence of God. That is what we are 
here for, and the conflict is still on. There was another one in that 
council that rebelled against God. He said, "O send me, here am I, 
too many will be lost in that plan of yours; too many will go astray; 
too many will be lost, for in the free exercise of their agency they 
will not do the right thing, many of them, and they will be lost. So 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 77 

here am I, send me.and I will see to it that not one soul shall be lost. 
I will compel. This free agency will not do." Freedom was a law 
of heaven, but slavery and servitude was the plan of this son of the 
morning, Lucifer, for he it was who made that proposition. And he was 
rejected and cast down because of his rebellion against God and 
the plan of life and salvation, and with him fell one-third of the hosts 
of heaven. Fell where? Right down here upon this earth, where you 
and I are living. And we meet them every day. You meet them and 
so do I — Lucifer and his hordes, these that are endeavoring to lead 
mankind astray, away from the path of right, into that servitude where 
he will compel and dominate. That is the struggle that is on, and it 
is in everything that we do, because there is a right way and a wrong 
way to do everything, and when we elect to do it the right way, we are 
serving God and keeping his commandments ; but when we do it the 
wrong way, we are yielding to the adversary. The great principle of 
refraining from sin is enjoined upon humanity, and we have daily need 
to practice that saving principle ; but we are i-n conflict with a very 
formidable foe and their name is legion, Satan and all his hosts, en- 
deavoring to gain the victory over us. 

Now then, wherein comes the benefit of the gift of the Holy 
Ghost? Have you thought, or do you think that you can gain the 
victory over so formidable a foe without the help of God? I do not think 
so, not one of us. And the Lord does not think so, and he desires that 
you shall be properly upheld and supported in your endeavor to gain 
this victory, and he proposes to help you. How? By giving you the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, without which no man can gain the victory 
over evil. Have you engaged in that conflict? Hasn't the Lord come 
to your help? Has he not rescued you from the power of the adversary? 
If he has, it is because the Holy Spirit has been with you. Don't you 
know it? Isn't that the testimony of God's power to you? 

How did you get the gift of the Holy Ghost? If you have it at all, 
you have received it because Peter, James, and John came and visited 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and laid their hands upon his head and 
ordained him to the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood. That is why you 
have it. There were some who had received the word of the Lord down, 
in Samaria, but they had not received the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
They had been baptized with water. "Now when the apostles which 
were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, 
they sent unto them Peter and John [those same men who came to 
Joseph] who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they 
might receive the Holy Ghost: (for as yet he was fallen upon none 
of them: only they were baptized [with water.]) Then they laid their 
hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost." Acts 8. That is 
what happened. And if you have received that gift of the Holy Ghost, 
you have received it because those same apostles came to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and laid their hands upon his head and conferred that 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Holy Priesthood upon him, and gave him the power that on whom- 
soever he laid his hands he might receive that same gift. That is the 
way you got it, every one of us, either directly or indirectly, from that 
one source. > 

O, some people think they can get it without that. That is what 
Simon, the sorcerer thought. It was an outward demonstration there. 
It was even apparent to him, and when he saw that on whomsoever 
these apostles laid their hands he received the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
he came and offered them money, so that on whomsoever he might 
lay his hands, the same might also receive that gift. You remember the 
words of Peter, "Thy money perish with thee, for thou hast thought 
to buy the gift of God with money." O no, it cannot be obtained that 
way ! It cannot be obtained except as God gives it to us. Through the 
restoration of the Priesthood, we have received these wonderful gifts, 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, practical in all of its phases, practical to 
all of us. 

But it is a terrible thing to get the gift of the Holy Ghost and then 
lose it. We can only do that through transgression. If we have only 
kept ourselves clean, we have it still, if hands have been laid upon us 
in this Church ; and_we should stir up that gift until it is alive within us. 
It will manifest itself, if you will become active; if you will take your 
part ; if you lift up your voice and cry repentance and labor for Zion. 
The Spirit will show itself within you, if you will declare the truths 
of heaven ; you cannot but say that you know, and the Spirit does 
know it. It is a terrible thing to lose it, and that is what some people 
have done. I call attention to one historical instance of it. There was 
David, the shepherd king of Israel, a man after God's own heart. 
How the Lord loved that man ! He was full of faith ; said he, "The 
Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down 
in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth 
my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's 
sake." That was the testimony of David. O how full and overflowing 
was he with that faith and confidence in God, in whom he believed to 
the bottom of his soul. But David sinned against God, and in the 
agony of his soul and in his repentant mood, he cried out to the Lord. 
"Create in me a clean heart, O-God, and renew a right spirit within me. 
Cast me not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy Spirit 
from me." O, Latter-day Saints, it is a terrible thing to have it taken 
away. David obtained a promise before he died that the Lord would 
not leave his soul in hell, and I like to think that he will yet receive com- 
pensation for all that he has done in upbuilding the faith of mankind in 
those unstinted words of his wherein he expresses his devotion and 
faith in God. 

It was practical in every way. Paul wrote to the Corinthian Saints 
— that is to Saints like yourselves, who had faith in God, had repented 
of their sins, had received the remission of their sins in the waters of 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 79 

i 

baptism and had received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on 
of hands — and said unto them, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of 
God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. If any man defile the 
temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, 
which temple ye are." So might we say to Latter-day Saints, "Know 
ye not that ye are the temples of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in 
you?" Are you not conscious of that, Latter-day Saints? We can 
realize it. Do not defile that temple, for it is holy. Do not transgress 
the laws of God, and you will keep the gift of the Holy Ghost; 
and as long as you do, that is the testimony of the truth of this work, 
and the only way to have a testimony. What we may not know through 
the gift of the Holy Ghost is hardly worth knowing. "Eye hath not 
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into "the heart of man, the 
things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God 
hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all 
things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the 
things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him ? Even so 
the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God." 

If we have the Spirit of God, then, and then only, can we know the 
things of God. So let us cultivate the gift of the Holy Ghost that we 
received by the laying on of hands, for he will lead us back into the pres- 
ence of God. He is the Comforter, the teacher, the educator, our 
tutor, our monitor, our daily companion. If we will only so live that 
we may enjoy his sweet presence, it will enlighten our minds, enlarge 
our understanding, fill us with wisdom and knowledge and understand- 
ing, that we may know the things of God by his holy Spirit, and with- 
out it we cannot come to that knowledge. 

I rejoice this afternoon in the testimony that I have that this is 
true, that it is a reality, it is God's way of helping his children to 
gain victory over evil. The difference between us and the world at 
large consists, then, primarily in this thing. There are many good 
people in the world, just as good perhaps as we are. We are sending 
our missionaries out to them. Why? That they may take unto' the 
inhabitants of the earth, our brothers and sisters who know not the 
truth, the glad tidings that they, too, may receive the same joys that we 
have, that they may receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. That is the 
difference between the world and us. If they can only secure the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, it will enable them to work out their salvation and 
bring them back into the presence of God. But there is only one way 
to get it, and Latter-day Saints know what that way is. And so we 
send our missionaries out with that message to tell unto the inhabitants 
of the earth, that they, too, may receive that priceless gift, and be en- 
abled to overcome this world of sin, and eventually be saved and exalted 
in the celestial kingdom of God. 

May the Lord help us to appreciate, then, what it means to have 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, and let us not say, as long as we have 



,80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

this gift, that we do not know that this is the work of God. I have 
heard it sometimes said, "Oh, you want to be very careful about saying 
what you know." Very true, that may be so; but let me tell you, it is 
sometimes more dangerous in telling them that you do not know ; for 
then you give the adversary a hold upon you. Do not fall into that 
danger, because when you say that, you merely indicate that you are 
not in possession of the gift of the Holy Ghost. Develop it then within 
you, and as you labor in the ministry, as you labor in advocating the 
truth, as you labor in bringing men and women to a knowledge of it, 
and in perfecting your own lives and overcoming your own weaknesses, 
by the power and influence of that Holy Spirit, you will grow in the 
knowledge of God, and your testimony will grow day by day ; it will 
burn in your hearts and you will know it beyond all shadow of doubt. 
That is the office of the Spirit of God, the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
May we then prize it above all things, and so live that we may always 
enjoy his sweet companionship, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

An anthem was sung by the choir, "God is our refuge and 
strength." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder David R. Lyon of the 
Ensign stake. The meeting adjourned. 



SECOND DAY 

MORNING SESSION 

Monday, April 5, 1926, at 10 o'clock a. m., a large audience 
gathered in the great Tabernacle on this the second day of the con- 
ference. 

Meeting opened promptly at 10 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang, "O say what is truth?" 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Hugh B. Brown, presi- 
dent of the Lethbridge stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "Zion stands with hills surrounding." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I think perhaps the greatest contribution that I could hope to 
make to this conference would be in the brevity of my remarks, and I 
hope that I may be able, in a few minutes, to make a few suggestions 
which may be of some worth. 

THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE HOME OUTSTANDING ESSENTIALS 

If I were asked what thing I regard as being most essential to the 
progress of the Church and the well-being of its members, I think that 
I would answer by mentioning two things : First, the Priesthood, 
and then the home. I have long felt that these two great institutions 
lie at the very basis of our work and its advancement. 

THE PRIESTHOOD AN AGENCY OF SERVICE TO MANKIND 

We have during the past three months been holding Priesthood 
conventions in connection with the quarterly conferences of the Church. 
I have been delighted to see the emphasis placed upon this work, and 
I am hopeful that it may result in a higher and keener appreciation 
for the great power which comes from God and which is so liberally 
bestowed upon the men and the boys of our Church. I have construed 
that power and interpreted it largely in terms of service. I don't be- 
lieve that the Priesthood has been bestowed upon men merely for their 
own aggrandizement. I look upon this power as an agency for service 
to mankind. I have characterized it as the perfect plan of service. 
I believe that it will not greatly profit any man to hold the power of 
the Priesthood unless he uses that power for the benefit of his fellows. 
Indeed, I have come to think that the holding of the power may con- 
duce to his condemnation rather than his exaltation, if he is indifferent 
to it and fails to utilize it for the advancement of God's work. So 
. I think that no more worthy enterprise can be fostered and carried 
forward by our presiding officers in the Church than to give to our boys 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and men, and indeed to the whole membership of the Church, a better 
comprehension, a higher regard, for the holy power which God in his 
goodness has given to us. 

PRIESTHOOD TO BE USED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HOME 

This power is to be used, not alone in presiding over the organ- 
izations of the Church, and not alone in the administration of the 
sacred ordinances of the gospel ; it is to be used in the administration of 
our homes. Every man who bears it ought by possession of the power 
to be a better husband and father. By virtue of the power he is entitled 
to be regarded with respect and deference, and I most heartily commend 
the teaching of our children to respect and regard the power of the 
Priesthood, presiding over the home, as a basis for the inculcation of 
the great virtue of reverence which was stressed in this building last 
evening. There ought to be a difference between homes presided over 
by the power of the Priesthood and those homes which are not. Men 
who bear the Priesthood ought to.be better neighbors; they ought to 
be better citizens, indeed in every way they ought to be superior men. 
If there is no distinction between the men who have received this holy 
power and those who have not, then I think we may well look to our- 
selves to find our deficiencies. The very holding of this power charges 
every man who is blessed with it to live more nearly a godlike life, for 
he holds a portion of Godhood itself. I commend to my brethren and 
sisters the emphasis of this power with the young boys who have 
recently received it. It should be taught to them that because these 
powers are widely distributed they are not cheap. 

NO ORGANIZATION A SUBTITUTE FOR HOME 

I said the second great institution I would stress is that of the 
home. I am well aware that this institution receives very considerable 
attention at our hands, and that few meetings pass in which it does not 
have mention. My suggestion is that we so concentrate our study, our 
attention and our effort upon this institution that we maKe it more 
effective than it has been in giving the virtues of true righteousness 
and purity of life to our children. I am very sympathetic with the 
attention and emphasis placed upon our auxiliary associations, but I am 
thoroughly persuaded that not any one of these organizations, or all put 
together, can be substituted for our homes in the culture of manhood and 
womanhood. The homes are the very nurseries from which spring the 
most worthy products of the Church, the State and the Nation. They 
need more direct attention, and parents, by virtue of their very parent- 
hood, are charged with a responsibility second to no other responsibility 
ever coming to them in their lives, the responsibility to return in purity 
the lives entrusted to their care. God grant that we may so safeguard 
this sacred and immortal institution, that it may achieve its great mission 
in the lives of men and of women, and God grant that, with the Priest- 
hood, these two fundamental institutions may bring into the lives of 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 83 

Latter-day Saints a great appreciation for the blessings of the gospel 
and a determination and resolution to keep the commandments which 
he has given to his children, I ask humbly, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I, also, have had opportunity to visit the stakes of Zion where 
we have recently held the Priesthood conventions and conferences, with 
the membership of the Church, and I think of all the quarterly con- 
ferences that we hold with the stakes of Zion I have enjoyed most the 
work of the Priesthood. I have been greatly pleased, as well as many 
of the parents of the Church, to see the young men of Zion stand up and 
in a public place declare their appreciation for the power of God that 
has been given unto them. With my brother who has just spoken, I, too, 
am impressed with the thought that it is a wonderful sensation to dis- 
cover in ourselves a power which comes from above, and the only way 
to discover that power, is to use it, when it is given to us. It some- 
times takes a little courage on the part of young men in the Church, as 
well as some of the elderly men also, to go forward and use their powers 
Which the Lord has given them, but unless we do use and magnify them 
I am impressed that they will be of little or no value to us. It is a 
wonderful sensation to witness in yourselves the power of God, the 
power to do and say things that are beyond your own physical and mental 
strength. I heard a very splendid lecture the other evening by one of 
our educators and doctors in speaking of some of the gifted men of the 
nation, in their efforts to bring to light the truth. He said that it was 
probably their imagination which places them in the lead in bringing 
to the world the things which they were permitted to do; but I have 
been willing, to grant just a little further blessing to these men, because, 
I believe that they are possessed of a power that is just a little beyond 
their imagination, even though it may be keen and brilliant, because I be- 
lieve that our Father in heaven inspires men who are honest in heart and 
who are seeking after truth, and that he blesses them with gifts that 
make men more powerful and useful than those of ordinary intelligence, 
or brilliant imagination. It occurs to me that the joy which comes to 
men through using their gifts, is somewhat comparable to the feeling 
that impresses men when they are moved upon by the power of God 
while functioning in his work, even under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit, by the power of the holy Priesthood. In my mind one of the 
greatest blessings that can come to a man, is to function in the holy 
Priesthood, to fulfil his duty in assisting to bring about the purposes of 
the Lord in the earth. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ, we understand, is for all people who 
will obey its teachings, who will hearken and who will study and practice 
the laws of truth which have been taught to the world, and in spite of 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

that the Master himself taught his disciples, and in one particular 
passage of the scripture were these statements : 

"Enter ye in the straight gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the 
way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat, 
because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto 
life, but few there be that find it." 

When men and women take advantage of their opportunities to use 
the light and knowledge which comes to them, then they enjoy the 
blessings, because the Lord has been merciful unto them, those who 
obey his commandments, he has remembered with the power that has 
strengthened them against doubt and discouragement and against the 
thwarts of the adversary to place barriers in their pathway, until just 
in my brief experience in the work of the Lord I have discovered, to 
my great satisfaction, that those who are willing to seek and to learn and 
to take advantage of their opportunities, are the ones to whom the 
Lord is very merciful, and whom he will strengthen against the tempta- 
tions of the adversary to place barriers in their pathway ; until I believe 
it is possible for a greater number of the children of men to receive 
important powers and blessings which God has in store for them than 
are enjoying them at the present day. The Lord has been kind in 
establishing his work in the earth where men. and women have taken 
advantage of their opportunities and have in a way cultivated their 
talents and have prepared themselves to teach God's truth, which is 
his gospel, which has been revealed to the earth in its plainness, in its 
fulness, in our own language, it has been taught in nearly all the 
languages of the world ; so I have been constrained to believe that the 
Lord has been very kind to his children. It is my humble desire to 
express the wish that all who desire to teach the truth may have 
occasion to do so, by taking advantage of their opportunities to further 
cultivate their gifts and talents in preparation to stand upon the towers 
of Zion as watchmen, as teachers, as defenders of God's work in all 
of its departments, for I want to testify, my brethren and sisters, 
that this is a day when the Lord has required of you and me that 
we be prepared to defend his work, to teach it by precept and by 
example, wherever it may be our lot to labor. I pray that the spirit of 
defendership may be upon us all, that the spirit to avoid the conditions 
of the world, the spirit to live so that we may walk in that narrow way 
which leadeth to life instead of the easy, forgetful, disobedient way, 
perhaps, that leadeth through that broad gate to the way of destruction ; 
and in humility, as a servant of the Lord, I leave in this conference, and 
in the Church today, with the leaders thereof, and with the membership 
thereof, the blessings of the Lord, that the spirit of discernment, that the 
spirit of teachership, the spirit of true defense may be in our hearts, 
and with us all in our homes and in our work, both in temporal and 
spiritual affairs, in the name of Jesus Christ Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRlN 85 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRlN 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the California Mission 

It is certainly a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to 
be permitted to take part in this great conference of the Church. I 
trust that the few moments that I occupy this position I may be led to 
say such things as shall be in keeping with the occasion and that may 
be of some benefit and advantage to those who are gathered together. 

I am very glad to be able to report the California mission as being, 
from my viewpoint, in good condition. We have had a larger number 
of missionaries in the field during the past Winter than we have ever 
had during any previous period in the history of the mission. This 
larger number is accounted for owing to the fact that a good many 
short-term missionaries were sent to California. A large number of the 
short-term men who have been assigned to California have been men 
quite well advanced in age, two or three of them being just under 
eighty years of age. They have all manifested a splendid spirit and 
have been very anxious to magnify their callings as preachers of the 
gospel. Their spirit has been stronger in some instances than their 
physical organism, and a number of these elders have already been 
released on account of failing health. Those who have been released 
were not quite able to stand up to the stress of missionary work. I am 
very sorry to say that one of these brethren, Brother Thomas Wilson 
of the Woodruff stake, after returning home suffered for a con- 
siderable period of time and then passed on to the great beyond. Elder 
Wilson was a good and faithful man. We appreciate the splendid work 
that has been accomplished by the short-term missionaries. Short-term 
missionaries will be made welcome again in California. While I have 
no thought that it is my prerogative to indicate what should be done 
regarding this class of missionaries, I take it from some expressions that 
I have heard from some of these brethren that they could just as well 
as not have been in the mission field earlier in the season if they had 
received notification, and this certainly would be a very great advantage 
to missionary work. If short-term missionaries could be notified so 
as to leave their homes, probably not later than the month of October, 
they could give more time in the field and thus make their services 
more valuable. They could render service during the winter months 
and still return in time to take up their farming operations'. I think 
the great majority of these short-term missionaries who have been as- 
signed to California have been men who have been engaged in agri- 
cultural pursuits. Many of them have already been released to return 
home in order that they might give attention to the planting of 
spring crops, and the balance of these short-term men I suppose will 
be home within a month or two from the present time. They have 
brought a splendid influence into the mission. They are men of faith 
and confidence, they have set a good example before the people and 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

have had wonderful testimonies to bear in relation to the great work 
that the Lord our God has planted among the children of men. 

We also have an excellent body of young men and women ; and 
while I suppose every mission president is anxious to have some men 
of experience in the mission field to lead the way, to preside over 
conferences, to instruct and teach younger men and women, personally 
I feel, the longer I labor as a missionary, that our Father in heaven 
made no mistake when, through his servants from the very beginning, he 
called very youthful men to go abroad to represent him in the preach- 
ing of the gospel. It is perfectly marvelous to note the change that 
takes place with these missionaries. Last Saturday night I had the 
pleasure of meeting quite a body of California missionaries in their 
missionary reunion, and I was proud of that company of young men and 
women. Just a short time ago I met every one of these young people 
in the mission field when they first reported for missionary labor, 
and almost invariably I met trembling boys and trembling girls. They 
hardly knew, as a rule, whether they had any testimony concerning the 
divinity of the work of our God, or not. In fact it has not been an 
unusual thing to hear some of these missionaries say that they did not 
have a testimony, they believed in the work of God, they had faith that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and they were anxious to come to 
the knowledge which they had heard their parents and bishops and 
presidents talk about in their home communities. These young people 
that I met in the reunion were a different class of young men and 
women altogether from the young men and women I met as Aey came 
into the mission field. They were no longer trembling. They were 
no longer in any doubtful mood concerning the work of God. They 
were full of conviction. Instead of striking hands with trembling 
boys in a good many instances, I found myself shaking hands with 
bishops in the Church of Christ, with bishop's counselors, and with 
stake superintendents of Mutual Improvement organizations, and Sun- 
day school organizations, and it was evident from the words that fell 
from their lips, in the brief conversations I was able to hold with them, 
that they were in very deed ministers of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and that they had burning in their souls the same testimony, the 
same knowledge, the same understanding, that were in possession of their 
fathers and mothers. 

I said in our Mutual Improvement General Board meeting the 
other night, when there was a little discussion regarding testimony, 
that I heard one of our bright, well-educated young missionaries say that 
he had attended one of our Church schools for four years until he 
graduated from that school, and then attended the Brigham Young 
University for four years until he graduated from that institution of 
learning, and he made this wonderful statement : "I have come to 
understand my relationship toward my Father in heaven, the nature and 
importance of the Priesthood of Almighty God that has been conferred 
upon me, and the duty I owe to my fellowmen, better in the three 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 87 

months that I have been laboring here as a missionary than during all 
those years when I was attending school and taking regular theo- 
logical lessons." Then he added: "And I had good teachers, too." 

I hope there will not be any thought in the mind of any educator 
who may be in this great congregation, that I do not entertain a proper 
appreciation for education. I would to God that I had more education 
myself. I am proud of the men in our midst who have passed through 
great institutions of learning in our own land and in other lands, 
and who have had conferred upon them degrees of honor, because of 
their educational attainments, and yet I do hold that in giving actual 
service in the preaching of the gospel, in coming in contact with in- 
dividuals who question one in relation to the principles that have been 
revealed of God, there comes by the power of God, and the inspiration 
and revelation of the Spirit of the Lord, an understanding regarding 
the purposes of God, the greatness and power and necessity of his 
work, that cannot be obtained from books, and that cannot be put 
into the hearts of men by teachers, let them labor ever so well and 
faithfully. I do not understand that there is any way of coming to a 
comprehension of the purposes of God other than by having the com- 
panionship of the Spirit of the Lord. If we come to understand the 
truth, as one of the old apostles taught, it must be by the revelation 
of God. So taught the apostle Paul to the Galatians. There is no 
other way. 

I am greatly comforted when I hear testimonies such as I have 
referred to ; and missionaries bear many such testimonies. I heard one 
of our college-bred men, Elder Louis E. Rowe, who is at present in 
charge of the Sunday school and Mutual Improvement work in the 
California mission, make the statement not long ago that he would 
not exchange the information and understanding that had come into 
his soul as a result of his missionary labors for all the college training 
that he had ever received, or ever expected to receive. With, I hope, a 
due appreciation for the declaration that came from the Prophet 
Joseph Smith that, "The glory of God is intelligence," I myself entertain 
the thought that there does come by the power of God and by the 
mysterious revelation of the holy Spirit, a knowledge, concerning the 
purposes of Almighty God that is superior to anything that any man 
living has ever obtained or ever will obtain while the world stands, from 
any institution of learning. 

Our Father in heaven has established this work. Men in the world 
do not believe it. We have been sent out to bear testimony that God 
has set his hand to accomplish a marvelous work and a wonder. 
Yesterday when I looked over this great congregation I wondered what 
can be in the minds of men and women not of our faith when they come 
into this tabernacle and see it crowded to its utmost capacity with 
Latter-day Saint men. Latter-day Saint congregations are not made 
up chiefly of women, as is the case in many of the churches of the 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

world. Our meetings are crowded with men, men of hard sense, 
men who know something about the battle of life ; yet they leave their 
affairs and come from long distances that they may be in this general 
conference. 

As I looked over the tremendous gathering yesterday morning 
there came into my mind the promise that was made by one of the 
prophets, Isaiah, when he said : 

"And it shall come to £ass in the last days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted 
above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go 
and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house 
of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in 
his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem." 

Another prophet, Jeremiah, made this declaration: 

"Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you; 
and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you 
to Zion : And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed 
you with knowledge and understanding." 

I have had some experience as a missionary in many of the nations 
of the world. In my missionary work I have been brought in contact 
with many thousands of Latter-day Saints who have been converted 
to the truth of the great message that missionaries are attempting to 
deliver to the peoples of the earth, and I know that they have not come 
up to Zion for gold or for silver or for perishable things. 

I call to mind, now, that many years ago, when I was a boy 
missionary in Scotland, in conversation with a good sister in that country 
she made this statement to me: "I would to God that the way might 
be opened up that I might go to Zion with my children. It would 
not matter to me," said that good mother, "though I was sure to lay 
down my life on the journey, if I could only have in my soul the 
knowledge that my children would be taken to the land of Zion, and that 
they would be brought up under the care and teaching of the servants 
of God." I know that men and women who have gathered from afar, 
to this land, designated by the Lord our God for the gathering of his 
people, are actually fulfiling the promise that was made by the holy 
prophets, that they are coming to the land of Zion with the thought 
uppermost in their minds, that they may learn more perfectly of the 
ways of God ; that they may receive more completely of the blessings 
that our Father in heaven has to give to his servants and his hand- 
maidens who are willing to keep his commandments. 

I would like to ask the strangers who are present in this con- 
gregation : Where else in all the world can a people be found who 
have been gathered from all nations like this people, or where else 
among the religions of the world can teachers be found who believe 
in the promises of the prophets such as I have mentioned? Men at 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 89 

large are not looking for any such fulfilment of the promises of 
God. The Latter-day Saints alone teach and believe in such promises 
as are made by Isaiah, Jeremiah and other prophets pertaining to the 
last days. 

I rejoice in my ministry, my brethren and sisters. I can not 
conceive of any line of employment, that any human being can have, 
more desirable or that produces greater joy in the human heart than 
that which is found by men and women who are engaged in calling 
repentance to the inhabitants of the earth and in teaching to them the 
precious truths that have been revealed for the salvation of the human 
family. I feel grateful to my brethren of the presiding authorities of 
the Church for the opportunities they have given me to labor in the 
ministry, to labor at the present time in the great state of California. 
I feel grateful to them for the kind words they have spoken to me, for 
the encouragement they have given me and my companions, and I 
have a strong desire in my soul to perform the duties that rest 
upon me to the best of my ability, and to be found always crying 
repentance among the people and bearing witness to the truth as 
it has been revealed. It is true there are not any great numbers that 
pay attention to the testimony borne by "the missionaries. In the 
California mission, during the year just passed away, there were about 
seven hundred sixty baptisms. A large number of these baptisms 
were the children of Latter-day Saints who reside within the confines 
of the mission, but we rejoice when we take into consideration the 
declaration of our Father in heaven that if one labors for a life time 
and saves but one soul, how great will be his joy with that soul in the 
kingdom of God. Then if we put that measure of importance and value 
upon the souls of men, wonderful things are following the ministry 
of these missionaries, not only in California, but in all the missions 
throughout the world, for I take it that few as the baptisms may be, 
they are far in excess of one soul to each man and woman who has been 
called to labor as a missionary. 

Then there is another great responsibility that rests upon the 
missionaries. It is not to be gauged by the number of souls that 
we lead down into the waters of baptism. It has always been the 
decree of God and his manner of working with the inhabitants of 
the earth, to send forth his servants to warn mankind and bear witness 
concerning the judgments of the Almighty that are to overtake the 
inhabitants of the earth, and those judgments have not ceased, as the 
Lord God liveth. . All that he has promised by the mouths of his holy 
prophets in due time shall be brought to pass ; and upon the shoulders 
of these men who have been called to labor as missionaries there rests 
a responsibility to warn the people and testify as widely as possible that 
the heavens have been opened, that God the Father and his Son Jesus 
Christ have come to earth, that holy angels have been sent by the 
command and appointment of God, and these holy messengers have 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

conferred upon the heads of mortal men authority of the holy Priest- 
hood, the power to speak legally in the name of God. That authority 
is here, it is with the missionaries ; they feel it. No wonder they say 
there has come to them a knowledge and comprehension concerning the 
purposes of God which they have never been able to obtain in institu- 
tions of learning, but they found it by revelation in the service of God. 
I bear witness to this truth. I rejoice in it. I know that God 
lives, I know that Joseph Smith, the man chosen to introduce this 
great work of the latter days, was called and ordained to the authority of 
the Priesthood by the commandment of Almighty God. The Lord's 
Spirit has so testified to me and, whether my fellowman entertains the 
thought that I am radical or otherwise, God being my witness, I know 
that this is his work, and that it cannot be destroyed. It has been 
planted to remain. That is the promise of God. Overturn it if you 
ran ! Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in the testimonies 
that have been borne, and the instructions given in this great con- 
ference. I realize that all of you who have come together have come 
for the purpose of receiving the word of the Lord and instruction from 
his servants, and I, with you, have listened with great interest and ap- 
preciation to the instructions that have been given to us by the Pres- 
idency and those of the authorities who have already spoken. I desire 
to live in accordance with these instructions, and, so far as I have^ 
power, to help with you, to carry them out in our lives for the 
advancement of this great work in which we are engaged. I appreciate 
the fact that in endeavoring to speak to you this morning I am under 
a great responsibility, and that unless I can enjoy the influence of 
the Spirit of the Lord and your confidence and attention, I shall not 
be able to speak in such a way as shall be edifying and profitable to 
you who are present. 

I have rejoiced greatly, and have been delighted with the op- 
portunity that has come to me to visit in the various stakes of Zion. 
It has been a joy to attend the conferences that have been held, and to 
partake of the fine spirit that is manifest among the presidencies of 
stakes, the bishoprics of wards, and the sisters — the women who are 
engaged in the various activities which are common to them in the 
various stakes of Zion — and to feel the spirit generally that is mani- 
fested in these stakes. I have been edified, strengthened and en- 
couraged in the appreciation of the fine manhood and womanhood that 
is in evidence among the officers and members throughout the Church. 

I rejoice in the fact that this Church will have been organized 
ninety-six years tomorrow. I have been led to reflect upon some 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 91 

of the things that have happened on that date. It is believed, I think, 
that on or about this date, somewhat like nineteen hundred twenty- 
six years ago, our Savior was born, and that about thirty-three years 
later, on or about this same date, he was resurrected from the dead ; 
that yesterday, the day that is celebrated by the Christian world gen- 
erally as the day of his resurrection, conforms very closely to the day 
which we celebrate as the anniversary of the organization of the Church. 
There are other events that have occurred on this same date, April 
6, that are of importance in addition to this great event which we 
celebrate — that of the organization of the Church. I am reminded that 
on April 6, T909, Admiral Peary reached the North Pole. What 
connection that may have with the gospel or with the attitude of the 
Church, I leave for your consideration. I am reminded also that on 
April 6, 1917, war was declared by the United States against Germany 
and Austria, which nations were engaged at that time in a war against 
the welfare of humanity. This nation entered into that conflict with 
unselfish purposes, and with the desire in mind to promote liberty 
and right living. As Latter-day Saints, we surely appreciate the fact 
that the entry of the United States into that war was in conformity 
with predictions that have been made in the past with regard to con- 
flicts which should prevail, and also the part which this nation should 
take in the promotion of liberty among mankind. 

I was impressed greatly with statements made by President Grant 
in his opening remarks yesterday morning with regard to the blessings 
which have attended the people of the Lord in coming to this land, 
and I would like to read to you a few of the words of Isaiah relative 
to this matter. In the 35th chapter of Isaiah we read as follows: 

"The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the 
desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. * * * 

"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 

"Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, 
your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense ; he will 
come and save you. 

"Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf 
shall be unstopped. 

"Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb 
sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. 

"And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land 
springs of water. * * * 

"And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The 
way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: 
the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. * * * 

"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs 
and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and 
sorrow and sighing shall flee away." 

We are witnesses, my brethren and sisters, to the fulfilment of 
this prophecy. It has been brought to pass in this generation in the 
coming of the people of the Lord to this community, and the building up 
of this land. We are enjoying the blessings that have followed the ac- 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ceptance of the trials and sacrifice which they made in coming here. 
What was the cause of their coming, or by what means were they able 
to endure? They developed the spirit of obedience and willingness to 
do that which the Lord desired of them, whereby they were prepared 
to submit their own desires and feelings for the welfare of this work, 
and the accomplishment of God's purposes, with an appreciation of the 
.fact that his word and his will had been declared unto them by those 
who were the leaders of his people. 

I would like to stress for a moment the importance of this spirit 
of obedience. The Lord has given to us a knowledge and an apprecia- 
tion of the responsibilities of the principles and the ordinances which 
conform to his house, and to the building up of his kingdom. He desires 
of every one of us who accept of these things that we shall accept 
of them willingly and that we shall endeavor to observe them. We have 
heard from our President in regard to the principle of the Word of 
Wisdom, a principle and a revelation that has been before this people 
for all these many years, so plain that the wayfaring man need not 
err with regard to the truth and the divinity of the principle and the 
assurance of blessings which follow the observance of this principle. 
Let me call your attention in this connection to the statement made in 
one of the opening paragraphs of the Word of Wisdom, with regard to 
the efforts which are being made and which will be made by wicked 
men conspiring for the purpose of defeating the welfare of the children 
of men, for which reason, among others, the Lord has made plain 
this revelation. I am sure that every one of us appreciates the fact, 
if we will but consider for a moment, that there are influences at 
work in the world today which are endeavoring to mislead and to 
deceive the people of the world with regard to those things which the 
Lord has declared are not good for man, such as tobacco and strong 
drink, and other things which he has declared are not for our welfare. 
Many men in the world are endeavoring in a deceitful way to make these 
harmful things appear attractive. We read the advertisements of these 
things which are narcotic in their nature, and we can perceive very 
clearly that such advertisements are worded and designed in order 
to deceive those who are not familiar with the dangers which attend 
the use of these drugs and narcotics. The Lord expects of us that 
we shall observe these things. As he has given this commandment, 
we should be ready to obey it, and should do so willingly. There 
should be no trial, as I see it, to the Latter-day Saints to observe the 
principle of the Word of Wisdom, even though it may mean that we 
have to resist the temptation or the desire for any of these things. If we 
will cultivate the spirit of obedience and humility, there is no reason 
at all why every one of us cannot observe and live in conformity with 
the principles which the Lord has declared in that revelation, the 
Word of Wisdom. 

In like manner, there is a principle and a law that has been given 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 93 

far our development which .will enable us to overcome our selfishness 
and enable us to cultivate charity and consideration for our fellow- 
men, for the welfare of mankind everywhere. We heard read yesterday a 
statement of the expenditures that have been made by the Church 
from the tithes for the welfare of the people, and I want to say to you 
that which you know for yourselves, that these tithes are expended 
solely for the welfare of the people of the Lord, for the advancement of 
his purposes in the earth, for the promotion of the welfare of man- 
kind, for the bringing of the gospel to all men everywhere, and for 
these purposes only ; and the tithes are expended with the greatest 
wisdom and judgment, under the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord. 

The Lord has given to us this commandment, which we should 
observe, that one-tenth of all of our increase should be given to him 
annually. Surely every Latter-day Saint can ibe taught this principle, 
and can learn to observe it in conformity with that spirit, that not less 
than one-tenth of all that we earn, not less than one-tenth of all our 
increase, shall be given to him for the advancement of his work. When 
the people of the Lord came to this land, they took it up as their own, 
and yet I am sure they did it with an appreciation that they were 
doing so as stewards ; that, while they claimed the land, they realized 
the fact that the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. In 
like manner, every one of us ought to cultivate that spirit, and the ap- 
preciation of the fact that we are only stewards here and we have 
what we enjoy of material things for the time being only. We cannot 
take any of the earthly possessions when we go from here. We can 
only take with us the things that we have developed in the way of faith, 
righteousness and good works. So we surely ought to use our means 
and administer our affairs here with the appreciation in our hearts that 
what we have received is of the Lord, and that he will bless and prosper 
us in larger measure as we show our appreciation to him for his blessings 
unto us. 

There are, also, other things, my brethren and sisters, that we need 
to learn to observe and to obey more fully. In the matter of the 
observance of the Sabbath day, the Lord has declared to us how we 
should observe that day. Many people question at times how we should 
observe it, or what it is that might be considered as breaking the Sab- 
bath. Surely anything that interferes with the spirit of peace con- 
formable to the Sabbath is breaking the Sabbath. There should be 
nothing that interferes with our worship or that causes our minds to be 
diverted, nor any act of ours that causes our minds to de detracted 
from the spirit of that day; but in all of our acts upon that day we 
should exercise and devote our minds and thoughts to those things that 
shall help us to grow in faith, in righteousness and in good works. 

The Latter-day Saints have received the promise of a blessing, 
that if they will observe the principle of fasting and give for the 
benefit of those who are in need — the fast donations — they shall be 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

prospered and blessed and grow in faith ; and righteousness. Our fast 
every month ought to be in the spirit and with the purpose of obtain- 
ing some particular blessing that we .need, which will enable us to gain 
spiritual strength and power. As we live and strive in this way we 
shall cultivate increased strength and capacity, we shall be blessed 
physically and cultivate more of the spirit of charity and good will for 
our fellowmen. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the truth of the gospel. I 
rejoice in the confidence of my brethren and the confidence which you 
have in me, and pray that I may be worthy of it. I know that this 
restored gospel is true. It has been an assurance to me all my life. I 
was brought up in the Church, of goodly parents who trained me in 
the spirit of the gospel, and I have learned to know for myself the 
divinity of this work, to know that this Church which is named the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is in very deed and 
absolutely his Church. Of all the churches of the world, it is the 
Church of Jesus Christ. It is founded upon the foundation of apostles 
and prophets, with Jesus Christ as the chief cornerstone. It has been 
established under his immediate direction and by revelation from him. 
It will endure and carry out the purposes which the Lord has in view for 
the accomplishment of righteousness, truth and liberty in the earth, 
and the preparation for the coming of the Son of man to reign in 
righteousness here. May we, every one of us, do our part to advance 
the purposes of God and to help to bring these things to pass, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang with spirit the old familiar hymn by Elder 
Charles W. Penrose, "O ye mountains high." 

ELDER LLOYD O. IVIE 

Former President of the Japan Mission 

I am sure, my brethren and sisters, that I have never in my life 
had a surprise quite like this. It was something that I had never 
expected. I really have never felt it would be possible within my life- 
time to be called to speak to an audience of this size, though I have 
spoken to audiences in our stake assemblies. I do feel that this is a 
place where, above all, we should be able to receive the blessings of the 
Spirit of the Lord. I have felt that Spirit whenever I have come to 
conference, here in f Salt Lake. I have always felt it here, perhaps, 
as much or more than at any other place. 

I was given an opportunity as a missionary to labor among the 
Japanese people. I am sure that I enjoyed the time that I labored in 
that land. I have had faith in that people. I know there are many 
good among them. I realize that in America anything concerning the 
Japanese is spoken of with considerable prejudice, due perhaps to 



ELDER LLOYD 0. IVIE 95 

political and other reasons. But in my association with them as a mis- 
sionary, I have found much good among them, and have learned to 
love and respect them in very deed. I really think and feel that the 
Japanese people are worth while. 

Our coming to Japan was, perhaps, the first contact of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with other than Christian religions, 
with other people than those of Christian belief, the so-called Christian 
denominations of the world. It is our first contact, we might say, with 
Buddhism, a religion and philosophy which is so much different from 
our own; and I have found that in this we have a new work, a dif- 
ferent problem to solve, and it is one that is going to tax the ingenuity 
and faith of our missionaries and of our people before that problem 
shall be entirely solved. At any rate, that is the way it has always 
seemed to me. We, cannot go before those people and preach to them 
the gospel by quoting passages of scripture, and say that this is true 
or that is true, because it says so in the Bible. We must convince them 
with reason. But, of course, as Latter-day Saints, we know and under- 
stand that truth is reason, and that there is no other way by which 
we can receive knowledge and understanding except by study and 
by the Spirit of the Lord, and that we must reason these things out for 
ourselves. That is one of the strong points, I think, of the Latter- 
day Saints. We are not confined to what is said in any book of 
scripture, though it is true those books are the foundation of our re- 
ligion. They make us what we are historically ; but, at the same time, 
we as Latter-day Saints feel that we have individual testimonies, each 
and every one of us, concerning the gospel, because we have reasoned 
it out for ourselves, and such is the way that we must work. As 
Latter-day Saints, that is the way we must obtain our testimony, if we 
feel that we are strong enough to stand against those various doctrines 
that spring up against the work of the Lord throughout the world. 
I think that it is a good thing for us all to gain a testimony, not only by 
faith and prayer, but by reason and by study, until we can understand 
that these things are true, even though the scriptural books were taken 
away from us. I think that is one thing that we should all say as 
Latter-day Saints, that we could stand on the testimony we possess, even 
though, through some freak of nature, or otherwise, the very books by 
which we have been taught were taken away from us. We stand upon 
that. That is going to be the problem in my mind when our Church 
fully solves the methods, the correct methods, of doing missionary work 
among this people who believe in Buddhism. I believe that there will 
be a great work done among that people. Of course, we don't un- 
derstand the origin of the Japanese. We don't understand entirely, that 
is of a surety, whence they came, though many opinions have been 
given, and much has been studied on the subject. 

While I was in that country I had an opportunity to study in 
company with a native man, who used to come to the Book of Mormon 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

classes. He was interested in the Book of Mormon from the viewpoint 
of his getting knowledge of early races; from the viewpoint of learning 
of the origin of the races. That was what he was studying, as a lad. 
He was a government employee, but as a hobby he had collected a large 
library. By the way, his library was destroyed in the great earthquake, 
and immediately thereafter he came back to the Church and bought a 
copy of the Book of Mormon, saying that it was the first book that he 
had purchased to begin his new library since the old one had been 
destroyed ; and he had studied these problems and felt that the Japanese 
people had perhaps come from somewhere around Asia Minor, perhaps 
from Greece or from Egypt or in that district somewhere, and he had 
maps that he had collected showing something to that effect. It is 
probable that such might be the case. At any rate, it is my firm belief 
and opinion that there is the blood of Israel among that people. I 
believe that some day, although the time may not be fully ripe, that 
blood will show itself in greater good works in the land. 

I want to bear my testimony that the restored gospel is true. I 
know this with all my being. The only problem in my life is to live 
worthy of those things which we know and understand are true and 
correct. I pray that the blessings of the Lord may be with us all, 
that we may seek continually to keep his laws and commandments, and 
I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Our concluding speaker will be President Alonzo A. Hinckley. 
I thought -the Saints would be pleased to hear from one of our short- 
term missionaries who has had experience in the field. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

President of the Deseret Stake, and one of the Short-term Missionaries 

My brethren and sisters, I beg of you that you will sustain me 
by your united faith and prayers, that my spirit may be calm, and that 
the Lord may be able to use me in his own way for the few minutes 
that I shall stand before you. I certainly do appreciate the opportunity 
of being with you and worshiping with you during the sessions of 
this conference. It is only a matter of a few days since I wrote home to 
my folks and said to them that this would be the first conference that 
I had missed in a number of years; but that I hoped that they, in 
their attendance here, would receive that reward of the Spirit of this 
work that comes to us when we are associated with the authorities of 
this Church, who speak in the name of the Lord by divine authority. 

I have been privileged the last few months to be in the missionary 
field, under the direction of President Charles A. Callis, in the Southern 
States mission. I was assigned to the Florida conference. Not being 
acquainted with the other conferences of the Southern States, I am 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 97 

I 
prone to believe, from the short experience that I had in Florida, that 
perhaps the Florida conference is one of the choicest conferences of the 
Southern States. I bring to you the greetings of the Saints in Florida, 
and I can speak of them as Saints. The majority of those who are 
members of the Church are devoted in their service to the Lord. I have 
felt that it is one of the greatest opportunities that has come into my 
life to be privileged to become renewed in the spirit of proclamation, 
even the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ; to feel the mis- 
sionary spirit; to feel the spirit of testimony; to be associated with young- 
men in the Florida conference. I believe that ten short-term mission- 
aries were appointed to labor in that conference. Choice as they are; 
splendid as are their influence, the spirit they manifest and the testimony 
which they bear, yet, the greatest impression came to me with the 
wonderful work that is being done by young men. Those young men 
seemed as dear to me, almost, as my blood kindred — true, clean, whole- 
some, sweet, living so that the Lord could speak through them ; 
living so that he did speak through them, speaking in the power and 
demonstration of the Spirit of the Lord. They are accomplishing a 
great and a mighty work. It has been a joy to me to sleep with them, 
to talk with them, to pray with them, to feel their spirits. I cannot 
conceive of anything that could bring, and that does bring, in my 
belief, greater strength to the Church than for young men, clean in 
mind and clean in body, to discover really what this work is and what 
the power of the Priesthood is. It was like a renewal; in fact, it 
brought me back immediately to the experiences of years gone by. 
I speak of Florida frequently as of Holland. I don't know why it 
should be, after a lapse of twenty-five years, that when I speak I should 
mix the names of Holland and Florida, only for the same spirit of 
testimony which is discovered. 

I do not know what particular good I was able to accomplish for 
any other than for myself, but it was worth more than it cost me in 
time and in money just to have the feeling and the experience. 

A week ago yesterday, Brother Worley asked me if I would 
perform a ceremony of baptism, and it was my privilege to walk out 
into the clear waters of one of the streams. Six people were led out 
into those waters to make covenant with the Lord. I had one of the 
real experiences of my life. I baptized three children that were children 
of members and one man and two of his children. It seemed just like 
other experiences that I have had in the Church as I baptized those 
children; but when I put that man a little deeper into the water and 
when I raised my hand to high heaven and called him by name, I 
realized who I was, just a weak man, and then when I spoke the 
words : -"Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ," my soul thrilled, 
and I felt, perhaps as I have never felt before, what it meant to be able 
to say: "Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you 
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." 
When that man was buried in the water and he came forth, and after 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the confirmation, he gathered me into his arms — a larger man than 
I am, having heard the gospel for seventeen years of his life and 
never having been brought, as he said, to a full understanding of what 
he had lost, what he was permitting to pass by ; then to have two of his 
children go down with him into the waters of baptism ; and as he 
closed me in his arms he said : "Oh, my brother, now do not forget me 
after all these days, when I accept the truth with an honest heart." 
He had laid away his tobacco, he had understood fully what it meant 
to part with one-tenth of his income annually, he said : "Remember 
me and my little family, that I shall have the faith, the support and the 
prayers of the Saints and of you, that I shall be true henceforth and 
forever." 

I do remember them ! I do pray for them, because out in this 
world of unbelief, in this period when men doubt the divinity of Jesus 
Christ, to find an honest soul who, through repentance and through 
baptism, has his sins washed away and who, through the laying on of 
hands, does receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and testifies of a 
surety that he knows that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of the living God ; that he who was dead now lives and lives forever- 
more, and has established his Church and commissioned men to pro- 
claim this everlasting gospel and to testify of him, of the establishment 
of the Church, and to point the way of salvation to those who will 
hear and believe, the privilege is choice, the blessing is great to have 
the opportunity to go and deliver this message. I thank the Lord for 
the opportunity. I pray that it shall be appreciated. I do not believe 
that it needs men as old as I am or older ; it needs vigor ; it needs 
strength; it needs testimony; it needs those who are prepared to offer 
sacrifices. From the beginning I have seen those who have come in. I 
call to mind one brother when he came in, one of the short-term mission- 
aries, who said : "I am ready to go back. I have not been able to do 
much. I have given what I had, all the strength that is in me, but I 
have not had much strength." I believe that it is worth the strength, 
the physical strength, the ability, the time and all that any man can give, 
to go out and renew his spirit, and cry repentance; testify of the 
divinity of this work, and receive a renewal of his testimony, a renewal 
of the desire to bring souls unto God. When I think of Brother 
Roscoe H. Paramore, I shall remember him forever; I shall think of 
him as one in whom the promise may possibly be fulfilled. I did not 
bring him the gospel first ; oh no ! I have said that he has heard it 
for seventeen years, but he has joined the Church. I expect, if I am 
true, and if he is true, which I believe he will be, to have joy with him 
forevermore, for it is the promise of the Lord. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, of the divinity 
of this work. It is of the Lord. The greatest manifestations, I have 
said, is in these young men standing up. I think of one of them. The 
Saints told me when he came out he had not had much experience. 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 99 

Some of the elders told me of him. When I went down into his 
field, I said: "My brother, do you have any honest investigators in 
this section who are listening to your testimony?" He said: "Come 
with me, my brother, and visit some of them. I believe they are 
honest." At the close of a meeting, we went to the home of one 
investigator. When I came away, one investigator stood up, and as 
he grasped my hand he said : "Brother Hinckley, you will not take 
this elder away from me, you are not going to replace him, are your" 
"Why not?" "Oh, he has brought us the truth. As he has come into 
our home, opened the scriptures, reasoned with us, and borne testimony 
of the gospel, he has brought more joy into our home than any man 
who has ever visited us. Leave him here with us." I walked out and 
I said to one of the elders. "Have you ever worked with this elder 
before?" "Yes, Brother Hinckley, when he first came out here I stood 
with him on the streets. He had not had much experience. As he stood 
on the street, his hands trembled so that he could hardly read a hymn 
that they were going to sing." Yet he stood there, notwithstanding his 
weakness, notwithstanding his fear; and he said, "As I watched his 
knees tremble and listened, to his weak words, I thought, 'oh, that he 
had had some training before he came here.' " That was an elder's 
testimony regarding this weak elder. Sure he was weak, but what has 
he done ? He has followed the instructions of President Callis ; he has 
risen early in the morning and in the early morning hours, after prayer, 
he has read the scriptures ; he has prayed with his companions ; he 
has studied diligently for two years ; and after two years of prayer, two 
years of study, two years of testimony, as I said to my folks, speaking 
of him yesterday, he is sweet and clean, and, excepting perhaps one 
elder, there is not another that will be missed as he will be missed when 
the servants of God say : "Honorably released to return home." He 
has gone into the homes, knowing the truth, testifying of it, living it, 
exemplifying it every day ; and before he comes home I feel certain 
that the Lord will permit him, even while there, to see the fruits of his 
labors, for I believe that the man who grasped me by the hand, saying 
"Take him not away, for he has come to us with a message that has 
brought more joy into our home than any other message that has been 
given unto us," will become a member of the Church. What is he 
waiting for? Because that same brother said: "Not yet; clean, free 
from tobacco, free from liquor, understanding that the gospel is a gospel 
for which you shall sacrifice; and then when you accept it, you shail 
receive the Holy Ghost, which shall lead you into all truth forever." 
God grant that he may be permitted to see the fruits ; God grant that 
we may exemplify in our lives our testimony of the divinity of this work, 
henceforth and forever, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



President 'Heber J. Grant announced that the congregation would

After the singing by the choir, prayer was offered by Elder Roy 
A. Welker, president of the Bear Lake stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Prayer is the soul's sincere 
desire." 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

THE ANCIENT PROPHET'S SPECIFICATION 

It is specified by one of the ancient prophets that "In the last 
days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord 
shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted 
above the hills ; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall 
come and say: Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, 
and to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, 
and we will. walk in his paths." (Micah 4:1,2) 

A FEW EVENTS SHOWING JOSEPH SMITH DIVINELY GUIDED 

Let us look at a few events in the history of the Latter-day Saints' 
Church and see if these satisfy the specifications contained in this 
ancient prediction. 

At the age of fourteen Joseph Smith became seriously interested 
in matters religious. In accordance with instructions which he found 
in holy writ, he concluded to "ask of God that giveth to all men liberally 
and upbraideth not." From that very hour, as we believe, until the 
early age of thirty-nine when he gave his life as a martyr, Joseph Smith 
was guided by Divine Providence in the establishment of the Church 
and the direction of its affairs. 

TEMPLE BUILDING 

For example, how, without divine guidance, could one so young 
and with so little chance for education have been wise enough to 
inaugurate the movement in temple-building that has aroused the in- 
terest of so many for so long a time? In less than a hundred years the 
followers of Joseph Smith have invested millions in nine different, 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 101 

splendid temples. The path these faithful followers have trodden has 
had temples constructed beside it all along the way. 

While the people after leaving New York located temporarily in 
Ohio, the inspiration of the Prophet seemed to indicate that Zion was 
to be established somewhere far away in the west. In June, 1831, he 
sent many of the elders westward on a preaching tour. The questions 
being asked by him and his associates were : "When will the wilderness 
be made to blossom as the rose? When and where will Zion be built 
in her glory, and where will the temple be located, unto which, in the 
last days, people from all nations are to come?" 

IN INDEPENDENCE 

The Prophet, Oliver Cowdery and other missionaries, met at Inde- 
pendence, Missouri about the middle of July, 1831. This land seemed 
so far west that they immediately located the city of Zion, the cenrtal 
gathering place of the Saints. Such was the intensity of the desire to 
locate a site and build a temple that under the inspiration of the spirit, 
Independence was chosen for this purpose. The lot then selected and 
dedicated is a spot on which the L. D. S. people hope, sometime, to 
erect a sacred building. By this act the people felt as if their Zion had 
been located and dedicated on the western borderline of civilization. 

The twelve hundred Church members in Missouri, in 1833, were 
being increased rapidly by immigration. By mob violence these twelve 
hundred were driven from their homes and robbed of their possessions. 

While these hardships and cruelties were severe, may not they, 
viewed in the light of more recent events, have been necessary in order 
to prepare a people strong enough and far-sighted enough to make the 
journey of a thousand miles across the desert and climb into the very 
top of the Rocky Mountains? Nothing less than years of severest 
training and discipline could prepare a people for such a task. 

The temple block in Independence had been dedicated in 1831. In 
December, 1832, through the Prophet, a direct command was given to 
"establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house 
of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a 
house of God." (D. & C. 88:119) The temple-building spinT rested 
so mightily upon the Prophet that the cornerstones of the temple in 
Kirtland were laid in July, 1833, and the building was finished and 
dedicated in March, 1836. 

While in this sacred structure there occurred rich outpourings of 
the spirit and many important heavenly manifestations, this temple was 
eventually abandoned. It did not satisfy the specifications named by 
the ancient prophet who clearly said that the temple to be built "in the 
last days," was to be established in the top of the mountains and was 
to be exalted above the hills. 

IN FAR WEST 

Those who are familiar with the history of the Church know that 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the temple-building spirit has been active in the hearts of this people 
from the beginning. Among the many sects and churches of today the 
Latter-day Saints are distinguished as builders of temples. 

On the Nation's birthday, in 1838, large numbers of church members 
participated in a Church celebration at Far West, Missouri, which in- 
cluded the laying of the foundation stones of a temple. Had this 
structure been completed the number of temples built by the Latter- 
day Saint people to date would have been ten instead of nine. 

IN ILLINOIS 

The training and preparation of this people for the work they 
were to accomplish continued to increase in severity. They were told 
in unmistakable terms they must leave the state of Missouri. Stripped 
of the accumulation of years many suffered with the cold and for the 
necessities of life. They stood facing a mid-winter exodus not knowing 
where to go. At this trying time the Prophet himself was in prison. 
Brigham Young, however, with his strong leadership came forward as 
President of the Council of Twelve and planned and carried into effect 
the exodus from Missouri to Illinois. On the 1st of May, 1839, it was 
decided to locate the headquarters of the Church at the town of Com- 
merce in the state of Illinois. A year later this name was changed to 
Nauvoo. 

.Soon the construction of dwellings was begun, and in the course 
of a comparatively short time a hamlet was transformed into a city. 

Prisons, mobs, persecutions, hunger and other hardships failed to 
dampen the temple-building ardor of the members of the Church. At 
a conference held on the 6th of April, 1841, the cornerstones of the 
Nauvoo temple were laid. On the 27th of June, 1844, while this struc- 
ture was in the process of construction, the Prophet Joseph and his 
brother Hyrum gave their lives as martyrs to the cause which, under 
divine guidance, they had instituted. Would one not naturally con- 
clude that this peculiar people would lose interest in their peculiar work 
of building temples with these great leaders slain? But new leaders 
arose and the work continued going forward as we believe under the 
direction of Divine Providence. Actual labor was resumed within two 
weeks after the slaying of the Prophet. 

There were indications of persecution on every hand when the 
capstone of the Nauvoo temple was laid on the 24th of May, 1845. 
Not until May, 1846, was the building wholly completed and ready for 
dedication. Nauvoo by this time had a population of twenty thousand. 
Could anything less than divine inspiration induce these builders to 
struggle on in the midst of poverty and persecution and thus carry out 
their ever-increasing desire to construct a temple? 

Feeble efforts were made in the fall of 1844 to bring to justice 
the murderers of the Prophet. In the fall of 1845 encouraged by the 
acquittal of the slayers of the Prophet, mobs became more and more 
bold and more and more vicious. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 103 

When the people had to decide between exodus and extermination 
by massacre, they concluded to leave the state. Is it possible that this 
people still needed a more severe, a more trying training? 

Although the exodus of the people had begun, ordinance work 
in the temple was continued. In a few months after its dedication 
"the people whose energy and substance, whose sweat and blood had 
been spent in its rearing, were driven into the wilderness or slain." 
The temple was in the possession of a mob. Fire and wind finally 
destroyed it. So complete has been its destruction that literally not one 
stone is left upon another. 

The people had dedicated a temple site in Independence, they had 
constructed a temple in Kirtland, the foundation of a third had been laid 
in Far West, and a fourth had been built in Nauvoo. Not one of 
these, however, satisfied the specifications of the scripture. The temple 
to be constructed "in the last days" is not to be located on the seashore 
nor in the valley nor on the bank of a river, but "in the top of the 
mountains," and it is to be "exalted above the hills." 

To these people who were being driven, robbed and persecuted, 
the following words of the Master gave great satisfaction: "Blessed 
are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all 
manner of evil against you falsly, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding 
glad, for great is your reward in heaven." (Matt. 5 :11, 12.) 

Perhaps no one can tell why in the wisdom of Providence, these 
severe experiences were necessary. Now the people, however, were 
thoroughly prepared. They were ready. They had their faces set like 
flint toward the west. 

THE HISTORIC JOURNEY 

While Nauvoo was less than seven years old, it now had twenty 
thousand inhabitants. These were compelled to leave their homes and 
journey far beyond the confines of civilization. It was in mid-winter, 
February 4, 1846, that this multitude began crossing the waters of the 
Mississippi. Ferries were used until the river was frozen. After that 
the crossing was made on the ice. With their sick, sleeping in tents and 
wagons, great harships were necessarily endured. "There is no parallel 
in the world's history," says Bancroft, "of this migration from Nauvoo." 
(Whitney's History of Utah, page 217.) 

"The people of Iowa have told me," said Colonel Thomas L. Kane, 
"that from morning to night they passed westward like an endless 
procession. They did not seem greatly out of heart, they said ; but 
at the top of every hill, before they disappeared they were to be seen 
looking back, like banished Moors, on their abandoned homes and far- 
seen temple and its glittering spires." (See Anderson's Brief History of 
the Church, page 82.) 

On the 14th of January, 1847, President Young announced instruc- 
tions to guide the Saints in their travels. Early preparations were made 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

to vacate Winter Quarters and depart for their unknown inheritance 
in the wilderness. 

One hundred forty-four men, able bodied, were selected to lead 
on this westward journey. Because of illness one returned to camp 
leaving the number of one hundred forty-three with three women and 
two children. They had seventy-two wagons, ninety-three horses, fifty- 
two mules, sixty-six oxen, and nineteen cows, besides seventeen dogs 
and some chickens. (See Anderson's Brief History of the Church, 
page 90.) 

This historic journey was begun April 7, 1847. All of April 
passed, May also, and still the Pioneers continued their journey onward 
across the American desert. June went by as did also nearly all of 
July, and yet they with their oxen and slowly moving teams wended 
their way westward, climbing the eastern slope of the Rocky Moun- 
tains, higher and higher, and higher, to the very place that answers 
the specifications prescribed by the Prophet anciently. Who will deny 
that such a journey made under such conditions was directed by the 
power of God ? 

THE TEMPLE IN SALT LAKE CITY 

The long and trying trip seems to have increased rather than to 
have diminished the interest of the people in temple building. 
From the day the cornerstones were laid for the Salt Lake temple 
until it was dedicated, forty years elapsed. 

The death of the great temple-builder, Brigham Young, occurred 
when the walls of the Salt Lake temple extended but twenty feet above 
the surface of the ground. The work so well begun by him was con- 
tinued during the whole administration of President John Taylor and 
the intensity of the effort seemed to increase during the administration of 
his successor, President Wilford Woodruff up to the very hour when 
it was dedicated, April 6, 1893. The capstone of the mighty struc- 
ture was laid by him in the presence of a throng that numbered forty- 
thousand within the confines of the temple block, while other thousands, 
unable to secure a place inside the walls, stood in the streets or looked 
from nearby windows and the roofs of adjoining buildings. 

THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ANCIENT PROPHET FULFILLED 

The edifice completed stands on this block. It speaks for itself. 
It is located in the top of the mountains. It is exalted above the 
hills and people from all nations have come unto it. Thus the specifica- 
tions laid down by the prophet of old are satisfied, his prophecy fulfilled. ' 

These are the days, too, in which, as Daniel says, "the God of 
heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed." That 
kingdom is located here, and in the language of Daniel, "it shall not 
be left to other people, and it shall endure forever." This is the place, 
this is the kingdom, and Jesus of Nazareth is the King. 



ELDER HUGO D. E. PETERSON 105 

ELDER HUGO D. E. PETERSON 

Former President of the Swedish Mission 

My brethren and sisters: I feel on this occasion like the young 
brother did this morning, when called so suddenly and without warning 
to speak unto you. I appreciate this opportunity that has been given 
to me to speak a few minutes about the Swedish mission, whence so 
many thousands of the blood of Israel have been gathered home to Zion. 
I appreciate the privilege that my brethren gave unto me to perform 
a mission to my native land, after having been in Zion since my youth. 
It was the most glorious time that I have ever experienced in my life. 

I will say, as President McMurrin said this morning, that we 
cannot count very many that come into the Church ; but the word has to 
.be preached as a warning, that the people may not say they have not 
been warned when the Lord shall pour out his judgments on them. 

The people in Sweden have the spirit of gathering to Zion. While 
the elders discourage them from coming out here, we cannot stop them 
from coming. Their desire is to gather with their own people. I have 
in mind a certain intelligent, well educated young lady, who embraced 
the gospel less than two years ago. She holds a prominent position 
in one of the greatest establishments in the city of Stockholm, and is 
drawing a large salary. She said, "I am going to try to go out to 
Zion." My wife discouraged her and said, "Do not go, sister. You will 
probably not get such a position there as you have now, and you might 
become discouraged." She said: "Never mind what I may get. I will 
do any honorable work that may be offered me for my support, but 
I want to go home to Zion, that I may work in the temple of the 
Lord for my dead relatives." And that is the spirit that the people 
generally are in possession of in the far north. 

I, too, can testify that we have a lot of fine missionaries in that 
mission, and especially when they get the spirit of the work. They 
want to labor early and late for this cause. I had frequently to remind 
one young man who labors in the mission office that, "You cannot do 
it all today, leave something for tomorrow." I found him at his desk 
many a night after we had held our public meeting. Another young 
man who had not learned the language of his father and mother, being 
born in this city, was sent up into the northern part of Sweden. While 
laboring in a certain 'city, a preacher advertised that he would lecture 
about the "Mormons" in Utah. Our young man had not been in 
Sweden very many months, and had not yet mastered the language; 
but he went to the church to hear what the reverend gentleman might 
have to say. After the meeting he said to the priest, "What you have 
spoken here tonight is not true. I am from Utah, was born there, and 
am therefore thoroughly cognizant of the conditions out there. I 
would like to be given a few minutes to correct what you have said." 
The gentleman replied, "We will not permit you to speak here in this 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

building." "Very well," said the young man, "I will take the op- 
portunity of speaking to the people on the street outside; I will give 
them tracts, and invite them to come to our hall, and I will there tell 
them the truth about Utah." The reverend gentleman evidently got 
frightened. He published an article in the local paper against us, and 
tried to belittle the elder who had taken him to task for telling fables 
about the Utah people and their religion, saying that the elder could 
not speak the Swedish language fluently. Our young brother wrote 
to me and said that he would like to answer the preacher's effusion, 
but, said he, "I am afraid the editor will find out that my written 
language is faultier than the language I speak." I helped him to write 
an article for the local paper, and told him he could use it if he saw fit. 
He took it to the paper, however, and the editor was liberal-minded 
enough to publish it. Shortly afterwards the minister left the city, and 
our little hall there was for some time crowded with people who wanted 
to hear our side. I have learned that where we have opposition 
it is the best advertisement we can get for our Church, as the people 
want to find out the other side, and they come to our meetings to 
investigate for themselves. In that way we have now and then the 
pleasure of baptizing a number of people. 

One thing that has rested on my mind for years is this: It was 
ninety years ago the day before yesterday that the Lord, also Moses, 
Elias and Elijah, visited the Prophet' Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery 
in the Kirtland temple, and gave unto them all the keys that were 
necessary for establishing his Church and carrying out the work for 
the salvation of man in this last dispensation. After they had re- 
ceived the keys, these words were spoken to them : 

"Beheld, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of 
Malachi — testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord come, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, 
and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse. 
Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands ; and 
by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, 
even at the doors." 

The application I wish to make is this, that we are ninety years 
nearer the culmination of the event spoken of in the revelation, namely : 
the second coming of the Lord, and that we should warn the people and 
our children, that all may be prepared to receive him. It behooves 
us as parents to look after our children, our sons and daughters, that 
the Lord has given into our care, and to teach them the principles of, 
and inculcate in their hearts a love for, the gospel. That is a duty 
resting upon us ; and I would say to the young people : Follow in the 
footsteps of your fathers and mothers, for the world has nothing to give 
you that can be compared with the joy and satisfaction we feel when 
we live in accordance with the teachings of the Church ; the joy that 
we have in the knowledge of the truth of the gospel and in the knowl- 



ELDER HUGO D. E. PETERSON 107 

I 
edge that we have prophets and apostles in our midst to lead and guide 
us aright. There is nothing else in the world that can give us that joy. 

Sometimes it happens that young people do not watch their actions, 
and they overstep the bounds of propriety, causing them to feel 
the pangs of sorrow and regret. My attention was drawn to- an 
instance or two of that kind, and when appealed to, I felt compassion 
for them, realizing that they have lived in an environment almost the 
opposite of that in which our youths are reared. On such occasions 
I have thought how fortunate are my five daughters and four sons, 
in being born here in a different atmosphere, blessed with faith in the 
gospel and from their childhood having a chance to walk in the right 
path. Our mission is to save, and I have felt a happiness beyond my 
power to express in seeing those who have made a misstep mend their 
way, making their lives conform to the teachings of the Savior. They 
have paid their tithing, attended to their meetings and done their 
duties in the Church ; and they have thus felt happy. I am satisfied 
they will not permit themselves again to be led astray. 

The Summer season is before us, brethren and sisters, when we will 
go to the canyons, the woods, the bathing and other resorts. See 
to it that our children are warned before they go out. Pray with them. 
I heard, many years ago, a good brother speak of a man whose son 
had been called to go on a mission, and how that son had spent the 
whole night with his father occupied in conversation, the father warning 
the son against making mistakes, giving him encouragement, that he 
might be able to perform an honorable mission. I believe we should 
take our boys in our arms before the time comes when we are to part 
with them, and warn them of certain things that will confront them 
when they come to a certain age, that we may come in before our 
enemies do, who whisper evil into their ears, and that we may warn 
them of things that may happen to them if they are not careful. 

I rejoice in this gospel, my brethren and sisters. I have been 
reared by honorable parents, and I have thanked the Lord hundreds of 
times on my knees that he led the elders to their door when I was 
young, so that I had an opportunity to be trained in the teachings of the 
gospel ; and I wish to continue to do good as long as the Lord gives me 
strength and permits me to live upon the earth, that I may eventually 
be saved in the kingdom of the Lord. May that be the blessing to us 
all, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right, let the consequence 
follow." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in my membership in this great 
Church, the Church of Christ. I shall never have the power to express 
fully my gratitude to the good men who left the valleys of the mountains 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and came into far distant Scandinavia and brought the gospel to my 
mother, to me and to mine. The gift of that visit is beyond earthly ex- 
pression. While Brother Peterson was speaking to us this afternoon, 
having returned from one of the Scandinavian countries, my heart was 
filled with gratitude, and with the prayer that the time may never 
come when we ishall lack the courage to go forth among the nations 
of the earth to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thousands of men 
and women in the Scandinavian countries are ready and ripened for the 
greater truth, and I pray, in behalf of the people whose blood runs 
in my veins, that ways and means may be found continually to do 
missionary work in those countries until the truly honest in heart may 
be brought to a testimony of the truth of the gospel. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE BODY 

I have rejoiced also in the proceedings of this great conference. 
I was deeply impressed yesterday by the voice of authority with which 
President Grant spoke to us about a number of important topics. I 
was happy to hear him mention to the Latter-day Saints the tremendous 
importance of caring properly for the human body. Man is an eternal 
spirit inhabiting a body of this earth, a perishable body, which some 
day we believe will be made imperishable. By means of that body, 
given by our Father in heaven, we are able to accomplish the great 
mission known as earth life. Through the body the spirit speaks, and 
through the body the experiences of earth are made the possession of 
the spirit. It is well that we give due care and consideration to the 
welfare of the body, which is the one great characteristic of this epoch 
in our eternal journey. 

A STRONG BODY PERMITS SPIRITUAL STRENGTH 

There have been times in the history of the world when the doc- 
trine has been taught that spiritual strength may best be known if the 
body is weak; and that the weaker the body the stronger may be the 
spiritual experiences of life. Latter-day Saints have no such belief. 
We believe that in a strong, healthy body the spirit may do more ef- 
fectively and efficiently the work which it is called upon to do here 
upon earth. It is a duty of Latter-day Saints to live well. We all 
agree to that. But it is important to Latter-day Saints also to live 
long upon the earth, just as long as the Lord may permit us to live. 
We take no pride in disease. We take pride only in those things which 
build us and make us strong both in body and' in spirit. 

TWO LAWS OF HEALTH 

As I have learned to understand the laws that govern our body, it 
seems that one fundamental law in preserving human bodies is the 
law of moderation. All things must be done in wisdom. No unneces- 
sary strain must be put upon the body, nor must indolence seize upon 



ELDER JOHN A. WWTSOE 109 

us. A second great law for the preservation of bodily 
health, including the needs of both mind and body, is that 
all the faculties of man must be given due and proportionate 
exercise. The mind must be used and the body must be used, neither 
to excess nor to the exclusion of the other ; otherwise, we shall not attain 
to that fulness of perfection of life on earth which we believe is the 
right of all Latter-day Saints. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM A BINDING LAW 

The Lord, as was called to our attention yesterday by President 
Grant, has given us a series of principles, laws if you choose, specific 
in their nature, which may be used safely by the Latter-day Saints for 
the preservation of physical and mental health. I refer to the Word of 
Wisdom, a great and a marvelous document, given us for our good, 
itself a witness that in the economy of the Lord the care of the body 
is very important, not to be neglected or forgotten. I know that many 
people believe that the Word of Wisdom is not a binding law upon us. 
To that view, I can only answer that yesterday I heard the prophet of 
God — I believe and know him to be a prophet of God — say to the 
Latter-day Saints that it was their duty to obey the Word of Wisdom. 
That ought to be sufficient for all Latter-day Saints. But, we find that 
from the very beginning, the Word of Wisdom has been held to be 
a binding law upon the Latter-day Saints. The Patriarch Hyrum 
Smith, brother of the Prophet, in a sermon which has been preserved 
and reproduced a number of times, warned the people of that day, about 
1843, against following any elder of the Church who declared that 
the Word of Wisdom was not binding upon the Latter-day Saints. 
Brigham Young, the great successor of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
upon many occasions urged the Latter-day Saints to obey the Word of 
Wisdom; and at least on one occasion said definitely that the Spirit 
had directed him to tell the Latter-day Saints to obey the Word of 
Wisdom. If I read the revelation on the Word of Wisdom correctly, 
I find that it says that the Word of Wisdom shows "forth the order 
and will of God in the temporal salvation" of his people. Whatever 
is the will of God appears to me to be equivalent to a commandment. 

THE WARNINGS OF THE WORD OF WISDOM 

The Word of Wisdom contains certain very important warnings. 
It declares that alcohol, tobacco, tea and coffee are not good for the 
body. The revelation says "hot drinks," but before the revelation was a 
year old, "hot drinks" were defined to include tea and coffee. Those 
who read the revelation intelligently understand that it has reference 
to all drugs or substances that act upon the human body to produce a 
constant desire for them. All habit-forming substances are included. 
Perhaps right here is one reason why we quibble about the meaning of 
the Word of Wisdom. When a taste is begotten, a habit is established, 
or when our appetites are concerned, almost every one of us is in- 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

clined to quibble just a little so that we may satisfy that appetite. The 
fact that the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee 
and similar substances as injurious to the body and handicaps in the 
journey of life, is an evidence of the divine inspiration of the latter-day 
prophet, for the physiological value of these substances was not known 
in that early day. Only after the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith did 
the world of science establish the fact that these substances act in- 
juriously upon the human organism. 

WHAT TO EAT 

The Lord seldom says "thou shalt not" without declaring also 
what we shall do. Therefore, the Lord prescribed in this revelation 
the foods that man may eat safely : meat in moderation, grain, vege- 
tables "in the season thereof," and fruits "in the season thereof." 
Perhaps, were we more careful to obey the part of the Word of Wisdom 
that deals with the "do's" it might be easier to obey the "don't's," and 
thereby be able more easily to conquer our appetites for the forbidden 
things. The more completely the body is able to function as intended 
by nature, the better control man has over himself and less desire he has 
for stimulants and for all things injurious. 

MODERN KNOWLEDGE CONFORMS TO THE WORD OF WISDOM 

It is probably common knowledge to the Latter-day Saints that 
during the last fifteen to twenty years, the science of nutrition, the 
science of eating, has been developed greatly by those who make re- 
searches into this branch of knowledge. The old learning has been laid 
aside ; and some very remarkable discoveries have enabled a new science 
of nutrition to be built up which is becoming very generally understood. 
That new science of nutrition is built largely upon the doctrine that 
human beings must use meat in moderation, must use the grains as 
nature provided them, that vegetables must be eaten freely in the season 
thereof, which often means as they come from mother earth ; that 
fruits must be eaten in larger abundance than before — all practical ap- 
plications of the Word of Wisdom, given in 1833, long before the 
science of nutrition or of physiological chemistry had been developed. 

One of the teachers in the summer school of the Utah Agricultural 
College, during the last two years, was Dr. E. V. McCullom, a leader 
in this field, who has done outstanding work in the domain of modern 
nutrition. On the last day of the Summer term, Dr. McCullom devoted 
a part of his closing lecture to a discussion of the fact that the "Mormon" 
Word of Wisdom coincided very well, indeed almost perfectly, with the 
doctrine which he had been elaborating in detail to his students through- 
out the preceding six weeks. It brought gratitude to my heart, when 
my children and some of my friends reported that this man bore such 
a testimony to the authoritative teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 111 

WE SHOULD USE ALL KNOWLEDGE 

What we eat is of tremendous importance. We possess not only 
wisdom of men, but also wisdom from heaven, all of which we should 
use for our welfare. We should be anxious to secure and use all learn- 
ing that may yet be developed. It should be our ideal to make and 
keep our bodies just as perfect as possible ; that our lives may be 
extended as long as possible; so that we may accomplish as much as 
may be possible during our earth careers. 

AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT FOODS 

Last November, when I was in Washington, I had the oppor- 
tunity to look into the new nutrition of which the (Prophet spoke a 
long time ago. I went to Baltimore and into the laboratory main- 
tained by one of the great foundations in this country. There, those 
in charge, to show the thorough going effect of food on the body, 
took two rats, one fed improper food, the other, food conforming to our 
new knowledge, both classes of foods in common use. The rats were 
chloroformed before our eyes, and opened, and their bones treated with 
a stain, placed under the microscope. The bony tissue of the rat which 
had been fed correctly was normally developed; while the tissue of 
the rat which had been fed improperly was imperfectly developed and 
diseased. This is but one of the hundreds of illustrations that might be 
used to verify the truth of the Word of Wisdom. 

CONCLUSION 

I have taken the liberty of offering these reflections upon the very 
authoritative and emphatic teaching of our President yesterday ; and 
to call your attention, not in detail, for this is not a scientific lecture, 
to the importance of our obeying in detail all of the Word of Wisdom. 
We must refrain from the things forbidden; but we must also obey 
the teachings with respect to that which we should do. Already it has 
become evident that one of the great revelations given to man for his 
good is the Word of Wisdom, and also that it is one of the great 
evidences of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph. 

May God bless us and be with us. May we fully understand the 
greatness and the grandeur and the mighty possibilities of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, endless in their nature and for our good, I pray in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN S. HANSEN 

Former President of the Danish Mission 

My brethren and sisters: I feel very weak and embarrassed in 
standing before you this afternoon; but as I have been called upon 
to say a few words about the work in Denmark, I will do so. 

I stand before you and look over these many faces with a feeling 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of fear, but also with happiness — fear that I may not be able to 
talk to you so that you can understand what I say. But when I 
think of all these many people who are here 1 today and of the same 
faith that I am, belonging to the same Church, believing the same 
doctrines that I have been taught and believe in, and have been 
trying to teach to others, then, a feeling of happiness goes through 
me; and I ask the Lord to be with me during the few minutes I 
stand before you that I may be able to give an account of myself. 

I came home three weeks ago today from my mission in Den- 
mark, where I have labored three years, and have enjoyed my work. 
It was my second mission to Denmark. I was there in 1912 to 1914, 
and as I was twenty years old when I emigrated, and at that time 
could not speak a word of English, you will understand that I am 
better able now to speak Danish than English. I hope that you will 
be able to understand me, although in the last three years I have 
been preaching and talking mainly in my native tongue. 

Denmark is a little country belonging to the Scandinavian 
group. Its population is a little more than three million people. 
It is a good country, and the people are a good people, and it is a 
pleasure to labor among them. We have had a number of good 
brethren from Zion to help out in our, missionary work during the 
last three years. When I arrived, conditions were different from 
what they are now. A long period had elapsed; in which very few 
elders from Zion had been laboring in that country, and there were 
only six elders there when I arrived. Most of the branches were 
disorganized. When I left, there were twenty-five missionaries in 
the field doing good work, and the branches were fully organized. 
Most of the elders that were sent to that country while I was there 
were young men unable to speak the language, and it took a great 
deal of work with them to help them learn the language and place 
them so that they could be of use while learning it. But I must say 
that the great majority of them have been very diligent and have 
learned the language quickly, and have been able to do a good work, 
;:nd we have seen good results from our labors, many having joined 
the Church during this time. The prospects are good for the 
future. I 

I realize that I am speaking to people who represent the Church 
from the different wards and stakes. The Danish as well as the 
other missions needs missionaries, men of liberal experience in life, 
and with the language that they learn there they will be able to do 
a great work. There are many people in that land who are of the 
biood of Israel, and I feel sure many will embrace the gospel in the 
near future. But the gospel must be brought to them, and it must 
be preached to them in, a language and in a way they can under- 
stand, because they are surrounded with so many different in- 
fluences, all trying to work with them and upon them. 



ELDER JOHN S. HANSEN 113 

Denmark has complete, religious liberty. Anyone can advocate 
or preach anything that he desires to preach. They had there rep- 
resentatives from India preaching Buddhism and other "isms." 
Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, International Bible Students, 
Seventh Day Adventists, and all these different sects, are preaching 
their doctrines, and many people do not know what to believe, and 
they come to the conclusion that it is better to leave it all alone, 
"Mormonism" included. And we cannot blame them. The way to 
teach them is to present the truth in such a way that it will reach 
their hearts and make an impression upon their souls. In order to 
do that, we must understand the condition of the people and the 
teachings they have been taught and have received from different 
sources. ' 

A number of the sects to which I have referred do not believe, 
in the literal resurrection of Christ. They do not believe in the 
resurrection of the body, and a literal resurrection is one of our 
testimonies to the people. We have been trying to confine our 
remarks to bearing testimony to the truth of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ as it has been revealed to us in these latter days, telling 
them of the true and living God, a personal God, our Father in 
heaven, who has a body, and who can show himself, and can talk 
to us and be with us. Also of his Son Jesus Christ, that, he is 
literally resurrected with the body in which he walked and talked 
while upon the earth. Sometimes in our meetings, when we have 
borne testimony to these truths as we understand them, people 
have come to us and said : "These are things that we used to 
believe in when we were children, but now we do not know what 
to think, because our ministers and all these other advocates of 
religion have confused our minds upon the question as to whether 
or not man will be literally resurrected.'' 

Ministers of the state church of Denmark have come forward 
with the teaching that the resurrection of Christ was a spiritual 
resurrection, and that it was a vision the apostles saw when they 
met him and talked to him after his resurrection, and also that our 
resurrection will be a spiritual resurrection. If we understand the 
people and preach the truth to them, we will find that the truth will 
appeal to them in many ways, and it will make an impression upon 
them. We have found that the best way of succeeding and getting 
access to the hearts of the people is by talking to them from the 
point of view that they now have, in order that they may understand 
us better than if we were to talk over their heads. I find that little 
children understand the teachings of our Church with reference to 
God much better than the grown people. In our Sunday school 
classes we can explain to little children the personality of God, 
and it seeims natural to them. The people say to us, "When we were 
.children we believed in such a God. When our fathers and mothers 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

i 
talked to us about God, we pictured him as a personal God, some- 
what like our earthly father. It was when we. grew older that our 
views became confused with these different ideas that -are now in 
the world." What we have to do is to bring the people back to the 
faith of their childhood, for there is not a child but has that im- 
pression and that feeling concerning God, and understanding of 
him when they first hear him spoken of by their parents. 

When I went to school in that country I was taught the state 
religion, but my feelings and understanding of God were of a per- 
sonal God; and when I was eleven years old and joined the "Mor- 
mon" Church, I kept that view and that idea of God, which I think 
is true. We have been trying to teach these doctrines to the people. 

Yesterday was Easter. Today is also a holiday in those old 
countries, being a day appointed for Church services where they 
celebrate the resurrection of Christ. It is strange to think that these 
people will congregate and talk about the great and glorious truth 
of Christ's having risen from the dead, and not believe that it was 
a literal resurrection. But when they read the gospel of St. John 
about Christ coming out of the grave, and the grave being empty, 
they explain it by saying it was a spiritual resurrection. When we 
hold our Easter services, we bear witness to the people of the truth 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ ; that he arose from the dead ; that he 
did take the body with him out of the grave which was laid in the 
grave ; that he showed himself to his disciples ; showed them the 
marks in his hands and in his feet, and that he said to them, "It 
is I, myself : handle me and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as 
ye see me have." We believe also, and have taught it to the people, 
that all those who shall come forth in the first resurrection shall 
come forth with the bodies which they received here upon the earth, 
glorified and free from evil, and free from the results of sin, which, 
through the gospel of Christ, we will be able to efface. That is 
why the teachings referred to by Elder Widtsoe are natural to us. 
They fit this body which we possess and which. we have received 
as a gift from God for our spirit to work with eternally. This body 
is going to be ours throughout eternity. We must take care of it, 
because if we do so and use it properly, it will be so much) the 
better for us in the resurrection. 

I believe that the people in the world are able to accept the 
principles of the gospel in a great measure, if they are presented to 
them in a way that they can understand and grasp. I have found 
many times, and I hope I will not offend anyone by saying it, that 
our missionaries are a little too quick to judge people, or judge their 
capacity to understand, and they judge them from their own point 
of view, instead of the point of view of the people. If it is the truth 
that we bring tq the people, if it is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
if the Lord intends us to bring it to them, then it is our duty to 



ELDER JOHN S. HANSEN 115 

work diligently in that service, and not to give up because things 
seem to be difficult, or because people do not seem to understand. 
Maybe the difficulty is that we do not present it in a way that they 
can understand it, and if that is the case, then let us try to find a 
way to reach their hearts and their souls, and present it so they can 
grasp it and understand it. If we cannot do it one way, possibly 
we can do it in another. I have never turned away angrily from 
anybody who could not understand me, or who ridiculed my views. 
But I have always said, "We will meet again ; we will talk it over 
again ; maybe we will be able to get closer together on this point." 

It is a mistake, as some have done occasionally, to say to the 
person who will not understand, or cannot understand, "You are 
cursed. I have borne my testimony to you and you do not receive 
it, consequently you are cursed.'' I have always instructed the 
missionaries not to do that, and have told them that we are in the 
world to bless and save the world and not to condemn it. We have 
been trying to preach and teach salvation and not condemnation, 
and trying to explain to the people that the gospel is in the world 
to build up and save the people. In preaching the gospel of salva- 
tion, we find that we are greatly blessed and the Lord is with us. 
Our converts have not been so many in numbers, but we have been 
able to bring into the Church a number of good, honest souls while 
I have been in Denmark during the past three years. In addition, 
we have been able to find and get interested in the work of the 
Church a number of people who were practically dead ; who for 
years have not been visited by the missionaries, and who had 
forgotten that they were members of the Church ; but who have 
come back again to the Church and have taken up the work again. 
They have commenced again to pay their tithing, attend their meet- 
ings, and labor in the organizations; and we look upon this as 
being as great a work as the bringing of new converts into the fold. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel that the time is limited, as there 
are many others of our brethren from whom you wish to hear. But 
I wish, before I sit clown, being the first time I have had the priv- 
ilege to stand in this place, to bear to you my testimony of the truth 
of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I love it. I have tried to do 
my duty as far as I have been able to see it, and as far as my busi- 
ness has allowed me to fulfil it. I pray the Lord to be with me in 
the future, that I may continue in this good work, and that we may 
all continue to do the Lord's will; and may God help us, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ALBERT R. PETERSON 

Former President of fixe Norwegian Mission 
This is one of the great honors that has been bestowed upon me. 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

It is the first time in my life that I have occupied this stand, and I feel 
it a great honor and privilege to bear my. testimony to you this after- 
noon to the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ which has been restored. 
I am thankful that I have had the privilege of raising a warning 
voice to the nations, and in the land of Norway, to the people in the 
far north, declaring unto them that the Lord has restored the gospel 
in these the latter days. 

I was indeed pleased when I heard the President speak regarding 
the Word of Wisdom, for I found it very necessary when I went into 
the mission field to preach this glorious principle to the world. It 
is a great responsibility which rests upon us as teachers and leaders 
in Israel. As I traveled around in the branches in Norway I saw 
fathers and mothers with their children smoking cigarettes ; and I 
saw in these children the future fathers and mothers ; and I thought, 
what will be the end if they continue to poison and contaminate their 
souls with this dreadful weed? I found a condition that made my heart 
ache ! Out of the many honest, true Latter-day Saints, in the mission 
I found only very few who are keeping the Word of Wisdom. Is it 
not necessary that we as elders in Israel, when we go into the world, 
set worthy examples for these boys and girls, honest and true, living in 
those countries who do not, perhaps, understand the great necessity 
of keeping the Word of Wisdom as we do? Is it not necessary that we 
lift the voice of warning to them against that which will eventually 
destroy them if they continue its use? 

I did not see this condition in Norway alone, but also in other 
European countries that I visited — boys and girls contaminating their 
souls with these things. And I feel to rejoice, and thank my Father 
in heaven, that my parents had the courage to join the Church and 
accept these great principles in Denmark many years ago, and emigrate 
to this country. As I traveled among my relatives, who have never 
understood the gospel of Jesus Christ, and saw them, with trembling 
hands, pouring alcohol into the coffee, I thought then, O how glorious 
it is that the elders in this day are sent out into the world to teach us 
the Word of Wisdom, thus to make us better men and women, and make 
us stronger physically and spiritually, that we may be able to carry 
the burdens of the day. 

I rejoice in the privilege of being a member of this great Church, 
which has been organized and is costing some of the best blood on earth 
to establish. We all realize that when the great God of heaven wishes to 
do anything of importance, it must cost the blood of many good men 
and women. 

When I was set apart as the president of the Norwegian mission, 
I was told that I was denied a vise to Norway, and I felt very sorry, 
and also felt it would perhaps be impossible for me to enter that land. 
When I reached Chicago, I received permission to enter Norway and to 
remain there for two weeks. When I arrived, I went to the police station 



ELDER ALBERT R. PETERSON 117 

where I was to report ,and asked for permission to remain, which 
permission was denied me. I went again the next day with the same 
result. The officials said they must take the request to higher authority. 
I was preparing to go the next day, and while putting on my coat and 
hat, a little girl was in one of the rooms pleading with God that we 
might be permitted to remain. I felt within my soul that we would 
not be permitted to remain. She knew where to go. She had con- 
fidence in the Lord. She had been taught to pray ; and even as the 
boy prophet went into the woods to pray and had confidence that God 
would hear and answer his prayer, this little girl also prayed to God. 
She came to me and said, "Papa, I know we are going to remain, 
for the Lord has answered my prayer." I thought then, O, if we only 
had the confidence and the courage of little children ! And I thought, 
too, is it any wonder that the Lord placed before his disciples a little 
child and said, "Unless ye become as a little child ye cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God." 

It was mentioned here yesterday by President Ivins that we are not 
considered Christians, that we are heathens, in Norway. That is a fact 
They consider us heathens and not as Christians, and I believe that 
was the only excuse they had whereby they could keep us from entering 
Norway. It is a free country, free for the Christian religion, but it is 
not free for those who are not Christians ; in their opinion we are not 
Christians, therefore they have been using an old law, sixty-five years 
old, to keep us out of Norway. We do not have any persecution 
from the people on the whole, but we do meet with persecution from 
those in authority — the government officials and the city officials. One 
young elder was driven from four cities. He said, "O, I will be glad 
when I can find a place that I can call home for at least two or three 
nights." The ministers write articles occasionally in the papers against 
us; but they do not seem to do us a great deal of harm. I remember that 
one of the great ministers there said, "I am not going to let down the bars 
now, and let those swine in here!" It was not long after he made this 
remark until the Lord saw fit to call him away. Men cannot stop the 
work of the Lord until he may see fit to stop it himself. 

There are many honest souls in Norway who are waiting to hear 
the gospel. The doors have been practically closed against our mis- 
sionaries and our elders, and we have had a hard time getting in, but 
there are a few there now and I want to say to the fathers and mothers 
of those boys, that your boys who have been sent to Norway are honest, 
true workers in Israel, clean and pure. 

One little item I wish to make mention of is this: Be sure, 
fathers and mothers that you teach your boys to pray. O how humiliat- 
ing it was to one young man when he came into the mission field, and I 
asked him to pray. He said : "I have never uttered a prayer in my life." 
Who was to blame ? Let us teach our children to pray, to live the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. There is not anything that will bring us such great 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

blessings as living the gospel. It will make us better men and women. 
I know the gospel is true. I have felt the nearness of God 
in far-off Norway, away up in the Narvik branch, the farthest 
north of any branch in the Church. Nestled in those snow-capped 
mountains, we find a little branch of honest, true Lattei -day Saints who 
are living the gospel. I am glad that I had the privilege of bearing 
my testimony and warning them, for it is the only hope of the nations 
today — that is, the gospel of Jesus Christ. May we know and realize 
who we are; that we are the chosen people of God; that we have 
been called and endowed with the holy Priesthood of God ; and that 
we may always stand firm and in holy places, and be ready at all 
times to go into the world to warn the nations, and to let them know 
that God has spoken in these the latter days, and that his great work 
is rolling on. May the Lord help us to be true and firm to these 
principles, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In speaking yesterday of the missionary work that is being done 
throughout the world, although I had a note about it on a piece of 
paper in front of me, I forgot to mention what I consider one of the 
greatest of all the missions we have, namely, the one on the Temple 
Block, presided over by Elders Levi Edgar Young, Benjamin Goddard, 
and Axel A. Madsen, aided by a number of faithful workers. 

The work which they are doing in allaying prejudice and in 
making the acquaintance of influential people, I feel is among the very 
finest missionary labors performed in any of our missions. 

The congregation sang, "Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing." 
Prayer was offered by Elder George S. Romney, president of 
the Fremont stake. 

The conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., April 6. 

In the evening there was a general priesthood meeting, which was 
the largest priesthood assembly ever held in the Church, there being 
3,207 people present. The ground floor was comfortably filled and there 
were many in the galleries, opened for the first time at a priesthood 



THIRD DAY 
MORNING SESSION 

On Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock, April 6, 1926, with President 
Heber J. Grant presiding, the conference continued in the great 
Tabernacle. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come let us anew our journey 
pursue." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Milton H. Welling, president of the 
Bear River stake. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Jesus once of humble birth." 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

The last congregational hymn that we sang brought to my mind 
great events in the life of our Redeemer and events dealing with the 
last week of his ministry when, after having partaken of the usual 
passover feast and before his departure for the Garden of Gethsemane, 
he instituted the Sacrament, which we call the Lord's Supper. "Jesus 
took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, 
and said, Take, eat; this is my body." (Matthew 26:26.) And after 
each disciple had partaken of this bread, "He took the cup, and gave 
thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it ; For this is my 
blood." (Matthew 26 :27, 28.) And he told them that as often as they 
should meet together they should do this in remembrance of him. Our 
Savior left no Church ritual, nor did he outline in detail the proceedings 
that his followers should adopt for their meetings. He gave them no 
sermon and no form of worship distinctive from that which they had 
been accustomed to in the synagogues ; but he did leave that one def- 
inite thought: that as often as they should meet together they should 
partake of the bread and wine in remembrance of his body and blood 
and of his death and sufferings, and this they should do until he should 
come again. 

I wonder why it is that, with such definite instructions from our 
Lord and Master the day before he was crucified, these words have 
not so sunk into the hearts of Latter-day Saints that they should feel 
afraid to neglect the Sacramental service. I believe it is one of the 
most solemn occasions in the Church, the time when a Latter-day Saint 
sits in silence in a place of worship and partakes of the Sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper. 

It has been my privilege to visit several of the stakes of Zion 
recently and to see the marvelous development of the Priesthood work 
of the Church. I have listened to powerful testimonies of men and 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

women concerning the authority of the holy Priesthood and the gifts and 
blessings that have come to those who hold it, through obedience to the 
gospel. I have listened to some wonderful singing by quorums of the 
Priesthood and other organizations — young men and boys. It has made 
me happy because I believe that in song we may worship the Lord, for 
he has said that the song of the righteous is a prayer unto him, and he 
will answer with blessings upon our heads. 

In one stake of Zion the presidency of the stake announced that they 
had decided to call upon every active and useful member holding 
the Melchizedek Priesthood to aid the bishoprics; each one of these 
persons to have assigned to him some neglectful or indifferent boy, 
over whom he will watch and teach the gospel and try to implant in 
his heart the love of the work of the Lord and a deeper appreciation 
for the blessings and opportunities that come to him. And he will be 
taken care of by this older and more experienced man until the boy can 
practically walk alone. 

What a wonderful possibility this thought opens to our minds. Take 
into consideration those who hold presiding positions in the stake alone 
and consider the bishoprics alone. If each of these brethren would take 
upon himself to be a brother's keeper to one of these indifferent boys 
for a year and see that these boys are trained and directed in the right 
manner, think of the good that would result. There are in the stakes 
of Zion 282 brethren holding the office of presidency ; there are 94 
stake clerks ; there are 1 ,400 high councilors and alternates ; 200 patri- 
archs ; in the neighborhood of 1,500 holding offices as presidencies of 
councils of seventies ; 500 quorums of elders, each quorum presided 
over by three men, making 1,500 men; then there are nearly 3,000 
bishops and counselors. If each of these brethren made it his duty to take, 
charge of one wayward or neglectful boy, thousands of young men 
would be on the road to improved conditions and would be diverted 
from paths of waywardness and neglect to a better understanding and 
appreciation of the gospel. 

Tithing matters have been touched by our President, and in- 
cidentally by two or three other speakers. We have recently had a 
tithing settlement, and the tithes of the Church have materially in- 
creased. Crops in most districts have been bountiful, and some of our 
brethren have been blessed with larger incomes, as a result of the high 
prices obtaining for certain products. The Lord has blessed this land, 
and he has done so because it is occupied by his people. As we pay our 
tithes and offerings gladly and willingly, as a part of our service to the 
Lord, so will he bless this land. What was once a barren waste is now, 
a marvel to those who travel through this country. 

No doubt, during this tithing settlement that has recently passed, 
many of our brethren and sisters went happily and gladly to their 
bishoprics, who are common judges in Israel, and were pleased to tell 
these good men that they had fully observed the law of tithing. Every 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 121 

person is happy when he fulfils the law of the gospel. Others, no 
doubt, went to the tithing settlement feeling more or less conscience- 
stricken, and made resolves for the future, that they would more dili- 
gently observe this important law and would try to pay their tithes and 
offerings in the season thereof. 

I appeal to my brethren and sisters not to leave the settlement of 
their tithing until the end of the year. I firmly believe in the idea 
of paying tithing each month. Every Latter-day Saint who earns 
something, whether he be old or young, rich or poor, should sit down 
with his conscience on or about the last day of the month and find 
out what the Lord has given him, and tithe it there and then. So 
many of our people get into the habit of leaving the payment of tithing 
until the end of the year, feeling that the next month they will be 
better off. The end of the year creeps along, settlement comes, and then 
instead of seeing how much we owe the Lord and paying it gladly, there 
is a tendency to see how little we can get off with and ease our con- 
sciences. 

Tithing is a fundamental principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
To those who observe it fully there comes a deeper love of the gospel. 
It is just as essential to our growth and development in this Church as 
are repentance, baptism, or any other fundamental laws. It will develop 
in men and women a deeper devotion to the truth and greater willing- 
ness to serve their fellowmen; and, above all, it will increase their 
testimony of the gospel. 

I picked up an old Journal of Discourses a few days ago. It was 
forty years old. I opened it casually and found there a very fine dis- 
course given in Provo, in 1855, by Brother Franklin D. Richards, in 
which he urged obedience to the principle of tithing. He said : "In the 
receipt which the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to me in Nauvoo, signed 
by himself and the tithing clerk, he stated that having paid my tithing 
in full to date, I was entitled to the benefits of the baptismal font, which 
had just been dedicated in the basement of the temple." So, evidently 
in those days it was understood that those who paid their tithing in 
full had the privilege of the House of the Lord. Twenty years later 
President Joseph F. Smith, from this very pulpit, spoke these words : 

"By the principle of tithing the loyalty of the people of this Church shall 
be put to the test. By this principle it shall be known who is for the kingdom 
of God and who is against it. By this principle it shall be seen whose hearts 
are set on doing the will of God and keeping his commandments, thereby sancti- 
fying the land of Zion unto God ; and who are opposed to this principle and have 
cut themselves off from the blessings of Zion. There is a great deal of im- 
portance connected with this principle, for by it it shall be known whether we are 
faithful or unfaithful. In this respect it is as essential as faith in God, as re- 
pentance of sin, as baptism for the remission of sin, or as the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost." 

After all, we are creatures of habits. The habits formed in our 
childhood stay with us throughout life. Every boy and girl, for this 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

reason, should be taught the principle of tithing and should be urged 
to tithe all that comes to them, and fathers and mothers should see 
that their children have something to tithe. At one time I was out with 
Elder Stephen L. Richards, at a stake conference, and he expressed the 
thought that every member of the Church should see if the Lord has 
given him something, and if so, should tithe it in the month in which it 
was received. He recommended that fathers and mothers encourage 
boys and girls to tithe even their spending money, not because it has 
not already been tithed, but to develop the habit of paying tithes and 
offerings as children, so that when these children become grown the 
habit will have been formed. 

I am glad that I am a Latter-day Saint, thankful to my heavenly 
Father that I heard the gospel, thankful to be associated with my 
brethren and sisters in the work of the Lord. I have been blessed with 
a testimony that this is God's work ; that it is the power of God unto 
salvation ; that the holy Priesthood is the agency by which he operates 
in this Church through those who have received the gospel ; and I pray 
that the Spirit of the Lord and the blessings of the gospel may be upon 
all of us, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES S. HYDE 

Recently returned President of the Netherlands Mission 

I am not entirely surprised, my brethren and sisters, at being 
called to this position, as a number of other returned mission presi- 
dents have already spoken. But notwithstanding the sense of re- 
sponsibility which I feel in speaking here this morning, I am very 
pleased to be able to report to you the labors which have been 
performed in the Netherlands mission, and to tell you something of 
that wonderful little country. 

The country of Holland is about one fifth the size of the state of 
Utah, according to area, and has a population of between seven and 
a half and eight millions of people. The Church membership in 
Holland at the end of 1925 was 3270 souls. There were 63 mission- 
aries laboring in that land at the end of the year, in four conferences 
and 18 organized branches. During the year they performed a most 
remarkable work, and while we had only 93 baptisms, they dis- 
tributed more than 400,000 tracts, held 31,000 gospel conversations, 
and visited the homes of 6,513 people on re-visits. While this may 
not be a very large number compared with other missions, I feel 
that is is a remarkable work to be accomplished under the con- 
ditions which prevail in that land. I am very happy to report that 
the elders are united; that they sense the responsibility of mission- 
ary service, and are seeking to bear witness of the divinity of this 
latter-day work whenever occasion presents itself. 

I believe some of the best times I have spent in my life have 



ELDER CHARLES S. HYDE 123 

been in the missionary service, and especially on occasions where 
ordinances of the gospel have been performed. It has been my 
privilege to attend some very remarkable baptismal services, not 
only in Holland but in Belgium, which at one time was a part of 
the Netherlands mission ; also in Switzerland, where I had the 
pleasure of attending conferences. I remember a very impressive 
baptismal service which was held in Lake Geneva during one of 
the sessions of the Lausanne conference, where a number of people 
were baptized in the lake upon a beautiful Sabbath morning, to 
begin the sessions of that wonderful conference. But! I believe the 
most remarkable baptismal service that I have yet been privileged to 
attend was one held in the month of February, 1924, in the city of 
Liege, at the time of the official organization of the French mission. 
There "were a number of candidates prepared for baptism and the 
service was scheduled to be held at ten o'clock on Sunday morning. 
It was a wintry day and snowing, cold and uninviting, and as we 
went to the baptismal place in the river I felt in my heart that it 
was a most uninviting day. Among others who were present were 
the elders of that conference, visiting brethren, myself, and the 
newly appointed president of the Netherlands mission, also Presi- 
dent David O. McKay. As the elder who was to baptize descended 
into the water with his candidate, in the heavens a ray of light 
shone through, the clouds separated, it ceased snowing, and there 
just upon the spot where the elder stood with his candidate, a ray 
of light descended and shone upon those who were in the water, 
and remained there until all the candidates were baptized, and as 
the last person went up out of the water, that ray of light disap- 
peared, and it began to snow again. To me it was a most remark- 
able manifestation of the divine approval of God upon that wonder- 
ful ceremony of baptism which was being performed by his 
authorized servants in the river. My heart was thrilled as I felt 
that God was smiling his approval upon that which was being 
done, and sanctifying to the people the ordinance which they were 
taking upon themselves, to keep his commandments and to walk 
in his ways. , 

The elders who are laboring in that mission have received of 
the Spirit. They are united, and they are seeking to do that which 
is required of them. If I had received no other witness throughout 
my missionary work than the attitude of the elders, it would have 
been a remarkable manifestation. The fact that these young men 
are cleansed and purified, sanctified to the work of the Lord, is 
a most remarkable thing. I have had them come into my office 
with their disappointments in seeking to learn that language and 
to accustom themselves to the habits of the people, and they have 
poured out their souls to me in tears, expressing their feeling of 
inability to do the work which they had been called to do, of their 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

unpreparedness, being disappointed in that they had not fulfilled 
every responsibility at home which they had been privileged to do 
'had they been so inclined. But after speaking with them, and 
praying with them, and counseling them, they felt to go onward 
and receive the spirit of the work. 

Just before leaving to come home one of our new elders came 
into the office, and in tears poured out to me his soul ; told me of 
his life and all that he had done, and his desire to do right, but 
with the feeling of inability to do everything that missionary work 
imposed upon him. After counseling with him and having prayers 
with him in my office, he went out feeling encouraged, and the day 
I left I received a letter from him, and at the top of it he had 
written these words : "There is sunshine in my soul today." That 
spirit is the spirit which characterizes their work — sunshine in 
the soul, and a desire to preach repentance and to bear witness of 
the divinity of this gospel. We have sought to impress them with 
the fact that the Lord has made wonderful promises to his servants 
in the missionary field, that he would be with them and go before 
them, and prepare the way, that they might be able to accomplish 
that work. • , 

I desire toj call attention to his promise as made known in the 
84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and we have relied 
upon this promise, and have seen the truthfulness of it. We have 
realized that the Lord really brings to pass his promises to those 
who seek to obey him. In speaking to the missionaries who had 
returned from the Eastern States in the year 1832, he made known 
these words: 

"Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, 
and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. 

"And who receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. 
I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your 
hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up. 

"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me ; and, the same will feed you and clothe 
you, and give you money. 

"And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise 
lose, his reward. 

"And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple ; by this ye may 
know my disciples." 

We have tested this word and found it to be true, for we have 
found in that land disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, men and 
women who have been and are willing to feed the elders and to 
clothe them and to give them money, and rejoice in this opportunity. 
In all of the organized branches of the Church in that mission 
where members of the Church reside the elders are fed, and in many 
instances clothed and given money by members of the Church; and 
last year, by practicing economy, we were able to reduce the 
average expense per missionary in the mission from $32.00 to $27.17; 



ELDER CHARLES S. HYDE 125 

with this added testimony that the elders who expended the least 
amount of money in the missionary services were doing the best 
work and producing the most results, for they were relying upon 
the Saints, partaking of their hospitality, leaving their blessings, 
and the Saints were in nowise losing their reward. And we were 
able to determine the disciples of Christ from those who were not 
bis disciples. Truly the Lord is going before his servants, is on 
their right hand and on their left hand, and is bearing them up, 
and his angels are round about them, and they are enjoying an 
influence that will sanctify their souls, if they continue faithful in 
the work. 

I believe I realize to a certain extent the feeling experienced 
by some of the Seventies in the time of Christ when they returned 
trom their missions, and with joy reported that even the evil 
spirits had been subjected unto them by the name of Christ. I 
have also had a similar experience, when even the evil spirits have 
been subject unto us through the name of Christ. We had one in 
the mission field afflicted with an evil spirit, and his body tormented 
and tortured by the possession of that evil spirit. I came into the 
room upon one occasion, and the evil spirit sprang upon me and 
seized me by the throat with a grip of iron, shutting off even my 
ability to speak and almost to breathe, while the elders stood round 
about, also my wife with a feeling of fear in her heart that the evil 
spirit would overcome me. He shouted with a voice that was most 
terrific. He declared himself to be the devil. "My name is Satan," 
he declared, "and I have more authority than you." And again 
tightening his grip upon my throat he declared, "I have more 
authority than you." I could not speak, but I looked the person in 
the eye, and releasing his grip and falling upon the bed, that same 
voice declared, "No, I have not more authority," and he hid his face 
in the pillow and was subject to the power of the Priesthood. 
Elder Kooyman, who was conference president, anointed him with 
oil, and with other elders I laid my hands upon him, and I began 
to confirm the anointing with oil. When I reached the point in 
prayer, that "in the name of Jesus Christ," I was going to say, "we 
rebuke the spirit," he sprang from the bed, and pleaded : "Do not 
use that name, do not use that name." We placed him upon the 
bed, and in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuked that spirit and 
commanded it to depart from him, and the person who was af- 
flicted fell limp upon the bed and slept for hours, the first peaceful 
sleep he had enjoyed for several days. One of the greatest wit- 
nesses that have come into my life was upon this occasion. 

I had been taught by my father and mother that there is power 
in the Priesthood. I had been taught it in the Sunday school and 
in the elders' quorum. I doubted it not, I felt that there was power 
in that Priesthood, but this was the first occasion which had come 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

into my life where I had seen evil spirits subject to that power with- 
out even a word being spoken. I realize that those who are set 
apart and ordained to preside have authority to administer in the 
ordinances of the gospel and have power over unclean spirits. 

I might go on and relate to you many wonderful experiences, 
but the time will not permit. I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
that the opportunity came into my life, to enjoy the wonderful 
spirit of missionary work, to associate with the cleanest, most 
wholesome young men that can be found in the world anywhere, 
whose lives are clean, and whose habits are an example unto all 
the world, seeking to bring unto them the power whereby they may 
be saved. I thank the Lord for this Priesthood, the power whereby 
we may sanctify our lives unto the renewing of our bodies, and by 
enduring in faithfulness become the sons of Aaron and Moses, sons 
of the seed of Abraham and the Church of God, and of the elect of 
the kingdom. That we might sanctify ourselves by this Priesthood 
and continue faithful, and enjoy the Spirit of the Lord as long as 
we shall live, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the fellowship with you 
and for this privilege of meeting with you in conference, to be fed 
spiritually, for I have been fed and I rejoice in this fact. 

I have a testimony that God lives; he has been good to me and 
1 have found him to be patient, kind and loving, and I sincerely 
pray that while I address you this morning he will bless me with 
the same spirit that has been present in our conference thus far. 

Many of our speakers have referred to the good work being 
accomplished by those who are sent into the mission field and to the 
wonderful growth and development of young men who are called 
to this service. It is a fact that the spiritual growth of our young 
men who go into the mission field is very rapid after they reach 
their field of labor, and we often refer to this development as a 
witness of the mercy and goodness of the Lord to those who serve 
him in faith. I have been wondering if, because of this fact, we 
neglect to a large degree our opportunities for development at home, 
looking forward to even a greater service than could be rendered 
in the mission field with proper preparation beforehand. 

For the last year it has been my good fortune and pleasure to 
labor with many young men who have been preparing to leave for 
the mission field. Occasionally this question is asked : Why did 
the Lord keep Joseph Smith waiting for seven years after giving 
him the first vision? And from the discussion of this 
question, I have wondered if many of us have not had this 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 127 

same thought in our minds. Let me refresh your minds by briefly 
calling your attention to the fact that after Joseph Smith went into 
the woods to pray and after he had received the wonderful mani- 
festation — the appearance of the Father and the Son, at which time 
he was commanded not to join any church, but to return to his home 
and in due time information would be given to him — he waited three 
years, which seems to have been a time in which he was tried and 
ridiculed and tempted, but overcame all temptations, his faith in the 
Lord and determination to serve him increasing. When he had 
been sufficiently tried and had shown by his faith and his works 
a desire to carry out the instructions given him and to seek for 
greater light and knowledge, the Angel Moroni appeared to him, 
and for four years he was schooled under the direction of this 
heavenly personage ; and finally the plates containing the record 
of the ancient inhabitants of the American continent were given to 
him and, little by little, translated, requiring much patience, study 
and effort upon the part of Joseph Smith. 

If we stop to reflect upon this incident and many others that 
could be called to our attention, we will see how God calls men 
to positions of great responsibility and provides for their prepara- 
tion for such service. "Many are called but few are chosen.'' Is it 
not possible that many blessings are withheld from us because of 
our failure to earn those blessings through our faith and our works, 
in this day opportunity is given to us to prepare in our youth for 
the service of the Lord, and not only is the opportunity given, but 
we are commanded to prepare through the organizations provided 
for us, and known as the priesthood quorums. Isaiah tells us in the 
following passage when we are to begin to gain knowledge : 

"Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand 
doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. 

"For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept ; line upon line, 
line upon line; here a little, and there a little." (Isaiah 28:9, 10.) 

We also read in Deuteronomy 32:1-4 the following: 

"Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of

"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, 
as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass : 

"Because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto 
ou'r God. 

"He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a 
God of truth and without iniquity, just and right he is." 

I am wondering if some of us have overlooked this fact. 
Occasionally we hear expressions from members of the Church that 
would lead us to believe that we cannot expect young men to get 
the spirit of missionary work at home. Is this a real condition or 
an imaginary one? When we meet together to worship, we partake 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of the same spirit and manifestations that are found in the mission 
field, and many times to a greater degree. If we will study the 
matter we will find that this spirit and these manifestations come 
mainly to those who are serving in faith and who, through their 
labors, are entitled to these blessings. 

If our young men were given greater opportunity to give ex- 
pression to their thoughts, and were taught to respond to the 
requirements of the priesthood and the responsibilities placed upon 
them in the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood, and to perform 
the labors required of them in these organizations, laboring at 
all times in faith and for a purpose under the direction, encourage- 
ment and good-will of their parents, their brothers and sisters, ami 
associates, they would, in my opinion, go into the mission field 
with the same spirit that is developed so soon after they arrive ir 
the field. 

What is responsible for this rapid growth and development in 
the mission field? It is the responsibility which is placed upon 
them ; it is the work required of them. 'They leave their homes for 
the mission field with a testimony of the gospel, but that testimony 
is not developed. They have looked forward for years to an oppor- 
tunity to serve in the mission field, but as a rule have not been 
given opportunity to give expression to their thoughts or to 
discuss the knowledge they have received concerning the gospel 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; but when they reach their 
fields of labor they humble themselves before |the Lord and 
seek the Lord in prayer, just as Joseph Smith sought him. They 
are touched by the influence of the holy Spirit and they respond 
to this power and influence. 

Now, what justification have we to feel that it is necessary for 
these young men to go into the mission field before they can de- 
velop this attitude toward the things pertaining to the gospel? 
There are many schools in which we may learn. Some are schools 
which look to the holy Spirit for light. Under this influence the 
spiritual growth is much more rapid than otherwise. We have an 
example of this in the life of Moses. We all know the story of 
his childhood, how he was taken to the home of Pharaoh, where he 
grew to manhood, learning from his mother, who was employed as 
a nurse to care for him, of the teachings of her people concerning 
God and the hereafter. Moses was far removed from the spirit and 
influence which comes through these teachings when in the midst 
of those who partake of this same influence. He learned of the 
teachings of the world from the masters of Egypt, who, while they 
had great learning, were not actuated by that influence which 
comes from above. So, while Moses had faith in God and the 
teachings of his mother, he had evidently not learned of the great 
power and could not appreciate fully the promises of the Lord to 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 129 

his children. An example of this is shown in the third and fourth 
chapters of Exodus. 

• Moses seemed curious when he saw the burning bush and he 
stopped to determine why the bush could burn and yet not be con- 
sumed ; and God called him and told him of the afflictions of his people, 
saying: , .' 

"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : 
and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 

"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest 
bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt." (Exodus 3:9, 10.) 

Had Moses been trained under the proper influences, this no 
doubt would have been commandment enough for him, but listen 
to his reply : "Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that 
I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" Even with 
the promise from the Lord to be with him, Moses questioned the 
power of God to give him strength to accomplish God's purposes. 
Even after several miracles had been performed by Moses as a 
sign to him of the power of God, he found excuses for not carrying 
out the Lord's instructions, and finally Moses said unto the Lord : 

"O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast 
spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 

"And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth ? or who maketh 
the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord? 

"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou 
shalt say. 

"And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom 
thou wilt send. 

"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is 
not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, 
behold, he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee, he will be glad 
in his heart." (Exodus 4:10-14.) 

Is it not possible that blessings were withheld from Moses and 
given to Aaron, blessings which Moses could have enjoyed had he 
obeyed the commandments of the Lord in faith? 

In the life of Enoch we have another striking example of how 
the Lord provides a means for the establishment of his work and 
the preparation of his servants for service in that great work. We 
are told that in the days of Enoch there was great wickedness upon 
the earth. In Moses 6:27, 31 and 32 we read the following: 

"And he heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy 

. unto this people, and say unto them — Repent, for thus saith the Lord : I am angry 

with this people, and my fierce anger is kindled against them; for their hearts 

have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see 

afar off; * * * * 

"And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, 
before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying : Why is it that I have found 
favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me ; for I am slow 
of speech; wherefore am I thy servant? 

"And the Lord said unto Enoch : Go forth and do as I have commanded 



130' GENERAL CONFERENCE 

thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and 
I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands, and I will do as 
seemeth me good." 

Unlike Moses, Enoch did not question the Lord, but he ac- 
knowledged his own [weakness and his lack of preparation and was 
willing to be guided by the Lord and prepared for the service 
required of him. We find that Enoch did not commence his preach- 
ing immediately, but was taken into the mountain wherej the Lord 
taught him, where he learned precept upon precept, line upon line, 
here a little and there a little, finally returning to his people, where 
he converted a city, and the city was not, for the Lord took it unto 
himself. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I mention these incidents be- 
cause it seems to me that there, is something lacking, either in our 
belief, ;in our training, or in our faith, when we say that young men 
cannot be prepared at home in the Church for service they render 
so well under the guiding influence of our heavenly Father in the 
mission field. How much better they could and would_ serve while 
in the mission field if they were thoroughly prepared before leav- 
ing. It is so easy to pass the responsibility to someone else, but it 
requires a real effort to face the responsibility placed upon one 
when he receives the Priesthood and to perform the labors required 
of those- who are called to such positions, who should labor in faith 
and humility, knowing and realizing that all things are possible to 
those who serve the Lord in faith, with a desire_to accomplish that 
which is required by him. Let us keep in mind the words contained 
in John 15:1-5: 

"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 

"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every 
branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. 

"Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 

"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, 
except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 

"I am the vine, ye are the branches : He that abideth in me, and I in him, 
the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing." 

How many of us belong to that branch which beareth good 
fruit? How many of us are in danger of being cut off because of 
our inactivity, because of our failure to take advantage of every 
opportunity that comes to us for service in this great work? 

May we be numbered among the branches that bear fruit; 
may God purge us that we may bring forth more fruit; may we 
always abide in him and may his words abide in us, that we may 
eventually be glorified with that glory which he has promised to 
those who are faithful in all things. May God help us to see the 
way; may we be guided by his Spirit that we may go forward and 
accomplish that which is required of us, doing it in faith and 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 131 

humility, is my prayer, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

The Apostle Paul, in the opening words of his epistle to the 
Hebrews, testified as follows: 

"God, who in sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past to 
the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son." 

And so we testify that in this generation the same God has spoken 
through his Son, and through the prophets unto us. Just as it was neces- 
sary to supplement the revelations of the Old Testament by the revela- 
tions of the New Testament, to which the Apostle Paul testifies, so was 
it necessary to supplement the revelations of both the Old Testament 
and the New Testament by the revelations to us in our generation. 

The history of this American volume of scripture, this modern 
volume of scripture, known to us as the Doctrine and Covenants, shows 
that the Prophet Joseph Smith and also his associates placed a high 
valuation upon the message, upon the doctrines given to us. Soon after 
the organization of the Church, indeed about three months afterwards, 
Joseph was concerned in getting the revelations together for the purpose 
of publication. In November, 1831, a conference was called at Hiram, 
Ohio, for the purpose of having these revelations sent down to Missouri 
and published at the printing office of the Church, then established at 
Independence, Missouri. On the afternoon of that day, November 1, 
1831, there was given to the Prophet Joseph the revelation now em- 
bodied as the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, known as 
the preface. It is so designated in the revelation. This revelation alone 
is very strong corroborative proof of the divinity of the work through 
the Prophet Joseph. 

Elder Whitney spoke of the Book of Mormon as being one of 
the strongest corroborative evidences of the divinity of the Master. 
And so as to the Doctrine and Covenants we may say that it is a 
very strong book of corroborative testimony in support of the divinity 
of this latter-day work. 

Dr. Eliot, the president emeritus of Harvard, has given us a 
volume of prefaces of the notable books of the world. Volume 39 
of this five-and-one-half-foot library, as it is sometimes called, is a 
volume devoted entirely to prefaces — prefaces that are deemed worthy 
to live after the books themselves to which they are prefaces in some 
instances have lapsed into obsolescence. After considering the preface 
to the Doctrine and Covenants in the light of the literary standards 
of the world as to what a preface should be, and after comparing 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

it with the outsanding prefaces of the books of all time, I discover it 
to be a very remarkable document. I have read it over scores of times, 
and the oftener I read it the more powerful and beautiful does the 
language seem to me. I am persuaded that the testimony in support 
of so-called "Mormonism" is not dependent upon any one single bit 
of evidence, but upon the cumulative effect of all the corroborative 
evidence we have in support of this divine latter-day cause. 

The brethren having in charge the bringing forth of the Doctrine 
and Covenants safeguarded it very carefully. It was not sufficient for 
Oliver Cowdery alone to take the manuscript from Ohio to Missouri, but 
by revelation a companion was designated as his assistant in carrying that 
message. Ex-Governor Harding, of Utah, a Palmyra boy, in an af- 
fidavit furnished for an anti-"Mormon" publication in the 50's gives 
us a very beautiful picture, to my mind, of the way Joseph and his 
associates safeguarded the precious manuscript of the Book of Mor- 
mon. He testifies that he saw Joseph, Oliver and Martin walking 
through the woods each day in the morning, with a "take," as the 
printer calls it, of manuscript to be delivered to Mr. Grandin, the 
printer of Palmyra, sufficient copy for the day ; and the same three men 
again in the evening walking through the woods to receive back the 
precious manuscript which the printers during the day had placed in 
type. 

Some of the brethren felt that it was not such a very difficult thing 
to produce one of these revelations. They saw these revelations and 
realized that they were coming through the Prophet Joseph more or less 
in his language, and yet with wisdom above that of man, and a notion 
prevailed with some that it was not a very difficult thing to produce 
such revelations. Then the test was given of the Lord, ju^c as surely 
a test, although not so spectacular, as Elijah's contest with the priests 
of Baal. This is the language of the Lord in making that test : 

"And now I, the Lord, give unto you a testimony of the truth of these 
commandments which are lying before you. Your eyes have been upon • my 
servant, Joseph Smith, Jr., and his language you have known, and his imper- 
fections you have known ; and you have sought in your hearts knowledge that you 
might express beyond his language ; this you also know. 

"Now, seek ye out of the Book of Commandments, even the least that 
is among them, and appoint him that is the most wise among you ; 

"Or, if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye 
are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are true; 

"But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye 
do not bear record that they are true. 

"For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is 
righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of lights." (Doc. and Cov. 
67:4-9.) 

And there was one wise man — Church history suggests that he was 
very wise in his own estimation — Brother McLellan, who was really 
foolish enough to undertake to produce something that would read 
somewhat like one of these revelations, and added to his knowledge the 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 133 

folly of attempting the impossible. Just as the great John Marshall, 
justly estimated the greatest jurist that the United States has ever 
had, failed upon a challenge by his preacher, to produce a parable com- 
parable to one of the parables of our Lord and Master. 

There were many testimonies given in support of the divinity of 
the revelations. The first book published was known as the Book of 
Commandments, afterwards changed to its present title. The Pres- 
idency in the proposed issuance of that volume, testified thus : 

"We do not present this little volume with any other expectation than that 
we are to be called to answer to everything advanced, in that day when the secrets 
of all hearts will be revealed and the reward of every man's labor given unto 
him." 

Later the great body of the priesthood divided into departments, 
each with a spokesman, and strongly testified to the divinity of that 
book of revelations and to Joseph as a prophet. The following 
testimony was prepared and presented at a conference, November, 
1831, it being intended to have it signed and printed in the Book of 
Commandments : 

"The testimony of the witnesses to the Book of the Lord's Commandments, 
which commandments he gave to his Church through Joseph Smith, Jr., who 
was appointed by the voice of the Church for this purpose : We therefore feel 
willing to bear testimony to all the wcrld of mankind, to every creature upon 
the face of all the earth, and upon the islands of the sea, that the Lord has 
borne record to our souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these 
commandments were given by the inspiration of God and are profitable for all 
men, and are verily true. We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being 
our helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father and his Son, Jesus 
Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of bearing this testimony 
unto the world, in which we rejoice exceedingly, praying the 1 Lord always that 
the children of men may be profited thereby." (History of the Church, Vol. 
I, page 226.) 

This testimony to the truth of the Book of Commandments was 
concurred in by the leaders and other elders present at the conference 
where it was presented. It may have been signed also. It was carried 
to Missouri, but owing to the fact that the printing press was destroyed 
by a mob before the Book of Commandments was all printed, the testi- 
mony does not appear in the part of it that was printed ; but it was 
concurred in by all the leading brethren present at the conference, among 
them being Joseph Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, 
John Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, William E. Mc- 
Lellan, Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson, Lyman E. Johnson, and others. 
(See History of the Church, Vol. 1, page 222 and 226.) 

As we look for individual items of testimony, having as I say this 
cumulative effect of making a case beyond all controversy to those who 
are willing to listen to the truth, we have such evidence as was referred 
to by President Grant in his opening speech — the testimony of the 
great premier of England, Gladstone, a man disinterested and certainly 
competent to give that testimony. And the testimonies continue up 



134 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

to this time in support of the revelation to Joseph contained in section 
101, Doctrine and Covenants, verse 80, to the effect that the constitution 
of this land was established by wise men raised up unto this very 
purpose — not only the view the great Gladstone had, but modern lawyers 
in convention assembled express similar views in reference to the in- 
spiration of this great work. Honorable Michael J. Doyle, in the con- 
vention of the Commercial Law League of America, held July 13th, 
1925, said: 

"It is not to be expected that any product of mere human brain can escape 
all criticism or will be an absolutely perfect document. But so far as human 
genius could reach, the testimony of the intervening years has established that 
never before in the history of man's endeavor to uplift man has there been 
presented to civilization or to humanity a document so inspiring of the rights of 
posterity and the rights of freedom, as the document which followed the Declara- 
tion of Independence on that hot Fourth of July, 1776. I agree with the many 
writers on the subject who say that we have much reason to believe that the brain 
of these men, sitting there in that solemn assembly, was touched by a divine 
spark when they gave to the world and to posterity that marvelous document." 

A federal judge who sometimes sits in our own city, Judge Page 
Morris, had this to say with reference to the Constitution not long ago : 

"The Constitution of the United States is the greatest document the world 
has ever known, and if it is riot divinely inspired it is nearer to it than any 
other human document I know of." 

The very manner of giving these revelations indicates that Joseph 
had divine assistance. Parley P. Pratt testified to the giving of these 
revelations, but time does not permit to read his testimony, but it was 
in substance to the effect that there was no interlining, no reviewing, 
no reading back, no corrections, but he simply dictated it, so that a 
person writing longhand could conveniently take it, and when his 
dictation was through the revelation was complete. 

My own testimony is that the revelations in the Doctrine and 
Covenants are beyond the wisdom of man. That is true of the least 
revelation. Take, perhaps, the shortest, the second section, outlining 
all our great temple work in the turning of the hearts of the children 
to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children. That 
is above the wisdom of man, as also the 20th, 107th, 84th, and 124th, 
sections, the four great charters of the P/iesthood, or revelations on 
the Priesthood, which, by the way, the priesthood here assembled 
should be very familiar with, as many of them no doubt are, and other 
revelations, too numerous to mention, such as the 59th, the 93rd, 
76th, 87th, 88th and 89th sections. Indeed any one of them is above 
the wisdom of the young man Joseph, and above the wisdom of any of 
his associates, and above the wisdom of the world today. That is my 
testimony, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the first and third verses of the hymn, 
"Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 135 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

Brethren and sisters : A solemn thought comes to me as I stand be- 
fore you. It is this: The Lord said: "I give unto men weakness 
that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men 
that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves 
before me, and have faith in me, then will I make things become 
strong unto them." 

The Apostle Paul, by the inspiration of the Lord, declared : 
"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency 
of the power may be of God, and not of us." 

There were those in Paul's day who made the statement that 
bis bodily presence was weak ; but in that earthen vessel was the 
courageous spirit, the power of the Priesthood and the Holy Ghost 
that magnified the name of the Lord, and that preached Jesus 
Christ and him crucified to all the people who would listen to the 
apostle's message. 

We should look upon the manner of our redemption not only 
with respect and gratitude, but also with deep love and affection. 
In the body of the Babe of Bethlehem was the mighty God, the ever- 
lasting Father, the God of heaven, who came down to redeem his 
people. 

What was there in that young child to incite the murderous 
impulses in the heart of the wicked King Herod? The child ap- 
peared to mortal eyes much like other children, except to those 
whom God had given the light to see that the Son of Mary was 
God, the Savior. The evil power moved Herod to seek the life 
of the Only Begotten of the Father, because the promised Son was 
a revelation of God, the Redeemer of the world, who came to save 
mankind by his atoning blood. He was the Resurrection and the 
Life. 

When the Prophet Joseph Smith related to sectarian ministers 
the account of his glorious vision in which he beheld the Father and 
the Son, they laughed him to scorn and persecuted him. After 
accomplishing all the work God had given him to do, he sealed his 
testimony with his blood as a martyr for the Lord Jesus Christ. 
What was there in that boy to stir up hate and murder in the 
hearts of those who persecuted him and sought his life? The evil 
one revealed to them that here was a man who came to declare to 
the world that God lived, that Jesus was the Christ. Joseph Smith 
was a man sent from God to fill the earth with the knowledge of 
the Lord and to restore the true and everlasting gospel for the 
salvation of the children of men. 

The remark is sometimes heard among us that the world looks 
with more complacency upon a prophet than it did a generation 



136 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ago. This is not true, and those who entertain that idea are de- 
ceiving themselves. The same power that hated the Savior has 
always hated and will always hate the prophets he sends into the 
world. "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own : 
but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of 
the world, therefore the world hateth you." 

A few years ago, shortly after the World War, I had a con- 
versation with a prominent minister. He was a great preacher of 
the gospel as he understood it. In manner he was courteous, and 
his questions indicated a tolerant spirit. At the close of our talk 
I said to him : "Doctor, do you not think that this great war and 
this terrible epidemic of influenza foreshadow some great event 
such as the second coming of the Son of God?" He replied: "I 
think so now, but if a man eight years ago had told us that this 
war and epidemic would come, we would have laughed him to scorn 
and then crucified him." I said : "Doctor, men did crucify just 
such a man." Then to relieve the deep astonishment depicted on 
the churchman's countenance, I told him the story of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and the marvelous predictions that he made, by 
revelation from the Lord, of the Civil War, the World War and the 
desolating sickness and the overflowing scourge that should cover 
the land. 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that in earthen vessels 
ihere is power, there is a heavenly treasure. In the Prophet Joseph 
Smith there was a heavenly treasure, an immortal spirit, the power 
and calling of the holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost by which 
he established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 
all its beauty and power, divinely commissioned to preach the 
gospel to prepare the way for the second coming of the Lord. 

And I testify that in the missionaries, earthen vessels, the 
Holy Ghost dwells, and by this they know, by first-hand knowledge 
and not second-hand, that Jesus is the Christ. By that treasure and 
power they are preaching the restored gospel, reproving the world 
of sin, and God is blessing their labors. 

The President of the Church has the same treasure, the same 
power, keys, and authority that the Prophet Joseph Smith had, a'nd 
all the leaders of the Church, and the officers laboring under their 
direction have these treasures and the calling and authority that 
belong to the particular offices to which they have been appointed, 
to declare God's message to the people to whom they are sent and 
among whom they labor. This testimony I bear, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

A Lamanite brother from Washakie will now speak to us. His 
remarks will be interpreted by his bishop, Elder George M. Ward. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 137 

We have 150 members of the Church in Washakie. I understand 
that this Lamanite brother said he would like the opportunity of 
saying a few words here, and we are glad to have him do so. 
Brother Frank Warner, a brother of our Lamanite who is coming 
to the stand, filled a number of very fine missions among the 
Lamanites in different sections of the United States. 

YEAHGAH TIMBIMBOO 

My brethren and sisters : I am glad to meet here with you in 
conference. This is the first time in my life I have stood here and 
spoken to an audience. In my childhood I understood nothing of 
the services of this people. I had seen them going to Church. 
Not until I yielded obedience unto the word of God and accepted 
the ordinances of the gospel did I know what they were doing. 
Since I have accepted this gospel T have felt to be a friend to this 
people, and I have no desire to kill, or to do anything wrong that 
would displease the Spirit of the Lord. 

I believe the Lord is in existence. In my younger days I was 
sent with others to this country towards the west in search of a 
Great Spirit. But I have found that the Spirit of the Lord is among 
this people. While in search of that Great Spirit, the company of 
Indians traveled by foot day and night, and endured hardships, 
hunger and thirst. When we did reach our destination in the west, 
we found it was the elders of this Church, and we were baptized 
by those elders. Since I have been baptized and accepted this 
gospel I feel to live it to the best of my ability. And it encourages 
us one and all to live sacred lives before the Lord and keep his 
commandments, as we have been instructed during this conference. 

I look upon these men sitting here the same as I look upon our 
heavenly Father. I want to be obedient unto them and their teach- 
ings. Upon one occasion in my life I was very sick and my spirit 
left my body and went to my Creator, and the Creator would not 
accept my spirit, but it was sent back to my body. And now I 
testify that I am a living witness to this thing. I rejoice in the 
work that I have accomplished in this Church, the acceptance of the 
ordinances of the gospel, the performance of the same in my own 
behalf and the work that I have accomplished in behalf of my dead 
kindred. 

I ifeel that the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof is 
his, and we are his children and are placed here to obey him. 
Everything that we receive from this earth in the shape of grain, I 
feel is a blessing from the Lord unto us, and that we should con- 
sider it such, and thank the Lord for these blessings. I want to 
encourage you to be faithful and serve the Lord and keep his com- 
mandments. You people have the advantage of me. You can 
read the word of God from the scriptures and can store it up in 



138 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

your minds and prepare yourselves to live it. I, being unable to read, 
have to get my instructions from my bishop and remember them, 
and whenever he calls upon me I depend upon the Lord to bless 
me with his Spirit to bring to my mind the things I should say. 
1 am in this position this morning, called unexpectedly to stand 
here before you, and I have expressed the few things that I have 
spoken under the direction of the Spirit of the Lord. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish to say that the Latter-day Saints have undoubtedly 
spent more money and more time in endeavoring to educate and 
benefit the Lamanite people, whom we believe to be the descend- 
ants of the father Lehi, than any other people. The Church today, 
I believe, numbers among its converts in Hawaii over one-half the 
native population of that land. We are given the credit by leading offi- 
cials in that land of having done more for the uplift, morally, intellectu- 
ally and physically, and for the temporal benefit of the people of 
Hawaii than all other missionaries who have been in that land. 
And we have invested there at the present time in plantations 
considerably more than a million and a half dollars in money. 

We have assisted the Indians in Arizona and in different parts 
of Utah and Montana, and have done everything within our power 
for the benefit of this people, and we look forward to the day when 
hundreds and thousands of them will be abundantly blessed of the 
Lord, and when they shall eventually become a white and a delight- 
some people. 

As a closing number, the congregation sang "High on the mountain 
top;" and prayer was offered by Elder Thomas W. Johnson of the 
Beaver stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

On Tuesday afternoon, April 6, the closing session of the con- 
ference was held in the Tabernacle. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang "Come, come ye saints." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder J. Fred Corbett, pres- 
ident of the Idaho stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang "O my Father, thou that 
dwellest." 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 139 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters: It is a thrilling, yes, an almost over- 
powering experience, to stand before a great congregation such as is 
assembled here, and endeavor to preach to them the word of God. 
We have had some very wonderful meetings during the past three 
days, and now we have come to the last session of the conference. 
These general conferences recur at regular periods; nevertheless, they 
always come with a freshness and variety of instruction that is very 
delightful. 

It is not expected of me to present to you any new doctrine. I 
have no 1 new doctrine to offer, and if there were any such to be given 
to the Church, it would be the duty and privilege of the President of 
the Church to announce it, he being the man who holds the keys. This 
is a principle that ought to be well understood by the Latter-day Saints. 

WE ARE DECIDEDLY A CHRISTIAN CHURCH 

President Ivins in his remarks yesterday alluded to the fact that 
the "Mormon" Church is sometimes referred to in the world as being 
an un-Christian church, that we are not a Christian people. If I re- 
member correctly, and perhaps President Ivins mentioned the fact that 
in 1893, at the great parliament of religions, the "Mormon" Church 
was denied admission because it was regarded as not being a Christian 
church. Now it appears to me that with the facts which are readily at 
hand and within reach of any investigator, it is easily seen that we are 
decidedly a Christian church. Ours is the only Church that bears the 
name of the Savior. It is called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and that alone, if we are sincere in our belief, and we are, 
is sufficient proof that we are Christians. 

OUR STANDARD TEXTS 

I have here on the stand the standard works of the Church — the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl 
of Great Price. These are the works that will be found upon almost 
every pulpit in the Church, in all our places of worship and in the 
temples also as well as in the homes of the Saints. Let us pause for a 
moment and as briefly as possible consider these wonderful books. What 
is the Bible? The Bible is a book of scripture that contains the word of 
God as transmitted to his people on the eastern hemisphere; and not 
only a book of scripture, but a book of historical character, because it 
deals with the purposes of God and his providences in the journeyings 
and travels of his people. It covers a period from Adam down to Christ 
and his Apostles. Somebody might say, "Is that the only Bible you have 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ?" The answer is, 
Yes, that is the only Bible we have. We have other books of scripture, 
but they are not known and not referred to under that title. 

THE HOLY BIBLE 

I am free to state on this occasion, in the midst of this great congre- 



140 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

gation, that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts 
the Bible for what it purports to be. We hold it in reverence, and to us 
it is a holy book ; and a couplet that is very often used in connection with 
the Bible is very pleasing to us, namely: "Holy Bible, book Divine, 
precious treasure thou art mine." The Bible sets forth in clearness the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. That is perhaps its main value. I speak of this 
because the gospel involves principles that are everlasting in their 
character. They always existed, and they will always exist. For that 
reason these principles of salvation are applicable to all times and all 
nations throughout the world. It must be apparent to anyone who 
studies the Bible that there were certain commandments given therein, 
very important and sacred commandments, which do not apply to us. 
This cannot be said, however, of the Ten Commandments. They are 
of a general character and their application is general, and, as stated 
here by one of the speakers, the Ten Commandments form a basis for 
all law. If they were local commandments they would not apply to us, 
and would, perhaps, have no particular value in guiding our movements. 
That fact alone naturally suggests that the Church of God, whenever 
it is upon the earth, is in need of direct revelation. People require the 
word of God that is suited to their day and time. The Bible represents 
very great authority, but it does not impart any authority. Here is a 
distinction that should always be borne in mind. 

THE BOOK OF MORMON 

The Book of Mormon is also a record of scripture. We prize 
it very highly. We study it and search it, for we claim it to be the 
word of God. It was written by the hand of Mormon, who was a 
prophet among the people of the western hemisphere, or America, as 
it is now known. He was a great prophet among the people in the day 
in which he wrote. The Book of Mormon had its beginning about 600 
years before Christ, and its ending about 420 years after Christ, cover- 
ing a period of about 1,000 years. Surely anyone who will give the 
Book of Mormon a careful study will be driven to the conclusion, if he 
is sincere-minded, that wonderful things were accomplished during that 
period. The people of the Book of Mormon were called Nephites, after 
one of their first prophets. Nephi was the son of Lehi, who was the 
founder of the nation, and surely it was a great nation. The Nephites 
themselves as a people passed away about 1,400 years ago ; nevertheless, 
they have some representatives still upon the earth. The Lamanite who 
stood here this morning and bore his testimony, and a very wonderful 
testimony it was, is a descendant of Lehi through one of his sons who 
was called Laman, who was a brother of Nephi. The descendants of 
these men are called Lamanites, otherwise known as American Indians. 
So we had a Lamanite here to speak to us this morning, and he bore 
a faithful testimony. It was very wonderful to hear him. He spoke 
in his own language and it was interpreted by the Bishop of his ward. 

Now the principal value of the Book of Mjormon, as a standard 
work of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, lies in the fact 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 141 

that it contains an account of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is set 
forth in very great clearness. It is learned through this sacred record 
that the Savior after his crucifixion visited the people of Nephi. It 
is not to be wondered at that he visited them, because the Nephites 
were of Israel, being descendants of Jacob, and could properly be called 
a branch of the house of Israel. Since the Savior deigned to appear to 
his own people after his resurrection at Jerusalem, is it to be wondered 
at that he visited this branch of the house of Israel ? Well, the account 
says that he did visit them, and the record further tells us that he 
organized his Church among them, and strange to say — and yet I ought 
not to use that expression — gave to his Church in this land twelve 
apostles. He also gave to the Church such other officers of the priesthood 
as were given to the Church in his day. He ordained high priests, 
seventies and elders, priests, teachers and deacons. The Church of 
the Nephites, corresponded exactly in every detail with the Church of 
Christ in the land of Palestine. 

Now I tell you, brethren and sisters, there is something very beau- 
tiful in a comparison of this kind, something that is faith-promoting, 
something that is very enlightening. 

In addition to the plan of redemption, or, the everlasting gospel, 
that was given to the Nephites, we have in the Book of Mormon a brief 
history of their travels and of the ministry of their prophets. It is a 
book that is published to the world. If anybody should ask me : "Well, 
isn't it a Bible, isn't it your Bible?" I would answer, "No. It is our 
Book of Mormon. 'We do not call it the Bible. There is only one 
book which has that title. This is the Book of Mormon." If they 
should say, "Well it is a book of scriptures, isn't it?" We answer: 
"Surely j£ is, and we put it forth as such." 

THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 

Coming down to our own day we form a distinct and separate 
people from those great nations that have gone before; namely: the 
Israelites of the eastern hemisphere and the Nephites of the western 
hemisphere. We have received the gospel of Jesus Christ in this day 
and time, and it came to us direct from heaven. We did not get it 
from any other church or denomination under heaven. We have another 
book of scripture that is very precious indeed. It has been referred to, 
as have been these other books in this conference. It is the Doctrine 
and Covenants, which contains seventy-two to seventy-six revelations, 
given to the people of our day through the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
is declared to be, the word of the Lord to his Church. Strange to say, 
and yet I must not use the word "strange," the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants in its doctrines corresponds exactly with the teachings of 
the Book of Mormon, and corresponds exactly with the teachings of 
the Bible. I am, therefore, justified in saying that the Latter-day 
Saints have three powerful witnesses of the truth of the gospel. 



142 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

HOW THE BOOK OF MORMON BEARS UPON THE SUBJECT 

Now, in conclusion, permit me to read just a few words from the 
Book of Mormon which have a bearing upon this topic, and are very 
instructive. Nephi, the (Prophet to whom I have referred, II Nephi 
28 and 29, uses language somewhat like this : 

"Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and 
denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost! 

"Yea, wo be unto him that saith : We have received and we need no 
more! 

"And in fine, wo be unto all those who tremble, and are angry because 
of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it 
with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest 
he shall fall. 

"Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, 
and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough! 

"For behold, thus saith the Lord God : I will give unto the children 
of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; 
and blessed are those who harken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto 
my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will 
give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall 
be taken away even that which they have." 

And again briefly : 

"And because my words shall hiss forth — many of the gentiles shall say: 
A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible and there cannot be any more Bible. 

"But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and 
it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And 
what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? 
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travel^ and the 
labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing 
forth salvation unto the gentiles? 

"O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant 
people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not 
sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your 
own heads, for I the Lord have not forgotten my people. 

"Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need 
no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews? 

"Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not 
that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those 
who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above 
and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of 
men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth? 

"Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my 
word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto 
you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Where- 
fore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when 
the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall 
run together also." 

God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 143 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Time is very precious today, as it is always, and I desire most 
earnestly that the few moments I occupy will be profitable to this 
vast congregation. 

A MARVELOUS AGE 

We are living in a marvelous age, in the Dispensation of the 
Fulness of Times. All the other dispensations that have gone be- 
fore are culminating in this one. The Lord tells us in the Book of 
Mormon, to which President Clawson has just referred, that at 
the time of the coming forth jof that book, he would commence his 
work among all the nations, and it is remarkable that since the 
publication of the Book of Mormon more important discoveries and 
inventions have been presented to mankind than in all the ages 
that have gone before. Science has developed many wonderful 
Ihings. Labor-saving devices have made our work much easier 
than before. Electricity, which has been in the world from the 
beginning, has been recently discovered and has been so controlled 
that it is used to light our homes, to propel our street cars and 
railway trains, and to operate machinery of all kinds. This was 
unknown one hundred years ago. As a matter of fact, nobody can 
tell what it is today ; but it is one of the powers in this universe 
that is controlled by our Father in heaven. It would seem that 
everything one can imagine has been provided for our comfort 
in this age. We have the accumulated information of the ages, 
2nd surely we ought to be inclined to take advantage of that 
information in order that we might enjoy our lives here and be 
prepared to enjoy them eternally. In our great institutions of 
learning men are devoting their entire time to research. There is 
a disposition on the part of man to find out everything that is 
mysterious, and the result has been that intelligent men have had 
their minds operated on by the Spirit of our heavenly Father, and 
many of the conveniences to which I have referred have been the 
result. In the science of medicine, newly discovered anaesthetics 
have been a boon to suffering humanity, and by their use the sur- 
geon has been able to perform wonderful operations. Toxins have 
been prepared that have a tendency to prevent disease, and to stop 
its spread. Opportunity is given us to know what happens in all 
parts of the world each day through the great newspapers and 
magazines that are published. Everything that you can think of 
in the way of comfort and information has been presented to this 
dispensation. Unfortunately, notwithstanding these blessings, 
there is a tendency to worship the gift and to forget the Giver. 

THE WISDOM, OF IMAN TAUGHT 

We have in our public schools and in our universities, men and 
women who are trained, their minds are lighted up by the teachings 
of men, and it is remarkable to what a degree the business of life 



144 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

has been brought to the attention of the human family; but most 
of our schools operate as a result of the wisdom of man sand 
exclude God, the source of all truth. We spend millions of dollars 
in the education of the hand and of the mind, and we exclude from 
many of these institutions all knowledge of our heavenly Father, 
who gave to us the hand and the mind. In fact, there has been an 
effort made by some educators to create in the minds of pupils 
under their watchcare a contempt for the fact that the world we 
live in is controlled by our Father in heaven. 

In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants I find this reference : 

"Light and truth forsake that evil one. 

"Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having 
redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent 
before God. 

"And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through 
disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their 
fathers. 

"But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and 
truth." 

ADDITIONAL LIGHT AND TRUTH TO BE TAUGHT 

So my brethren and sisters, while we can have our children 
educated in the arts and sciences as taught by men, there still re- 
mains a commandment of our heavenly Father that we shall sup- 
plement those teachings and that our children shall be reared in 
light and truth. I find in this same section a reference that is made 
to one of the men of that time. It says : 

"Verily, I say unto you, * * * you have continued under this con- 
demnation; 

"You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the 
commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and 
this is the' cause of your affliction." 

Now the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints realizes 
the importance of teaching children the things of God, and has 
given to us our auxiliary organizations. Our heavenly Father 
inspired the organization of the Relief Society, the Sabbath School, 
the Mutual Improvement Associations, the Primary, the Religion 
Class. The inspiration of the Lord gave to us our Church schools 
and our seminaries. All these are intended to supplement the 
teachings of men, and to bring our children under an influence that 
shall assist them, while they remain here in the earth to prepare for 
eternal life. These have been wonderfully beneficial. Then we 
are instructed, even in our recreation, to teach our boys and our 
girls that in their pastime they should recognize our heavenly 
Father; and in our day the various stakes and wards of Zion are 
asked to give special attention to recreation, in order that the 
things that induce our young people to follow after the foolishness 
of the world may be neutralized by keeping them in an influence 
that will incline them to righteousness and inspire them to do 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 145 

those things and live such lives as shall make them worthy to be 
called sons and daughters of our heavenly Father. 

We find in section 68 (of the Doctrine and Covenants some- 
thing that we often hear quoted, but I am going to read it because 
it has application to these things I refer to : 

PARENTS ,TO TEACH CHILDREN THE THINGS OF GOD 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine 
of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight 
years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. 

"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized. 

"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins 
when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord." 

There is more of this same section that perhaps you are all 
familiar with, but the point that I had in mind, and what I am 
about to say I am exceedingly anxious that it should sink into the 
mind of every parent in Zion, and that is, that while the Lord has 
provided all these wonderful educational institutions, while science 
has contributed so much for our comfort and our blessing, while 
the Church has prepared places to which we may send our children 
to be taught the gospel of Christ, that does not relieve you or 
me of the responsibility and the obligation that is laid upon us by 
our heavenly Father to teach our own children. And the Lord 
says, wherein we fail to do that, even at the tender age of eight, 
that the sin will be upon our heads. President Joseph F. Smith 
was inspired to give unto us the wise counsel to be more with our 
children. Notwithstanding the many things that occupy our time 
— the business of life, theatres, parties, socials, automobiles, pleas- 
ure resorts, the canyons and lakes — all these things that we may 
enjoy in moderation ; notwithstanding the pursuit of life whereby 
we gain a livelihood, that prophet of the Lord gave to us this 
advice : That we should so arrange our time that one evening each 
week would find the Latter-day Saints in their own homes, asso- 
ciated with their own children, and there teach them the things 
that the Lord has decreed that they should know. It is not suffi- 
cient that my children are taught faith, repentance and baptism, 
and the laying on of hands for the gift of the holy Ghost in the 
auxiliary organizations. My Father in heaven has commanded that 
I should do that myself. I have read to you that the Lord told 
one man that the cause of his distress was that he had not taught 
his children light and truth. There is anguish in some of the homes 
of the Latter-day Saints today because we have neglected our 
opportunity, and we have failed to teach our children as we should. 
If the home evening could only be a fact among the Latter-day 



146 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saints, if during one evening a week we would live with our own, 
under the influence of the spirit of the Lord, at our own firesides 
surrounded by those whom the Lord has given unto us, and told 
us, particularly, that we should instruct them, how many happy 
homes there would be where today there is sorrow and discord and 
distress. Fathers and mothers would elicit from their children that 
respect that is due to parents who are model parents, and who have 
in their hearts a desire to teach their loved ones. We are told in 
Luke that there would be a time when men would be choked with 
the cares and the riches and the pleasures of life. I have in my 
mind, as I stand here even now, men and women that I love, whose 
very spirituality is being choked by these very things, and the 
adversary is leading them along that easy pathway of pleasure and 
they are nelecting their duty as parents and as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ. 

THE DUTY WE OWE TO OUR CHILDREN 

It was said by one of the speakers that your commission, you 
men of Israel, is from God .the eternal Father. The holy Priesthood 
has been conferred upon us, and if we exercise it as we should, as 
we have a right to do in our homes, when we shut out the world 
;:nd the things of the outside, and under the power of prayer and 
thanksgiving we give to our sons and daughters those rich truths 
that the Lord has deposited with us for our welfare and for theirs, 
a genuine development of faith will follow. I hope that it will be 
possible for us to return, if we have departed from that adyice. 
Gather our children around us and let our homes be the abiding 
place of the Spirit of the Lord. If we will do our part, we may 
know and be sure that our heavenly Father will do his. Let us 
avail ourselves of all the information that it is possible to ob- 
tain in the world; it will rise with us in the! resurrection. I am 
grateful for the great men and women who give their lives for the 
education of the human family, and I am grateful to God that he 
has given to us in this latter day a knowledge that the wisdom of 
man is not sufficient, but it takes the wisdom of our heavenly 
Father to prepare us for eternal life in his celestial kingdom. Are 
you satisfied with the thought that your children will go to the 
terrestrial or the telestial kingdom ? Are you satisfied that you 
shall inherit either of these lesser kingdoms? It is that you 
might enjoy the celestial kingdom that the Priesthood of the living 
God has been conferred upon men in this day. It is that we 
might gain the celestial glory that the gospel of Jesus Christ has 
been given to the children of men. Now in the midst of confusion, 
excitement and all the pleasures of life, let us not lose sight of 
the Pearl of Great Price, the power of God unto salvation, and let 
us not lose sight of the duty that we owe these boys and girls who 
are created in the image of God. He is the Father of their spirits, 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 147 

and he will hold us responsible for the teaching that they receive. 
I hope and pray that we will so teach them that when the end 
shall come we can receive from him that blessing, "Well done, 
good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord," and that 
we may have our loved ones with us eternally, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A soprano solo, "Beautiful Zion for me," was sung' by Lily 
Shipp Burton. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

"Beautiful Zion For Me," was written by Brother Charles W. 
Penrose upon the spur of the moment when bidding good-bye to Brig- 
ham Young, Jr., who had presided over the European mission, and who 
was about to sail for home. Brother Penrose remarked, "Oh, Brigham, 
beautiful Zion for me ! I wish I were going with you." Then he 
asked Brother Brigham Young, Jr., "Do you know the tune, 'Beautiful 
Isle of the Sea?'" And he said, "Yes." "All right, I will write 
you a hymn to that tune that you can sing on the ocean." And Pres- 
ident Penrose wrote this hymn. i 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

On occasions of this character there is an obligation resting 
upon each member of the Church present, perhaps the greatest re- 
sponsibility is upon those who are called upon to instruct the people. 

PRAYER IS OF GREAT BENEFIT 

We all have need of the help jour Lord so generously gives, 
when sought after in the way that he has appointed. Our singers 
need help that they may have control of their voices, that they may 
have the spirit of these hymns and songs which are sung, that the song 
may be as a prayer unto the Lord, that it may be an acceptable feature 
of our worship, and be answered with blessings upon our heads, and 
that they may be able, not only to be heard, but to be understood. 
The individuals who pray need help that they may be able to voice the 
sentiments and feelings of the members of the congregation, for they 
are not offering an individual prayer, but a prayer for the whole 
people, expressive of their thoughts and feelings. The speaker needs 
that help which the Saints can give by their prayers of faith. The 
Lord has said that the prayers of a righteous man availeth much with 
the Lord. This being the case, the prayer, silent and secret though it 
be, of many faithful men and women is sure to avail more with the 
Lord, and if we all do our duty in the spirit of worship when we come 
together on such occasions, our worship will not only be approved of the 
Lord, but will be sanctified to our blessing and salvation. 

THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THE SOUL OF THE CHURCH 

The Apostle Paul in an epistle to the Corinthians made com- 



148 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

parison of the Church and the offices thereof with the human body, 
and made the declaration that one member could not say to another : 
"I have no need of thee," for all the members are necessary. Not- 
withstanding the perfection of this organism of man which God has 
created, there is something within, that is the spirit, that if it were 
lacking this body would be as the dust of the earth, there would be 
no virtue in it. And so it is with the Church of Christ and the officers 
therein. But for the Spirit of God, which is the very soul of the 
Church, of our religion, of "Mormonism," it would be powerless to 
accomplish its destiny in the earth. There is in this thing called "Mor- 
monism" a spirit, a spiritual life, and I fear that many of us have not 
found it. I fear that we are too mechanical in our prayers, in our 
worship, and in our service of God. When this spirit is upon us we 
feel the truth and see the beauty of the gospel which we have received. 
Our souls are lighted up by it and we have the spirit of testimony and 
a knowledge of the truth. It is the spirit of revelation, it is the spirit 
by which the Church and kingdom of God has been set up and by which 
the work has been conducted up to the present time. We can have 
this spirit with us and have its manifestation if we will live for it, 
my brethren and sisters. We must make these tabernacles of ours, 
which are the temples of God, fit to receive the Holy Ghost that he 
may dwell within us, that we may be inspired by him in that which 
we have to do in life, to see aright, to feel aright, and to act aright,' 
that our administrations and our lives may be acceptable unto God. We 
cannot do this work assigned to us, we cannot live our religion ac- 
ceptably to the Lord without his help. 

THE SPIRIT COMES TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING 

If we obtain his help it must be through his holy Spirit, and if we 
would have that Spirit we must live for it holy lives, being al- 
together worthy in the sight of the Lord, then we must have a willing 
spirit, willing to receive that which the Lord has to give us, willing 
to give that which the Lord desires at our hands, whether it be our 
time, our talents, our means, or our lives, we must have that willingness 
of spirit that we will place all upon the altar to be used by the Lord for 
the accomplishment of his purposes, the saving of the souls of his 
children. We must recognize that authority which the Lord has placed 
here in the earth, in his Church, for he has said : "Whether it be by my 
own mouth, or by the mouth of my servant, it is the same." So, when 
a call is made upon us by those who are in authority, we should regard 
it as a call from the Lord, and never refuse to accept that call, no 
matter what of sacrifice it may entail. We should receive these things 
with grateful hearts, having that faith and trust in God that it will 
mean to us honor and glory in the life to come which it certainly will 
if we magnify these callings and the work which is assigned to us. 
We are here to learn what the will of God is concerning us and to do 
his will, walking in the footsteps of our Savior, even in the light as 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 149 

he was in the light, that we may receive a fulfilment of the promise 
that we shall have fellowship one with another in his kingdom, and that 
the blood of Jesus Christ shall cleanse us from all sins. 

PRAISE THE LORD IN PRAYER FOR OPPORTUNITY AND BLESSINGS 

I have been greatly edified and blessed in this conference. I have 
enjoyed the inspiring songs, so beautifully rendered, and particularly 
the song, "Beautiful Zion for me." My soul went out in rejoicing and 
thanksgiving before the Lord that my lot is cast with the Latter-day 
Saints in Zion, that I have membership in the Church and kingdom of 
God here upon the earth, that I have the fellowship of the Saints, their 
love and confidence and association, that I have a portion of the auth- 
ority of the Lord and have been honored with the privilege to minister 
for him in this great ministry in the earth, for his sustaining hand and 
power have been with me in my ministry, notwithstanding my weak- 
nesses and personal inability. May the name of the Lord be praised for- 
ever. 

My attendance at the meetings of this conference have had the 
effect of bringing me to appreciate, it seems to me, more than ever 
before, the blessings of the Lord unto me and unto his people. I love the 
Latter-day Saints. I desire to see the blessings of God poured out 
upon them, the blessings of heaven and the blessings of earth, and I 
desire to see this people faithful in keeping the commandments of the 
Lord and in doing his will. Brethren and sisters, if we appreciate 
the great blessings that have come to us through the gospel, let us never 
forget our obligation to render thanksgiving to our Father in Heaven 
for them, in the name of Jesus Christ. Morning and night is not too 
often. It was not too often when I was a child at my mother's knee. 
I have never felt less the need of prayer than at that time. As obliga- 
tions have come to me, and as I have been made to appreciate more the 
blessings of the Lord, I have felt more the need of prayer, and I have 
constantly, and fervently prayed unto him in praise and thanksgiving, 
and, realizing my dependence and my weakness, I have pleaded with 
him for mercy, forgiveness and for spiritual guidance. The Lord has 
been very good to me, and I feel sure you feel the same, brethren and 
sisters, that he has been good to you. 

OTHER WAYS THAN PRAYER TO MANIFEST APPRECIATION 

Now let me say, it is not sufficient that we pray to the Lord 
often in thanksgiving for the blessings. There are other ways in which 
we can manifest our appreciation, if we appreciate what the Lord has 
done for us, we will love him and the greater our appreciation of these 
blessings the greater will be our love, and the Lord has said: "If ye 
love me, keep my commandments," and thereby does he know whether 
we love him, if we keep his commandments. He has said : "If a man 
love me, he will keep my word." He has given us his word through 



150 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

his servants. President Heber J. Grant has referred to the Word of 
Wisdom as the word of God, which it is. Now the Lord says : "If 
ye love me, keep my commandments. If a man love me, he will keep 
my word." Some people say : "But the Word of Wisdom is not a 
commandment." If the Lord has commanded that I love him with all 
my heart, with all my soul, with all my might, and then has said that 
if I love him I will keep his word, therein is a commandment to me 
that I keep the Word of Wisdom. Regard it as you will, to me it is 
sufficient to know that it is the mind and will of God. That is what 
we are here for, my brethren and sisters, to learn his mind and will 
and then with his help to do it at whatever cost it may entail. 

TESTIMONY 

I know that this is God's work, I am thankful for it, I know that 
President Heber J. Grant is the mouthpiece of God unto this people at 
this time, and I know that he has the inspiration of his calling. I 
know that this work is progressing as it has under administrations of 
the Church which have gone before, and I know there will be no 
dearth of interest on the part of the Latter-day Saints in helping to 
carry on this work. I am assured of its triumph. I have no fear of 
future embarrassment, of being found in a mistaken condition. I know, 
and thank God for this testimony, that this is his work, that he is at 
the helm, and that it will triumph. This is my testimony which I 
bear to you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have a half hour left and there is some business to be attended 
to, namely, the presenting of the Authorities, and I would like to make a 
few closing remarks. I do not know that it would hurt the Latter-day 
Saints if we were to overrun the time fifteen or twenty minutes. I 
would like to hear from all our mission presidents that have not spoken, 
and I will ask them to watch that clock and to bear us a testimony of 
from three to five minutes. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission ' 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance 
at this conference ; and, had I been left to my own desires I would 
have preferred that my time be given to President Grant. I appreciate 
the gospel and the knowledge that has come to me through my ministry, 
and the privilege I have had of laboring in the ministry, bearing my 
testimony to the children of men ; that the work of God as revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith in our day is true. In my travels 
I have found faith among the children of men, and have become ac- 
quainted with many men and women who have obeyed the gospel of 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION 151 

Jesus Christ as taught by the elders of the Church who have labored 
in the Central States mission during my appointment as president of 
that mission. 

Inasmuch as I have had many hundreds of young men and women 
laboring under my direction as president of that mission, I have been 
able to observe that the youth of Zion are growing stronger, and that 
they are not weaker than they were 20 years ago. I know that the 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are growing 
in faith and that the youth of Zion are not losing their faith, but that 
they are holding their own, notwithstanding the increased temptations 
that surround young people, compared with the temptations of 20 
years ago. 

Considering the fact that our young men and young women con- 
tinue to show improvement in faith and in preparedness, is it not evi- 
dent, then, that the membership of the Church of God in the earth is 
growing in strength and in power? For if we could notice a decline, 
it would be undoubtedly because of the training of the youth of Zion, 
and inasmuch as the youth of Zion do show an increase in faith and 
in general preparedness for preaching the gospel, we cannot but 
conclude that the affairs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints are well administered, and that the work of the Lord is growing 
and increasing in power and in strength in the earth, and that the 
children who are given to parents in Zion will be able to continue to 
carry in honor the gospel message to the children of men until the 
Lord shajl come. 

I know that the Lord lives and that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith was and is a prophet of God and that he received the authority 
to act in the name of God ; that he was divinely appointed and qom- 
missioned to establish the Church, and that the gospel through him might 
be preached in all the world. I bear testimony that the Priesthood of the 
Son of God is in the aarth, and that the presiding brethren, with Heber 
J. Grant at the head, are divinely appointed men to act in the name 
of God, for the furthering of his work here in the earth. That the 
Priesthood shall remain in the earth until the Son of man comes to rule 
and reign; and I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the testimony of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ that I have received ; of the truth of this 
great work that has been established in the latter days ; and of the 
divinity of the Prophet Joseph Smith. We often say that we are very 
grateful for our parentage, and for the blessings that have come to 
us through that parentage. Sometimes I wonder just what I have re- 
ceived through my parents and grandparents. In thinking over the 
matter, I feel that I have received one good thing, among the many 



152 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

other blessings, and that is a love for the Prophet Joseph Smith whom 
God raised up in these latter days to establish his work upon the 
earth. Grandfather loved Joseph Smith and was willing to give his life 
for him. He stood by his side. I am grateful for the blessing that 
lias come to me in the testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God ; that I can love him, in a measure at least, in the way that grand- 
father loved this man of God. I have heard my grandmother, Elizabeth 
Taylor, testify regarding the Prophet Joseph Smith. I have also heard 
my wife's grandmother, Rachel Grant, testify of him. I have heard 
many other men and women who have personally known the prophet 
testify to the divine calling of Joseph Smith. We are not so very far 
away from this Prophet of God, and the testimony concerning him is 
very close to us. It is not necessary to reach back through the ages, 
or through the thousands of years, to find testimony and to find faith 
in regard to this great work and this great man, a prophet, raised up 
in these the latter days. 

I hope that, as members of the Church, we will do our part ; that 
our boys and our girls will accept the testimony of the splendid men 
and women we have among us, and particularly of those who can 
testify to the divinity of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. May 
God bless us and help us to live a life of usefulness and of righteous- 
ness upon the earth ; and show him, by the things that we do, that we 
truly love him and are willing to give service and perform the labors 
which God would have us perform upon the earth. I bear testimony 
as to the truth of this work, and of the divine mission of the Prophet 
Toseph Smith, and of Jesus Christ the beloved Son of God. 'Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

These tabloid sermons remind me of a line from Shakespeare: 
"One woe doth tread upon another's heels, so fast they follow." 

But I will not detain you long, brethren and sisters. I am grateful 
to have the privilege of representing and making a brief report of the 
Northwestern States mission. It is a glorious work to which a few 
selected brethren have been called, and I am very grateful that I 
have been one of the selected few ; not because I merit the distinction, 
because I have had to rest upon the mercy of God and the kindness 
of my brethren. It is a wonderful and glorious experience to be as- 
sociated with your sons and daughters. They are the elect of the earth, 
and I plead for them that, on their return to their homes, their 
presidents of stakes, their bishops of wards, will extend to them the 
hand of helpfulness, that they shall be cared for and provided a place 
in which they may continue the excellent work they have performed in 
the mission. They are acquiring such knowledge as does not come 
to men and women in educational institutions, but I desire to make a 
plea that we encourage them to greater educational efforts. We are 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 153 

meeting a class of men and women in the world that requires and calls 
for the very best of intellectual attainment, and the better equipped 
our boys and girls are to meet these higher intellectuals, the more good 
they can do. They can reach people whom men and women of less 
educational attainment cannot successfully reach ; and I look forward in 
hope to the time when young men and women we shall send out into the 
world will be the peers, educationally, of any other men and women in 
the world. The destiny of this people and this cause is that it shall be 
the greatest educational factor in all the world ; and to the testimonies 
that have been borne here this day, and other days, I wish to add mine. 
Re?son has convinced me; the laws of experience, as they have been 
and are being applied in human attainment, as well as the authority of 
the scripture, teach, proclaim and testify to me, that this is the work 
of God. As the gospel of Jesus Christ has come forth from the crucible 
it has been adorned and is in the radiance of the divine. God is with 
good. He is with truth. He is with this people ; and if we wish to do 
our full duty to him, we can best do it by proclaiming to the world in 
the lives we live that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, to which I testify 
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Canadian Mission 

I believe that I appreciate, to the fullest, the great responsibility 
that rests upon one, when one is called upon to bear witness of the 
gospel of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. I have come to the con- 
clusion that there is no greater work in all this world than to be engaged 
in proclaiming and teaching the gospel of our Lord and Master to the 
nations of the earth. I am glad, beyond my power to say, that I have 
been chosen and sent into the world to be associated with young men and 
women, in declaring this divine truth to those with whom we come in 
contact from day to day. I am glad to be a member of this great and 
mighty Church, and that there is burning within my heart a testimony 
concerning the divinity of this great latter-day work. 

In the country in which it has been my privilege to labor, there are 
some of the finest people with whom one would care to meet. They 
are, as a rule, intelligent and law-abiding people. They are people who 
know the value of law, in that they execute it to bring about better 
order for all those who reside within their borders. As an example : 
the other day, while riding in one of the street cars of the city of 
Toronto, there hung from the roof of the car this sign, "The Toronto 
Traction Company, since September 1, 1921, has traveled one hun- 
dred twenty-two million miles ; these cars have carried one billion 
two hundred twenty-five million people, and during that length of time 
there has not been one fatal accident." I make mention of this for 
the simple reason, to bring out the fact, that they do business on a 
conservative basis, and that there is cooperation on the part of all, in 
protecting the population of the country. This conservatism is shown, 



154 • GENERAL CONFERENCE 

not only in their business life, but also in their social and spiritual 
life. 

My brethren and sisters, to me this latter-day work is worth my 
life. In the silent hours of my life, when I have the opportunity, and 
that is often, I reflect upon that great vision of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, when he saw God, the eternal Father, and his Son Jesus 
Christ and heard the voice of God introducing his Son. I think 
that is one of the greatest events in the history of human life. 
Indeed, there is no other event recorded, that equals it. It is true that 
we read in the scriptures that Stephen saw the Son of God sitting 
on the right hand of God; but nowhere do we find that both God 
the Father and the Son have appeared at the same) time to mortal man. 
This event, wherein God introduced his Son to this young prophet, 
clearly indicates the character and magnitude of this great latter-day 
woik. Indeed it was so important that it required the introduction of it 
into the world in this great and last dispensation by both the Father 
and the Son. I thank God, my eternal Father, that I have been counted 
worthy to bear this testimony, not only upon his occasion, but upon 
the many occasions that have come to me during my life. May God 
bless us to the extent that we may appreciate more fully, our relation- 
ship to him, and praise him for the testimonies that all of us enjoy, I 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

President of the Northcentml States Mission 

One of the ancient prophets who had his mind centered upon this 
great latter-day work used words somewhat like these : 

"Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, 
but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 

"For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and 
hath closed your eyes : the prophets and, your rulers, the seers hath he covered. 

"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is 
sealed, which men deliver to one fthat is learned, saying, Read this, I pray 
thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: 

"And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this 
I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned. 

"Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with 
their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their 
heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: 

"Therefore, behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people." 

Not long ago a letter fell into my hands that was written in this 
city, in the year 1876. That letter, written by one of our enemies, 
said: 

"Brigham Young is fast trotting toward the grave, and in a short 
time he will be laid beneath the sod and with him will come the 
death of 'Mormonism.' " 

The following year, 1877, Brigham Young died, but "Mormonism" 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 155 

did not die, and our answer to the world is : "Mormonism" will never 
die, for it is the work of God, and will be consummated in the coming 
of Jesus Christ the Lord, who shall come to reign as Lord of lords 
and King of kings. The young men of Israel are today filled with the 
same faith that filled the breasts of their fathers, who adopted this 
work and who have so successfully carried it on ; and it will never wane 
for the lack of faith on the part of the young men and women of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I bear witness to you today that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God and that he has been followed by men who are his legal suc- 
cessors, endowed with the keys of the Priesthood of God, with the 
authority to speak today, not a thousands years ago, but now. Thus 
saith the Lord God of Israel, that power is in the earth today, in these 
valleys of the mountains, in the Church of God, as it was established, 
and I bear witness to these truths, testifying that I know as I know that 
I live, that this work is of God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

I 
ELDER KENNETH HAYMORE 

Acting President of the Mexican Mission 

I am very pleased to be here this afternoon, my brethren and 
sisters, to give a brief report of the work of the Mexican mission. 
1 know that the work we are doing in Mexico is indeed the work 
of the Lord, and that it is not the work of any man. The mission- 
aries, numbering seventy-four or seventy-five, are doing a splendid 
work there. They are taking the gospel to the descendants of a 
people who formerly had a thorough knowledge of the gospel. 
It has already been stated here this afternoon that the people of this con- 
tinent, the natives of the continent, at one time enjoyed the knowledge 
of the gospel, but just as an apostasy was brought about on the 
other continent, so also there was an apostasy upon this continent; 
but now, thanks to our heavenly Father, he has restored his gospel 
to the earth. These people are receiving again its teachings, they 
are coming into a knowledge of their fathers, and are learning that 
they are indeed of the blood of Israel. They are learning the laws 
and ordinances of the gospel, and I am happy to say that some of 
them, at least, are accepting the gospel, and are showing by their 
lives that they know that they indeed have the truth. We are 
having success in Mexico in spite of a few disadvantages. We hope 
that within a short time our missionaries may labor in that country 
unhindered. In the United States we also have a work going on 
among the Mexican people with great success. 

I shall not attempt to give any further report, but I do wish to 
testify that the missionaries are working hard; that they are 
happy, and that they are safe. I don't believe that they are in any 
danger in Mexico. They are treated courteously in all cases. I 



156 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

testify to you this afternoon that, I know that this is not the work 
of any man. I know it is not the work of President Grant, nor is 
it the work of President Pratt, with reference to the Mexican 
mission, but that it is indeed the work of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ. This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

My brethren and sisters: The significant and reassuring fact 
about this conference is that we are growing in a testimony of the truth 
of the work of almighty God. There is something substantial and 
unimpeachable about these meetings, for they indicate that we as a 
people are growingjn grace and spiritual power, and that some day we 
will emerge into our highest selves, and vindicate by our spiritual 
lives the supreme ideals for which we stand. We appreciate the fact 
that we are citizens of the United States. This government under 
which we live was brought into being by the highest concepts of the 
finest types of men. When Christopher Columbus landed on American 
soil in October, 1892, he uttered a prayer which is significant and 
prophetic. From the Latin I give it to you in translation : 

"O, Lord God, eternal and omnipotent, by thy sacred word, the heaven, 
the earth, and the sea, thou hast created. Blessed and glorified be thy name, 
praise be thy majesty, which has been made worthy through thy humble servant, 
that thy sacred name be recognized and proclaimed in this other part of the 
world." 

We are told in a book of holy scriptures, namely, the Book of 
Mormon, that a man, chosen from among the Gentiles should discover 
this continent and the remnant of the people of Israel. This was 
Christopher Columbus, and we are further told that others would 
follow him, and that this land should be dedicated to the highest prin- 
ciples of liberty. When the Pilgrim Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock 
they drew up a compact which was fundamental to the Constitution of 
the United States. This compact in part reads : 

"In ye name of God, Amen. We whose names are written, the loyall subjects 
of our dread soveraigne Lord, King lames, by ye grace of God, of Great 
Britaine, France, & Ireland, King, defender of ye faith, &c, haveing undertaken, 
for ye glorie of God, and advancements of ye Christian faith, and honour of our 
king & countrie, a voyage to plant ye first colonie in ye Northerne parts of 
Viriginia, d,oe by these presents solemnly & mutualy, in ye presence of God, and 
one of another, covenant & combine ourselves together into a civil body politick, 
for our better ordering & preservation & furtherance of ye ends aforesaid : and by 
vertue hereof 'oenacte, constitute, and frame such just & equall lawes, ordinances, 
actes, constitutions, & offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most 
meete. * * * " 

We Latter-day Saints believe in the sacredness of the Mayflower 
compact, and we hold very reverently in our hearts the Constitution 
of the United States. This document is the greatest expression of 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 157 

government that has come forth in all history, and its principles, if 
lived up to, will change the political and civic life of the world. The 
beautiful thing about the American government is that it is an expres- 
sion of the lives of the people, and if the people live magnanimous and 
Christian-like lives, so will our Government become greater and greater. 
There are problems today to be solved, and I consider that the greatest 
ills of society are: first, the unprecedented challenge of authority and 
disrespect for law ; secondly, hatred between man and man ; and thirdly, 
the excessive search for pleasure as the aim of life. I believe that we 
people should be the greatest lovers of the law of any people living, 
for just law expresses our ideals and concepts of life. We should 
dedicate our lives to the highest political and civic truths and we should 
grow in the abiding thought that man is made in the image of God ; that 
the Christian virtues are the highest codes of ethics; and that im- 
mortality and the establishment of God's kingdom on the earth are il- 
luminated because of the restored Priesthood which we hold. With such 
ideals we will be able to contribute more to the solution of the problems 
of the world than any other people. I pray that we may not only 
see the problems of human society that lie before us, but that we will 
be able to meet them with a potency that comes as a result of the deepest 
faith in almighty God and his purposes. May we not sing: 

"Higher yet and higher, 
Out of clouds in night, 
Nearer yet and nearer, 
Rising to the light."

patriarchs, 34 of the First Council of Seventy, and 14 of the Presiding 
Bishopric. A total of 133 besides the three witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon." 

A FEW WORDS ON DEBT 

Apropos of my remarks to the effect that we should not run in 
debt or mortgage our future, I will read a poem that has been handed 
to me, written by Stoddard King: 

SAID THE PIEMAN 

A study of pie salesmanship will be made by the National Pie 
Bakers Association. — News item. 

"The story of Simon called Simple 

Is one everybody has read ; 
It is sweet, it is sad,, and it tells of a lad 

Who wasn't quite right in the head. 
When he sought to buy pie of the pieman, 

Poor Simon was hopeful but rash, 
For he childishly thought that a pie could be bought 

Without any transfer of cash. 

"But we mustn't speak harshly of Simon, 

Who was simply ahead of his time — ■ 
Today he could buy a whole carload of pie 

By merely investing a dime. 
The up-to-date salesman would land him — ■ 

Or, rather more likely, his wife — ■ 
By letting him pay a few cents right away 

And installments the rest of his life. 

"It's the way they sell pins and pianos, 

And paintings, potatoes and pants — 
For a few dollars down you can buy the whole town — . 

As a prospect you haven't a chance. 
The fact that you're broke doesn't matter, 

Your only escape is to die — 
And as long as they take all the money you make, 

You might as well spend it for pie!" 

U. S. COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION 

I am pleased to state that sitting on the stand Sunday, at the opening 
session of our conference, was the Commissioner of Education of the 
United States of America, Honorable John J. Tigert, and he expressed 
himself as very well pleased with our wonderful gathering. 

PASSING OF PRESIDENT THOMAS P. COTTAM 

Since our last conference one of the most faithful and diligent 
of all workers in the Church, for many years a counselor in the presi- 
dency of the St. George stake, and subsequently the president of the St. 
George temple, Brother Thomas P. Cottam, has passed away. He 
was one of the noblemen of the earth, one of the most faithful, loyal, 
true, upright Latter-day Saints that it has ever fallen to my lot to know. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 161 

EVANGELINE BOOTH ON PROHIBITION 

I had intended to read something here from Evangeline Booth, 
Commander of the Salvation Army in this country, but, like the con- 
gressmen, I will beg leave to have it put in my speech when it is printed 
in the Conference Pamphlet, or when it appears in the Deseret News. 
It was published in the Literary Digest of March 20, 1926: 

"Park benches are emptied of their drunken derelicts, and the men who used 
to make their wives and children the victims of their thirst and besotted rage 
have sobered up and returned to work to feed their families. And that one 
fact, believes Evangeline Booth, Commander of the Salvation Army in the 
United States, is the most convincing argument in favor of prohibition and against 
the return of the saloon. She is sure, however, that the Eighteenth Amendment 
is so firmly entrenched in public favor that it will never be repealed, and equally 
sure that it can be enforced. Such drinking as is indulged in now, she asserts, 
is a fad of the idle rich which will die out, or else society — society, that is, 
with the big 'S'— will be turned upside down and furnish rum wastrels for the 
Salvation Army to salvage. Miss Booth's utterance is no careless statement of 
fact and possibility, for there is no more seasoned worker among the sub- 
merged tenth than she, none among the world's greatest moral clean-up organ- 
izations more familiar with the sodden aspects of drunkenness and debauchery 
and their devastating influence on the home. It was while convalescing from an 
attack of appendicitis that she issued her statement on prohibition, which is 
quoted in part by the New York Times as follows : 

" After all these years of hard fighting to protect the home, emancipate the 
neglected children and wipe from our national escutcheon the disgrace of the 
evils arising from drink, it is good to find that the people of America have 
come to a correct judgment concerning the drink evil. It is unthinkable that 
the country will ever return to the deadly saloon system and a resumption of 
liquor vending. 

" 'Surely it will be conceded that the Salvation Army knows something 
about the evils of strong drink. From the day my father founded the organiza- 
tion in England to combat the degradation and vice that are inevitable conse- 
quences of liquor drinking, the Salvation Army has held rigidly to its purpose, 
and feels that it had a great deal to do with the enactment of prohibition in 
America. 

" 'It is an illogical thing to say that because a new law has not worked 
like magic it is best to cast it aside and return to the original state of vice which, 
because of its awfulness, prompted the enactment of that law. Such a thing would 
make civilization march backward. It is rather the duty of the citizen, the 
State and the Government to find ways ana means to make the law work out 
its unquestioned benefits to humanity. It can be done. It is being done. 

" 'Enemies of the Volstead Law waste their time when they try to tell organ- 
izations like the Salvation Army that national prohibition will not work. Vast 
changes have come about, and to undo them would be to strike a blow at every 
fireside and every industry in this country. . 

" 'Why try to tell the Salvation Army that the park benches are crowded with 
drunken men, as they were before prohibition when we used to gather them in on 
Thanksgiving Day, for example, and fight to salvage them? They are gone. 
The benches still remain, but the occupants are not drunk any more ; they are 
climbing upward to better things while the public rushes by all unheeding. Why 
try to tell us that workingmen spend their wages before their families can get 
the money for food, and that men beat their wives and children as in the old 
days ? It simply is not the case. 

" 'If the idle rich persist in making a sport of the prohibition law, the day 



162 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

may come when the boulevardiers, vastly in the minority, will have to be salvaged 
out of their attractive places for secret drinking and rescued, if possible, by the 
Salvation Army, just as the poor saloon victim used to be. In that event the sober 
and progressive working classes will automatically become the aristocrats, and 
society, so-called, will be turned upside down in its system of organization. 

" 'In other words, drinking and flouting the prohibition law are a fad and 
will die out' " 

In testimony of Miss Booth's experience and of her fitness to 
pass judgment on prohibition, Arthur J. Davis, State Superintendent 
of the Anti-Saloon League of New York, says, as he is quoted in the 
same paper : 

"She led her band of Salvationists against the drink evil in the United States 
and consistently opposed the saloon while she salvaged its wrecks and bound up 
the wounds of its victims. Evangeline Booth has been knocked down by drunkards 
and so badly injured that she spent months in hospitals. In the early days of 
her work in New York slums Salvationists were murdered by drunkards. She, 
therefore, knows what she is talking about when she attacks the illegal liquor 
traffic and upholds prohibition. For seventy years her organization has fought 
the saloon and she knows the advantages of its banishment." 

A study was made in Munich by a professor in which it was dis- 
covered that in that great beer-drinking city seventy-two out of every 
one hundred babies that were born there were unsound. The same pro- 
fessor visited prohibition Maine and found that 71.5 per cent of the 
babies there were born sound. There have been born to me twelve 
babies and forty-four grandchildren, all of whom were sound, and I am 
convinced that among the Latter-day Saints who are observing the Word 
of Wisdom not more than one to two per cent of the babies are born 
unsound. And yet, I quoted from an article published in one of our 
local newspapers that if any woman believed that tobacco would injure 
her child she would not be guilty of using it. 

ON MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE 

I would like to appeal to the Latter-day Saints who are thinking of 
moving from one place to another, from Canada on the north to Mexico 
on the south (I believe that four hundred miles north of Lethbridge 
is the farthest north, or the closest to the north pole, any Latter-day 
Saint has gone), that before moving they do some consulting with or 
writing to the presidents of stakes and others in the section where they 
contemplate going, and ascertain if they can identify themselves with 
some of the regular organizations of the Church ; instead of going 
beyond the bounds of the Church, and then writing and asking us to 
please send some missionaries to hunt them up ; that they really do 
belong to the Church, but that they have gotten so far away everybody 
seems to have forgotten them. Move where you cannot be forgotten 
and where there is an organized stake or ward of the Church. There 
is plenty of opportunity in the organized stakes of Zion for those who 
want to change their location here in Utah and in Idaho and in Canada. 



CHURCH AUTHORITIES 163 

ON SMOKING CIGARETTES 

There are two items which I had intended to quote here this after- 
noon, but I shall not do so; instead, as before stated, I will adopt the 
system of the congressmen, and beg leave to print. 

I quote a statement which profoundly impressed me, from Mr. 
Henry Ford's pamphlet: 

" 'Several of my young acquaintances are in their graves who gave promise 
of making happy and useful citizens,' declares Luther Burbank, the wizard of the 
plant and vegetable kingdom whose experiments have caused the civilized world 
to wonder, and whose experiments have benefited the civilized world by millions 
upon millions, in increase of prosperity, by the increase in the various things that 
he has done in improvement in flowers and in seeds and in fruits and in the 
redemption of the cactus in Arizona, taking the thorns; he is in very deed the 
wizard of the agricultural world and one of the benefactors of mankind. He 
says : 'And there is no question whatever that cigarettes alone were the cause of 
their destruction.' No boy living would commence the use of cigarettes if he 
knew what a useless, soulless, worthless thing they wouid make of him." 

I quote from David Starr Jordan, President Emeritus of the 
Stanford University: 

"The boy who smokes cigarettes need not be anxious about his future. He 
has none." 

BENEDICTION ' 

I rejoice beyond measure in the rich outpouring of the Spirit of 
the Lord during our conference, from the first session until the present 
time ; and, insofar as God has endowed me with ability and power and 
his Priesthood, I bless the people. I bless each and every soul who has 
taken part in this conference, in singing, in praying and in speaking, 
and I bear witness to you that they have spoken under the inspiration 
of the living God, and that they are entitled to the blessings of God. 
I bless the people of the Latter-day Saints who have come here and 
listened so patiently and in such great numbers' to the testimonies which 
have been borne. May God's choicest blessings attend all Israel, and the 
honest the world over, and I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "For the strength of the hills 
we bless thee;" and the benediction was pronounced by Fred A. 
Caine, president of the Idaho Falls stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by B. 
Cecil Gates; accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were 
played by Edward P. Kimball, Tracy Y. Cannon, Alexander Schreiner 
and Frank W. Asper. Stenographic reports were made in the Taber- 
nacle by Frank W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson; in the 
Assembly Hall by Frederick G. Barker.

Discourses of Brigham Young 

This Great Book Should be in Every 
Home Library 

No Latter-day Saint home library is complete without the unique 
volume, "Discourses of Brigham Young." Thousands still living were 
thrilled with the inspired wisdom of the great colonizer. They heard 
the words fall from his lips that were a comfort and a guide to them 
in their daily living. 

Those same words, now in print, can help and inspire the new 
generations. The youth should be encouraged to read this great book. 
It will help them to know Brigham Young as they have never known 
him before. They can appraise his doctrine, not by tradition or garbled 
account, but by the perusal of sermons accurately transcribed. 

"Discourses of Brigham Young" will be sent to any address for 
$2.50 postpaid. Special price to members of Priesthood Quorums — $2.00 
postpaid. Orders will be filled mail C. O. D. at $2.00 each, if desired.

WHAT DID JOSEPH SMITH KNOW ABOUT SCIENCE? 
Read: 

Joseph Smith as Scientis 

By JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

"In the life of every person, who receives a higher education, in or 
out of schools, there is a time when there seems to be opposition be- 
tween science and religion; between man-made and God-made knowl- 
edge. The struggle for reconciliation between the contending forces 
is not an easy one. It cuts deep into the soul and usually leaves scars 
that ache while life endures. There are thousands of young people in 
the Church today, and hundreds of thousands throughout the world, who 
are struggling to set themselves right with the God above and the world 
about them. It is for these young people, primarily, that this book has 
been written."

FIRST DAY

o'clock Friday morning, October 4th, the large auditorium and galleries 
of the great tabernacle being well occupied with people from all parts 
of the Church.

ness of Zion's Glad Morning." 

Opening prayer was offered by Elder Thomas WV Richards, 
President of the Malad Stake. 

The hymn, "Come, let us Anew," was sung by the congregation. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice in the opportunity of again meeting with the saints in 
general conference. I am grateful for the blessings that we as a people 
have enjoyed during the past six months. 

As is customary we announce in our opening meeting some of 
the changes that have taken place during this period.

Joseph L. Peterson has been released as president of the Danish 
mission, and Holger M. Larsen appointed to succeed him. 

A new mission has been organized in Czecho-Slovakia, with 
Arthur Gaeth as president: 

New wards organized : 

Spanish Fork Fifth ward, Palmyra stake. 

Diamond City ward, Lethbridge stake. 



Stake president who has passed away : 

Since our last conference President Fred A. Caine of the Idaho 
Falls stake has passed away. It fell to my lot to labor for three years 
with Brother Caine in the Japan mission, and to be intimately ac- 
quainted with him from then until the time of his death. I wish to 
bear witness that it has not been my privilege to ever be associated 
with a more sincere, God-fearing, capable, faithful man than was 
Brother Fred A. Caine. 

Bishop who has passed away: 

Elmer H. Johnson, Alterra ward, Roosevelt stake. 

At the present time we have : 



Independent branches are presided over by a president and two 
counselors and are practically, to all intents and purposes, wards ; they 
are not, however, considered quite large enough to be regularly or- 
ganized as such. 

There are also at the present time : 

Dependent branches 41 

Missions 28 

Branches in Missions 783 

Making in round numbers nearly 2,000 organizations in the Church. 



The new appropriations made to the stakes and wards for the 
building of meeting houses during the first nine months of last year 
amounted to $868,125.00, and this year, for the same period, they 
amount to $886,780.00.

APPROPRIATIONS INCREASE 



NEW HOTEL ERECTED 



As you perhaps all know, we have erected a hotel building on the 
corner opposite this block on the southwest, on some vacant land that has 
been held by the Church for many years. We feel the necessity of having 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a building where many of our saints who come here, from Canada 
to Mexico and from the various missions, can secure accommodations 
at a more reasonable rate than at the splendid hotel which we erected 
many years ago, facing this building across the street to the east. 

It is only fair to say to the people that we have not utilized any 
of the means in the nature of tithing that have come into the hands of 
the Presidency of the Church for the erection of this building. Nor only 
has all of the money that has been paid as tithes during the last nine 
months been returned to the stakes of Zion, but even more has been 
appropriated to them. We have disposed of property and securities 
that the Church was in possession of, in order to erect this building for 
the accommodation principally of our people. The drafts upon the 
Church have been far greater during the last nine months than during 
any similar period while I have presided over the Church. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH PAYMENT OF TITHES 

I regret to say that there are a great many of the people who are 
not paying their tithing. To me it is a marvel that any man having a 
testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged as 
Latter-day Saints can sing lullabies to his conscience, figuratively 
speaking, and not be absolutely honest with the Lord in the payment 
of his tithes. 

Tithing is a law of God and the payment of tithes brings peace and 
joy to the Latter-day Saint who does it. There is a satisfaction that 
comes into the heart of the man who is absolutely honest with the 
Lord in contributing of his means to the building up of the Church of 
Christ, and into the heart of every true, full tithe-payer. Each and 
every blessing that you and I enjoy comes from God. We are under 
obligations to him for the very breath of life, and hq gives us every- 
thing that we have. He asks us to show our appreciation and ac- 
knowledge to him his goodness, by returning to the Church for its 
benefit and for the spreading of the gospel at home and abroad, one- 
tenth of that which we receive, all of which comes from him. 

APPEALS FOR HONESTY 

Again I say it is beyond my comprehension how any man who is 
absolutely honest in his dealings with his fellow men and would not 
think of such a thing as compromising his store bill if he were able 
to pay, would compromise his ■ obligations to God. I can speak upon 
the payment of tithing because from my childhood every dollar that 
has come into my hands has been tithed, and I have endeavored in 
addition to be as liberal as any of my associates have been in con- 
tributing for the various public enterprises that have been required 
of us — the erection of ward houses, school houses, etc., etc. 

I appeal to the Latter-day Saints to be honest with the Lord and I 
promise them that peace, prosperity and financial success will attend 
those who are honest with our Heavenly Father, because they are ful- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

filling the law and an obligation, and he will bless them for doing so. 
And being strictly honest with the Lord is the most splendid way to 
teach your children faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The most 
tender portion of the human anatomy of the male variety of the 
species, it has been said, is the pocket, and there is something to it. 
When we set our hearts; upon the things of this world and fail to be 
strictly honest with the Lord we do not grow in the light and power 
and strength of the gospel as we otherwise would do. 

WARD AND STAKE BUILDINGS DEDICATED 

It has fallen to my lot during the past year, in April, to be present 
and assist in the dedication of the new Hollywood stake and Wilshire 
ward building. It is one of the very finest buildings that we have 
ever erected in any of the stakes of Zion for stake and ward purposes, 
and I am sure it will give us a very splendid standing in that section 
of the country. I rejoice in the beauty of the building and in the 
surroundings, as well as in the great accomplishment there. 

In May, I had the pleasure of dedicating the Dimond ward chapel. 
The Dimond ward is in the San Francisco stake of Zion. The 
chapel is a very beautiful one and a great credit tq the people of that 
ward. I was astonished that so small a ward could build such a splendid 
building. 

VISITS WINTERS GRAVE 

Also in May of this year I went to Scott's Bluff, Nebraska, with 
members of my family, where I attended services in connection with 
the placing of a marker by the Daughters of the American Revolution, 
at the grave of Rebecca Winters. Rebecca Winters died while crossing 
the plains, and some fifty years later, the Burlington railroad, in survey- 
ing on the north side of the Platte river, came to a broken wagon tire 
upon which was chiseled "Rebecca Winters, aged fifty years." 

They very kindly made a detour so as to miss the grave, and the 
Burlington Railroad company has since erected a fence around the 
grave and has kept the ground in the enclosure in very nice condition, 
having put down a well for the express purpose of securing water 
with which to water the grass around the grave. 

It has been my privilege and that of my wife and some other 
members of our family, to visit that spot upon three different occasions. 
On this last occasion the Burlington railroad carried ten carloads of 
people from Scottsbluff to the grave, which is a mile or two distant 
from that city. Rebecca Winters was the daughter of a Revolutionary 
soldier, and in Utah, Idaho and this intermountain country, she has 
nearly six hundred descendants. 

NEW STAKE BUILDING 

In June I dedicated the Los Angeles stake building at Huntington 
Park. The chapel and amusement hall are a very splendid and re- 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



markable structure and a very great credit to the people. I rejoice 
that we have it. The accommodations are very fine indeed, equal, I 
think, to any of our stake houses. The building is not quite so ex- 
pensive as the one in Hollywood, but it is equally as commodious and 
a very splendid structure. 

COLORADO RIVER BRIDGE 

In company with President Ivins, I was present at the dedication of 
the bridge across the Colorado river, which will join Utah and Arizona 
more closely in the future than it has been possible for them to be joined 
in the past. Formerly it required travel of nearly a thousand miles 
to get around from the north rim of the Grand Canyon to the county 
seat, in order to pay your taxes if you wanted to do so in person, 
in case you owned property in what is known as the Arizona strip 
on the north rim of the canyon. I cart only hope that Arizona will 
build a good road to the bridge and from the bridge to the Utah line, 
something that is very greatly lacking at the present time. It is about 
the worst piece of road from the Utah line to the bridge that it has 
fallen to my lot for many years to ride over. 

VISITS WARDS AND MISSIONS 

I have had the pleasure of attending some ward meetings and 
also some stake conferences during the past six months. 

In June I had the privilege of dedicating a fine ward house in 
Jerome, Idaho. The people there have had a great struggle through 
many years in constructing this building. It was rather beyond the 
capacity of the small ward, but the people have done themselves 
credit, and I rejoice that the work is finally completed and the building 
dedicated. 

In July I visited the Elwood ward in Bear River stake, and 
dedicated a small chapel there, which is a very creditable structure. 
They have placed pressed bricks around their old ward meeting house 
and turned it into an amusement hall, and it looks as fine as though 
it were an expensive building. The amusement hall and chapel are very 
creditable, and I congratulate the people on having them. 

I had the pleasure of visiting the Elmhurst ward in the San 
Francisco stake. I expected to be at the dedication of their new 
building but was unable to do so on account of sickness in my family. 

In the past six months I have attended a meeting in the San Jose 
branch of the California mission. We have a very good chapel at San 
Jose. 

In September I visited Pittsburgh with President James H. Moyle 
of the Eastern States mission, and there dedicated a fine little chapel, 
which is a very suitable structure for our purposes. 

COAST MEMBERS INCREASE 

During the past two weeks I have had the pleasure of speaking 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

in the Sacramento branch of the California mission, and also in the 
Long Beach ward of Los Angeles stake. When I was in Sacramento 
only a few years ago we had only two hundred members of the Church 
there. Today we have over twelve hundred members fh that city, and 
also a great increase in the number of Latter-day Saints in Long Beach. 

The work of the Lord is progressing satisfactorily. I am pleased 
to tell you that from all of the various missions we are receiving 
calls for more help. The reports that we receive are favorable, and 
the call for additional missionaries, I believe, comes from every 
mission that we have. There are something over two thousand of our 
young men and women out in the world at the present time preaching 
the gospel. The work of the Lord is spreading, and we are grateful 
for his blessings that are attending our labors. 

QUOTES FROM REVELATIONS 

In thinking of what I would like to say today I was reminded 
of the fact that probably twice if not three times during the past 
six months in speaking I have quoted the eleventh section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. I know of no finer section, it being a revela- 
tion to the father of our beloved President Joseph F. Smith. Not 
only is it a revelation to Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, but the remarks 
therein, as the revelation says, are applicable to all the saints who 
have the right spirit and desire to spread the gospel. This revelation 
was given eleven months before the organization of the Church. 

When the Prophet Joseph was engaged in translating the Book 
of Mormon there were a great many leading influential men who 
came to him and asked what the Lord would like them to do. He 
inquired of the Lord, through the Urim and Thummim, and many 
revelations were received, telling of the great and marvelous work 
that was about to come forth, and this is ona of them. Many of the 
men desired to go forth and preach, but you will find that the Lord tells 
them to wait. 

"keep commandments" 

"A great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the children 
of men. 

"Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, 
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both ioints and 
marrow ; therefore give heed unto my word. 

"Behold, the field is white already to harvest : therefore, whoso desireth to 
reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, 
that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God. 

"Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God. 

"Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive ; if you will knock it 
shall be opened umo you. 

"Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, 
and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion." 

I have heard a great deal of criticism in my life about our re- 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

peating over and over and over again the many things that the Lord 
has revealed to us, and appealing to the people to keep the command- 
ments of the Lord. And yet we find that the Lord, in this revelation, 
repeats this declaration time and time again : "Keep my command- 
ments." 

"Seek not for riches but for wisdom ; and behold, the mysteries of God shall 
be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath 
eternal life is rich. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done 
unto you ; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this 
generation." 

And every Latter-day Saint ought to have a desire in his or her heart 
to do all the good within his or her power for the advancement of the 
work of God. 

"Say nothing but repentance unto this generation. Keep my commandments, 
and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you 
shall be blessed. 

"Behold, thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt, desire of 
me in faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, or in my 
power, which speaketh unto thee; 

"For behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth in 
darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee. 

SPIRIT WILL LEAD 

"And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit 
which leadeth to do good — yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously, 
and this is my Spirit. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which 
shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy! 

"And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever 
you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith 
believing in me that you shall receive. 

"Behold, I command you that you need not suppose that you are called 
to preach until you are called. 

"Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my Church, 
and my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine. 

"And then, behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your 
faith shall it be done unto you. 

"Keep my commandments: hold your peace; appeal unto my Spirit;" 

PATIENCE AND STUDY NECESSARY 

"Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing 
to light those things of which has been spoken — yea, the translation of my work; 
be patient until you shall accomplish it." 

Remember the Prophet was engaged in the translation of the' 
Book of Mormon at this time. 

Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea with all your 
might, mind and strength. 

"Seek not to declare my word, but seek first to obtain my word, and then 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and 
my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men. 

"But now hold your peace ; study my word which hath gone forth among 
the children of men, and also study my word which shall come forth among 
the children of men, or that which is now translating, yea, until you have 
obtained all which I shall grant unto the children of men in this generation, 
and then shall all things be added thereto. 

"Behold, thou art Hyrum, my son; seek the kingdom of God, and all things 
shall be added according to that which is just. 

"Build upon my rock, which) is my gospel; 

"Deny not the spirit of revelation, nor the spirit of prophecy, for wo unto 
him that denieth these things; 

"Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the time which is in my wisdom 
that you shall go forth. 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in their 
sickle to reap. 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light 
of the world. 

"I am the same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not; 

"But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as will receive me, to them 
will I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on my 
name. Amen." 

A MARVELOUS WORK AND A WONDER 

This "marvelous work and a wonder" has come to pass and has 
spread all over the world where there has been religious liberty; 
and from every land and from every clime honest, faithful, God-fearing 
men and women have heard the sound of the true voice of the shepherd 
through his servants who have gone forth to proclaim the gospel. 
And men of great influence have been gathered into this Church. Men 
like John Taylor who presided over the Church, heard the gospel in a 
foreign land ; the parents of George Q. Cannon, and many other leaders 
in this Church, heard the sound of this gospel and embraced it and 
gathered to Zion and labored with all the power and ability that they 
possessed for the advancement of God's kingdom. Year by year this 
great and wonderful work has rolled on and we are becoming known 
as a God-fearing people, as a people with a destiny that is sure to be 
fulfilled. 



THANKFUL FOR TESTIMONY 

I thank God for a knowledge that he lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Savior of the world, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet. 
I rejoice in the knowledge that we are being blessed of Almighty God 
and being led by the inspiration of his Spirit in all of- our labors. May 
God inspire all who shall speak here during this conference ; may we 
go home carrying the message of life and salvation under the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of the living God that is poured out upon this 
occasion during this conference, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"It is expedient that the Church meet together often to partake of 
bread and wine in remembrance of the Lord Jesus." 

THE JOY OF FRIENDSHIP 

I came to this conference at about ten minutes to the opening hour, 
and had the privilege of greeting many friends, among whom were' at 
least a half dozen of life-long standing, and others whom I have met 
in the mission field. My soul was made happy as I shook hands with 
these dear friends. I esteem it a great privilege to renew the warmth 
of that friendship. Among these missionary friends is one who, in 
one sentence, seemed to link this opening session of conference with 
those held in pioneer days. Commenting on the fact that he 'left his 
home in Cache valley only two hours before he was sitting in this 
tabernacle, he said, "I have taken four days to travel that distance to 
come to conference with an ox team." Just that remark awakened 
renewed appreciation in my heart for the work of our pioneers ; and 
it made me appreciate, too, the privilege of living in this most wonderful 
time in the world's history when we have the enjoyment and blessing 
of so many marvelous inventions and discoveries, particularly the 
radio by means of which the British Premier this morning greeted 
the people of the United States, and everybody who tuned in heard his 
voice instantly. How easily the gospel may yet be preached to every 
people ! 

. Well, it is good to meet friends. This conference affords us an 
opportunity to do so; and our souls are made happy as we shake 
each other's hands in confidence and brotherhood. In contrast, my 
soul is chilled and my faculties inhibited if I meet one who 1 think 
is magnifying my weaknesses and who seems almost to rejoice in 
them — who turns his head rather than to shake hands. Such a man 
makes life chilly. 

MEETING GQD 

In the house of God, however, we have the opportunity not only 
of meeting friends and of rejoicing in the strength and encouragement 
that comes from that meeting, but also of meeting God our Father 
through his Holy 'Spirit. We rejoice in his presence. He is here 
today, and he has inspired President Grant. You felt President 
Grant's spirit in his opening remarks, you felt his faith, his confidence 
in his brethren and in this work of God ; and if we had nothing else 
but these blessings to which I have referred we could go away with 
our souls well fed. 

IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF CHRIST 

I wonder if the Lord did not have some such thought as this in 
mind when he said, "It is expedient that the Church meet together 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



11 



often." We meet in the house of God not as mere acquaintances 
suspicious of one another, but as brethren in the brotherhood of Christ. 
We meet in the presence of him who has said, "Love one another." 
I look forward to the time when the membership of our quorums will 
approach their quorum meetings in anticipation of that brotherhood 
and experience that fraternal feeling which strengthens the soul and 
which inspjres all to render greater service to their fellowmen. 

SACRAMENT MEETINGS 

I believe in meetings. I desire to say this morning that I feel 
impressed to emphasize what the Lord has designated as the most 
important meeting in the Church, and that is the sacrament meeting. 
In this very text which I have read, given to Joseph Smith by revela- 
tion, the Lord refers to that special meeting. "It is expedient that the 
church meet together often." Not for these general purposes to 
which I have made brief reference, but for the specific purpose of par- 
taking of the sacrament. He has designated a particular prayer to be 
offered on that occasion. He has prescribed for us only a few set 
prayers, one of which is the blessing on the bread and water. 

THE LORD'S SUPPER 

Let us first consider the importance of this sacrament. It is not 
the only sacrament in the Church. It is particularly designated "The 
Lord's Supper." But if you will recall the occasion on which that 
was given or instituted you will agree with me that the Lord himself, 
the Savior, attached great importance to it. He had met with his 
twelve disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on that memorable 
night of the betrayal. He had pointed out the traitor. He had par- 
taken of the passover with them in accordance with the Jewish practice, 
and then he took bread and brake it and said, "Take, eat ; this is my 
body, which is broken for you." He took the cup and blessed it, and 
said, "Drink ye all of it in remembrance of the blood which is shed for 
you, and this do in remembrance of me till I come ; till we eat 
and drink in the kingdom of the Father." That was given just a few 
hours before his crucifixion. That alone establishes its importance, 
but if we put the proper interpretation upon the phrase in Corinthians, 
11th chapter, which Paul used when he was teaching this principle to 
the Corinthians, we 'learn further that the Lord himself revealed the 
significance of the sacrament to Paul, and Paul gave specific instructions 
to the Church at Corinth, in regard to the partaking of these important 
and sacred emblems. Again in this dispensation the Lord revealed 
specifically how this part of the worship should be conducted. All 
God's ordinances and ceremonies are sacred but it seems to me that there 
is more importance attached to this than perhaps to any other sacra- 
ment or ceremony in the Church of Christ. So much for its importance. 

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SACRAMENT 

Now. what does it signify? You will find first that the sacrament 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is a memorial of Christ's life and death. When we think of his life 
we think of sacrifice. Not a moment of his existence on earth did 
Christ think more of himself than he did of his brethrenand the people 
whom he came to save, always losing himself for the good of others, 
and finally giving his life for the redemption of mankind. When 
we partake of the sacrament in his presence we remember him, his life 
of sacrifice, and service ; and we are inspired by that thought and 
memory. There is nothing won in this life without sacrifice. I am 
thrilled when I study carefully any principle of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and find that it is part of the whole, or rather that it compre- 
hends the whole. Truly, truth is the sum of existence. So we can 
associate this sacrament, with all truth, all life. It is all-comprehensive. 
No thing worth while is obtained in this life without sacrificing, without 
putting forth effort. The evil one thrusts things upon us but God 
asks us to reach out and get that which he offers. "Teach self-denial," 
says Walter Scott, "and make it pleasurable, and you create for the 
world a destiny more sublime than ever issued from the brain of the 
wildest dreamer." 

THE BOND OF BROTHERHOOD 

A second significance or a second principle associated with the 
administering of the sacrament is the bond of brotherhood to which I 
have made mention. In the early establishment of the Church of 
Christ the brethren met, we are told, often at day-break, to partake 
of this sacrament as in the bond of brotherhood, of oneness. They 
met, as it were, under oath, comparatively as the Roman soldiers were 
bound in unit. In the Church at Corinth, when Paul wrote to them 
regarding their abuse of this holy sacrament, they held, previous to 
the administering of the sacrament, a love feast in which the rich and 
the poor met. They brought their food with them, — the rich plenty, 
of which the poor partook. That was at the beginning, carrying out 
the passover and the sacrament which followed. But when Paul wrote 
to them he found that those who had plenty were eating by themselves 
and those who were poor had nothing. This practice he condemned, 
saying that it was not part of the sacrament. He told them to satisfy 
their appetites and partake of the sacrament in remembrance of the body 
and blood of the Christ. 

However, the element of brotherhood has been associated with it 
always. I remember when I was a boy that there was emphasized 
even more than we hear emphasized now the necessity of no one's 
partaking of the sacrament who had ill feelings toward another, 
and I have heard more than one man say: "I am sorry that I hurt 
brother so-and-so's feelings, and I ask his forgiveness." He felt it 
necessary to do that before he was worthy to partake of the sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper. 

We meet in the brotherhood of Christ, all on the same level, each 
expressing confidence in the other and all in one another. Oh, the 
strength of brotherhood ! Sin divides us. Righteousness unites. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY

COMMUNION WITH CHRIST 

The partaking of the sacrament indicates also how communion 
with Christ may be secured. It cannot be obtained by Sunday righteous- 
ness and week-day indulgence. It implies that we will remember 
Christ always. "If we show the Lord's death at communion we must 
show the Lord's life in the world." 

DIVINE GUIDANCE 

And the fourth great significance is the promise that it is a means 
of receiving divine guidance. "If a friend is one who summons us to 
our best, then is not Jesus Christ our best friend? and should we not 
think of the communion as one of the chief appeals to us to be our best? 
The Lord's Supper looks not back to our past with a critical eye, but to 
our future with a helpful one." 

THE SACRAMENT PRAYER 

May I call attention to the great obligation which every member 
of the Church assumes when he first partakes of the sacrament on 
the Lord's day. Think of the prayer revealed in this dispensation : 
"Oh, God the Eternal Father." What an invocation ! An acknowledg- 
ment of God as our Creator ; the giver of all good ; the bestower of all 
blessings ; in whom is all power and all glory ; and yet, our Father, 
and we his children. ' The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of 
man ! "We ask thee in the name of thy beloved son Jesus Christ," who 
is interceding for us, through whom all blessings are obtained, — "to 
bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it." 

Bless the bread ! It is only bread. There may be a mystery about 
the sacrament, but that mystery does not consist in the changing of 
that bread to the actual body of the Christ. As President Brigham 
Young has said, the thought is a repulsive one. But it is a symbol,- 
and we ask God to bless it to the souls of all those who partake of 
it, who witness — oh, there is the point. Recall in this regard 
President Grant's appeal this morning to be honest with the Lord 
in all your dealings. What a fundamental virtue is honesty! the 
roundation of all character. It is said to be the mother of a whole 
family of true virtues. Well, that principle is associated with this great 
sacrament. We witness, that is, solemnly covenant in the' presence of one 
another, in that great assembly, and "unto thee, O God the Eternal 
Father"— What? 

A GENTLEMAN'S WORD OF HONOR 

Before we specify, think of what it means to make a promise. 
Your word is more sacred than your bond. I like to think of that 
English gentleman who, finding himself distressed financially, borrowed 
from a friend, to whom he gave his written note ; but before the gentle- 
man received his competence, he was again in financial distress and 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



borrowed from another friend, to whom he gave only his promise. 
Both these lenders knew when the gentleman received his money and 
both called for the return of their money. The first, who held the 
gentleman's note, was surprised to hear the gentleman say, "I will pay 
the second first." The first one protested saying, "I loaned you that 
money first, your lordship." 

"Yes, that is true, replied the English gentleman, but you hold 
my note. This friend has only my word of honor. I will redeem my 
promise first." 

The first gentleman taking the note from his pocket, tore it into 
pieces, threw it into the waste-basket, and said, "There, your lordship, I 
have only your promise." 

"Since you place it upon that basis you shall have your money 
first." 

A mere incident emphasizing the importance that a gentleman 
places upon his word of honor. 

OUR OBLIGATION 

My brethren and sisters, do we always stop to think, on that sacred 
Sabbath day when we meet together to partake of the sacrament, that 
we witness, promise, obligate ourselves, in the presence of one another, 
and in the presence of God, that we will do certain things? Note 
them. I have time merely to mention them. 

The first : That we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of 
the Son. In so doing we choose him as our leader and our ideal ; and 
he is the one perfect character in all the world. It is a glorious thing 
to be a member of the Church of Christ and to be called a Christian 
in the true sense. of the term; and we promise that we should like to 
be that, that we are willing to do it. 

Secondly, that we will always remember 'him. Not just on Sunday, 
but on Monday, in our daily acts, in our self-control. When our 
brother hurts us we are going to try to master our feelings and not 
retaliate in the same spirit of anger. When a brother treats us with 
contempt we are going to try to return kindness. That's the spirit 
of the Christ and that's what we have promised, — that we will do our 
best to achieve these high standards of Christianity, true Christian 
principles. 

The third : We promise to "keep the commandments which he has 
given." Tithing, fast offerings, the Word of Wisdom, kindness, for- 
giveness, love. The obligation of a member of the Church of Christ 
is great, but it is as glorious as it is great, because obedience to these 
principles gives life, eternal life. On the other hand, the man who 
seeks to live by violating the principles is deceived by the adversary 
and goes the way to death. 

ADDING SIN TO SIN 

To partake of the sacrament unworthily is to take a step toward 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



15 



spiritual death. No man can be dishonest within himself without 
deadening the susceptibility of his spirit. Sin can stun the conscience 
as a blow on the head can stun the physical senses. He who promises 
one thing and deliberately fails to keep his word, adds sin to sin. On 
natural principles such a man "eats and drinks condemnation to his 
soul." 

We die in this world before our hearts stop beating, as we live 
and partake of eternal life before we pass into the other world ; for this 
is part of life eternal, and true life consists in obedience to the principles 
of the gospel. We promise every Sabbath day to keep those principles. 

I THE BLESSING 

And what is the blessing? "That they may always have his Spirit 
to be with them." What a divine guidance ! And I testify to you that 
divine inspiration is a reality. Men and women who obey the principles 
of life and salvation, sincerely repent of their sins, and as sincerely strive 
to live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, are guided and 
inspired by the Holy Ghost, and are shown things to come. I testify 
that that guidance is with this Church and has been since the Prophet 
Joseph Smith established it. I bear you witness too, that this Church 
is the power of God unto 'salvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

SUMMING UP 

To sum up then, the operation of the law of cause and effect is 
as constant in the spiritual realm as it is in the material world. You 
obey the principle and you receive the blessing, and the keeping of 
each promise made in relation to the sacrament brings the results and 
the blessings as sure as the sun brings light. Order, reverence, attention 
to divine promises, — the promise to enter into the fold of Christ, to 
cherish virtues mentioned in the gospel of Christ, to keep them ever 
in mind, to love the Lord whole-heartedly, and to labor, even at the 
sacrifice of self, for the brotherhood of man — these and all kindred 
virtues are associated with the partaking of the Lord's supper. It is 
good to meet together and especially to renew our covenants with God 
in that holy eucharist. "Help us O, God, to realize the great atoning 
sacrifice, the gift of thy beloved Son, the Prince of peace, the Holy One." 

GRATITUDE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE CHURCH 

My heart is full of rejoicing this morning for my membership 
in the Church, for the privilege I have of meeting you my fellow 
workers in the Church of Christ. I prize the privilege of associating 
with the First Presidency of this Church and the Twelve Apostles, 
the First Council of Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric and the 
Stake Presidencies. Oh, it is a glorious thing to be one in the brother- 
hood of Christ! God strengthen us that we may go out and make the 
sacrament each Sunday that we partake of it what God intends it to be, 
— the means of strengthening the saints, of eradicating ill will, hard

feelings and back-biting, of establishing unity, love and strength, and 
keeping the commandments of God, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the California Mission 

I esteem this a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, and 
at the same time, at this moment, it is a very great surprise. I am 
thankful, however, that I feel in my soul that I am in harmony with 
the counsels that have already been imparted in this conference and that 
I believe most sincerely in the doctrines that have been presented for 
our consideration. 

I come up, my brethren and sisters, from the mission field in 
California, where I have had the privilege of laboring for some time 
in seeking to spread the truth as it has been revealed in the dispensation 
in which we live. I am happy to be associated with the young men 
and women who have been assigned to that field of labor. Generally 
speaking, the missionaries are all young men, or young women. Oc- 
casionally, through the system that has been introduced during recent 
years, a few men of experience and one or two women of experience 
have come into the California Mission, as short term missionaries. 
We have rejoiced very greatly in the companionship of these men and 
women who have had development and experience for a goodly period 
of time in the work of the Lord. 

You have just learned from the remarks made by President Heber 
J. Grant that California has been blessed with his presence and with 
his ministry, both in the stakes that have been established in that great 
state, and in the branches that belong to the California Mission. The 
people are always glad in their hearts when they have the privilege of 
meeting with the President of the Church, and of listening to his 
testimony which has always been so strong and sure that the work 
which is under his direction as the President of the Church has been 
revealed and established by the Lord our God. 

We have been blessed just recently, for about five months, with the 
presence of Doctor James E. Talmage, who has been giving some very 
remarkable and inspiring discourses over the radio in Los Angeles; 
and many people, we have discovered, who are not of our faith, have 
been giving attention to those discourses. We have not only rejoiced 
in his ministry, as he has delivered the word of the Lord and the 
doctrines of the gospel over the radio, but we have rejoiced also in his 
companionship in the wards, and in the branches, that he has visited 
quite thoroughly throughout the state of California. We feel that 
we have been very greatly blessed by his presence, by his counsel, 
and by the doctrines that he has presented for the consideration of the 
people, both members and non-members of the Church. 

We have been blessed also with the ministry of Brother George 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



17 



Albert Smith, of the Council of the Apostles, who was appointed 
in the early part of the year to visit the California Mission. He gave 
counsel that was very greatly to the advantage of the people who make 
up the membership of the Church in the mission. 

I am glad, my brethren and sisters, that our faith in the work of 
God remains unshaken, and we feel from our experiences that we 
receive constantly renewed evidences confirming the truth as it has been 
revealed. I was impressed with the wonderful character of the work 
established in this dispensation, in reading in the editorial column of 
the Los Angeles Examiner of Sunday, September 29th, 

"The great majority of preachers no longer teach that the earth as we 
know it, was created merely by the expression of Divine Will in a period 
of six days. Practically all religious teachers now! interpret the six days to 
mean six PERIODS OF TIME, six 'geological ages' reaching over periods 
inconceivable to our mind." 

When I read this, my brethren and sisters, I could not but feel 
how wonderful are the inspired teachings of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, who in no way professed to have scientific information, but 
who always taught that he delivered the word of the Lord as thaltf 
word was given to him. It surely is wonderful that he should have 
declared almost at the very opening of this dispensation, that which is 
now beginning to dawn upon the minds of men in relation to the 
creation of the world. The Prophet taught this doctrine very clearly, 
as you can read in the Pearl of 1 Great Price. I do not know just how 
long ago the Book of Abraham was translated. I have in my possession 
a copy of that work that I believe was published in Liverpool in 1851. 
so it has been in print for a long period of time. Surely the lad Joseph 
Smith, the farmer's youth, the man without scholastic attainment, 
could not have conceived of the great truth to which I have referred, and 
taught it so correctly, had it not been impressed upon him by the 
inspiration and revelation of the Lord our God. 

I am happy to say, my brethren and sisters, that we are endeavoring 
to the best of our ability to declare the glad tidings of great joy that 
have been revealed for the salvation of the human family. We believe 
most devoutly in the mission of the Redeemer of the world ; that he is the 
very Son of God ; that he in his time, chose mortal men and conferred 
upon them the authority of priesthood, the power to minister in his 
own great name and in the name of the Eternal Father. He sent 
those men forth to preach the gospel, gave them commandment to go 
into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, and made 
the promise that every soul who would hearken, who would accept of 
the message, should find salvation in the presence of God; and of 
course, those who would not accept would take the consequences of 
condemnation. We believe, and we teach to our fellow men, that in thi? 
last dispensation, in fulfillment of the promises that have been made by 
the mouths of holy prophets, that same Eternal Father, that same Re- 
deemer of the world, have sent holy messengers to confer upon mortal 
men the authority of priesthood ; and by that authority, it having been 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



given to us by new revelation in the dispensation of the fulness of times, 
we go out among the people, not because of the commission given to the 
apostles in the meridian of time, but because the Lord God of heaven has 
said to men in this dispensation, "Go ye into all the world and preach the 
gospel to every creature." I am very happy to say the missionaries 
so teach, although it may be at times in halting words, and in fear and 
trembling. Men and women are delivering this message and are bearing 
witness that through the power of God, through the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord, they know whereof they speak. I thank the Lord 
that I have the confidence in my own soul that I am not preaching the 
doctrine of men. I am not laboring for the glory of man nor for 
the plaudits of men. I am laboring in the fear of God, because upon 
me that divine authority has been conferred, and I am under obligation 
to cry repentance, to the best of my power, among the children of men 
and to help lead men, if possible, from the darkness that is in the 
world, to the truth that has been revealed. In doing that, with my 
companions, I have partaken of that joy with them that passeth under- 
standing, and we do know that we are trying to bring to mankind a 
glorious message that is for their benefit and salvation. 

May God help us all to love the truth, believe in it and maintain 
it in our conduct here and in our speech before the people for ever 
and ever, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council 1 of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may have the 
benefit of your faith and prayers and that the Spirit of the Lord may 
actuate me while I shall speak to you for a few moments this morning. 
Sometimes we are so taken by surprise that our breath nearly leaves 
us ; but I have an implicit and abiding faith in the Lord that if we put 
our trust in him and labor to the best of our ability he will prepare 
the way for us whereby we may accomplish the things that he commands 
us to do. 

I take it, my brethren and sisters, that, as people having the gospel 
of Jesus Christ and a testimony of it, the Lord calls upon us to bear 
that testimony and make known his word to the world, and to bear 
testimony one to another of the inspiration of the Lord and the knowl- 
edge that has come to us concerning this great gospel plan that is 
instituted in the world for the salvation of men. 

During the past six months my mind has been centered very much 
upon the Book of Mormon. It has fallen to my lot to publish an edition 
of that book in the Spanish language. Our work is now completed, 
so far as the printing of the book is concerned. I think the last form 
was printed yesterday, and we have now only the binding to attend to. 
We shall soon have in circulation the third edition of the Book of 
Mormon in the Spanish language. My hope and desire is that this 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



19 



edition may soon be exhausted and that the circulation of that book 
amgng the Spanish-speaking people may increase, for in the Spanish 
language are to be reached the descendants, many millions of them, 
of those people who wrote the book. It seems to me that in the work 
that I have been engaged in — getting out this particular edition of the 
book — there has come a vision of a very wide distribution of that book 
among the seed of Father Lehi, who dwell in the land south of us. 
Many thousands of copies have been distributed in the past, and a very 
great many people have been made to know of the truthfulness of that 
record. 

In this connection my mind reverts to the promise of the great 
Prophet Moroni concerning the obtaining of a testimony of the divinity 
of that book, and I should like to read that to you this morning. You 
will find it recorded in the tenth chapter of the book called Moroni : 

"And now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good ; and I write 
unto my brethren, the Lamanites, and I would that they should know that more 
than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given 
of the coming of Christ. 

"And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of 
exhortation unto you. 

"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be 
wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how 
merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of 
Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it 
in your heart. 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true ; 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." 

I have always believed in the Book of Mormon, my brethren and 
sisters. Before I ever read the Book of Mormon, I believed that it 
was a divine record. It was taught to me by my parents, and it was 
taught to me in the Sunday School and in the Primary classes that I 
attended as a little boy. I have read this book many, many times. 
It seems to me that I have considered it from most every angle ; and, — ■ 
I say it with a great deal of thankfulness, — I have been placed in a 
position in my missionary labors to challenge the book from an archa- 
eological standpoint, and have been able to see firsthand the re- 
mains of former civilizations that have dwelt upon this continent. 
I have stood in the shadows of the mighty ruins of the past, that are 
stupendous in their magnitude and in their grandeur. I have visualized 
the people that built those great buildings, and it has seemed to me, 
beyond any question of a doubt, that they could justly be associated 
with the Book of Mormon people. From that angle has come to me 
a great bolstering faith and knowledge that the Book of Mormon 
is true. I have thought that I had read it with a prayerful heart in 
years that have passed, and felt sure that I had received the inspiration 
of the Spirit of the Lord that this book is a divine record. But I wish 
to bear you my testimony that during the last few months, since May, 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



especially, when I have been so particularly engaged in bringing out 
this work, I have prayed to the Lord anew that he would evidencento 
me, even more strongly than ever before, if such were possible, the 
divinity of this work; and I stand before you, my brethren and sisters, 
and testify, after having read the bt)ok five consecutive times since 
May, that I know beyond all doubt that the Book of Mormon is what 
it purports to be. It is the divine record of a forgotten people, brought 
forth through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. The Holy Ghost 
has witnessed this unto me and I wish that I could make you sense 
the spirit in which I feel it. It is consuming in its nature. It makes 
me tremble to contemplate what this knowledge means to me. 

My brethren and sisters, the Book of Mormon is one of the greatest 
works in all the world. With the witness that I speak of there has 
come to me other knowledge, without which the testimony of the 
divinity of the Book of Mormon would not be of much value ; but, the 
Book of Mormon being true, the truthfulness of it having been borne 
in upon my soul, I know through that as one medium — and I know, 
it through other mediums — that God lives as an entity, a tangible 
being, in whose form I am fashioned and in whose likeness I am made. I 
know, beyond all peradventure of a doubt, that he is in very deed my 
Father, that I can call upon him as such, and that when I come before 
him in prayer, in sympathy, he will hear ; and if my players are for right- 
eous things he will grant unto me those things for which I ask. 
Through this book, knowing that it is true, I also have this witness, and 
to me it is valid, that Jesus is the Son of God ; that he is the Redeemer 
of the world ; that he was born of woman and lived in the world among 
men and ministered unto them and established the gospel ; that he was 
nailed upon a cross and suffered for the sins of all men, redeemed them 
from the grave, broke the bonds of death, and instituted the resurrection, 
becoming the first fruits of it; and he lives, for this book testifies that 
he lives. 

I know, by this same process of reasoning, that if the book is true, 
he, through whose instrumentality it ' was brought forth, is and was 
a prophet of God. So I have no hesitancy in testifying that Joseph 
Smith, the man whom the Lord chose to bring forth this book, and 
to open up this greatest of all gospel dispensations, was his prophet 
and that he spoke as a chosen instrument in the hands of God. If he 
was a prophet of God, the revelations that through him have come 
and which are recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, are likewise 
the word of God. If he' were instrumental in the hands of God in 
translating this great work, which is true, he was likewise instrumental 
in the hands of God in bringing forth the Pearl of Great Price and 
the precious gems of religious thought, knowledge and history, that 
we have in that wonderful book which constitutes, with the Bible, 
the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, the standard 
Church works to which we refer in points of doctrine and in points of 
history pertaining to the Lord's great work in the world. 

I know that these things are true, my brethren and sisters. I 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



21 



rejoice in them, and I have an abiding faith and a strong testimony, 
that is as strong as my knowledge that I live and speak to you today, 
that not only was Joseph Smith a prophet of the Lord, but that each 
one who has succeeded him in the presidency of this Church is likewise 
and has been, a prophet of the Lord. 

I bear you my witness, my brethren and sisters, that I know that 
the gospel is "upon the earth and that God's Church exists, fully or- 
ganized and fully authorized. There has been a restoration of the holy 
priesthood. There has been a restoration of the keys of the kingdom 
of God upon the earth, and those keys are here in our midst. I want 
to leave you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I know that 
the Church today is guided by the spirit of inspiration and by the 
spirit of revelation and by the spirit of prophecy just as much as it 
ever has been guided in any age or at any time, including all former 
gospel dispensations, even in this greatest of all gospel dispensations, 
opened by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear you 
my witness that it stands us all in hand to- give heed to the teachings, 
admonitions, and advice of the servants of the Lord by him authorized 
and by him acknowledged to minister in the Church and keep it in 
order. I raise my voice in warning against those who presume, because 
of any motive, be it whatever it may, to better the conditions in this 
Church other than through sustaining the authority that the Lord 
has given, through whom will come the revelations to guide and to 
direct this Church. 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord to be upon this people. I 
pray for the blessings of the Lord to be upon the missionaries who are 
in the world, laboring so valiantly. Those young men and those young 
women are fine characters. They are laboring zealously for the spread 
of truth. They need your assistance, and the world needs their teach- 
ings, for they are teaching the gospel that has been restored. Not only 
does the world need the teachings and the ministry of those who are 
out there, but, my brethren and sisters, if you could only see what 
we see, who are out on the firing line, you would know that we do 
not repeat it as a mere form when we say that there is a crying need 
for thousands more to be in the ministry of the Lord, to take care of 
the ministry in the world. I have cried that from my standpoint in 
the Mexican Mission for years, and we have had the support that I 
believe could be rightly given us ; but recently for the past two months 
while in Independence, I have had occasion to visit with President 
Bennion in some of the nearby branches of his mission, and have held 
conference with him nearly every Sunday that I have been down there. 
It has not interfered with my week-day work, and I have been pleased 
to visit with him in the great mission over which he presides. In 
many of these trips we would start out late Saturday evening through 
the country by automobile, or by train. I have made inquiry of President 
Bennion, "What about missionaries through all of these towns, through 
all of these villages, through all this country-side?" And he has 
remarked, "Brother Pratt, we haven't them here. We haven't the 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



men to take care of the work that there is for us to do." I have talked 
with a great many people who would be anxious to have missionaries 
come into their midst. The harvest, my brethren and sisters, truly 
is great. The work is great. The necessity for sincerity, calling for 
honest effort, is apparent everywhere in the Lord's work. May we 
acquit ourselves as men and as women having this great knowledge, 
and bear off our responsibilities ; for, as I frequently say to the mission- 
aries in our mission, "Brethren and sisters, the responsibility of 
teaching the gospel in this mission is upon you right now. It is no 
use for you to criticize what is in the past, nor will it do any good 
for you to be particularly worried about what shall follow after you 
leave ; but the responsibility of preaching the gospel, right now and 
here, is upon the little group that is gathered together in this mis- 
sion." So likewise the ' responsibility of this work today, my brethren 
and sisters, rests upon the membership of the Church today, and the 
Lord will hold us accountable for our stewardship, for our participa- 
tion, and for our faithfulness in his work. 

May he continue to add his blessings to us, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I have rejoiced beyond my power to express, at what I have heard 
and what I have felt this morning. As the good brother who was 
hard of hearing remarked, upon one occasion, when somebody asked him 
why he went to church when he co-uldn't hear a word, "It isn't what 
you hear, it is what you feel that makes you better." I have enjoyed 
the influences that are present. My memory has gone back to the 
time when this building was first erected and as a child I helped to 
decorate the roof with festoons of paper flowers, — at least I helped make 
the flowers. I have seen the improvement in its lighting go^ on from 
then until now. I remember the old gas jets around the gallery that were 
used to illuminate this' building. I think we have now arrived at perfec- 
tion of lighting for the comfort of all who assemble, and I congratulate 
those who have installed the fine system that makes this room as 
delightful as it is possible for it to be,' as far as light is concerned. 

GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS OF THE GOSPEL 

The testimonies that have been borne this morning have rejoiced 
my soul. I am thankful that I belong to a church that numbers 
among its members men and women who know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that in this latter-day he has spoken again from the 
heavens, that the authority of his holy priesthood has been conferred 
upon men, and that we who are members of this Church have taken 
the preparatory step toward a home in his celestial kingdom. I am 
thankful for this knowledge, and when I listened this morning to the 
report of our beloved President, telling of the progress and development 
of the Church in a material way, I was greatly pleased.

Some of our associates have recently been called home. The 
Lord has said to them, "It is enough, you have finished your work on 
earth." Those who have been called to succeed them are in the service 
of the Lord in different stations. The appeals of the mission pres- 
idents remind us of the fact that disseminating the truth is not 
the responsibility of someone else, but it is your responsibility and 
mine to see that the gospel of Jesus Christ in its ' purity is taught 
to the children of men. Doesn't it make you feel grateful? Isn't 
there a sense of appreciation welling up in your souls when you 
realize that we are numbered among the comparatively few of all 
God's children who believe in him and know that he is? 

A PURE ATMOSPHERE 

I have been sitting here this morning wishing that my relatives 
who are not here might be under the sound of the voices of the brethren 
who have spoken, that they, too, might partake of this influence that 
comes from our Heavenly Father. I have wished that conditions were 
such that all Israel might, not only at annual and semi-annual con- 
ferences and stake conferences, but at all times live in such an at- 
mosphere that it would not be possible for them to do wrong. 

I remember a number of years ago a good man who was at that 
time chairman of the board of control of the Universalist Church of 
America. He came here to visit our city and attended two of our 
Sunday schools. In one of the kindergarten classes he became much 
interested. Eventually, when the school was about to close, the super- 
intendent said, "Wouldn't you like to say a few words to the school?" 
He had informed me in the other Sunday school, for he visited two, 
that he didn't feel to say anything; but when in the second school the 
superintendent asked him to speak, he said, "I would like to say a few 
words." He said, "If I could only live in the atmosphere that I found 
in that little kindergarten class in this Sabbath school this morning, 
I couldn't help but be a good man." I have thought of that a good 
many times. We choose carefully the atmosphere that we breathe, that 
we may live in health. But sometimes, in our carelessness, we place 
ourselves in subjection to immoral influences that destroy our resistance 
of evil, and we are led to do things that we ought not to do and would 
not do if under the influence of the Lord. If we would only be humble, 
if we would only be prayerful, if we would only live in such a way 
that each hour of our lives we could truthfully say, "Father in heaven, 
I am willing and anxious to do what thou wouldst have me do," our 
lives every day would be enriched as we go through this earth ex- 
perience. 

OUR LIVES ENRICHED BY SERVICE 

Twenty-six years I have been privileged, and honored, to occupy 
this stand as one of the General Authorities of the Church ; yet it 
seems but a short time to me since I was ordained an apostle and 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. During that time, 
all but three of those who were among the General Authorities of the 
Church have passed to the other side, and I realize that only a few 
years more and my summons will come. It may be only a few days. 
That's not important. The important thing to all of us is, that when 
the summons comes, when the Lord calls, we can say, like one of old, 
"Lord here am J, and I am ready." 

Our ministry is one of love. Our service is one which enriches 
our lives. The opportunity of those who preside in the stakes and 
wards of Zion or elsewhere, is one beyond all price, and if we are 
living as God intends that we should live, if we are ministering as he 
desires that we should minister, every day of our lives is enriched 
by the influence of his Spirit, our love of our fellowmen increases and 
our souls are enlarged until we feel that we could take into our arms 
all of God's children, with a desire to bless them and bring them to 
an understanding of the truth. 

EACH SHOULD DO HIS PART 

When I think of the burdens that are carried by the President 
of this Church and his counselors, and realize the responsibilities that 
are placed upon their shoulders, with all my heart I desire to help 
them, that I may not be an incumbrance, but that in the position to 
which I have been called, with you, my brethren and my sisters, we may 
each take our place and carry our portion of the load and magnify 
our calling to the honor and glory of God. 

THANKFUL FOR LOVE OF ASSOCIATES AND FRIENDS 

I have associated with a large number of men who have presided 
in the Church as Presidents and Counselors, as members of the Quorum 
of the Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric 
and Patriarchs. I have associated with many presidents of stakes 
and bishops of wards. I have associated with many who have presided 
over mission fields and auxiliary organizations. I want to say that 
all these men and women of prominence, without exception as far 
as I can recall now, have been an inspiration to me to serve God and to 
be a better man. I thank my family that they have made it possible for 
me to do the things that have been assigned to me — my good wife 
who has carried the burden at home; my children who have never 
once discouraged me from doing the work that has been assigned to 
me, but have encouraged me and blessed me, not only by permitting 
me to do my part but by striving to do their part as they have had 
it called to their attention by those who preside over them. I am 
grateful to the men with whom I associate, my brethren, for their love 
and kindness and gentleness to me; for of the twenty-six years I have 
referred to several of those years have been years of illness, of 
inability to do the things that were in my heart to do, but not one 
word of reproach or of unkindness has come from one of these, my 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



25 



brethren. From all Israel, from every corner where I have gone 
I have felt that there has been a desire that I might live, that I might 
magnify my calling, that I might be worthy of the high position to which 
I have been called. The members of my quorum have performed my 
work, apparently gladly and willingly, when I was unable to perform 
it; and now in the Mutual Improvement organization, my counselors 
and the board members have stood by me and have carried the burden, 
and in their anxiety have taken the load that ordinarily falls to the 
presiding officer. The result has been that wherever I go I feel love 
and kindness. In the homes of the Latter-day Saints, in all parts of 
the Church where I have been permitted to go, the spirit of prayer and 
thanksgiving has been present. My life has been illumined by the 
power of God and I have seen the beauties of the gospel of Jesus Christ 
as they have been made manifest in the lives of these wonderful men 
and women. 

THE LORD'S WORK 

Brethren and sisters, this is the Lord's work. Men could not 
have carried it forward successfully as it has been done by the simple 
means employed by us. Ordinary man could not have brought into your 
souls the knowledge that you possess. Neither can we as men inspire 
those in the world with the assurance that God lives and that this is 
his Church, but if we will do our part, our Heavenly Father will bless 
our effort. If we will sustain those who are called to lead us, if we 
will pray for and uphold those who preside in the various stakes and 
wards of this Church, nothing can stop our progress. The Lord 
will make it possible for his children to understand, if they are worthy 
to understand, and our blessings will be in proportion to the efforts 
we put forth to bring them to a knowledge of the truth. 

This day, with all my heart, I thank him for life, for being, for 
membership in this Church. I thank him for the Word of Wisdom. 
I thank him for the Ten Commandments. I thank him for all the 
ordinances of the House of the Lord that I have received, each one 
of which has been intended not for me alone but I have been permitted 
to receive a portion of that which has been intended for all his children, 
wherever they may be, if they are willing to receive what he offers to 
them, without money and without price. 

Brethren and sisters, let us go to our homes rejoicing when this 
wonderful conference is finished. No doubt when it is concluded we 
will say, "It is the best one that we have ever had." Why? Because 
while we are basking in the sunshine of the Spirit of God we forget 
our sorrows and our distresses. While our lives are illumined by 
his power, our souls are enriched, and we know that we are blessed of 
the Lord. The gospel teaches us that if we take advantage of our 
opportunities, all the time we may enjoy those blessings, and all the 
time the love that we now have in our hearts for our fellowmen will 
abide with us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is God's work. I know it, as well as I know that I live, and 
I bear witness of it, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Zion Stands with Hills Sur- 
rounded." 

Elder Joseph F. Merrill, Commissioner of Education for the 
Church, pronounced the benediction, after which the Conference ad- 
journed until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference was continued in the Tabernacle at 2 o'clock p. m. 

President Grant, who presided, announced that the congregation 
would sing, as the opening hymn, "Come, Come Ye Saints." 

After the singing, Elder Harry Edward Sutton, President of the 
Oquirrh Stake, offered the invocation. 

The hymn, "Though Deepening Trials," was sung by the con- 
gregation. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Amplifying sets have been arranged to accommodate the deaf. 
Those not having ear phones may secure them for each session, upon 
application to the Bureau of Information. Those desiring further 
information regarding them may secure it from the Bureau of Informa- 
tion. Seats will be reserved in the rear of the building for the deaf. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

I am happy to be at home once more after a brief absence in 
the East. I have seen nothing, heard nothing, found nothing, in my 
travels that could wean me away from the love of my mountain home; 
from my dear ones who dwell here; and from my kindred and friends 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

LAND OF BEAUTY 

When I was in Switzerland, the loveliest land I was ever in, I 
told the people there that I had come from the Switzerland of America, 
and I congratulated them on living in the Utah of Europe. This 
is a beautiful land, beautiful by nature, and beautiful in spirit. It is 
the home of the Saints of God, the home of the prophets of God, the 
home of a people who possess the powers of the Priesthood and the 
fulness of the Everlasting Gospel. That is what makes it so beautiful. 

IN THE NORTHERN STATES 

During the month of September, in company with Elder Noah 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



27 



S. Pond, the able and amiable president of the Northern States Mission, 
I traversed six states of the Union, namely, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, 
Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. We held forty meetings with the 
missionaries, saints and investigators, and addressed in the aggregate 
fully fifty percent of the Latter-day Saint population of those states. 
We dedicated two chapels in Ohio, one at Cincinnati, the other at 
Dayton, and organized a branch in that town. We also organized an 
Elder's quorum in Chicago, the first quorum of its kind known in any 
of the missions of the Church, so far as I am informed. I much 
enjoyed my labors, and the Lord was with us in our journeyings and 
in our work. 

ADDRESSING THE ROTARIANS 

On the 10th of September, I had the honor of addressing the 
Chicago Rotary Club, a distinguished body of professional and business 
men, at their regular luncheon in the Sherman Hotel, having been 
invited to deliver the invocation. I was billed upon the program as 
"Bishop Orson F. Whitney of the Mormon Temple, Salt Lake City," 
the maker of the program evidently thinking of the temple as a church, 
with me as its pastor. My daughter Margaret (Mrs. Lester C. Essig), 
who resides in Chicago, was asked by an outside friend, "Who is this 
Mormon priest that's going to pray at the club luncheon?" Margaret 
answered : "It happens to be my father" — and there was silence in that 
vicinity (if not in heaven) "for the space of half an hour." 

I was given a mo'st cordial reception, a Jewish rabbi being par- 
ticularly gracious in greeting me. After 1 1 had spoken, for I made a 
little prefatory talk before offering the prayer, a gentleman sitting 
near leaned over to tell me that he was well acquainted with President 
Heber J. Grant and prized his friendship highly. He also spoke kindly 
of my deceased brother, Horace G. Whitney. I do not recall the gentle- 
man's name, but doubtless the President will. He said the President's 
autographed photo hung upon the wall of his office in San Francisco. 

I sat upon the chairman's platform, right next to Colonel Archer, 
the speaker of the occasion, who gave a splendid talk on "Sanitation 
and Civilization." He began thus : 

"While Bishop Whitney was speaking, I was reminded of the story of the 
two oysters at a church festival. One of them inquired, 'Where are we?' The 
other replied, 'We are in the soup at a church festival.' 'Must be some mistake,' 
said the first, 'what need had they for both of us ?' " 

Brisbane's admission 

And now, to change the subject. Some months ago, I clipped 
from a newspaper a paragraph, part of a column furnished to the 
syndicate press by Mr. Arthur Brisbane, who is said to be the highest- 
nriced editorial writer in all the world. Speaking of Supreme Court 
Justice Holmes and quoting the latter's motto, "Rest is not the destiny 
of man." Mr. Brisbane added this comment ; 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"A big monument would reward Justice Holmes if he could tell us what the 
destiny of man really is ; how we got here ; whence we came ; whither 
we go from here ; what happens after we go. But about such questions a learned 
Supreme Court Justice knows as little as an Eskimo watching for seals in an 
ice-hole." 

"An honest confession is good for the soul." So runs an old 
proverb. I admire Mr. Brisbane, not only for his vast learning and his 
brilliant writings, but for his courage and candor in admitting that 
there are some things he does not know. For what he says of Justice 
Holmes applies inferentially to himself. I would not put either of 
these learned men on a level with an Eskimo watching for seals in an 
ice-hole, but if Mr. B. confesses to a lack of information as to man's 
origin, destiny and the purpose of his creation, I for one shall not 
dispute him, but content myself with honoring his frank and open 
admission. 

Whether he was authorized to speak for Justice Holmes upon 
this momentous question, I know not, but this I know : he cannot speak 
for me nor for the Latter-day Saints in general. I know of a man who 
told the world long ago, told them in the name of the Lord concerning 
man's origin and destiny ; and they rewarded him, not with a monument, 
but with a martyr's grave ! I refer, of course, to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Here is one pronouncement upon the subject under discussion, 
taken from his translation of the Book of Abraham : 

man's bre-existence and eternal destiny 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were 
organized before the world was ; and among all these there were many of the 
noble and great ones ; 

"And God saw these 1 souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst 
of them and he said : These I will make my rulers ; for he stood among those 
that were spirits, and he saw that they were good ; and he said unto me : 
Abraham, thou art one of them ; thou wast chosen before thou wast born. 

"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto 
those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space there, and we 
will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell ; 

"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things what- 
soever the Lord their God shall command them ; 

"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon ; and they who 
keep not their first) estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those 
who keep their first estate ; and they who keep their second estate shall have 
glory added upon their heads for ever and ever." ( Abr. 3 :22-26.) 

Those who wish to pursue the subject further should read the 
Prophet's marvelous description of the vision seen by him and Sidney 
Rigdon, February 16, 1832, and recorded in Section 76 of the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants. Time will not permit me to treat of it here. 

How did Joseph Smith get hold of these things ? Not by watching 
for seals in an ice-hole ; not by reading newspapers, nor by going to 
college. He received them by divine revelation, through the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, manifesting the things of God in the fulness of the ever- 
lasting gospel.

THE MORMON ATTITUDE 

About a year ago I was traveling through the Eastern States 
Mission with President Henry H. Rolapp. One of our meetings was 
in Huntington Hall, Boston. At the close of the service many came 
forward to shake hands with the speakers and ply us with questions. 
One young man, approaching me, asked respectfully: "What is your 
attitude toward the other churches?" I replied, "They are all doing 
good, but they are without the fulness of the Gospel ;" and he walked 
away thoughtfully. 

This. I believe to be our true position. There is some truth in all 
religions, in heathendom as well as in Christendom. And it is the 
truth in those systems that perpetuates them, not the errors with which 
the truth is mixed. There are millions of good, honest people all over 
the world, in all the churches, but they have not the fulness of the 
Gospel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its one 
depository. This is the claim we make. This is the "Mormon" attitude. 

REGARDING INDUCEMENTS 

Many years ago, when I was bishop of the Eighteenth Ward in 
this city, I was invited to meet, at the home of one of the ward members, 
a learned medical gentleman from Philadelphia. Elder B. H. Roberts was 
also there, and we spent a very pleasant evening. Brother Roberts 
told the visitor all about the Book of Mormon, and he listened intently. 
So did I. The gentleman then turned to me and said : "Bishop Whitney, 
will you please tell me why I ought to be a Latter-day Saint, in prefer- 
ence to being a Methodist, a Baptist, a Presbyterian, a Catholic, or 
anything else in religion?" 

I answered him in much the same language as I used with that 
young man in Boston, though with greater elaboration. "It is," said 
I, "because we have the fulness of the Gospel, and the other churches 
have only parts of it. If you were seeking the wealth of this world; 
its gold and silver, houses and lands, flocks and herds, and so on, I 
would not advise you to become a Latter-day Saint. You might acquire 
riches as an indirect result of joining this Church, and you might not. 
I have known of men emigrating hither from foreign lands in early 
days, who, if they had remained in their own country, would never 
have owned an inch of ground, would have continued to live in rented 
homes, with no prospect before them in old age but the poorhouse. 
They joined the Church and came to Utah because the spirit of the 
gathering was upon them, the gathering of scattered Israel, preparatory 
to the coming of the God of Israel to reign over the earth. And as 
an indirect result of their immigration, they became well to do. They 
took up land of their own, had flocks and herds of their own, and 
prospered in temporal as in spiritual things, some of them rising to 
wealth and affluence. But the Church had not promised those things 
to induce their conversion. We have never bribed people to come into 
the Church. If the Lord chooses to bless the Saints with riches, we are 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



glad of it — glad to see our brethren and sisters prosper, but we don't 
guarantee such things. 

"Again, if you were seeking office and authority, I would advise 
you to pass us by. You might, by joining the Church, become a bishop, a 
stake president, an apostle, or even one of the First Presidency — if 
the Lord so willed ; but we don't promise it. We don't hold that out 
as an inducement. Such things, if they come at all, come as a gift 
from God and not because they are sought after." 

Digressing for a moment, I remember hearing a young man say 
concerning our beloved brother, Senator Reed Smoot, that he had 
achieved every object for which he had set out in his youth, and among 
these was included the Apostleship. "Young man," said I, "please 
omit from that list of achievements the holy Apostleship. Men don't 
get that by aiming for it, and Reed Smoot never made such a claim, 
neither would he make it." 

There are some things that ought not to be aimed at. They are not 
to be achieved by man's effort, and ought not to be boasted of as 
trophies of human skill. The Apostleship is one of them. 

Resuming as to that gentleman from Philadelphia, said I to him 
in conclusion: 

"If you were seeking honors of that kind you would very likely be 
disappointed. Or, if you desired the Iovp of the world, its applause and 
good will, you would be doomed to disappointment by joining this 
Church ; for you would simply inherit your share of the Savior's promise 
to his disciples : 'You shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.' 

"But if you want the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel, the 
powers of the eternal priesthood, and the illumination of your soul, so 
that you can know beyond all doubt why you are here, whence you, 
came, what God expects of you, and what awaits you in the great 
Hereafter, — if this knowledge is of any value to you, then embrace what 
the world calls 'Mormonism' and these blessings shall be yours." 

god's greatest gift 

God's greatest gift is eternal life, but that pertains to Eternity. 
The greatest blessing that our Heavenly Father can bestow upon us 
in time, or while we are here, is the power to lay hold upon eternal 
life. The Everlasting Gospel, through obedience to its every require- 
ment, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, gives this power. It not only 
saves — it exalts men to where God and Christ dwell in the fulness of 
Celestial Glory. Such, in substance, was my testimony to that gentle- 
man to whom I refer, and this is my testimony to you, my dear brethren 
and sisters, in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

There is a saying among the German people that runs like this: 
"All good things are three." We have in a material way the three 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



31 



dimensions: length, breadth and thickness. We have the three com- 
ponent parts of this mundane sphere: land, water and air; also solids, 
liquids and gases, the three forms of matter. We have the three classes 
of heavenly bodies that fill the sidereal universe : suns, planets and 
satellites. And in a spiritual way it may also be pointed out that we 
have the three degrees of glory — celestial, terrestrial and telestial, 
symbolized by the sun, the moon and stars, on account of their com- 
parative brightness. I mention these things, and might mention many 
more, not because they have, particularly, any bearing upon what I may 
say, but more because I have another three in mind, to a consideration 
of which I would like to devote the few moments that I stand before 
you. 

There are three things which are indispensably important to our 
wellbeing and are naturally inherent to all mankind. We inherit them 
from our divine parents. They are divine attributes transmitted to us 
as the offspring of Deity. They are, in this, like the inalienable rights 
of man, another three : life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, of 
which we read in the Declaration of Independence. These three things 
are emotional qualities of the mind and heart of man and of our natures, 
that may and should be carefully cultivated ; but they may and often do 
exist in a very perverted and distorted form — and we are under necessity 
of choosing between these divine and noble attributes as they are 
naturally inherent to us, and their ignoble and perverted counterfeits 
which can only be acquired by ignoble and unnatural effort. It is a 
question of choice between good and evil. 

These three to which I refer are faith, hope and charity. Whether 
they be virtues or vices depends upon the form they take. If they 
assume their natural and hence divine form they are virtues, but if they 
are perverted or counterfeited then they become vices. Some people 
regard faith as a weakness, a positive vice. To believe everything you 
hear, how foolish ! They have simply mistaken credulity, the devil's 
counterfeit, for faith; they are not alike. Credulity is no more like 
faith than lust, another devilish counterfeit, is like love. 

All good things are counterfeited. Our government issues cur- 
rency in various denominations. It is known as the legal tender 
wherever we may use it, but it is capable of being counterfeited and 
palmed off on an unwary public sometimes as the genuine thing, but 
it is counterfeit. They make coins in various denominations, but some 
devil will obtain a baser metal and gild it over with gold and palm it 
off for genuine. Religion is sometimes falsely understood. It, too, has 
its counterfeit. But let us not despise the pure gold of religion because 
the devil makes a counterfeit of it in hypocrisy. 

What must we believe or in whom must we have faith? are vital 
questions if we are to choose the true, the genuine faith, and reject 
the false, the counterfeit. It must be obvious to everyone who thinks 
that if there is a plan of salvation, a plan whereby mankind can be 
redeemed from its fallen state and from death and the grave; whereby 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it can be exalted into a state of never ending joy where sin shall be 
no more, a state wherein there shall be a continuation of happy asso- 
ciations of loved ones, husbands and wives, parents and children, such 
plan must, of necessity, emanate from heaven, for only God can give 
us such salvation. Surely this is something for which we earnestly 
hope, or as the poet tells us, "A consummation devoutly to be wished." 
Do we hope for salvation or do we only hope for the sordid things 
of worldly pleasures and the gratification of sensual desires? Therein 
lies the difference between good and evil hopes. 

How then may we learn of such a plan, if plan there be? In 
answer let me say, only as God shall make it known. There is no other 
way. And how? By revelation, the very foundation upon which he 
builds his church. He reveals his secrets unto his servants the prophets. 
Then hearken unto these messengers of life and salvation, these bearers 
of the glad tidings of great joy. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and 
thou shalt be saved," for as we read still further in holy writ, "God so 
loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son that whosoever be- 
lieveth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life." Herein are 
these three attributes combined, faith, hope and charity. Paul says, 
"Now faith is the substance (or assurance) of things hoped for, the 
evidence of things not seen ;" but again we read, "Faith is not unto every 
man, it is the gift of God." Then we may well say it is the assurance 
which God gives us that our exalted hopes shall be realized. All our 
hopes of a glorious resurrection, of a future life in celestial glory, are 
based upon our faith in him, whom God sent into this world, even our 
Savior, and in his servants and messengers, the prophets and apostles 
through whom he makes known the glorious plan of life and salvation 
which dispels the gloom of death and the grave, and fills our hearts 
with hope. But says one: I have no faith in God and no hope in a 
future life. How unnatural ! How such a one must have resisted every 
natural impulse of the heart to have fallen into such an abnormal state 
of mind ! No faith, no hope. Spiritual deformities. To look upon a 
man who is deformed or maimed for life, — a dislocated jaw, a broken 
nose or an eye knocked out — is naturally revolting. How unsightly and 
ugly ! But not half so hideous or so repulsive is he who is thus 
physically deformed as he who is spiritually deformed, wanting in these 
Christian qualities so inherent and natural to all mankind. No faith : 
he does not ask and hence does not receive ; he does not seek and hence 
he does not find ; he does not knock and therefore the door is not opened 
unto him. 

No hope. How unnatural! Pope says: 

"Hope springs eternal in the human hreast, 
Man never is but always to be blessed." 

And another poet, after telling us of the pleasures of hope, exclaims : 

"Cease every joy to glimmer on my mind, 
But leave, O leave the light of hope behind." 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

Young women, you daughters of Zion, who delight in making 
yourselves look fair, I shall not censure you or find fault, you were 
created so; but if you would be beautiful indeed then garnish your 
minds, your inner selves, with these virtues, with faith, hope and 
charity ; and lift up your souls in grateful adoration to God, the giver 
of every good. Then shall these virtues permeate your whole being 
and shine forth in a matchless beauty that may not be acquired in any 
other way. Young men, cultivate these virtues; then shall godlike 
nobility be indelibly engraved upon your countenances, and that in- 
telligence which is the glory of God shall fill your souls with joy and 
gladness even to overflowing. 

"Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three ; but the greatest of 
these is charity." Thus writes the Apostle Paul to the Corinthian 
saints. Then what is charity ? Is it pity? Compassion? Almsgiving? 
Mercy? Yes, all these, but still more besides. The dictionary defines 
it as "universal love." The Prophet Joseph Smith says it is "the pure 
love of Christ." The Savior tells us that all the law and the prophets 
hang on these two commandments: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy mind," and 
"thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." This then is charity, which 
is the fulfilment of the law. This is the greatest thing of all. This 
achieved will sanctify us from all unrighteousness and prepare us for 
celestial glory. All else is merely the means to this desired end. This 
then is "that which is perfect," the rest is "that which is in part." Or 
as Paul further writes to the Corinthians : 

"Charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail ; 
whether there be tongues, they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge, it shall 
vanish away. 

"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 

"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall 
be done away." 

For the accomplishment of this end the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ has been revealed, through obedience to which we manifest our 
faith in him as the Savior of the world and receive the assurance that 
our hope for a glorious future life will be realized. No other name is 
given under heaven whereby eternal life, God's greatest gift to man, 
may be attained, other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the very 
Son of God, whom he sent into the world to be our Savior. 

Let us then believe in him and cultivate his divine attributes as 
they are naturally inherent within us, even the true, the genuine, and 
reject the false, the counterfeit; then shall we grow in the knowledge 
of God and good works day by day and eventually receive the crown 
of eternal life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

of the Presiding Bishopric 

My brethren and sisters, I assure you I appreciate the privilege 
of standing before you today. I fully realize that this is a difficult 
position to occupy. Not that it is difficult to bear testimony of the things 
of God, but one standing in this position and realizing the great re- 
sponsibility, fears that he may not do justice to his subject. In the 
spirit of humility I approach this task and humbly pray our Heavenly 
Father that he will bless me in my, attempt to address you. 

I was greatly impressed this morning with the remarks of President 
Grant. I had a feeling of joy come over me when he promised that if 
we would obey the law of tithing God would bless us. I am wondering 
how many of us are going to take this promise seriously. The Lord 
has made a similar promise before and has also reminded us that we 
have many things to do and repent of, for we are not pardoned because 
we seek to counsel in our own way. (D. and C. 56:13, 14.) Is it 
not worthwhile to receive these promises sincerely and with faith in 
their fulfillment through obedience to the laws of God? Surely none 
of us doubts that President Grant has a right to make this promise, and 
we should have no doubt that it will be fulfilled. May we take the 
spirit of this promise to our homes that we may be encouraged and 
encourage others in attempting 'to keep the commandments of the Lord. 

I was happy to hear President Grant read Section 11 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants and comment upon it. This section has always 
been interesting to me. I was attracted to it at first because it is a 
revelation given through the prophet Joseph Smith to my grandfather. 
To me this revelation contains a wonderful sermon which in my 
opinion was not intended for him alone but for all those who receive 
the priesthood. May I explain why I reached this conclusion? Since 
the beginning of the Church, men have been chosen and sent into the 
mission field to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have not been 
chosen because of their educational attainments, but because of their 
humility and willingness to serve the Lord to the best of their ability. 
One of the many evidences that this is the work of the Lord is seen 
in the results of their labors. Very few have failed in their effort and 
we have no record of an elder, while serving as a missionary, leaving 
the Church to join another. We have looked upon this condition as 
being normal and in keeping with the gospel plan. Many times have 
I heard Church members say, in some cases as an excuse for not 
supporting the priesthood quorums, the Sabbath school or the Seminary 
work, that the Lord does not require men of great learning to> preach 
the gospel, for he has promised to establish the gospel through the 
weak things of the world ; and they point to the success of our mis- 
sionaries to justify themselves in their failure to take advantage of 
the many opportunities afforded them to gain a better knowledge of 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



35 



the gospel of Jesus Christ, which, with the spirit of humility and faith, 
qualify them for this service. For faith, humility and knowledge are 
the weapons to be used in defense of truth and righteousness. Have 
we been guilty of "counselling in our own way ?" In this interpretation 
is it not an attempt to justify ourselves? Did the Lord intend to convey 
to his children the thought that they should wholly depend upon him? 
Are they not required to prepare themselves by storing up useful 
knowledge? To my mind these questions are of vital importance to us 
and I believe a careful examination of the scriptures will convince 
those in doubt that the Lord expects much of his servants by way of 
preparation on their part to qualify them to render efficient service, 
which preparation must come through a sincere desire to gain a knowl- 
edge of the gospel through diligent research carried on in the spirit 
of faith and humility. 

Referring to Section 1 :19 and Section 35 :13 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, who are the weak things referred to ? The answer given is 
he who does not "counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of 
flesh." How are they to thrash the nations? and the answer "by the 
power of my Spirit." How are they to receive that power? The 
words of the Lord to Hyrum Smith in Section 11 give us the answer: 
"Therefore if you will ask of me you * shall receive ; if you will knock 
it shall be opened unto you." "Seek not for riches but for wisdom;: 
and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and! 
then shall you be made rich." (D. and C. 11 :5, 7.) 

About eight years after this revelation was given the Lord said to 
Joseph Smith, "Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph 
Smith, I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments, 
which you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that 
I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth. 
(D. and C. 124:1.) 

We will recall that when the Prophet Joseph Smith was first 
called to this work he was a boy, unlearned but intelligent and capable 
of understanding the words of God. He was not a man of letters and 
had not learned to "counsel his f ellowmen nor put his trust in the arm 
of flesh." Realizing that there was something lacking in the teachings 
of men and believing in the promises made by God to his children, as 
recorded in the scriptures, he went to the Lord to ask. His prayers 
were answered. That weakness, "speaking in the language of men," 
became strength, showing forth the wisdom of the Lord through the 
weak things of the earth. And it took years of patient study, intelligent 
research, and unquestioned faith, to prepare him for this great service. 
And through him the Lord has given us his word to direct us in our 
effort to prepare for his service. The following quotation from Doc- 
trine and Covenants 84:106-110 is a notable example: 

"And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him 
him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become 
strong also. 

"Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser priesthood, 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and send them before you to make appointments, and to prepare the way, and 
to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill. 

"Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my 
church unto me. 

"Therefore, let every man stand in his own office, and labor in his own 
calling; and let not the head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for 
without feet how shall the body be able to stand? 

"Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, 
that the system may be kept perfect." 

It would appear that many of us have neglected to follow this 
instruction. 

"And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the 
doctrine of the kingdom. 

"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed 
more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in 
all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you 
to understand." 

"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words 
of wisdom ; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom ; seek learning, 
even by study and also by faith." (D. and C. 88:77-79; 118.) 

This quotation also gives us a better understanding of the need 
of preparation for service in his great Church. 

The time is limited; it would therefore be unwise to comment 
longer upon these passages. May I therefore read a few passages 
from the Bible having a bearing upon this subject? Let us consider 
Paul's advice to Timothy. 

"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, 
nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all 
things to enjoy; 

"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, 
willing to communicate ; 

"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to 
come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 

"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane 
and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called : 

"Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with 
thee. Amen." (I Tim. 6:17-21.) 

"It is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with 
him : 

"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him : if we deny him, he also will 
deny us: 

"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself. 

"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord 
that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. 

"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not 
to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 

"But shun profane and vain babblings : for they will increase unto more 
ungodliness." (II Tim. 2:11-16.) 

Also Paul's instructions to the Corinthians found in I Cor. 1 : 1 7-3 1 . 

"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel : not with 
wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



37 



"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto 
us which are saved it is the power of God. 

"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to 
nothing the understanding of the prudent. 

"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this 
world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 

"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God. 
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 

"For the Jews require a sign, and trie Greeks seek after wisdom : 

"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto 
the Greeks foolishness ; 

"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power 
of God, and the wisdom of God. 

"Because ' the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of 
God is stronger than men. 

"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the 
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called : 

"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; 
and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which 
are mighty; 

"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God 
chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are : 
"That no flesh should glory in his presence. 

"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, 
and righteousness, and sanctification, and'" redemption: 

"That, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." 

Solomon calls our attention to the need of such training for we 
read in Proverbs 1 :2-7 : 

"To know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ; 

"To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 

"To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 

"A wise man will hear, and will increase learning ; and a man of understand- 
ing shall attain unto wise counsels : 

"To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, 
and their dark sayings. 

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise 
wisdom and instruction." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, it seems to me the Lord has given 
us his plan in clearness, and our duty is clearly denned and definite. 
Ample provision has been made available for such training for all who 
should be prepared to engage in the work of the Lord. For years 
we have urged that young men serve as Ward Teachers that they 
might have an opportunity to discuss gospel principles in the homes of 
the saints, thus applying in actual service the information gained 
through study in their quorum and auxiliary meetings. We have also 
urged that we carry out the commandment of the Lord in requiring the 
priest to "preach, teach, expound, exhort and baptize." It is such 
experiences that give to those who go into the mission field a burning 
testimony of the gospel, and which sometimes, I am sorry to say, some 
lose after their return, because of lack of proper Church activity and 
spiritual food. How much more successful would the work be if all 
missionaries were sent out with the training and testimony found in 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those who return. In certain sections this is being done. Why not in 
all? Surely we are left without excuse when we fail, and how much 
easier would be the task for the mission presidents who are constantly 
pleading for missionaries, as well as for the missionary himself, if 
such interest were taken in him before his departure. 

"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, 
and of a sound mind." (II Tim. 1 :7.) 

May the Lord bless you. I rejoice in his great work. I am 
thankful to him that I bear his holy priesthood and that I am permitted 
to labor with you in this great cause. May God bless us and help 
us to carry on this great work and responsibility which he has placed 
upon us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

It shall be my purpose, brethren and sisters, in the brief period 
allotted to me this afternoon, to introduce to you two great characters 
with whom you are more or less acquainted and whose power and 
influence has actuated the minds, the hearts and lives of the people of 
this world from the beginning. I desire also to bring to your attention 
the work and purpose of each of these great characters which, I may 
say, are diametrically opposed to each other. I read to you from the 
first chapter of the Book of Moses : 

THE WORKS OF GOD 

"The words of God, which he spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was 
caught up into an exceedingly high mountain, 

"And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of 
God was upon Moses ; therefore Moses could endure his presence. 

"And God spake unto Moses, saying : "Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, 
and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; 
and is not this endless ? 

"And, behold, thou art my son ; wherefore, look, and I will show thee the 
workmanship of mine hands ; but not all, for my works are without end, and 
also my words, for they never cease. 

"Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my 
glory; and no man can behold all my glory and afterwards remain in the flesh 
on the earth. 

"And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son ; and thou art in the similitude 
of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for 
he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are 
present with me, for I know them all. 

"And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son ; for 
thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee. 

"And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which 
he was created ; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the 
children of men which are and which were created ; of the same he greatly 
marveled and wondered. 

"And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that His glory was not 
upon Moses ; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, 
he fell unto the earth; 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



39 



"And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses 
did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: 
Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed. 

"But now mine own eyes have beheld God ; but not my natural but my 
spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld ; for I should have 
withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld 
his face, for I was transfigured before him, 

TEMPTED OF SATAN 

"And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold, Satan 
came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me. 

"And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said : Who art thou ? 
For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and 
where is thy glory, that I should worship thee? 

"For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon 
me, and I were strengthened before him. But I can look upon thee in the 
natural man. Is it not so, surely? 

"Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether with- 
drawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And 
I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: Worship God, foV 
him only shalt thou serve. 

"Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art 
after the similitude of mine Only Begotten. 

"And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the 
burning bush, saying : Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and 
worship me. 

"And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon God, I have other 
things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can 
judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan. 

"And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, 
and rent upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only Begotten, 
worship me. 

"And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he 
began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, 
he received strength, and he commanded, saying : Depart from me, Satan, for this 
one God only will I worship, which is the God of Glory. 

"And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook ; and Moses received 
strength, and called upon God, saying : In the name of the Only Begotten, depart 
hence, Satan. 

■ "And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and 
wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence, even from the presence 
of Moses, that he beheld him not." 

Continuing further until we come to the thirty-ninth verse, we find 
that the Lord appeared again to Moses, after this great temptation, and 
made known to him his work and purpose, the end he had in view. 
Said he, "For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass 
the immortality and eternal life of man." 

If we have not already learned what the work and purpose of 
Satan is, we will perhaps learn it as we proceed. 

MAN TO HAVE FREE AGENCY 

I will now introduce to you, brethren and sisters, another great 
character in connection with these two of which I have been reading 
and speaking. This is from the fourth chapter of Moses : 

"And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses saying: That Satan, whom thou' 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



hast commanded, in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was 
from the beginning, and he came before me saying — Behold, here am I, send me, 
I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be 
lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. 

"But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the 
beginning, said unto me — Father, thy will be done and the glory be thine forever. 

"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy 
the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I 
should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I 
caused that he should be cast down. 

"And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive 
and to blind men, to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not 
hearken unto my voice." 

These two great influences being wrought upon us, and having 
our agency, we are to be judged by the exercise of this agency, whether 
we exercise it in righteousness unto salvation and exaltation or in un- 
righteousness unto our condemnation. 

satan's designs and purposes 

In the fifth chapter of the Book of Moses ; we read as follows : 

"And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things 
known unto their sons and their daughters ;" — preached the gospel to them, of 
course. 

"And Satan came among them, saying : I am also a son of God ; and he 
commanded them saying : Believe it not ; and they believed it not, and they loved 
Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, 
sensual, and devilish." 

"And Satan said unto Cain:" (A few verses farther in the chapter.) "swear 
unto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die ; and swear thy brethren 
by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not ; for if they tell it, they 
shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will 
deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands. 

"And Satan sware unto Cain that he would do according to his commands. 
And all these things were done in secret." 

This shows also, the machinations of Satan, his designs, and pur- 
poses upon the lives of men and women as pertaining to this life and 
the life to come. 

We also have an account in the first few chapters of Genesis of 
the creation and how that Adam and Eve, when they were placed in 
the garden of Eden, were tempted of this same individual, Satan. 

When the Savior came here upon the earth, and after his fasting 
forty days and nights, he also was tempted of Satan. Again Satan 
failed in his purpose. 

In this the dispensation of the fulness of times when the boy 
Joseph Smith went into the woods to pray, Satan was there. Evidently 
knowing what our Father in heaven designed to accomplish in the last 
days, through the instrumentality of this boy, Satan tried to destroy him. 

The Prophet Joseph is of record as having said that, "All beings 
who have bodies have power over those who have not — the devil has 
no power over us only as we permit him. The moment we revolt 
at anything which comes from God, the devil takes power. * * * 
All men have power to resist the devil." (Compendium, p. 288.)

A WARNING TO THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Brethren and sisters, these two powers are operating upon the 
minds and the hearts of the children of men today in the Church and 
out of the Church. Many of us are tainted, more or less, having been 
influenced by Satan, having yielded to his temptations, here a little 
and there a little ; and brethren and sisters, we are to be warned, and 
I desire in my brief talk here to lift a warning voice to the Latter-day 
Saints, for the time is to come in the last days that the very elect, if 
possible, will be deceived. Choose ye therefore this day whom ye will 
serve. 

There are some who seem to be willing to be the emissaries of this 
great being, Satan, to assist him in his work. It is a notable fact that 
those who have arraigned themselves against God's work and purposes, 
fire their darts at the head of the Church ; and we have a great many 
people now, some in the Church and some outside, who are trying their 
utmost to destroy the influence of the President of this Church; and 
I believe at the bottom of it they would destroy this work if possible. 
They are enemies to God, but they will surely find sooner or later that 
it is hard to kick against the pricks. We have known of men circulating 
literature among the saints, calculated to destroy confidence in the 
authorities of the Church, particularly in the head of the Church. 
Fault is found with the way they handle the means that are entrusted 
to their care, the tithes of the Church. Others are circulating literature 
calculated to encourage people to perpetuate practices which are by 
the Church forbidden. It is the purpose of the authorities of this 
Church to live, and teach this people to obey, the constitutional laws of 
these United States ; and there are people here who take the opposite 
course, criticizing and doing all they can in opposition to the attitude 
taken upon these questions by the authorities of the Church. These 
people, I think, are becoming the emissaries of Satan, and if they should 
succeed, no doubt Satan would rejoice exceedingly. I want to say to 
the Latter-day Saints, we do not fear any power or influence that can 
be brought upon this work or the authorities of this Church from 
the outside. The most powerful influence with its most dire effects is 
that which comes from members within the Church; and when it is 
known that men arraign themselves against this work, or the authorities 
of this Church, if they will not repent, they should be dealt with, and 
that speedily. "It is better that one man shall perish than that a whole 
nation should dwindle in unbelief," notwithstanding we should be full 
of charity toward all men as well as toward the household of faith. I 
want to say to you, brethren and sisters, you should not follow such a 
lead. 

A SURE AND SAFE LEAD 

I want to give you a guide that is sure and safe. If you will be 
one with the Presidency of this Church, and with the twelve apostles, 
you will never go astray. You will be on firm footing. There has 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



never been a moment since the organization of this Church when the 
President of the Church and the Twelve Apostles or a majority of the 
Twelve Apostles have gone astray. You are safe to follow their lead. 

And now, another thing to make you safe and secure: live your 
religion, brethren and sisters. I do not know what better advice and 
counsel I can give than to repeat what President Grant has already 
given us in this conference: Keep the commandments of the Lord. 
Obey all his laws. The law of tithing? Yes. Consecration? Yes. 
Shall we obey the command that we love the Lord our God with all 
our heart, soul and mind? Yes. And our neighbors as ourselves? 
Yes. And if we do this, surely we can do all the other things that are 
required of us. The Lord knows best and if we will listen to the 
promptings of his Holy Spirit and live our religion, we shall not be 
deceived, but shall know the truth, whether written or spoken, for we 
will be on firm footing. 

TRIUMPH OF GOD'S WORK ASSURED 

I know that this work is true. It is God's work and not man's. 
No man can succeed in this work without the help of the Lord, and no 
man can succeed on the outside against this work, or the authorities 
of this Church, for in their efforts so to do they are opposing the Lord. 
I know that Heber J. Grant, the present President of this Church, is a 
prophet of God, the mouthpiece of God to this people and to the whole 
world, at this time. He is a man of inspiration, a mortal man indeed, 
but a man who seeks the mind and will of God our Father on all im- 
portant matters, a man who seeks the advice and counsel of those whom 
the Lord has given him as counselors, a man who is leading this people 
in righteousness ; and I know that this work will succeed and triumph. 
It has been established for the purpose of preparing for the coming of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who is to take this Church and 
kingdom and reign a millennial reign of peace here upon the earth ; and 
the time of his coming is not far distant. I bear this testimony to you, 
knowing whereof I speak by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I have been greatly impressed, my brethren and sisters, by the 
wonderful spirit and power of the instructions and testimonies borne 
during the sessions of this conference thus far. I rejoice with you in 
the progress that is being made by this people. I listened with great 
interest to the remarks made by President Grant — the statement of the 
various advances being made in the Church and the building up of the 
work of the Lord. I was impressed with his statement with regard 
to the observance of the principle of tithing.

SUSTAINING THE AUTHORITIES 

I rejoice in the faith which I possess of the divinity of this work. 
I sustain with all my heart the Presidency of the Church. I know, as 
has been stated here by President Richards, that President Grant is 
inspired of the Lord — that he is the Lord's mouthpiece — and that his 
counselors are inspired. I sustain the brethren who compose the Council 
of the Twelve and all of the General Authorities. I have confidence 
m these presidencies of the stakes. They are men who are called to 
direct the various divisions of the Church that are organized and 
established. I have confidence in these mission presidents who are 
putting forth such great efforts in that important work of the Church — 
the spread of the gospel — and the building up of the Church throughout 
the world. I sustain the bishoprics. I realize the wonderful work that 
is being done by these men who preside over the various wards through- 
out the Church. I am impressed continually with the tremendous power 
that is here for good and for righteousness. I am sure that we, every 
one of us, ought to take as our motto that statement made in the reve- 
lation which was read by the President this morning, that we walk 
humbly, deal justly and judge righteously. Those things are important 
to every one of us. 

CHAPEL BUILDING COSTS 

Sometimes I have 'felt that in the building of our chapels and 
meeting houses, beautiful as they are, there has been a little too much 
competition or rivalry among some of the wards, by the bishoprics 
and the building committees, to make their new meeting houses a little 
finer than others in the same locality. It seems to me important that 
great care and economy should be exercised ; so that, while we ac- 
complish what we require in the way of providing sufficient accommoda- 
tions, at the same time every effort be made to spend as little as is 
possible of the means raised locally by the people and that appropriated 
by the First Presidency. 

INCREASE IN TITHING 

With regard to the principle of tithing, I believe that the tithes 
paid by the saints throughout the Church thus far this year amount 
in total to more than has ever been paid before during a similar period. 
Yet, as has been stated, the demands upon the Church for the vital things 
that concern the welfare and growth of this great work require more 
means to be used for its advancement. There are some wards through- 
out the Church that have as tithepayers practically the average quota 
of those that should pay tithing. It has been calculated that on the 
average about forty percent of the membership of the Church, including 
children, are potential tithepayers. That is, they are people who are 
earning means. This varies, of course, in certain localities and under 
different conditions. There are some wards, I say, where there are 
practically forty percent of the membership that are observing this 
principle.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A FULL TITHING 

Tithing means the payment of one-tenth of our interest annually. 
It is not the amount, primarily, that is important, but the observance of 
the principle in its fulness. If we cultivate the spirit of obedience to 
this principle we shall, even though our tithing be small in amount to 
begin with, grow in spirit and power and ability to pay, and the Lord 
will bless us and enable us to increase our tithes as we go forward. 
I know that this principle is true. It is a means of progress, growth 
and development. 

TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE TO BECOME TITHEPAYERS 

I would like to suggest to these brethren who preside over the 
various stakes, wards and missions throughout the Church, that they 
endeavor to teach, as far as possible, all the members of the Church 
directly, and particularly the young people, to pay their tithes. In our 
own families, as soon as our children reach the age of eight years and 
are baptized, we should encourage them to observe this principle, even 
though the amount which they pay annually may be very small ; and 
even though we may have to start them by paying for them. A.s 
children get far enough along so that they can earn a little means they 
should be taught obedience to the law of tithing, the purpose of it and 
the way in which the funds derived therefrom are employed. If this 
is done, children of the Latter-day Saints will grow up with faith, I 
am sure, in this principle. It will become a source of strength to them. 
It will develop in them stability and power for the observance of every 
other principle of the gospel. 

DIVINE PRINCIPLES PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT 

I was impressed with the statement made also with regard to our 
obedience to the commandments of the Lord generally. I believe that 
the observance of divine instructions is the most effective means for the 
best development of men and women. Recently a man declared to me 
that he believed that in this community there is the making of the finest 
civilization the world has ever seen. He referred to the wonderful prin- 
ciples which are being taught the Latter-day Saints, and called attention 
to the fact that though these principles are not being as fully observed as 
they should be, yet the extent of their observance is such that the people 
are brought to higher standards than otherwise. 

YOUNG PEOPLE THE GREATEST RESOURCE 

Some time ago a prominent banker in this state made a declaration 
with reference to the resources of the state. In effect he said that the 
finest and most important resource of this state is not the agricul- 
tural crop, not the mining industries, not the banking or other organiza- 
tions, not the commercial progress of the state — but the boys and girls. 
It seems to me, if we realize the fact that the faith and devotion of the 
individual members is the source of the greatest possible strength and 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



45 



progress in the Church, then we shall devote our efforts to the training 
and development of these young people in the living of the gospel. 

FACTORS OF CIVILIZATION 

What is it that constitutes the finest civilization? Is it physical 
development;? That is important in every instance. The Greeks 
were famed for their splendid physical prowess. They developed a 
high civilization, based in part upon their physical training and upon 
their architectural progress. Other nations have developed civilizations 
based upon military power. Others again, upon the glorification of the 
ruling power through oppression of the masses; and still others upon 
material achievements through inventions and discoveries. It would 
appear that the finest civilization must be founded upon the development 
of high ideals in a number of fundamentals, such as physical develop- 
ment, education, progress in the arts, moral standards, industrial pro- 
gress, fair dealing and faith in God. 

PHYSICAL WELFARE 

Let us consider for a moment that, living in this nation, possessed 
of a high civilization, we are greatly favored, in addition, in having 
an understanding of divine principles which will promote still higher 
standards in all of those who observe them. For instance, we have in 
the Word of Wisdom the finest guide possible for the physical welfare 
of man. Again, we are taught that in spirit we are the sons and 
daughters of God ; and that our physical bodies are created in his image, 
so our faith will tend to cause us to keep these bodies clean and sound 
and strong. 

MORAL STANDARDS 

Again, in the matter of moral progress, I think there is no people 
anywhere who receive such excellent instruction and such practical 
training in high moral standards as the Latter-day Saints. Among us 
there is no double standard of virtue. Every man and every boy is 
expected to be just as virtuous and clean in his life as every girl and 
every woman is expected to be. Marriage is a sacred obligation and 
privilege. But the Lord has declared that licentiousness is most de- 
grading and that it will limit our progress here and hereafter. If we 
fail in this vital principle of morality it will not be for lack of instruction 
and guidance. 

EDUCATION 

Also, in education the Latter-day Saints have proven by their 
works that intellectual advancement is of most vital concern to all the 
merbership of this Church. The standards of education prevailing in 
those states which are populated largely by the Latter-day Saints, are 
among the highest in comparison with the other states throughout the 
Union. The Latter-day Saint students in universities and elsewhere 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have demonstrated their comparative ability and capacity. Along with 
intellectual development we realize that religious training is just as vital. 

ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 

With respect to progress in the arts and material achievements 
the history of this people is evidence of the important part these phases 
of civilization have played in our progress. Yet, I believe that we are 
not generally giving as earnest attention as we should to the vocational 
training of our young people and to the industrial development in our 
communities. This is an age of industry. We are concerned with our 
material as well as our spiritual growth. I recommend to these men 
who are leaders in the various communities that they endeavor to 
encourage our young people to qualify in all of the vocations which 
shall be most helpful in the various communities. Through this 
training and the development of suitable industries, our communities 
can be made desirable and attractive for these young people, so that 
they may be able to remain at home and help to make all sections of 
the Church prosperous and successful. 

UNSELFISHNESS AND FAIR DEALING 

Wholehearted obedience to the principle of tithing inculcates in 
man the spirit of unselfishness. It promotes the spirit of church and 
community welfare. It encourages fair dealing, for if a man is true 
in his obligations toward God, he cannot be otherwise than straight- 
forward in his dealings with his fellowman. It helps to cultivate 
economy and living within our means. Thus we may gain material 
happiness. I think it was Benjamin Franklin who declared that there 
are two ways to be happy. One is to increase your income and the 
other is to diminish your expenses. Either one will promote happiness. 
It has been said that the first lesson in the art of being happy is to learn 
to do without and like it. I want to testify to you that that is true with 
regard to this, as well as with regard to every other principle of the 
gospel. Training in moderate self-denial is important to every human 
being, so that we may learn to control our appetites and our improper 
desires. Therein is strength and power. In like manner the principle 
of fasting and fast donations promotes the spirit of humility, charity 
and equality in the hearts of those who observe it. Surely if there is a 
principle upon which the stability of any civilization rests, it is that of 
mutual consideration among the members thereof. Pride and high- 
mindedness have been a fruitful source of destruction in nations of 
the past. 

SPIRITUAL GROWTH 

Finally, faith in God and a lively sense of his providences is a great 
source of strength in the maintenance of any civilization. The Latter- 
day Saints are privileged to enjoy a fulness of the gospel through 
obedience to the commandments of the Lord. If we keep these com- 
mandments we shall enjoy the influence of that Spirit which leads us 
into all truth, and helps us to grow in all respects that will make us 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 47 



stronger and better men and women. It promotes integrity and purpose. 
It develops stability and sound judgment. 

I am reminded of that interesting experience of the Prophet 
Elijah. You remember when King Ahab had decreed his death and 
Jezebel had also declared that the dogs should eat the flesh of his body, 
that Elijah was discouraged. He went into the desert where the angel 
of the Lord appeared and instructed him to proceed further. So he 
went on to Mount Horeb and there the evidences of the powers of 
the elements were made visible to him; in the wind storm; in the 
lightning and thunder ; in the earthquake ; and after all of these things, 
the still small voice! That testimony comes to everyone who observes 
to keep these commandments. Thereby we shall be able to understand 
what is expected of us and walk forward clearly and definitely in the 
path of righteousness that leads to eternal life. 

I do not fear for the observance of the principle of tithing or any 
other principle of the gospel if the Latter-day Saints are converted to 
the truth of the whole, and become possessed of a testimony of the 
divinity of this work through the influence and power of the Holy Spirit. 

THE WORK IS GROWING 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that this work is pro- 
gressing. I have occasion to know of many things that are being done 
under the direction of the General Authorities to advance this work. 
I do not doubt that in time there will be stakes organized in other parts 
of this great nation which will help to stabilize the work of the Lord 
in those parts. I have faith that divine instructions will be given to us 
from time to time as we are prepared to accept and obey them. I know 
that the gospel is true. I rejoice in the privilege that has come to me 
to work in this position. I pray the Lord to help every one of us to 
live in conformity with these principles that we may gain the benefits 
and blessings resulting therefrom, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The following telegram has been received: 

"We are highly appreciating the conference. Every word is distinct. 
Students of American Fork Seminary, 
E. Ray Gardner, Principal." 

The congregation sang the hymn, "O say, What is Truth?" 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Wilford A. Beesley, 
President of the Salt Lake Stake. 

Conference adjourned until the following morning at ten o'clock. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The third session of the Conference commenced promptly at ten 
o'clock Saturday morning, October 5, 1929, with President Heber J. 
Grant presiding. 

The congregation joined in singing the hymn, "How Firm a Foun- 
dation,'' after which the opening prayer was offered by Elder Leo 
J. Muir, President of the Los Angeles Stake. 

The hymn, "Do What is Right," was sung by the congregation. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I am sure, my brethren and sisters, we were all cheered yesterday 
morning as we listened to the report of our President concerning the 
growth of the Church. I was particularly impressed with it because 
it stands out in such contrast to the reports that are coming from govern- 
ment statistics with reference to other churches in this country. Judg- 
ing from the records of twenty-three churches and their status between 
the years 1916 and 1926, six of these twenty-three leading denomina- 
tions in the United States suffered an actual loss in membership; and 
while the balance showed an increase, there is none of them whose 
percentage of increase its greater than that of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

STRENGTH AND GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 

The record shows that so far as our Church is concerned the amount 
expended for meeting houses during the past nine months exceeds that 
for any similar period. This stands in contrast to the record of churches 
in the United States. On good authority we are informed there are 
twenty-five thousand vacant churches in the United States without a 
pastor or a congregation ; while here there is growth such as the Church 
has never had before, with increase and prosperity attending the mem- 
bership of the Church. 

It is delightful to know that in an age when churches are being, 
tested and tried and shaken, and doubt and uncertainty are developing, 
here there is strength, here there is power, here there is solidity; and 
in the most enlightened age that the world has ever known for this 
Church to be making its most rapid progress, surely is hopeful. 

But I am not so much concerned with the material growth of the 
Church or its increase in membership as I am with its growth in good 
works, in righteousness. I am sure if the Latter-day Saints can be in- 
duced to live up to that high standard which God has established for us, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



49 



we need not worry about the Church's growth in membership nor its 
material srtength. 

"we believe in being honest" 

I want to read the thirteenth Article of Faith, because there is in 
it something I would like to speak about, as I feel that the attention 
of the Latter-day Saints needs to be called to it because of conditions 
that obtain in the world that will naturally affect us. 

"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing 
good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul — 
We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and 
hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or 
of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." 

It is that first declaration of the Prophet in announcing items in 
the faith of the Latter-day Saints that I wish to speak of : 
"We believe in being honest." 

Why I speak of this is because we are in an age of self-indulgence 
so far as the world is concerned, and men are endeavoring to accom- 
plish their ends not always with honest methods. Short cuts are being 
taken to secure those desirable ends. The records of the United States 
for the last year show, for instance, that there was stolen from the 
citizens of this country by hold-ups, at the point of a gun, two billion 
six hundred and fifty millions of dollars, all of course unlawfully taken. 
No spirit of honesty here. In stock swindling sales, wherein dis- 
honesty is practiced, and sometimes within the law, there was taken 
from the people of the United States over six billions of dollars last 
year. There was lost through trusted employees committing forger- 
ies and thefts one hundred million dollars. The total of these three 
items for one year is something like nine billions of dollars. How long 
could this order of things continue to increase as it has been doing until 
this would no longer be a land of safety and security, but of unsafety and 
insecurity? If the spirit of dishonesty is in the world naturally we will 
be influenced by its effects, because we live in a very small world to- 
day. What affects any portion of this country or the world, naturally 
affects us. Recently surety companies guaranteeing the honesty and in- 
tegrity of men in positions of trust have doubled their rates because 
of the increasing number who are untrue to their trust. 

It all impresses me, my brethren and sisters, with the need of our 
harking back to that high standard of old rugged honesty established 
by the men who laid the foundations of this work. It is here yet, 
yes ; but if we preserve it we must be vigilant, or we shall succumb to 
the influences that are in the world to corrupt men. 

MR. STUDEBAKER'S TRIBUTE. 

I remember being impressed years ago with the standard of 
Mormon honesty and integrity, when at the close of a street meeting in 
the city of South Bend, Indiana, an elderly gentleman wearing a high 
silk hat, who had driven up in a carriage, asked permission to speak. 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



He was given the privilege and said to the people of that city: "I 
want you to be kind to these Mormon elders. Their people are my 
friends. I have known them for many years. They have a motto 
that appeals to me, and I have discovered that they are living up to 
their motto, which is that "a Mormon's word is as good as his bond." 
He remarked that he had sold President Young his first cutter and 
carriage after arriving in the valley, and that he had sold millions of 
dollars worth of vehicles to the Mormon people. He declared that he 
had not lost a single dollar on a Mormon. He further remarked, "I 
cannot say that of any other community where my company is doing 
business." 

The old gentleman was Mr. Studebaker, the founder of Studebaker 
Brothers. I was thrilled to hear his testimony after years of associa- 
tion with our people, that he had discovered that their word was as 
good as their bond. I believe it will be a word in good season to ask 
the membership of the Church to preserve sacredly this high standard. 
I believe that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints are doing so. 

A RULE OF CONDUCT 

I have been thinking about what in this connection I might give as 
a rule of conduct to follow to preserve this spirit of honesty ; and the 
thing that has impressed me is that God, in the establishment of the 
law of tithing, of which President Grant spoke yesterday morning, was 
laying down a course for the Latter-day Saints to foliow that would 
lead them to be honest with Him first. And I believe that it is essen- 
tial that we shall be honest with God in order to be fully honest with 
our fellow men. I believe that the man who understands the law of> 
tithing and accepts it as the word of the Lord and is not true to it will 
find it easy not only to rob the Lord but to be untrue to his fellow men. 
I believe that the first step that men take toward disregarding the laws 
of man is to disregard the laws of God. 

When France sought to maintain her government, her civilization, 
by appealing to the rule of Reason, and God was out of the question, 
she soon came to difficulty. No nation can fully preserve its institu- 
tions and wholly disregard God. This government, mighty as it is, 
and greater as it may become, shall still have to observe and to honor 
the laws of God, the God of this land, who is Jesus Christ, according 
to the Book of Mormon prophets, or it cannot stand. So I believe 
that one of the finest practices to inculcate into the very hearts of men 
true, genuine honesty is to teach them to be honest before God. "Will 
a man rob God" ? He asked of the children of Israel of old, and yet 
He charged them with having robbed Him in tithes and in offerings. 

Here is a chance for men to develop honesty without fear of 
oppression, without fear of being sued; for the Lord will not sue a 
man. He gives him the privilege of practicing the principle of honesty 
out of the high motives of his own heart, impelled towards justice to 
God, with only the highest principles moving him, and without fear of 
the collector. I believe therefore that the Latter-day Saints will do 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



51 



well to consider this law as the foundation upon which genuine honesty 
may be built, not only between God and man, but between man and 
his fellow man. 

god's rental 

Surely this is a righteous law. It is merely God's rental. A 
man who gives you right to possess property and the privilege of re- 
ceiving returns from that property, naturally expects a rental for the 
use of the land. But what does he guarantee? That the sun will 
shine ; that the moisture will come ; that the frost will be stayed ; that 
the soil will germinate? No, he guarantees none of these things , — 
only right and title to the land. And still we expect to pay rental for 
that right and title. Who supplies these more essential things — the 
moisture, the fertility of the soil, the sunshine, the harvest? God Al- 
mighty, who provided the earth itself, the proprietor. He wants men 
to recognize that He is the proprietor, through observing the law of 
tithing. Any man who fails to pay his just tribute to the provider of 
these more important and essential things for the sustenance of life, is 
robbing the Lord and is not just in his dealings. 

A HIGHER LAW 

When the Lord gave this Church the correct principles that shall 
ultimately be established, known as the Order of Enoch, or the United 
Order, it was a high ideal for them to aim towards, something to work 
for, but they lacked preparation for it. When he introduced the law 
of tithing, he called it a schoolmaster bring us to that higher law. 
Men and women who can live up to th ; s law of tithing will be better 
prepared for that day to come, for come it will, when there will be 
some prepared and ready to maintain that higher law which shall be 
established in the just economy of God, when Christ reigns with men 
upon earth. 

THE LAW OF INHERITANCE 

And further than that, do we not hope and expect to have an in- 
heritance in the celestial kingdom, even upon this earth in its redeemed 
and sanctified state? What are the terms under which we may ob- 
tain that inheritance? The law of tithing is the law of inheritance. 
It leads to it. No man may hope or expect to have an inheritance on 
this celestial globe who has failed to pay his tithing. By the payment 
of his honest tithing he is establishing a right and a title to this inherit- 
ance, and he cannot secure it upon any other terms bat by complying 
with this and other just requirements ; and this is one of the very essen- 
tial things. 

THEY WHO ENTER THE CELESTIAL KINGDOM. 

I was asked by one of my brethren recently, as he closed the 
vaults of one of the great banks, to lock up the treasures, whether I 
thought the day would ever come when treasures could be and would 
be preserved without fear of being stolen and it would not be necessary 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to lock them up. I remarked that surely that day will come, for all 
those who will enter into the celestial kingdom will be so honest that 
they could live and walk within hand's reach of that which is not theirs 
with nothing to prevent them from possessing it, following that high 
standard established in the gospel of Christ, and the rectitude of their 
own intentions being worked out in actual living. For they who enter 
that state will be so honest that God can pave the streets with gold and 
set the walls with jasper and diamonds, without any fear of their be- 
ing stolen. Yes, there will come such a day. Now, however, we are 
being proven to see whether we are worthy to enter into these high 
and holy privileges. 

When Pope said that "an honest man is the noblest work of God," 
he uttered a truth. I care not how many privileges and blessings, 
come to men, what their ordinations and baptisms may have been, there 
is no possibility of their entering into the presence of God by dishonest 
means. 

Peter said unto the baptized saints in his day, that unto their 
baptism, they must add faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, pa- 
tience, godliness. What is godliness ? It is honesty, integrity, purity 
and virtue. These qualities must be added if men shall seek to gain 
admittance into that high presence. We cannot for a moment consent 
to the conceptions of many in the world, that mere ceremonies and 
ordinances, important as the}' are, are the all-fundamental and impor- 
tant things. They are fundamental, they are important, but the more 
important thing is the living of the gospel, preparing to enter into that 
presence by receiving the training necessary and essential; and one of 
those essential things is to develop within us the spirit of honesty, so 
that we will be honest with God and honest with our fellow men. 

THE BANKRUPTCY LAW 

There is a law called into existence for the relief of men who are 
oppressed because of their creditors, and through taking bankruptcy 
men may be released from their obligations. I have many times been 
asked the question, who is justified in taking bankruptcy to avoid an 
obligation ? My answer has been — and I would like to make it here, 
and if I am wrong I stand to be corrected — that no Latter-day Saint, 
so long as his creditors give him the chance, the faintest chance, to work 
out and meet his obligations, ought to resort to accepting the law of 
bankruptcy. It is only for those who are oppressed, those who have 
no chance, no hope, and nothing but oppression following them. They 
may be justified, but surely no one who can possibly work out his 
problems with his creditors, ought to resort to this means of relieving 
himself of his obligations. 

A PRECIOUS HERITAGE 

When my father died he was a poor man with a large family, but 
he left us a credit that I have counted as worth more than millions. I 
never knew him to do a dishonest thing in all his life, nor would I be 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



53 



ashamed for the whole world to see his acts revealed. I confess to you 
that has been a greater joy and strength to me than money would have 
been. I plead with you to leave that kind of an inheritance to your 
sons and your daughters, that they may be stimulated and inspired by 
your honesty, by your integrity, by your dependability, to be honest 
with God and with their fellow men; that that heritage may be left! 
with them that may inspire them to go on and perpetuate these high 
standards in preparation for the more glorious things that are to come 
to those who can maintain such high ideals. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints that we may not forget, in this 
season of harvesting our bountiful crops, to settle with the Lord and 
to settle honestly and justly and fully;' that we may see growing in 
ourselves that spirit of honesty that shall support and sustain us dur- 
ing these perilous times that are upon us and that shall come. I pray 
for it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

of the Presiding Bishopric 

I desire to express appreciation for my membership in this 
Church and how thankful I am that the gospel found me in my youth ; 
how glad I am to be in the service of the Lord, and my desire is to be 
loyal to my brethren. 

The Lord has blessed me with a testimony of the truth. I am 
so thankful that I am not tossed about with every wind of doctrine that 
blows. I firmly believe in my God, the Father; and in my Redeemer, 
Jesus Christ ; and in the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I want to call attention to an incident in the life of our Master. 
This was the last day of his public ministry. He was in Jerusalem 
on that fateful Tuesday before his crucifixion. There, near the 
Temple treasury, he was questioned by Pharisees, Sadducees and 
scribes. First, the Pharisees asked him this question: "Is it lawful 
to pay tribute to Caesar?" Then a group of Sadducees questioned him 
concerning a woman who had seven husbands and whose wife 'would 
shall be in the resurrection ? Then there came to him out of the crowd 
a lawyer or scribe who propounded a very important question. May 
I quote from the 12th chapter of the gospel of St Mark: 

"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, 
and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first 
commandment of all? 

"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O 
Israel; The Lord our God is : one Lord: 

"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength : this is the first command- 
ment. 

"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth : 
for there is one God ; and there is none other but he ; 

"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with 
all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is 
more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 

"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, 
Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." 

If our deep sense of responsibility to our God and 'to our fellow- 
men were understood as our Master intended it to be, there would 
be few other laws needed. There would be no occasion for the states 
of the Union to enact thirteen thousand laws a year if we were living 
the two great laws given by Jesus. 

To love one's neighbor is to be a brother to him in the largest, 
deepest and most serious sense of the term. Neighborliness is help- 
fulness, sympathy, kindliness and good will, without any expectation 
of reward. To expect a reward would defeat the very ideals of 
neighborliness. 

Men and women throughout the United States and in this great 
Latter-day Saint Church of ours are trying to apply this law. Rich 
men are disposing of their wealth so that it will be helpful to their 
neighbors. There are some wonderful examples in this country, of the 
distribution of great wealth to help those less fortunate. 

Among the Latter-day Saints the principle of neighborliness has 
prevailed. Years ago I listened to a discourse by President Anthon 
H. Lund. He emphasized the fact that all mankind are our neighbors, 
but particularly those of the household of faith. 

Every person should be given an opportunity to live a normal 
life, and bishops are anxious that the members of their respective 
wards should have this opportunity. Organizations and societies, 
particularly the great Relief Society, are always helping men and 
women to live a normal life. To live such a life it is necessary that 
the individual have health, an occupation, recreation, an education, 
and a love of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The man without employment 
is not living a normal life. Every man should be earning a livelihood 
for the maintenance of his family. If he does not do this, then someone 
else must do it, and this frequently leads to the loss of self-respect 
and pauperism. 

The early pioneers came here almost destitute, but with courage 
and determination they wrung from the soil the necessities for their 
sustenance. They took the wool from the sheep; hides were tanned 
into leather ; cotton was cultivated ; and clothing was made, mostly 
at home. Later factories developed. These were small community 
industries, but they answered the purpose and provided clothing and 
other necessities for the people. Later came an effort to establish 
the United Order, but the Latter-day Saints were not prepared for 
this system of living. Then that great statesman and prophet, Brig- 
ham Young, established in many of the communities of the Latter-day

Saints a cooperative system of buying and selling. Some of these 
stores are still doing business. Now we are in a competitive era or 
epoch where great aggregations of capital controlling highly specialized 
industries, practically dominate the avenues of production. This has 
compelled men and women to sell their handicraft and ability — what 
we call labor — for wages upon which they live. Now we have the 
chain system of buying and selling. What the future holds for the 
working man is difficult to foresee. 

One of the greatest problems, however, is that of employment, 
especially for our brethren and sisters who have passed middle age. 
The other day I read of one great establishment employing fifty 
thousand men and women. The average age of these employees is 
thirty-two years. Today is the young man's day. Our older brethren 
are having quite a struggle. Some of them have reared families, sent 
boys and girls into the mission field, and haven't been able to accumu- 
late means to sustain themselves in their old age. Tragedy comes into the 
lives of these men when notice is given them that their services are 
no longer needed. 

There are quite a number of our people who have failed in their 
little communities. They become despondent, and, seeing rosy ad- 
vertisements in the newspapers, think that if they could only get to 
Salt Lake City they could obtain employment. Many of them suffer 
disappointment. 

Then there is the problem of the young missionary, nearly a 
thousand of whom return from the missions each year and find it very 
hard to establish themselves in the communities where they formerly 
lived. There is also the problem of the widow left with a family to 
rear, whose only possession may be a little home and lot. She feels 
that if she could get to Salt Lake she would be able to do housework, 
cleaning, etc. Most of this class are disappointed. There are many 
other angles to this situation which time will not permit me to mention. 

Winter is coming and many who are now employed will soon be 
discharged. They will come to the bishops and others for help. As 
much as possible is, being done by the employment department of the 
Presiding Bishop's Office and by the General Board of Relief Society, 
but this is largely local. It furnishes help to those only who live within 
a small radius. There are thousands of others who need assistance. 
In order to reduce this unemployment, may I make a few suggestions. 
First, that the presidents of the stakes and high councils, in their 
monthly meetings, discuss the local situation and try to furnish employ- 
ment for people who are out of work in their own stakes. Second, the 
bishoprics of wards at their monthly meetings with the ward teachers 
should inquire of those in need of employment in ' the various districts. 
Then every member of that ward should try to furnish it. Third, at 
the regular bishopric meeting, which should be held every week, the 
bishopric of the ward should discuss and if possible provide ways and 
means of helping those who are seeking employment. Fourth, the 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood should also help. Their meet- 
ings should be something more than calling rolls and discussing doctrine, 
important as such work may be. If the one hundred and three quorums 
of high priests, the one hundred quorums of seventy, and nearly five 
hundred quorums of elders, would make it their business to look after 
the temporal welfare of their members, marvelous things could be 
done. There are approximately two thousand classes of high priests, 
seventies and elders in the various wards, some of these units being 
quite small, others large, and if they made it a part of their business 
to find out who is seeking employment, no doubt many could be found 
employment. All it needs is a little more sympathy, a little more 
kindness, a little more helpfulness, so that we may show our Master 
that we are trying to love our neighbor. 

There is another story of the Master on that fateful Tuesday that 
I desire to mention. After he had left the temple he went with his 
disciples upon the Mount of Olives and made this statement concerning 
the future: 

"When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with 
him, then shall' he sit upon the throne of his glory: 

"And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them 
one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats : 

"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

"Then shall the King say unto them on his right 'hand, Come, ye blessed 
of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the 
world : 

"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty and ye gave 
me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 

"Naked, and ye clothed me : I was sick, and ye visited me : I was in prison, 
and ye came unto me. 

"Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee an 
hungered, and fed thee ? or thirsty, and gave thee drink ? 

"When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in ? or naked and clothed 'thee ? 

"Of when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came Unto thee ? 

"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, 
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have 
done it unto me." 

The Lord has not blessed all with the same power and ability to 
acquire wealth. Let us have sympathy for our unfortunate brethren. 
The unemployment problem would not be a serious one if the members 
of this great Church of ours would all lend a helping hand and make 
every effort to retain in the wards not only elderly persons and widows, 
but the young men and women who frequently leave the community 
to seek employment and who are so badly needed in the communities 
where they were reared. 

May the Lord add his blessings to these thoughts. May we think 
seriously of the suggestions I have made, and may the power and 
strength of this great congregation be applied as the Master desires — 
in service to our fellowmen. Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am very glad and happy that we as A people have passed safely 
over another six months period. 

I desire to say to you that my life is being crystallized into a very 
few things that are important to me. The great hope that I have is to 
be saved in the kingdom of God. I have a great desire to be true and 
faithful and devoted in my work; to be honest, frank and straight- 
forward with the people. I know of no other way. I can see no other 
outlook, and I have no other desire than to sustain the priesthood of 
God, to uphold those whom we sustain as prophets, seers and revelators 
in the Church of Christ. If there is not safety in this there is no 
safety for the Latter-day Saint people. 

I have never in all my travelings and teachings among the people 
been told what to say. I realize the importance of this occasion. I 
understand what time means. At the conference six months ago I 
was fortunate in being called upon, and I occupied three minutes. To 
my surprise I was complimented everywhere I went. People say it 
was the best sermon I ever preached. Of course, did I believe what 
they said to me I would close now ; but I have what I think is a message, 
at least I desire to call your attention to a certain matter that transpired 
with me this year. 

About the fourteenth or fifteenth of August Dr. George W. Middle- 
ton, together with Elder Levi Edgar Young and the doctor's son, (I 
was an invited guest), went by auto to Casper, Wyoming, 515 miles 
distant from Salt Lake City. The purpose of the meeting which we 
there attended, was to honor the pioneers. It was held under the 
auspices of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association. The officers of 
this Memorial Association are as follows : President, Howard R. 
Driggs; Vice-President, David G. Wylie; Secretary, Ellen Eaton; 
Treasurer, Guthrie Y. Barber. There are also fifteen directors. Dr. 
Middleton is appointed to look after the markers in Utah. 

I now read the parting words of Mr. Meeker: 

" 'I am not quite ready to go ; my work is unfinished,' were at once a benedic- 
tion and a request to the Memorial Association. They reflect the inner spirit 
of the foundation of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association. At the same 
time they lay sacredly upon us the great cause for which he gave his last full 
measure of devotion." 

It is not my purpose to enlarge upon this Oregon Trail subject. 
Never before, strange to say, (and I was born soon after the people 
arrived in this valley) did I get the spirit of what it all meant. I have 
never understood, I have never comprehended, what it all meant to 
our fathers and mothers, the pioneers. But I confess to you that I 
have had that feeling burning within my bosom, that desire, to do 
honor to those great men and great women who made it possible in 
this day for us to enjoy all the comforts of life.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I quote from Professor Driggs: 

"We are brought a little closer to the tragic cause of it all when we realize 
that fully twenty thousand lost their lives in an effort to reach the Golden West 
They had no means of marking the graves of the dead in those prairie stretches. 
Only one grave out of all of the twenty thousand, so far as we know, is surely 
marked. I refer here to the grave of the pioneer mother near Scott's Bluff, 
Nebraska. When Rebecca Winters passed away one of the company had the 
forethought to pick up an old wagon tire that lay along the trail. Bending 
it into an oval he set the tire within the grave. On the top of the tire was chiseled 
the mother's name and age. A party of surveyors laying out the railroad along the 
North Platte happened by mere chance to run their line right over the mother's 
grave. Then the surveyors, with a touch sympathy that is beautiful to think 
of, went back for twenty miles and changed the line of survey, that it might 
miss the mother's grave." 

That is the purpose of this organization, and they contemplate in 
the year 1930 a great gathering at Independence Rock. They desire 
to make that a national marker in the United States. It is a great 
barren rock. I have read of it many times but never saw it before. 
These markers will call the attention of the people to what has been 
accomplished by these pioneers, a thing that many people know very 
little about. I desire to be one among the number to honor such men 
and women. 

At Casper we held a meeting Friday evening. I think there were 
something like two hundred people assembled, who were among the 
best and choicest of the people of that community. Professor Driggs, 
Elder Levi Edgar Young and Dr. Middleton talked. The people were 
friendly, they were courteous, they were in sympathy with the Mormon 
pioneer people as well as the Memorial Association of the Oregon trail. 

There is a story — it is beautiful — I love to make an effort to tell 
it. The history of the West sounds like tales of the Arabian Nights; 
but as far as I know only parts of it have ever been told. 

Dr. Driggs asks: "Will the warp hold? It will hold providing 
we can keep alive the sacred stories of the pioneer builders of this 
nation in the hearts of American boys and girls." 

Coincident with the Mormon Pioneer movement their prophet 
prophesied they would go to the Rocky Mountains, and, in a way, they 
were forced to go west. They started out not for conquest, not intent 
upon spoil, but to worship God, build up cities, do mighty deeds and to 
build for greater happiness. 

Had it not been for great spiritual leaders this barren wilderness 
could never have been peopled in so short a time, and it would not have 
gained much momentum had it not been for immigration. It would 
appear that this people threw themselves almost blindly into what would 
seem to the natural man, impossible, but under the leadership of inspired 
men they accomplished the unbelievable. 

We must not forget to remind the next generations of the glorious 
strength of faith, hope, courage and the love of God they possessed. 

Try to remember that the pioneer, no matter of what race, is 
fast disappearing. Often he is a tragic figure. History is leaving him 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

behind. Few of us are so gifted as to be able to attract and to converse 
intelligently with our own children. A parent must be a genius to tell 
of the days of their strength, the days of their suffering, sorrows and 
defeats, and yet make clear how they won glorious victories. 

The next generation cannot feel, neither can they understand, 
sense or appreciate what it all means, surrounded as they are with ease, 
comforts and luxuries. They are unmindful, and it should be burned 
into their souls and memories, to respect the doting pioneer, tottering 
with old age, to remember their minds are stored with the richest ex- 
perience and historic lore. 

We have no way of testing and proving the next generation, 
through trials, sacrifices and suffering; neither can we force these 
historical truths upon them, and to reason would seem fruitless. It is 
said: "People shape their lives largely the way we are today living." 

I have thought a great deal about our fathers and mothers and 
their great object, and I have wondered what it was that the Latter-day 
Saint people had — the desire, the ambition, the faith and the hope — 
that enabled them to sacrifice, suffer and die for the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I am made to understand what their great objective was. 
Something new had transpired. God the Father and Jesus Christ the 
Son had appeared to that young man Joseph; and also the everlasting 
gospel, a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ and the power 
of God unto salvation, had been revealed. The restoration of the 
gospel, the restoring of the priesthood with all its keys and its powers 
and authorities were conferred upon these men ; also the eternity of the 
marriage covenant, including a plurality of wives. 

The bringing forth of the Book of Mormon, the redemption of 
Zion, and the building up the City of Jerusalem, and the gathering 
of the Ten Tribes — these were the great objectives that were placed 
before our fathers and mothers. 

I often think of mother, and while she was a very practical woman, 
a woman who lived by faith, a woman who had suffered and sacrificed, 
a woman who had left her whole race of people and was the only one 
we know of who has ever been converted from her immediate family, 
yet mother had that great vision of the celestial glory, of becoming a 
queen. And surely she is a queen, because when I visited her people 
I brought to her over one hundred names of her ancestors, and we went 
into the temple at Logan and did the work for that good mother of ours. 

That was the dream, that was the great vision, that they had of the 
future; and that was why they were sustained in their suffering and 
in their sacrifices and in their troubles and in their tragedies. 

My dear brethren and sisters, what is your objective? That ques- 
tion has been put to me more than once. Our objective is to carry out 
the will of God and through the direction of his servants the prophets 
to fulfil every prophecy and every revelation that we find written in 
the Doctrine and Covenants ; for surely God will not forsake his people 
if they will repent of their sins. It is needless for me to say more. 

For the past week or so I have read the Book of Mormon through, 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and I was surprised how deeply interested I became in the people who 
inhabited this continent. I discovered that whenever they served God 
and kept his commandments they prospered in the land ; and whenever 
they failed (and I hope we will never fail) then came their destruction, 
until that people became extinct. 

I pray God to bless you. I pray God to be with each and all of 
us, for I do not believe that a man can remain faithful in this Church 
and devoted and true to his covenants, who fails to keep the com- 
mandments and who has not a testimony that Jesus is the Christ. To 
this end I pray that the blessings of the Lord may rest upon us, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I realize that I am standing in the presence of the strength of 
Israel ; in the presence of men who have been tried and proved ; who 
have been called to responsible positions in the Church, in stakes, in 
wards, and in missions. These calls have come because of integrity 
and obedience to the principles of the gospel and the kingdom of God. 

DUTIES OF WATCHMEN ON THE TOWERS 

I desire to address myself more particularly to you, my brethren. 
We are watchmen on the towers of Zion. The Lord has placed in our 
hands great and wonderful responsibilities. No men anywhere in all 
the earth, no matter what their calling, hold responsibility equal to 
that which we have received, for we have had conferred upon us the 
priesthood of God. We are possessed of divine authority and have 
been set apart as his servants and watchmen upon the towers of Zion. 
Our duty is to teach, to guide and direct the members of the Church 
in the path of righteousness. Our duty is to set examples before the 
world, that they, seeing our good works, may glorify our Father in 
heaven, and have faith and confidence in us. It is our duty to warn 
all men and endeavor to teach them the truth, so that those who will 
not hearken may be left without excuse. 

I endorse all that has been said at this conference and I hope 
that the things we have been taught will find place in our hearts 
and that they may never be removed. Something has been said, very 
timely, very necessarily, in regard to the sacrament, in regard to the 
Word of Wisdom, the payment of tithing and offerings, in regard to 
fasting and other principles of the gospel. There are one or two 
thoughts that I desire to present in relation to the question of the 
sacrament, more particularly in regard to the meetings that have been 
set apart in the Church by revelation, by commandment of the Lord, 
for the partaking of these emblems representing the body and the 
blood of Jesus Christ. 

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SACRAMENT 

In my judgment the sacrament meeting is the most sacred, the 
most holy, of all the meetings of the Church. When I reflect upon 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



61 



the gathering of the Savior and his apostles on that memorable night 
when he introduced the sacrament ; when I think of that solemn 
occasion my heart is filled with wonderment and my feelings are 
touched. I consider that gathering one of the most solemn and wonder- 
ful since the beginning of time. There the Savior taught them of his 
coming sacrifice, which in their bewilderment they could not understand. 
He plainly told them of his death and that his blood should be shed, 
and this was said in the very hour of his agony for the sins of the 
world. It was a very solemn occasion; there the sacrament was 
instituted, and the disciples were commanded to meet together often 
and commemorate the death and sufferings of Jesus Christ, for his 
sacrifice was for the redemption of the world. He was about to take 
upon him the responsibility of paying the debt brought upon the 
world through the fall, that men might be redeemed from death and 
from hell. He had taught the people that he was to be lifted up that 
he might draw all men unto him, and that all who would repent and 
believe in him, keeping his commandments, should not suffer for he 
would take upon himself their sins. 

THE PURPOSE OF SACRAMENT MEETINGS 

We have been called upon to commemorate this great event and 
to keep it in mind constantly. For this purpose we are called together 
once each week to partake of these emblems, witnessing that we do 
remember our Lord, that we are willing to take upon us his name and 
that we will keep his commandments. This covenant we are called upon 
to renew each week and we cannot retain the Spirit of the Lord if 
we do not consistently comply with this commandment. If we love 
the Lord we will be present at these meetings in the spirit of worship 
and prayer, remembering the Lord and the covenant we are to renew 
each week through this sacrament as he has required it of us. 

APPROPRIATE SERVICES 

I do not believe that the Lord is pleased with us when we turn 
this sacred meeting into a concert. I do not believe that he is pleased 
with us if we assemble in this meeting in a spirit of levity and not 
solemnity. I am sure he is not pleased when men are called to speak 
in these services whose hearts are not touched by the principles of 
the gospel, and when they have no faith in the mission of Jesus Christ, 
and when they cast doubts upon the efficacy of his atonement and the 
sacrifice he made for the sins of the world. I am sure he is not pleased 
when we meet on such occasions to be amused, to be entertained, rather 
than to be instructed and to obtain spiritual education and thought 
and reflection. 

I do not believe it is necessary, very frequently at least, for 
presiding officers to go outside of their wards and stakes to find 
speakers ; not that this is something they should never do, but I think 
we many times ignore worthy men living in our wards who are filled 
with the spirit of the gospel. I know it is not pleasing to me when 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I attend a service and someone is called upon to speak who stands 
before the people and presents, though it be in a pleasing way, some 
platitudes, some philosophy of men, — the ideas of those who today 
mould the thought of the world, but who in their own hearts have no 
faith in or love for Jesus Christ — or who discuss questions at variance 
with the fundamental principles of the gospel. I think this is an 
occasion when the gospel should be presented, when we should be called 
upon to exercise faith and to reflect on the mission of our Redeemer 
and to spend time in thei consideration of the saving principles of the 
gospel, and not for other purposes. Amusement, laughter, light- 
mindedness, are all out of place in the sacrament meetings of the Latter- 
day Saints. We should assemble in the spirit of prayer, of meekness, 
with devotion in our hearts. I know of no other place where we can 
gather where we should be more reflective and solemn and where more 
of the spirit of worship should be maintained. 

SOLEMN ASSEMBLIES 

The Lord called upon the people in an early day of the Church 
to meet in solemn assembly, and speaking of these assemblies, he said : 

"Organize yourselves ; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even 
a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a 
house of glory, a house of order, a house of God ; 

"That your incomings may be in the name of' the Lord, that your outgoings 
may be in the name of the Lord, that all your salutations may be in the name 
of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High." 

"Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all 
your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all 
your wicked doings." 

We should not get the idea from this scripture that the Lord 
is displeased with us when we laugh, when we have merriment, if it 
is on the right occasions. He has said, however, that in our solemn 
assemblies such things as light-mindedness, laughter and merriment 
are out of order. We should cease from all light speeches, laughter 
and wrongful thoughts and desires, from all things which will detract 
from the teachings and the influence of the Spirit of the Lord. 

I felt that I would like to say this much after listening to the 
excellent remarks on the sacrament and the purpose for which it was 
instituted. 

COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS 

In conclusion I want to ask you a few questions, and I speak, of 
course, to all the members of the Church. Do you think a man who 
comes into the sacrament service in the spirit of prayer, humility, 
and worship, and who partakes of these emblems representing the body 
and blood of Jesus Christ, will knowingly break the commandments of 
the Lord? If a man fully realizes what it means when he partakes of 
the sacrament, that he covenants to take upon him the name of 
Jesus Christ and to always remember him and keep his commandments, 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 63 



and this vow is renewed week by week — do you think such a man 
will fail to pay his tithing? Do you think such a man will break the 
Sabbath day or disregard the Wjord of -Wisdom? Do you think he will 
fail to be prayerful, and that he will not attend his quorum duties and 
other duties in the Church? It seems to me that such a thing as a 
violation of these sacred principles and duties is impossible when a man 
knows what it means to make such vows week by week unto the Lord 
and before the saints. 

If we have the right understanding we will live in full accord 
with the principles of truth and walk in righteousness before the 
Lord. How can we receive his Spirit otherwise? I can see the sig- 
nificance in the commandment the Lord has given us to assemble fre- 
quently and partake of these emblems in commemoration of his death. 
It is our duty to assemble and renew our covenants and take upon us 
fresh obligations to serve the Lord and keep his sayings of which 
we have heard so much during this conference. How can a man go 
forth after making such covenants and cheat his neighbor? or rob 
the Lord? or violate any other commandment and refuse to walk in 
the light of truth? I am sure if we could picture before us — as I have 
tried many times to do — the solemn occasion when the Savior met 
with his apostles ; if we could see them there assembled, the Lord in 
his sadness, sorrowing for the sins of the world, sorrowing for one 
of his apostles 1 who was to betray him, yet teaching these eleven men 
who loved him and making covenant with them, I am sure we would 
feel in our hearts that we would never forsake him. If we could see 
them there assembled and could realize the weight of the burden 
which was upon our Lord; and after their supper and the singing of 
an hymn, their going forth, the Lord to be betrayed, mocked and 
scorned, the disciples to forsake him in the deepest hour of his trial — 
if we could understand all this, feebly though it be, and feebly it must 
be, I am sure, my brethren and sisters, we would forever more want 
to walk in the light of truth. If we could see the Savior of men 
suffering in the garden and upon the cross and could fully realize 
all that it meant to us, we would desire to keep his commandments and 
we would love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our might, 
mind and strength, and in the name of Jesus Christ would serve him. 

That we may have the desire to do this I humbly pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We would appreciate it if each of the brethren whose names 
I will read, would leave word at the Bureau of Information, if they are 
here; because I do not like to call on them if they are not here. 

We have been in the habit of hearing from our United States 
mission presidents, nearly always at these conferences, but we have 
neglected Brothers Andrew Johnson, J. A. Cahoon, Samuel Martin,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Charles H. Hyde, J. Howard Jenkins, Lorenzo W. Anderson, Joseph 
L. Peterson, and Alma G. Burton. Some of these brethren have been 
home nearly a year. 

If Brother Hyde is here now we would like to hear from him. 
If the other brethren whose names I have mentioned, who have been 
here for six months or more, will send in their names we would like to 
hear from some of them — briefly, of course. 

As I said six months agoy I say today: I really feel in my heart 
that we ought to have at least three days of conference and one meeting 
in addition. We cannot seem to get through and hear from as many 
people as we would like to hear from. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HYDE 

Former President of the Australian Mission 

I am delighted to have the opportunity of being able to represent the 
Australian Mission. I have labored among the people of that island- 
continent for something over seven years in all, having performed two 
missions among them. 

I was delighted with the remarks of Elder Rey L. Pratt yesterday 
concerning the Book of Mormon. We have endeavored in Australia 
to present that book to the people, and I believe that we were highly 
successful in the effort. A great many books were placed in the homes 
of the people of that land, especially during 1927. We endeavored to 
makq it a memorial year. The elders caught the spirit of it and did 
a splendid work in presenting that book to the people. We gained 
an additional testimony of the divinity of the book through our efforts. 
I would like to say, too, that we gained a wonderful physical testimony 
of the divinity of the Book of Mormon; in journeying from San Fran- 
cisco to Sydney, Australia, in coming in contact with the people of 
the Hawaiian islands and the Samoan islands, and learning something 
of them and their present conditions ; and then coming in contact with 
the more western peoples of the Fiji islands and the Solomon islands, 
and especially with the aborigines of Australia. Wje realize the marked 
differences between the Polynesian races and those more western 
peoples, and we recognize in the Polynesians, Israelites, the children 
of God. They are responsive to the teachings of the gospel and to all 
civilizing and educational influences, while those of the more western 
tribes are not nearly so susceptible and have been long removed from 
any contact with 'gospel influences. 

Among the people of Australia, those who have settled there in 
the last one hundred years, we find a splendid type of people, many 
of them responsive to the teachings of the gospel; and they long to 
hear the testimonies of the servants of the Lord. However, we are 
handicapped, as many of the other missions are, through the lack of 
elders. There are but thirty-two elders now laboring in Australia, 
endeavoring to reach something over seven millions of people scattered 



ELDER CHARLES H. HYDE

over an area of country nearly as large as the United States. Of course 
these people are congregated in a great measure in the larger cities of 
Australia, which makes them to some degree more easily reached. 
But we find that the people living in the country districts are more 
susceptible to gospel influences and more ready to listen to the elders, 
and they are harder to reach because of the long distances the elders 
have to travel. 

However, there is a growth among that people numerically as 
well as spiritually. With the new members and the natural growth of 
the Church we are able to just keep ahead of the number who die and 
those who drop out of the faith. Our numbers increase a little each 
year. 

The people there are very faithful in the payment of their tithing. 
The per capita tithing reaches a very high, figure, and we are glad to 
see the manifestations of the faith of those who have identified them- 
selves with the work of the Lord. 

It is a very good mission to work in. It has many advantages 
of an educational nature that our young men would be pleased to enjoy 
if they really understood the conditions in that land. The people of 
Australia are an educated people. Many of the children ten or twelve 
years old among that people read the Book of Mormon in our classes 
just as readily as do our elders. They have a splendid school system 
and) all things that tend towards the growth and development of that 
good people. 

I rejoice in the testimonies that the Lord has blessed me with, 
for his sustaining power and influence while engaged in that missionary 
work. I testify that the Lord is with the elders, the power of the 
priesthood is manifested among them, they enjoy the spirit of their 
calling in rich measure, and they return home blessed and favored of 
the Lord because of 'their faithful efforts. 

May the Lord add his blessings to us and to the good people in 
that far-off land, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word ! 
What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled ?" 

The grand old hymn loses none of its inspiration with time. It 
is well to consider what the Lord hath said and to act in accordance 
therewith. The tenor of the instruction thus far given in the present 
conference has been this: Keep the commandments of the Lord! A 
grand summation indeed ; and if that admonition were followed in 
spirit and by effort there would be little need, as has been suggested, of 
dealing with particular and specific commandments.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AGENCY AND COMMANDMENTS 

We boast much of our freedom and agency, and I find some who 
seem to have difficulty in reconciling the thoughts of freedom and 
individual agency on the one hand with the fact that we are living under 
commandment on the other hand. 

In the scripture already quoted to you the purpose of placing man 
upon the earth has been declared : "And we will prove them herewith, 
to see if they will do whatsoever the Lord their God shall command 
them." A plainer or more comprehensive statement than that of the 
Lord's purpose could scarcely be conceived — to see whether we shall 
do whatsoever the Lord shall command us — because our agency enables 
us to do or to refrain from so doing, for the Lord will not compel. 

This life is ofttimes, and very properly, referred to as a probation. 
"And we will prove them" the Lord says, putting us upon test, to see 
whether we will exercise our agency in choosing to do whatsoever the 
Lord our God requires of us. The Lord wants to know about that. 
Perhaps His foreknowledge shows the result to Him, but it is necessary 
that we demonstrate it. There is much work ahead of us, and the 
Lord desires to know whom He can trust with authority and power 
beyond the grave, so this probationary period has been provided that 
we may prove and demonstrate beyond all question as to whether we can 
be trusted, as to whether we shall be entitled to the welcome: Well 
done ; you have been faithful over what may have seemed to be a few 
things, and perhaps relatively small things, but you have been proved 
and you have shown that you can be trusted with many and greater 
things. 

REVELATION ON FUNDAMENTALS 

In the early days of the Church, indeed before the Church was 
organized as a body corporate among men, the Lord gave revelation 
after revelation, specific and of profound importance. That revealment 
was the foundation, and how firm a foundation it is ! I should be very 
much surprised if the Lord were revealing today the same funda- 
mental principles, for they have already been revealed, and under His 
command they have been recorded ; they form the constitution of the 
Church. Revelation is coming from Him day by day through inspira- 
tion to His servants, and we should note the trend of that inspiration 
and the particular principles that are emphasized from time to time. 
Are we today hearers of that word alone, or doers of it ? You Bishops 
of Wards, Presidents of Stakes, members of the Church, will you 
simply remember that something was said at this conference, or will 
you go hence to carry into effect in your several fields what has been 
presented and what shall yet be presented unto you as requiring especial 
attention? We are not looking for something new in the sense of that 
that has never before been given to this people, but we are looking to 
see the way the Spirit is pointing as to those particular duties that are 
most especially important' to us at this period. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



OBEDIENCE A FORM OF ENERGY 

There is a profound principle embodied in that admonition to keep 
the commandments of the Lord. Have you ever thought of the fact 
that there is a power, an actual force, a definite form of energy, in 
obedience? That energy is just as real as the force that is giving light 
to these lamps serving in the hours of darkness to illuminate this great 
auditorium for us. I think we shall yet come to recognize the force, 
the power, the energy, that lies in obedience. We have many demon- 
strations of it. 

I have been impressed with the fact that the scientific spirit, as 
man calls it, is manifest in the organization of this Church and in its 
operation. It is only through obedience to what we call the forces of 
nature, the laws of energy, that we are able to make them serve our 
purposes. We would have none of these lights unless we obeyed 
strictly, with full purpose of heart, the laws of electricity. 

Yesterday morning between nine and ten o'clock Mountain Time, 
we heard in this city the very voice of the Premier of Great Britain 
who had just landed at the port of New York. How was that miracle 
made possible ? Through strict obedience to the laws by which the energy 
was employed and then applied through the radio, and in none other 
way would the marvel have been wrought. We have to obey the laws 
of light, the laws of mechanical construction, and the laws of chemistry 
if we would operate the camera successfully and get good pictures. 
That time-piece yonder would be worth nothing had not the laws 
of mechanics been very strictly obeyed in its construction. It is only 
through obedience to law that we enjoy blessings. 

A MASTERLY GENERALIZATION 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, as is common with the prophets of 
God, went beyond the inventors and discoverers and gave to us in a 
generalization — one that challenged the attention of thinkers who paid 
attention to it — one that embodied the solemn truth that by law ir- 
revocably decreed, not for this earth alone, but before the foundations 
of the earth, it is ordained that when we obtain any blessing it is by 
and through obedience to the law upon which that blessing is predi- 
cated. Those who considered this said : Well of course ; we knew that 
before, but we had not thought of it. So always with generalizations 
of great import. All of them are wonderfully simple, but it has been 
said, and with propriety, that none but a genius or a prophet can 
safely generalize. 

What of the leper in Syria who through obedience was healed 
of his leprosy? What of the widow who went to Elisha, that man of 
God, when she was in great distress, and by compliance with and 
unquestioning obedience to the commands he gave her, she and her 
children were provided for? We may live under the blessings associated 
with law, if we will obey.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



man's nature to obey 

There appear to be many contradictions in human nature. Have 
you ever thought of the fact that it is really natural to man not only 
to obey, but to desire to obey ? Think of the wealth that is being applied 
to investigation and research in science, and what is the great purpose 
of it all ? Let us confine ourselves to what we call, artificially, perhaps, 
physical science. Our great men are at work in laboratories, and we 
think it nothing now to expend millions upon the equipment and 
maintenance of such institutions. Summed up, what are they trying 
to do? To discover new laws. Not to create them; you cannot create 
laws of nature, but to discover new laws. For what purposes? So 
that they can put themselves in subjection to those laws, to obey them. 
What? To be subject to new laws? Yes, because there are blessings 
predicated upon each of those laws, and men want those blessings. 
Men of science know very well that blessings cannot be obtained except 
through obedience to the corresponding laws. And then in strange 
inconsistency we find some who say that though we have to comply 
with physical law, natural law as we call it, in order to enjoy the 
blessings connected therewith, it is not necessary to comply with laws 
relating to the spiritual activities of man. 

LAW OF THE TITHE — AN ILLUSTRATION 

The law of tithing has been referred to as an illustration. But, 
brethren, take this to heart : the inspired servants of the Lord tell you 
at this conference no new principle connected with tithing, but they 
tell you it is necessary that you give your attention to the living of 
that law! Take that home with you, put it into effect in your stakes 
and wards, and let every member of the Church take it home with him 
and put it into effect. The Lord knows why he has inspired His 
servants to say that unto you at this time ; that it is necessary that this 
people shall live up to that law. If there were time I would like to 
consider with you that sublime principle and law. Do you know that 
the soil can be sanctified by the tithing of its products ? The land can be 
sanctified. There is a relationship between the elements and forces of 
nature, and the actions of men. Did not the Lord sanctify the land to 
Israel of old as long as His covenant people lived up to their covenants ? 
He warned them of what would come if they forfeited that sanctifica- 
tion. He told them of the destruction that would come upon them, 
and it came because they chose the evil alternative, in large measure. 

We should be sanctified, our homes should be sanctified, and we 
can attain that condition in part by living up to that portion of the 
law, and in its entirety by living up to the law in its fulness. Are you 
feeding your children tithed food? Are they wearing tithed clothing? 
We are to be tithed people. That was characteristic of the covenant 
people of old. It will be so ever. The law of tithing will abide, though 
it may be superseded by a yet higher law to which we shall learn to 
subscribe. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE

REWARD AND PUNISHMENT — NATURAL EFFECTS 

Again, the Lord has said that according to the laws we obey here 
shall we receive from Him. We speak of rewards just as we speak 
of punishments. But rewards and punishments will come through 
the operation of law. The Lord has spoken illustrating that great 
truth by reference to what He had already revealed respecting the 
kingdoms or orders of glory, to this effect — If a man cannot or will 
not obey celestial laws, that is, live in accordance with the celestial 
requirements, he must not think that he is discriminated against when he 
is excluded from the celestial kingdom, because he could not abide 
it, he could not live there. If a man cannot or will not obey the 
terrestrial law he cannot rationally hope for a place in the terrestrial 
kingdom. If he cannot live the yet lower law — the telestial law — he 
cannot abide the glory of a, telestial kingdom, and he will have to be 
assigned therefore to a kingdom without glory. I rejoice in the con- 
sistency and order of the Lord's plan and in His revelations to us. 

Let us go forth carrying the spirit of this conference into effect, 
that the word of the Lord may be something more to us than mere 
sound ; and so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Wfe rejoice in knowing that our patriarch, whose health is such 
that he cannot be with us, is resting quietly and hearing by means 
of the radio the proceedings of this conference. It is a source of a 
great deal of regret to us that he is not with us. 

Brother Smoot, as you all know, is actively engaged in work at 
Washington, and cannot be with us. He is laboring with all his might 
and main, and I regret to say that his health is not as vigorous as it 
has been in the past. The great burdens resting upon him are telling 
very strongly upon him physically. 

Brother Widtsoe is thoroughly enjoying his labors, and is ac- 
complishing a fine work in Great Britain. 

I have received a very grateful expression of thanks for the 
amplifying sets that have been arranged to accommodate those who are 
hard of hearing. They appreciate them very much. 

My attention has been called to the fact that I did not mention 
Brother John P. Lillywhite as one of the returned mission presidents 
from whom we have not yet heard. Brother Lillywhite and his good 
wife 'are here with us. The reason I did not mention him is that we 
have not yet had time to neglect him, as he has been home but a few days 

The congregation sang "Redeemer of Israel," and the benediction 
was pronounced by Elder A. Richard Peterson, President of the Emery 
Stake. 

Conference was adjourned until 2.00 p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

At 2 o'clock p. m. the Conference reconvened, with President Heber 
J. Grant presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "High on the Mountain Top." 

Elder Alfred L. Hanks, President of the Tooele Stake, offered the 
invocation. 

The hymn, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah," was sung by the 
congregation. 

ELDER STEPHEN L.RICHARDS 

I feel very humble and very weak in approaching this duty, not 
because I have not thought and studied and prepared for it. I presume 
that we are all apprehensive on occasions such as this, lest we might not 
profitably occupy the time of the saints and speak those things which 
are in consonance with the wisdom of our brethren and the Spirit of 
God. I can think of no other reasons which give rise to the fears and 
the trepidation which hold one as he stands in this great presence. I 
have prayed that my words and my thoughts might be in harmony and 
ring true with the great messages which have been delivered during this 
conference. 

IN THE LANGUAGE OF YOUTH 

I have been hoping that the Church may interpret the gospel in 
the language of youth. I am certain that if boys and girls can under- 
stand its glorious message they will respond. Religion has always seemed 
more or less formidable to youth. I think that is in part because its 
inhibitions and its "don'ts" have been emphasized rather than 
its persuasions and its happiness. The representative of religion has 
usually been characterized as a somber joy-killing person without much 
of human understanding and human sympathy. I would, if I could, 
change this erroneous conception, indulged by youth, and substitute the 
glorious conceptions of abundant life and living given to us by the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

Youth should understand that the spirit is the life of man, and 
the body is its tabernacle ; that the tabernacle cannot be polluted or 
defiled without injuring the spirit, and that the spirit will grow and 
develop only as the house in which it dwells provides an atmosphere of 
purity and beauty. Youth admires strength and power. They must 
learn that the real strength is the strength of being clean. 

LIBERTY AND SAFETY THROUGH OBEDIENCE 

Youth should know that obedience is not bondage, but liberty — 
liberty under law; that the only real freedom is the freedom from our 
weaknesses : from the vices, the remorse of conscience, and the infraction 
of law. When youth understands that the bending of the will in obe- 
dience tends to liberty and joy, then lawlessness, disrespect and irrever- 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



71 



ence will wane. I wish that youth could realize that the only death to 
be feared is the death that is the wages of sin, and that the gospel 
program of living is insurance against that dreadful calamity ; that the 
commandments of God, both the "shalts" and the "shalt nots," and the 
warnings, reproofs and admonitions of God's servants, are all kindly 
calculated to hedge round the precious age of youth with safe-guards 
which shall protect its course until the age of wisdom and judgment 
shall be reached. 

I know that it is difficult, but I wish that everyone who reproves 
youth could "show forth afterwards an increase of love toward him 
whom he hath reproved, lest he esteem him to be his enemy." I know 
of nothing in scripture that evinces a nicer understanding of human 
nature than does this splendid admonition given of God, so delicately 
put. 

MANIFESTATIONS OF GOD's TRUTH 

While I recognize the necessity of the prohibitions and injunctions 
of the gospel, all to be interpreted for the blessing of man, it seems 
to me that I would lay my major stress for youth on the positive, con- 
structive, inviting concepts of truth which enlarge the vision and hold 
forth those exalted hopes, stations and glory which attract the soul of 
man as the marvelous magnet of the sun attracts the planets of the uni- 
verse. ; i ■ 

Youth should understand that all the beauties of nature, the ma- 
jestic mountains, the hills and vales, the streams crystal clear, the 
changing seasons, the gorgeous garb of earth, the peace of the summer 
night, the thunderous awful beauty of the storm, are all but manifesta- 
tions of God; that the unfoldment of science is but a revelation of 
fragments of God's truth, and that the searcher for facts, when he 
discovers truth, however startling it may seem to the human mind, will 
never find anything, if it is real truth, which is not compatible with the 
revelations of God as they have been made known and will be made 
known to his prophets. 

TEACHERS OF UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY 

I am sorry that youth seems to be so much disturbed in this respect. 
I am sure it is attributable to inadequate instruction in the fields of both 
science and religion. Youth sorely needs today teachers of great, 
understanding and sympathy, who can reconcile apparent conflicts and 
enable youth to hold fast to God's word and time-tested principles, while 
science, through experimentation and research, unfolds and develops 
the secrets and the processes of nature. I have long been persuaded 
that no teacher will ever be able to perform this high service for youth 
unless he be at once a man of God and a real scientist, a man who under- 
stands and believes the revelations and who fully appreciates the possi- 
bilities and the limitations of scientific method. It may seem boastful to 
say it, but I believe that such teachers are more apt to be found in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than in any other place in all 
this wide world. 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES 

May youth recognize that all true morality is founded on religious 
principles ; principles that have been tried and not found wanting ; that 
old things are not to be despised merely because they are old, and that the 
Ten Commandments are still the basis of Christian virtue. I want 
them to know that the scriptures are the word of God and that they will 
discover within them the deepest and truest philosophy, the most inter- 
esting history, the most vital principles to human life and welfare and 
the finest literature that the world has ever known. They should 
understand that pure recreation is not sinful and not inhibited by the 
Lord ; that play is necessary as work is necessary ; that both play and 
work are to be enjoyed; that service is the pursuit of most lasting satis- 
faction ; that worship is the recreation of the soul. 

• 

COMPANIONSHIPS THROUGH GOSPEL ASSOCIATION 

Would that youth could appreciate in full measure the companion- 
ships of gospel association. Would that they could realize that there is 
no such life-mating as that under the influence of the Holy Spirit and the 
power of the priesthood ; that the quorums are fraternities where men 
clasp hands in bonds that are stronger than the bonds of death ; that 
the organizations and service in the Church bring friendships dearer 
and more lasting than even life itself ; "that God is a Father ; that man 
is a brother ; that life is a mission and not a career." 

THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH LEADERS TOWARD YOUTH 

I have earnestly desired that youth might more fully understand the 
leaders of the Church and their attitude toward them, because I think 
they feel that we are exacting, that we do not understand and are 
therefore not sympathetic with their environment and their thinking. 
Perhaps we do not fully understand them. I want them to know, 
however, that it is not because we do not love them and desire their 
welfare. I would like to assure every young man and every young 
woman in the Church of God that they have no warmer and truer friend 
than President Heber J. Grant. I know that never a day passes that he 
and his associates in the leadership of the Church do not pray for. the 
youth of Zion, and that there are no lengths to which they would not 
go to bless them. I entreat the youth to give to their leaders and their 
parents their confidence and their trust. These are their best friends. 

THE SIGNIFICANCE AND BLESSING OF TEMPLES 

I wish that youth could grasp more clearly the vital significance 
and transcendent blessings of our temples. I am fearful that by many 
the temples are regarded as institutions of rather formidable mystery. 
I wish they could come to know that these sacred establishments of the 
Church are places of education and incomparable blessing, where the real 
meaning of life is made clear and glorious. 

After all, to understand the gospel is to love it. I am so enamoured 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



73 



of its glorious conceptions that I feel sure that if we can win the 
affection of youth for its joyous principles, their salvation will be 
assured. 

THE GLORIOUS AGE OF YOUTH 

What a glorious age of promise youth is, when life is in the bud 
and early blossom, when each experience is fresh with curiosity and 
adventure. I think that if we may envy anything it is the life and vitality 
of youth. I would not rob it of its joy and its sparkle. I would only 
add to its richness by securing its enjoyment through the passing years. 
I know that a real appreciation of the gospel will do that. Gospel 
truth will always quicken the impulses of the spirit, and the spirit is 
the life of man. It unfolds new visions as knowledge increases, and 
these new visions keep life ever new ; so, in the gospel life, there is youth 
even in old age. 

God bless youth that they may understand truth and us, and God 
bless us that we may understand youth, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the Canadian Mission 

We have been fed and refreshed, my brethren and sisters, by the 
teachings and by the spirit of this conference. I am very anxious, 
during the few minutes I stand before you, that this feast may be 
continued, and I am sure that it will only be by the blessings of the 
Lord that this shall be so. 

I felt quite at home at the first session of this conference. I was 
reminded of our Canadian Mission when the opening prayer was given 
by a former missionary of that mission, Elder Thomas W. Richards, 
and when Elder David O. McKay spoke, who recently toured the 
Canadian Mission. I can assure you, my brethren and sisters, that he 
gave the same sort of powerful sermons all through our mission, as 
the one that he delivered here yesterday forenoon. From Portland, 
Maine, to Windsor, Ontario, in that tour of two thousand five hundred 
miles that we made in about fifteen days, holding thirty-one meetings, 
we had the same kind of spiritual feast as we received yesterday from 
him and also from others of the brethren. 

Our tour took us through Maine, to the ancient city of St. Johr, 
New Brunswick; from thence, across the Bay of Fundy, through 
the land of Evangeline, made famous by Longfellow, to the historic 
city of Halifax, Nova Scotia ; from thence to Amherst, Nova Scotia, 
Montreal, Quebec ; to Burlington, Vermont ; to Ottawa, Toronto, 
Hamilton, Brantford, London, Windsor and Chatham. At the last 
named city we had the opportunity of giving our service over the radio, 
and one of the striking features of that service was the invitation to 
Brother McKay to give the benediction. Rather short notice was given, 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but we had the unusual joy of just such a prayer as we hear from the 
priesthood here at home, given over the radio in that land. We received 
very good reactions from that meeting. We have heard a number 
of favorable comments from those who were "listening in." 

Since that time we have again toured the mission, giving an 
interpretation of the gospel as expressed through the auxiliaries, through 
the great Relief Society organization, the great Sunday School organiza- 
tion, the great M. I. A., and last, but not least, the great Primary 
Association. The Primary Association is capable of doing real mis- 
sionary work, as it reaches the parents through the children. 

On this last tour, in passing through the state capitol of Vermont, 
we were handed a pamphlet with a picture of a stone erected in mem- 
ory of Brigham Young, at Whitingham, Vermont, the birthplace of 
Brigham Young. The legend on the stone is : "Brigham Young born on 
this spot 1801. A man of much courage and superb equipment." 
A little later we passed through Concord, the capital of New Hamp- 
shire and saw the statue to Daniel Webster. These two great men 
were born in close proximity of time and of territory, and we had 
the opportunity that evening of making some contrasts between them, 
particularly in reference to the inspiration to the Prophet Brigham 
Young, pertaining to the redemption and settlement of this western 
country, and the purported attitude of the great American orator upon 
that same subject; and that exposition was favorably received by the 
audience of people from New Hampshire, who think very highly of the 
great Daniel Webster who is voted, at least by Harvard, as being 
entitled to the seventh place in the galaxy of the great orators of the 
world. 

We had some unusual experiences along the line, one of which 
was the holding of our religious services immediately following a- 
wedding ceremony and feast. It was a little difficult, for the moment, 
to make the contact and transform the marriage feast into a service of 
the Lord, but with our "wedded companionship without end," known 
to us but not known to the priest who performed the ceremony that 
night, nor to many of the people who listened to the services, we were 
able to secure a hearing. While they were cool to start with, they 
soon warmed up to the exposition of the gospel as interpreted by these 
auxiliary organizations. 

We have recently had the privilege of being refreshed anew by 
the inspiration which comes from a visit to Cumorah and the Sacred 
Grove, and to the Joseph Smith Memorial in the State of Vermont. 
There is a spirit about those places as there is about the revelations 
of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I was reminded of the 
lines describing Joseph at the age of the restitution, given by Bishop 
Whitney in that great epic of his, known as "Elias, An Epic of the 
Ages," and which I am persuaded is read too little by the Latter-day 
Saints. He describes Joseph at that time as : 

"Standing but fourteen steps upon life's stair, 
An unlearned boy, thinker of thoughts profound, 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



75 



Boy and yet man, dreamer of lofty dreams. 

Not solemn, save betimes, when hovered near 

Some winged inspiration from far worlds, 

Some great idea's all-subduing spell — 

His heart grew humbler then, his look more grave; 

Not melancholy — mirthful, loving life, 

And brimming o'er with health and wholesome glee. 

A stalwart spirit in a sturdy frame, 

Maturing unto future mightiness." 

After making some reference in the poem to the sort of deity 
which Joseph Smith worshiped, the attributes of deity, the poem 
continues, in reference to Joseph : 

"And pondering the apostolic line, 

'Let any lacking wisdom ask, 

And God will freely give, upbraiding none,' 

He puts the promise to the utter test." 

Then the poet adds : 

"What pen can paint the marvel that befell? 
What tongue the wondrous miracle portray?" 

When those "two heavenly personages, whose beauty and glory 
defy all description," stood before Joseph in the air, and one of them, 
addressing the boy, pointing to the other said, "This is My beloved 
Son, hear him." It is a noteworthy fact that as the years go by the 
significance of the information that was received by Joseph at that 
time from the Son, the Lord and Savior of the world, is being more 
confirmed year by year. An examination of the magazine literature 
of the world, in the last few years, pointing out the limitations upon 
Protestant denominations and in fact all religious sects, will indicate 
the truth of what Bishop Whitney told us yesterday in reference to 
a fragmentary portion of the gospel, only, residing in these denominat- 
tions, these cults and these isms. 

I have been very much impressed with the direct testimony in 
support of the restoration of this gospel, but I have been more impressed 
with the circumstantial evidence which supports the restoration and 
the coming forth of the gospel, the re-statement of the gospel and the 
restoration of the holy priesthood. 

The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants was referred to 
here yesterday — a perfect piece of literature as a preface to that book. 
There is harmony in all that 'came through Joseph. Our Judge Rolapp, 
a few years ago, in his "Gospel Quotations," made a compilation of 
scriptures, brought together the scriptures given to Joseph, coming 
from different ages, different languages ; and lo arid behold, when they 
are brought together they dovetail and are in perfect harmony, a 
beautiful exposition of the gospel as restored through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in these great truths which have 
come to us, the spirit of these great revelations, the spirit of the Book 
of Mormon. I have been melted many times, and thrilled, in reading 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



some of those simple chapters of the Book of Mormon. I was pleased 
to hear Brother Pratt speak of his experiences in recently reading anew 
many times the Book of Mormon. 

It is my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I am grate- 
ful for the knowledge I have that God lives; that he answers prayers; 
that the gospel, by his power, has been restored, and likewise the 
priesthood; and that we are enjoying that priesthood, in the leadership 
that we have in the Church at this time, as we also enjoyed it in former 
administrations of the Church, since its restoration through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. May the Lord bless us and help us to appreciate and 
realize all the blessings which have come unto us, is 'my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL MARTIN 

Former President of the South African Mission 

I trust that I may be sustained this afternoon in this ordeal, for 
I assure you that it is an ordeal to realize that there are ten thousand eyes 
gazing at me and perhaps double that number who are listening to my 
utterances; but I have enjoyed the Spirit of the Lord so often in the 
mission field under trying conditions that I feel confident I shall enjoy 
his Spirit while I endeavor to speak to you this afternoon. 

One of the last requests made of me, as I was leaving Cape-Town 
and the South African Mission as a whole, was that I would bring 
the love of the people of South Africa to you who live in Zion. There 
are many still living who remember the elders who first went to that 
land to preach the gospel of the restoration in 1853. And again, there 
are many, among whom I had the privilege of laboring, who feel to ex- 
tend to you their love and gratitude for the elders who returned again in 
1903, after forty years absence, to bring the gospel to that far-off land. 
In 1853 the South African Mission was limited — the elders bore their 
testimony to those only who lived in the British possessions. Cape 
Colony and Natal. When they returned in 1903, the mission had in- 
creased more than double. Instead of including only about three or 
four hundred thousand square miles of territory, it had been increased 
to over a million square miles, owing to the fact that in 1890 Great 
Britain decided to take over that large native territory known today 
as Southern and Northern Rhodesia, which embraces over four hundred 
thousand square miles, all native territory, and then since the war that 
of German Southwest Africa. This added territory has made it im- 
perative that the elders who go to that far-off land be sent out two 
by two to only the large cities within the union. 

The great cry of South Africa today is : "Send us missionaries." 
Since Southern and Northern Rhodesia have been under the control 
of the British government, thousands of white settlers are going to that 
country and are establishing beautiful cities, very much after the plan of 
the cities we have in the west. They need at this time the missionary

pioneer, that as the population increases the gospel knowledge might 
grow with them ; therefore, the cry in South Africa is from the people 
themselves: "Send us missionaries.". 

You may perhaps know that the missionaries do not go to the 
colored or native races. The native races have besought the elders 
that they would go and teach them the gospel and that they would 
allow them to translate our tracts into the native language. They have 
offered to have congregations amounting to the thousands if the elders 
would only go and speak to them, but that time has not yet arrived. 
The number of missionaries that the General Authorities have been 
able to send has precluded us from sending the missionaries even into 
many of the cities where the white people dwell. There are towns of 
ten, fifteen and twenty thousand people who have had no elders sta- 
tioned with them. 

It was very pleasing to me, when I returned to South Africa 
after nearly eleven years, to find people who were pleased to see me 
again. Nearly twenty-five years ago I had the privilege of hearing 
the gospel message for the first time in that land, and I believe was 
the first convert to the Church through the efforts of the elders who 
came out in 1903. Some of those who knew me in business, political, 
and social life, asked the question: "Has Martin gone mad? Is he 
attending to his business? How and why on earth could he allow 
himself to be overcome by those Mormon elders?" But when I 
returned this time and I met some of the same people who are holding 
high government positions, men of social position, and of the press. They 
said: "Have yon really come back to South Africa? Surely you will 
never leave us again?" And the press requested me to write and tell 
them of my experiences here among this wonderful people. They gave 
me freedom to write all that I desired, and from that time on I can 
assure you with truthfulness I never again saw in the press during 
my presidency of the South African Mission an article in adverse 
criticism of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Prejudice 
is breaking down. The people as a whole are ready and willing to 
listen. The elders who come out are men of splendid character as a 
whole, many of them earnest in their endeavor to preach the gospel. 
They are able to take rebuke and slander without retaliation. The only 
difficulty we have found does not exist with the common people gener- 
ally but with those who are supposed to be teachers of truth and 
light. It often seemed very strange to me that men who professed to 
be teachers of the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ were not able 
to discern the difference between his teachings and their treatment to 
the elders; the love, tolerance, patience, and gentleness which he 
taught, compared with that which they were pleased to give in exchange 
for his teachings to the elders of this Church. It seemed to me that 
the pastors were unable to discern the difference between a lamb and 
a wolf, for charity is often absolutely lacking. Therefore, my brethren 
and sisters, I come to you with an appeal — Do not withhold your sons 
if you can possibly arrange for them to fill missions. The Lord will 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



open the way. He will bless those who go into the mission field. 

Let me tell you the experience I had prior to gathering to Zion 
many years ago. There was a young elder who came out from Idaho, 
I believe it was Paris or Bloomington. He landed in South Africa in 
a state of collapse through typhoid fever. He was taken to the 
hospital, and when he became convalescent the government was about to 
send him back, owing to the fact that he had only two pounds ten 
shillings ($12.50) with which to sustain himself in the South African 
Mission. I had the privilege, as a business man at that time, to go 
before the government and stand security, giving a guarantee that 
he should never be a charge to the country ; and the Lord blessed me 
and gave me confidence in his work, and with the kind cooperation of 
my little wife, from the day he came out of the hospital until the day 
he left South Africa, we fed him. I don't say that to receive your 
praise, but I do say this that I am only a humble man and if God would 
induce me to sustain a humble elder who came into the world to preach 
the gospel, he will do it for your son if occasion requires it. 

I want to make one other expression before I sit down. I want 
to appeal to you parents to stress particularly the importance of your 
sons and daughters reading, studying and marking the wondrous 
blessings which are given to them by the servants of the Lord, par- 
ticularly their patriarchal blessings. I can say to you with great 
humbleness and sincerity that many times when I have seen things 
requiring great care and good judgment in the mission field, I have 
gone alone and read over the blessing given to me by our beloved pres- 
dent, Anthony W. Ivins, and at times I saw the wondrous guidance 
of the Spirit of the Lord in harmony with the blessings he pronounced 
upon my head, as a humble servant of the Lord called to preside over 
a branch of His kingdom. I often felt very weak, but at times 
I could feel the presence and hear the very voice of the Lord direct- 
ing me. And frequently, after I had given instructions to the elders, 
when the mail reached me from headquarters the very instruction 
which they were advising me to give had already been given, showing 
that the Spirit of the Lord permeates his servants and guides and 
directs them in all their undertakings. 

• I pray humbly that the Lord will help us to appreciate and value 
the words which his servants pronounce upon our heads, for I can assure 
you from very strong testimony that I have felt their power, their influ- 
ence, and their guidance, in my life. I pray that God will bless you and 
open your hearts and guide you that you may not think too much of 
wealth for self, but of the thousands who are out in the word not enjoy- 
ing what you have today — a knowledge of the glorious truths of the 
restoration of the gospel, for which I am grateful. I am humbly 
grateful that I with four others of my family should be counted worthy 
to go out into the world to preach this wonderful message. I pray 
that the Lord will bless us each to feel dissatisfied until we all have 
done our duty in that respect. 

May God bless you, Amen.

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

America's chief need — religion 

Is this nation, though it is the strongest, richest country in the 
world, headed for destruction? It is, say good authorities, unless the 
growing disrespect for law is stopped. 

"Growing disrespect for law," says James W. Good, Secretary 
of War for the United States, "unless it is stopped, will end in our 
destruction." 

WHAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICA? 

A volume that was on the reading course of the M. I. A. last year 
bears the title, "What Ails Our Youth?" In the light of what the 
Secretary of W!ar has said, it may be appropriate to ask also, "What 
ails our country?" 

"Train up a child in the way he should go, and, when he is old he 
will not depart from it." So says Solomon in Proverbs 22 :6. It 
may be that the citizens of the United States were not, in the days 
of their youth, trained up in the way they should go ; or that the 
young folks in our country today are not being well trained ; for it is 
a leading educator, George A. Coe, a professor at Columbia University, 
who has written a book with the title, "What Ails Our Youth ?" 

The Washington Post of March 9 devotes a whole page in large 
type to the following: 

"TO THE YOUTH OF WASHINGTON" 

"Where will you be five years from now? 

"What will be your mental outlook on life at that time? What your associates? 
What will be your physical and financial status? What your religious and 
mental standards? 

"It is sure that what you are doing now will point almost exactly to the 
answer of these questions. 

"Few men or women are able to make sweeping revisions in their modes 
of living overnight. 

"Most changes come in a gradual way. What man can stop a hundred 
bad habits in one day and begin a hundred good ones the next? 

"It isn't done that way. Life is a constant change, with everything being 
done by easy stages. The paths you are treading today will become broader and 
easier to follow, no matter in which direction they are leading. 

WHERE WILL YOU BE? 

"Where you will be five years from today depends upon whether you are 
a little better or a little worse tomorrow or a month from today. 

"Try to elevate yourself a little each day. Save a little money each week, 
deposit it carefully or invest it wisely, and you will be surprised at the growth 
in five years. 

"Spend your money and time foolishly, associate with wrong companions, and 
in five years you probably will be a liability to your community and a disgrace 
to your family. 

"Apply this test to the things you want to do — 'If I continue this in- 
definitely, where shall I be in five years ?' " 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This stirring appeal to the youth of the capital of the nation is 
signed by one hundred and ninety-two business men of that city. 
It thus appears that these business men also are asking : "What 
Ails Our Youth?" And may I ask: "What Ails Our Country?" 
Growing disrespect for law, our Secretary of War has said, is leading 
us to destruction. 

PRISON RECORDS OF CRIME 

The records of a reformatory at Pendleton, Indiana, may throw 
light on what ails our young people. During twenty years they have- 
received in that institution 20,000 young men between the ages of 
eighteen and twenty-five. This means an average of 1,000 a year. 
Of these 20,000 young men in that reformatory only four per cent 
claimed membership in any church. These statistics may be the answer 
to the questions, What ails our youth? and What ails our country? 

May not conditions today be similar to those prevailing on the 
30th day of April, 1863? Then Abraham Lincoln, as President of the 
United States, issued a proclamation setting apart that day as a day of 
fasting and prayer. 

THE WISDOM OF LINCOLN 

These were his words: 

"We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven; we have 
been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in 
numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have 
forgotten God. 

"We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and 
multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in 
the deceitfulness of our own hearts, that all these blessings were produced 
by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken 
success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming 
and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us. 

OUR GREATEST NEED 

"It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, to 
confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness." 

What is it that the youth of our country needs, that the people of 
our nation must have, if our land is to be preserved from destruction ? 
It is religion. The people of the nation must follow more closely 
the teachings and the example of him who came to bring "Peace on 
earth, good will to men." 

Let us look to the words of the Master himself for an answer. 

MEN MUST HAVE THE NEW BIRTH 

"There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews : 
"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know 

that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles 

that thou doest, except God be with him. 

"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except 

a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



81 



"Nicodemus saith unto him, how can a man be born when he is old? * * * 
"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of 
the water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. * * * 
"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again." (John 3:1-7). 

THE POWER OF PRAYER 

So I say, this is the advice, this the counsel, this the instruction, 
and these are the commands for the citizens of our country. We "must 
be born again" — born "of the water and of the spirit." The one thing 
needful is religion. 

Our country is filled with men who are rich, with men who, as one 
well-known author, Roger W. Babson, says, ridicule religion ; but he 
holds that these men are indebted for all the riches they possess to the 
family prayers once held daily in the homes of their fathers. 

This is a religious country. The citizens of this land ought to 
be devout. Our forefathers came to this continent primarily in order 
to secure religious liberty. The motto of our nation is: "In God 
We Trust." 

Is there any one that dares to point with ridicule at Washington 
upon his knees at Valley Forge? Who is there, enjoying the liberties 
of this free country, that dares to ridicule Benjamin Franklin? He 
said: "I have lived, sir, a long time; and the longer I live, the more 
convicing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs 
of men?" Who dares point with ridicule at these men, the idols of this 
land of liberty ? 

THE EXAMPLE OF OUR LEADERS 

Washington, Franklin, Lincoln, Joseph Smith — each of these, in 
times of dire need and real distress, went upon his knees and made 
appeal to Divine Providence. It was Franklin who said : "In the 
beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible to 
danger, we had daily prayer — for divine protection. Our prayers, sir, 
were heard ; and they were graciously answered." 

It is religion, it is the guidance which comes from divine providence, 
that is most needed. Our Lord and Savior said to his nearest friends, 
"Why sleep ye? Rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation" (Luke 
22:46). 

"Pray without ceasing," the Bible tells us (Thes. 5:17). "Watch 
and Pray," the Master said again, "that ye enter not into temptation. 
The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak" (Matt. 26:41). 

"SEEK YE THE LORD" 

To pray without ceasing is the practice needed by the youth of 
this country; for they are, in these days, surrounded on every hand 
with pitfalls and unusual temptations. The words of the Master ought 
to be kept ringing in their ears : "Why sleep ye ? Rise and pray, lest 
ye enter into temptation." 

"Seek ye the Lord," is another admonition that applies also to the 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



people of these days. Those whose lives are well-nigh completed, 
those who have had long years of experience and know with certainty 
what is worth while — these are the ones who ought to call out to the 
youth of today, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found." Today 
is the accepted time; tomorrow may be too late. O youth of our 
country, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call ye upon him 
while he is near" (Isa. 55:6). This is the doctrine and the practice 
that the people of our country are most in need of at this very hour. 

NOT FAITH ALONE, BUT WORKS 

I hope I shall not give anyone the impression that we favor 
bringing up a generation of young people who rely on faith only. We 
like to emphasize the words of the Master: "Not everyone that saith 
unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he 
that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 7:21). 
That we believe in doing as well as in saying, in works as well as in 
faith, is proved even by the chapels we have built in the Church. 
Most of the chapels have recreation halls connected with them. 

As real Americans, the training we aim to give our young people 
is accurately described by the following words of Theodore Roosevelt : 
"Of course what we have a right to expect from the American boy is 
that he shall turn out to be a good American man. Now, the chances are 
strong that he won't be much of a man unless he is a good deal of a 
boy. He must not be a coward or a weakling, a bully or a prig. He 
must work hard and play hard. He must be clean-minded and clean- 
lived, able to hold his own under all circumstances and against all 
comers. It is only on these conditions that he will grow into the kind 
of man of whom America can really be proud. In life, as in a football 
game, the principle to follow is: 'Hit the line: don't foul; don't shirk. 
Hit the line and hit it hard.' " 

CHIEF AIM OF REAL RELIGION 

While praising and commending this strenuous and vigorous life, 
we impress upon our young folks ever to bear in mind these words 
of the Master: "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born 
again." What does this mean ? That we must be touched with religion ; 
that we must have in our hearts and souls the satisfying conviction that 
comes as a testimony from a life of righteous living. 

Our chief aim in religion is to bring up a generation of young 
people who have character and honor. Before our young people we are 
constantly holding up the words and character of such men as King 
Albert of Belgium, whose deeds have made him immortal. His reply 
to the repeated German appeals for permission to march the German 
army through his country was: "I cannot do so in honor." Standing 
to their guns, he and his people maintained their honor "intact and 
immortal." 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



83 



WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND YOUTH 

It is works like these, not faith alone, which we are struggling to 
make a vital part in the lives of our people. To them we often repeat : 
"Take ye heed, watch and pray" (Matt. 13:33). Ye must be born 
again of the spirit. To him who relies upon daily prayer, "Every 
day is a fresh beginning, every day is the world made new" (Susan 
Coolidge). 

Believing purity to be better than repentance, we teach our children 
to pray, to place their trust in divine providence. We do our utmost 
to keep them from sowing wild oats. We are struggling to understand 
youth, we are hoping to make youth understand us. The stirring appeal 
of Stephen L. Richards this morning for a better understanding of 
youth indicates how earnestly we are struggling to understand the young 
folks and to keep them in the ways of truth. 

THE WELL-BALANCED LIFE 

We believe in the well-rounded out, the well-balanced education, 
of both mind and heart. During the past year the President of the 
Church and his associates appropriated nearly one million and a half 
dollars for educational purposes. If you knew how generously money 
has been expended to train our youth, to teach them to "pray without 
ceasing;" if you knew that the Church is pressed today for funds be- 
cause of the great expenditures made for the religious training of your 
sons and daughters; that the President and his associates, in order to 
give our young folks the religious training which the nation and the 
youth of our country so much need, have established eighty-two sem- 
inaries and maintained many church schools — then, I feel sure, you 
faithful members would come forward more liberally with your tithing. 
There is no price in time, in effort, or in money that you cannot afford 
to pay, if by so doing you can have your young folks so taught and 
trained that they will bring to you and to your family honor and not 
dishonor, credit and not discredit. 

AIMS OF PRESIDENT GRANT 

As to the President of the Church, his heart is noble, generous. 
He not only prays daily for the youth of the Church, but he has made 
appropriations for their welfare more liberally than is justified by the 
amount of tithing that you faithful Church members have paid. May 
we take to heart the words spoken by him at the opening session of 
Conference, when he said : "Pay your tithes." 

I have every faith in him. He is the inspired servant of the Most 
High. I believe in the promise he made: "Pay your tithes, pay your 
offerings, and you will be richly blessed." 

By so doing, we make it possible to place our religious training, 
our seminary instruction, within the reach of students in the public 
schools. Only thus shall we be able to bring up a generation of people 
the like of whom the world has not known.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

W'e have listened to a great many testimonies from our brethren 
during this conference. 

We shall now call on some of our sisters to address us briefly. 

SISTER LOUISE Y. ROBISON 

President of the Relief Society 

My brethren and sisters, I am sure you will know that I need your 
faith and prayers, but I do love to bear my testimony. I know that 
our Heavenly Father has been good to me, and to all women, especially 
since this glorious gospel has been restored. It seems to me that the 
women of this Church cannot fail to show our Heavenly Father their 
gratitude by upholding the standards of the Church and by obeying 
entirely, as far as it is humanly possible, the instructions of our leaders. 
I am happy to say that the Latter-day Saint women are loyal, and do 
pray earnestly for our Authorities. The Relief Society women are 
striving to give to the Church boys and girls who are clean and who will 
be capable of carrying on the Lord's work. When I hear the mission 
presidents' reports, my heart is just thrilled to think of the work that 
the missionaries have done ; that they have carried the gospel to foreign 
countries. My parents were partakers of it, and I can only pray that 
I shall live and that I shall encourage other mothers of Zion to so live, 
that we may give to the world men and women who are clean and pure 
and capable of carrying this inspiring message to our brethren and 
sisters abroad. 

I thank President Grant for this privilege, and I pray that we 
shall ever be true to the leaders of this Church, and then I am sure we 
shall be safe. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

SISTER RUTH MAY FOX 

President of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association 

My brethren and sisters, this is surely a surprise to me, and I stand 
before you entirely dependent upon the Spirit of our Heavenly Father 
as to what I shall say. I may say, however, that I am very, very 
proud of being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day- 
Saints. Since I am asked to bear my testimony, you will not 
consider it egotistical if I say that from my childhood, I have looked 
upon the presiding brethren — the President of this Church, and those 
associated with him — as the very servants of God. I was taught in my 
early years that President Brigham Young was the mouthpiece of God to 
all mankind, and that thought has never wavered in my heart concerning 
him and also the succeeding presidents up to this time. I want to say 
here before the fathers and the mothers, teach your children reverence 
for the Authorities of the Church. Teach them that they are men of 



SISTER RUTH MAY POX 



85 



God. Teach them to obey their counsels. I was trained to believe that 
in obeying counsel there is safety. I realize that nowadays many of us 
are not so particular about this matter as our people used to be. 

Naturally, as you know, I am interested in the youth. I have been 
interested in my own children, and as I look back through a long life 
and take note of what I have gained, I find it is my children that 
mean the most to me. My children are my jewels ; they are my heritage, 
and I thank the Lord that they are fairly good. None of us can throw 
stones, you know. We all live in glass houses. But I do thank the 
Lord that I have been able to rear my children in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I do pray that he will give me influence 
with the daughters of Zion, especially; that because I have lived they 
may have more faith in God and in their fathers and mothers and 
in the Authorities of the Church. I ask this blessing in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

SISTER MAY ANDERSON 

President of the Primary Association 

I am happy today to be able to bear my testimony. I was not 
born in the Church. My parents were converted many years ago. 
When I was a young girl a prediction was made on my head and 
blessings were given to me. When the statement was made in this 
conference that it is a good thing to have and read your patriarchal 
blessings, I could say, Amen to that, because blessings which have 
been pronounced upon my head have been literally fulfilled. The 
prediction given in my youth said I should come to be known in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that my name would 
be respected. I realize that if my name is respected I must live in such 
a way as to earn that respect. I have tried to do my duty as it has 
been presented to me by the General Authorities of the Church and 
by my knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

It is a very great responsibility, in my estimation, to raise your 
voice and give service in behalf of little children. Had I known, in 
the early days of my life what would be the greatest pleasure to me 
I could not have chosen a vocation more suited to the happiness and 
contentment of my life than the privilege of trying to help boys and 
girls to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

My testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, is that God loves 
us and that he is willing to bless us. I know this in and of myself, 
and I ascribe my greatest happiness to my membership in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

That we may all enjoy this supreme blessing, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation then arose and sang the first two verses of the 
hymn, "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning." 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

Frankly, I am a bit frightened. I might have used another word 
but I think that will express my feelings. I do not believe that anyone 
can face a presence such as this and not feel a little abnormal. One 
other thing troubles me, and that is I do not know just what I ought 
to say. I have but one idea in mind with which to begin. After that 
we will have to take our chances. 

I recall that in our State Constitutional Convention, when the com- 
mittee on personal rights made its report to that body (I think it was 
my friend, Franklin S. Richards who read the report) there was a 
clause in it which at the time did not strike me very favorably; and 
I remember I called up some question in regard to it. I had not previous 
to that time given it due consideration. It was this : "A frequent 
recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the maintenance of 
liberty and the rights of the people." I thought such a clause un- 
necessary, and made some objection, as I say; but after consideration 
I concluded that I was mistaken, and that the paragraph announced a 
very profound principle, and a very necessary thing. I have thought much 
of it through the years since then, and am persuaded that it is a 
profitable thing, from time to time, to go to the consideration of funda- 
mental principles. In the case of civil government, of course, reference 
to the consideration of fundamentals is needful to preserve liberties 
of the people. So, also, in Church affairs, in religion, I have discovered 
that when things get a bit confused, and in your feeling and thought 
you are about at the zero point, a good way to work out of the con- 
fusion is to consider first principles, fundamental things. 

Now this morning the thought occurred to me that it might be 
well for me, on this occasion, to consider what to me personally are the 
fundamental things. Then if in an incidental way, the audience can get 
benefit from this consideration, there will be that much of gain. 

Very well, then, let me say first of all: I believe in God; and in 
the Lord Jesus Christ, as the very Son of God; and the Holy Ghost, 
as that Spirit of intelligence that imparts the knowledge of the truth, 
and is the witness of the Father and Son unto the world. I believe that. 
I believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ as the means that divine wisdom 
has devised for the salvation of the world. I believe in all the ordi- 
nances of that gospel as the means through which the grace of God is 
imparted to the human soul, and salvation results through faith in and 
obedience to that gospel. 

I believe in the Church of God, with God's holy priesthood as the 
inside framework of it ; that gives it form and stability and power and 
authority. 

I believe that there have been many dispensations of the gospel 
given to men. The dispensation between Adam and Noah, counted as 
the patriarchal dispensation; and the gospel, or part of it, not wholly, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS

but rather imperfectly expressed through the law that was given unto 
Israel in symbols, and signs of things yet to come and not the very 
things themselves, but stood as representatives of those things — the 
"school master" to bring men to Christ. 

I believe in the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ — and in his atone- 
ment that he offered for the salvation of men ; and I believe that atone- 
ment is essential to the salvation of men. I believe it was God's means of 
expressing his love for the world, for as God so loved the world that 
he gave his only begotten Son, to become the Savior of the world, so 
the Lord Jesus Christ himself so loved his brethren that he was willing 
to make the sacrifice for their salvation, and thus gave evidence to men 
indeed of the love of God. 

I was speaking a moment since of the successive dispensations. 
I believe that the great dispensation, introduced by the ministry of 
John the Baptist, and followed by the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
is the dispensation of the meridian of times, for the development of those 
great things concerning the salvation of men and the expression of the 
love of God. I also believe that, in fulfillment of the inspired words of 
the servants of God in those days, men subsequently transgressed the 
laws, changed the ordinances, broke that glorious covenant, and left 
the world again in darkness. True, throughout that period from the 
Christ to our day, there were left fragments of the splendid truths and 
sublime teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, that have become the com- 
mon heritage of the world. But the formal authority of the Church 
and the ordinances of salvation — these were departed from, and a 
period of dark apostasy hung over the world until, in the providences 
of God, the time came for the introduction of what is known to us as 
the dispensation of the fulness of times. God raised up a prophet in 
these latter days to introduce that bringing together of all the dispensa- 
tions that have ever been, and welding them into one great final tri- 
umphant dispensation. That restoration was brought to pass through 
the work that God introduced by the Prophet Joseph Smith ; by reveal- 
ing himself and his Son Jesus Christ to this witness, who was to be 
God's witness in the world in these last days, the witness par excellence ; 
and hence the vision given to him was clearer and fuller than had ever 
been given in the world before. I believe that with all my soul. 

In the course of time this new witness sealed his testimony with his 
blood. I doubt not but what the wisdom of heaven concluded it was 
essential, because where a testament is, as Paul argues, there must needs 
be the death of the testator, in order that the final evidence that man 
can put upon his life and his work might be given to his fellowmen. 
He gives his life in attestation of it. Hence the broad seal of Joseph 
Smith's martyrdom is affixed to the Book of Mormon and to the volume 
of revelations that he gave to the world. 

Necessarily there had to be successors to him. There have been 
six : Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, 
Joseph F. Smith, and our present President, Heber J. Grant. 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



There must be, after the introduction of this dispensation, no 
recession from the position that had been taken by the introduction of 
this work. Hence, believing in God's holy priesthood, I must needs 
believe in the perpetuation of that priesthood in its fullness; in its 
glory, in its power, and in the success of it. The first prophet must 
arrange for a perpetuity of that which had been given to him. I 
believe that he did. 

It would not matter to me if all the forms and ceremonies might 
not have been followed. Substance is more than shadow ; and I believe 
that Brigham Young inherited, by the fact of his succession to Joseph 
Smith, all that Joseph Smith had received from God through the 
ministration of holy angels with their several keys of authority and 
power. And that, succeeding Brigham Young, the next man in position 
came to the same heritage, power and authority. The one following 
him in like manner received the same heritage of power and authority ; 
and so all down the line until the present time. I now proclaim my 
faith absolutely that Heber J. Grant possesses all that these other men 
possessed ; that he is God's servant ; that he is the mouthpiece of God 
to this people and likewise to this generation of men so long as he 
shall live. I believe that, and that there has been no diminution of 
authority and power between him and his predecessors. I may say in 
the way of my testimony concerning him, that I have known him for 
a good many years. We have had some experiences together, not 
always, I was going to say, of a pleasant kind, but I think I ought not 
to say that, for when the outcome of things has been reached the 
fulfillment has been good, but the way has not always been smooth. 

There is no man that I know of anywhere who by the texture of 
his nature and character, who by the purity and the uprightness of his 
life, can be more loved of God than President Heber J. Grant. I have 
absolute faith in his honesty, and if God has a word to impart to the 
Church or to the world, I could not select in my mind, or from my 
experience among my friends fix upon a man whom I would believe 
could hold the confidence and favor of God more than he. So that not 
only by the ordinations that he has received, and calls to authority and 
place, I believe absolutely in his fitness for his position. And when 
God has a word to give His Church or to the world, this man, as long 
as he lives, will be the man through whom it will come. That is my 
faith in regard to Heber J. Grant. 

I have been fortunate enough to know all the Presidents of the 
Church since the Prophet Joseph Smith. Of course I only knew Brig- 
ham Young as a boy may know a great man from a distance. But 
I sat under the sound of his voice, and heard his teaching, felt the 
influence of his spirit, and noted the evidence of inspiration in his face 
when he taught the people, and in his bearing as he stood before them — 
he was God's mouthpiece unto the people. John Taylor I knew more 
intimately. When I went on my first mission there was no mission 
organized in that particular state where I was laboring. I was the 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



89 



only elder in it, and my reports were made directly to President John 
Taylor, and my instructions were received directly from his office. 
Later, when presiding in the Southern States Mission, I found it 
necessary to submit problems and questions to him directly, and to sit 
with him in council in relation to the affairs of that mission. Later, 
of course, as some of you know, I became his biographer ; so that all 
his letters in existence, personal and official — his official communications, 
his journals, and everything that had been written to or by him, passed 
through my hands; and I wrote the story of his life. That made me 
intimately acquainted with him. 

With Wilford Woodruff I had the good fortune to have most 
personal and confidential relations, and to me, of the dearest kind. I 
may say the same thing, though not to the same extent, with reference 
to Lorenzo Snow. Joseph F. Smith I knew more intimately. I came 
in contact with his mind, and sometimes it was flash against flash. But 
I must say for Joseph F. Smith that I saw him on numerous occasions 
respond to the spirit of inspiration from God, and rise above himself 
and give decisions and draw conclusions ; though some times contrary 
to his natural inclinations, yet he followed the light as God gave him to 
see it — I am sure of that. 

I have already said concerning Heber J. Grant that I have known 
him a long time. He has been my friend on various occasions. I 
appreciate those manifestations of his good will for me. 

I believe then that this line of six succeeding presidents of the 
Church have been men inspired of God ; that God has been with them ; 
and as I stated recently from this stand, the occasions of observing 
inspiration in these men have been too positive and frequent for me 
to doubt for a moment that the Church of the Latter-day Saints 
has been organized on God's plan; that he has ordained that there is 
but one man at a time on earth who receives revelations for the whole 
Church, and that man is of his appointing, approval and upholding. 

That, as to my faith, is what I call fundamental principles. What 
I have said marks off my faith in this present dispensation of the 
gospel; and if there has been any wavering anywhere or at any time 
from this conviction that I now express, I have not been conscious of 
it. Such my faith — briefly expressed — in fundamental principles that 
I hold in connection with you, I presume, in relation to this great 
latter-day work. And my faith is that it is going on to its triumph. 
I know not through what trying circumstances as a Church we shall 
pass in the second century of existence, even as we have had to pass 
through experiences in this first century now drawing to a close. I 
know not that; but I have supreme confidence that the second century 
as well as the first century will close gloriously, and that the purposes 
of God will be achieved even as his wisdom shall unfold them. 

I happened to be reminded today that next April it will be fifty 
years since I commenced my public ministry in the Church. Fifty 
years since I was called in a conference of the Church such as this to

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



become a traveling elder ; and between then and now what wonderful 
experiences are stretched out ! Will you pardon me just a moment if 
I refer to some of these things ? During that time my labors have been 
almost incessant in the interest of this work, in preaching from the 
pulpit, in lecturing from platforms, in writing books — expository books, 
defensive books, historical books — until I think I may say, without dis- 
paragement of others, at least the volume of my work in this kind — 
in the contributions I have made to the Church — is not exceeded by any 
other man in that fifty years. I mean as to the volume of the contribu- 
tion. As to the value of that contribution of course others may have 
written more valuable books. I will not go into that. I want to bear 
testimony to you that I have at least been busy in the period mentioned. 
I have preached the gospel in many lands; not in as many as some, 
but I have traveled almost as much as any man within the last fifty 
years — not perhaps to such great distances as others, but within the 
English-speaking races I have covered as much territory. 

I am mentioning some of these things in order that my profession 
of faith that I have made here today may be supported by the evidence 
of steady, persistent effort on my part to develop and to advocate and 
to establish this great work of God. I have preached under many 
circumstances ; within prison walls where I myself was a prisoner for 
the sake of this work; and in the halls of congress too, where if I 
did not fill the term of my office I had the opportunity at least of bearing 
witness to the truth of this work. I saw the wrath of a nation rise to 
break upon my head ; and when I took my station in the hall of Repre- 
sentatives before the speaker's desk, to take the oath of office, I was 
confronted by a petition signed by seven millions of people, rolled 
in upon trucks before the speaker's desk, to protest against my in- 
stalment into office. And I was thrust away from the first rung of the 
ladder that I had dreamed and hoped might lead to a career of use- 
fulness in behalf of my people. This, too, for obedience to the doctrine 
of the New Dispensation. I was crushed and mangled in the lone 
fight ; for it was a lone fight, so far as human aid is concerned, 
with the exception of a few dear hands that were thrust out to render 
a little assistance in a material way, all of which I returned for the 
most part. But the helpers were very few. 

I still held on in spite of these things. I have faced both in the 
old world and the new, the violence of mobs. I have known men to be 
practically shot from my side, martyrs to the cause of God ; and I 
did not desert them. I took my risk with them to render them service, 
dead though they were. I do not know how I shall ever obtain your 
pardon for such references as these to personal services in this, God's 
work. But this is my object, and my object alone; that after bearing 
testimony to the fundamental things of this work, and my confidence 
in it, I hope that if anywhere along the line I have caused any of you 
to doubt my faith in this work, then let this testimony and my indicated 
life's work be a correction of it. I make reference to these personal 
things in fifty years of service so that you may know that my testimony 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



91 



has some sanctions for it in the life of service I have given to the cause. 
And if to your minds, I say again, there does not occur remembrance 
of this service, then let the shame of it be mine. It would not be good 
taste for me to make further allusion to such things. 

After the hymn, "O Ye Mountains High," had been sung by the 
congregation, the benediction was pronounced by Elder John E. Hepler, 
who is in charge of the Bureau of Information on the Temple Grounds. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

On Sunday morning, October 6th, the auditorium and galleries of 
the large Tabernacle were crowded to capacity, every seat being taken 
and every available space in the aisles and doorways being occupied. 

The Assembly Hall directly south of the Tabernacle was crowded 
with people who listened to the Conference proceedings as they were 
broadcast from the Tabernacle. Thousands of others who were unable 
to get inside of either of these buildings, assembled upon the Taber- 
nacle grounds and listened to the services by means of loud speakers 
that had been installed. 

The fifth session of the Conference began promptly at ten o'clock, 
with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The Tabernacle Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "We thank 
thee, O God, for a Prophet." 

Elder Joseph T. Finlinson, President of the Deseret Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

Sister Mamie Stark, assisted by the choir, sang the hymn, "O Mv 
Father." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

When Jesus came into the coasts of Csesarea Philippi, he asked 
his disciples, saying: 

'"Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 

"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist ; some Elias ; and 
others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the son of the 
living God." 

If the Lord will give me help, my brethren and sisters, I desire 
to make this scripture which I have read the basis of the brief remarks 
that I am to make this morning. Never before have I more profoundly 
felt my own weakness and utter dependence upon the Lord. Facing this 
great congregation of Latter-day Saints, which appears to me possibly 
the greatest ever assembled in the history of the Church, I am over- 
come with emotion, which leaves me in a very dependent frame of 
mind. 

I have prepared and must necessarily refer briefly to notes which 
I have, because I desire in a few minutes to take you over a long trail, 
a winding trail, which will lead us back a hundred years. 

FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES 

The scripture which I have read, uttered by the Redeemer of the 
world, so often quoted and expounded before congregations of Christian 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



93 



people, contains fundamental doctrines with which the members of the 
Church should be thoroughly familiar. The question propounded was 
a very simple one : "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?" 
The answer is equally simple, where definite information or knowledge 
is lacking : "Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Jeremias or 
Elias, or one of the prophets." But Peter made a definite and direct 
answer : "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Then said 
the Redeemer to him: "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and 
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. 
* * * Thou art Peter, and upon this rock (the rock of revelation) I 
will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." 
And continuing, he said to Peter : "I will give unto thee the keys of the 
kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be 
bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven." 

UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF REVELATION 

A thoughtful study of these words reveals these great truths : 
First, that it is possible that knowledge not previously possessed may 
come from God our Father to his children who are here upon earth. 
It is probably true that Peter himself did not understand the direct 
source from which the impulse that prompted his answer had come, 
but this scripture makes it plain that it came from God our Father, 
who spoke to him through the influence, or whisperings, of the Holy 
Ghost. 

Another important truth which this scripture reveals is that the 
means of communication between our Father who is in heaven and his 
children who are here upon earth, is the Holy Spirit of God, the Holy 
Ghost, communicated to us through the precious gift of revelation. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to be built upon 
this principle of revelation. 

Another very important thing which is definitely implied by these 
words spoken by the Redeemer of the world is that the keys which were 
bestowed upon Peter, when in the possession of any other man, as 
they were in the possession of Peter, confer upon him the authority 
to bind upon earth and it shall be bound in heaven ; to loose upon earth 
and it shall be loosed in heaven. 

Questions which are of vital importance, and in which this principle 
or doctrine of revelation is directly involved, have come to the Church 
from the time of its organization until the present. They are con- 
stantly being introduced and discussed, many of which, unless properly 
understood and defined, lead to confusion and misunderstanding. 

A TEMPLE BUILDING CHURCH 

It is to one of these questions that I desire to confine my remarks 
this morning. I refer to the propaganda which is being so industriously 
circulated among members of the Church, in favor of the immediate 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



construction of a temple at Independence, in Jackson county, Missouri. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a temple-building 
church. Among the very first commandments that were given to the 
Church was the word of the Lord in regard to the building of temples; 
and we are told in the revelation that its members are always expected 
to do this in order that the house of the Lord may be erected, and a 
place properly prepared where the ordinances of his house may be 
administered in the manner in which he designs that they should be. 

In the early history of the Church, a temple was erected at Kirt- 
land, Ohio, the first to be dedicated to the Lord in this dispensation. 
Prior to that time, however, the Lord had revealed to the Church that 
the center stake of Zion was to be established in Jackson county, Mis- 
souri. I desire to read the revelation which refers to this, and which 
is contained in the eighty-fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant, Joseph Smith, Jr., and six 
elders, as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high. 

"Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his Church, established in the last 
days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his 
prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which 
shall be the city of New Jerusalem. 

"Which city shall be built, beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed 
by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the state of Missouri, and 
dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord 
was well pleased. 

"Verily, this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be 
built by the gathering of the Saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the 
temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation. 

"For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be 
built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even 
the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house." 

PERIOD OF PERSECUTION 

All of you, my brethren and sisters, who are familiar with the 
history of the Church know that after the gathering of numbers of its 
members to the state of Missouri, persecution developed which became 
so intense and unbearable that they were not permitted to remain there. 
During the period of these persecutions excavations were made at Far 
West in Missouri, and the corner stone laid there, with the intention 
of erecting a temple at that place, but because of persecution the work 
proceeded no farther. 

The people were finally driven from the state. Many were put to 
death. Many were imprisoned, and property of inestimable value was 
confiscated. 

Driven from Missouri, members of the Church migrated to the 
state of Illinois, where they found temporary asylum and peace. It 
was nine years after the revelation from which I have just read was 
given that the Lord commanded the Church to proceed immedi- 
ately to erect a temple at Nauvoo, Illinois. Before this building 
was entirely completed, opposition to the Church again developed. 
Persecution became more intense, perhaps, than ever before. Men 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



95 



were placed under arrest, charged w.ith sedition, murder, and other 
kindred offenses — not one of which was ever proved to be true — 
with the result, as you all know, that the members of the Church 
were again driven from their homes, and under the leadership of 
Brigham Young, turned their faces westward, in the hope that they 
might find peace and the opportunity to worship the Lord as their 
consciences dictated, here in the valleys of these mountains. Brigham 
Young, having become the leader of the Church, it was under his 
presidency that the migration across the plains was successfully carried 
out. 

Just as definitely as the Church was commanded to make Jackson 
county, Missouri, the gathering place of the Saints, and to erect a 
temple there in this generation, upon which a cloud should rest by 
day, so does he, in this scripture which I have read, release them from 
that responsibility. And he says further : 

"This I make an example unto you, for your consolation concerning all 
those who have been commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the 
hands of their enemies, and by oppression, saith the Lord your God." 

After the arrival of the pioneers in this valley one of the first 
important acts of the President was to designate a spot for the erection 
of a temple, upon the block where we are now assembled, work upon 
which was immediately commenced and prosecuted until the structure 
was finished and dedicated, and has for many years been in operation. 

VARIOUS FACTIONS 

At the time of the exodus of the Church from Nauvoo, Illinois, 
many of its members remained behind, among them the family, of the 
Prophet. Sidney Rigdon, the man who had dedicated the spot in 
Missouri where the city of Zion and temple were to be reared, a close 
friend of Joseph Smith, and at one time his counselor in the Presidency, 
retired to Pittsburgh, where he gathered around him a small congrega- 
tion, and organized a church after the pattern of the Church at Nauvoo. 
The movement, however, was an entire failure, and it was but a short 
time until his congregation left him and scattered. 

James J. Strang, another man of great influence and power in 
the Church, claiming that Joseph Smith had designated him to be his 
successor in the Presidency, led away a considerable number of 
people to Beaver Island, in Lake Michigan, where he organized a 
church and sent his missionaries to Great Britain and other parts 
of the world. He was finally anointed king, by his congregation, and 
reigned as a king until finally his administration became unbearable, 
and he was (killed by one of the members of his own congregation. 

Lyman Wight, a man of influence in the Church, gathered to- 
gether a small body of these people who remained behind, and es- 
tablished himself in Texas, where for a time he held a small con- 
gregation together. But like all the others, it was only a short time 
until there was dissolution and he was left alone. 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It was from the members of these different congregations, brought 
together under the leadership of Joseph Smith, the son of the prophet, 
that the church known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was formed. This denomination is still in existence. 

HEDRICKITES OR CHURCH OF CHRIST 

The matter to which I desire to call particular attention relates to 
the small congregation of people known as Hedrickites. In 1851 
Granville Hedrick and Daniel Judy, both of whom had been regularly 
ordained elders in the Church, began to preach the gospel as they 
understood it. They gathered around them a number of converts. 
They rejected the doctrine of plural marriage, the doctrine of baptism 
for the dead, and practically all of the revelations given to the Church 
through Joseph Smith after 1834, declaring that from that time forward 
he had been a fallen prophet. These people, in 1864, removed to 
Jackson county, Missouri, and soon after, by purchase, acquired a small 
portion of the tract of land which was originally known as the temple 
block. The tract of land purchased by Edward Partridge, and which 
was designated as the temple block, consisted of some 63 acres. This 
had been subdivided and sold, so that the Hedrickites acquired only 
about three acres of the original tract, which they now hold. 

By the addition of numbers of people who have dissented from 
the Reorganized Church and others, the numbers of the Hedrickites 
have recently been considerably increased. They have now organized 
themselves into a church which they call the Church of Christ. 

SOLICITING AID 

It is a well known fact to many of you that these people have sent 
out their agents, who have recently visited many of the wards of the 
Church in the stakes of Zion that are in Utah, Arizona, California, 
Idaho and in other places. The message which they bring to us is 
this : that the Lord has revealed to them that the time has come when 
the temple is to be erected upon the temple lot at Jackson county, 
that this scripture which I have read, from section 84 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, may be fulfilled, because they call attention to the fact 
that the generation which lived at the time that the revelation was 
given has about passed away. They have been to us. They 
have come to our office soliciting aid. They would like us 
to assist them in building a temple. In other words, they would 
like us to become a part of their organization, not to direct it, not 
to control it, but to act in harmony with it. 

A HOUSE BUT NOT A TEMPLE 

My brethren and sisters, with all good feeling toward these people, 
which we have always had, and always manifested, you will readily 
understand the impossibility of such a coalition. It is true that a 
house may be erected upon that tract of ground in this generation, but 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



97 



it will not be a temple erected to the name of the Lord and accepted 
by him, until the time comes when he shall speak through the proper 
channel, and the work be accomplished by his recognized church. 

THE PURPOSE OF A TEMPLE 

I asked these people what they would do with the temple if they 
had one. What would a temple be to people who do not believe in 
baptism for the dead? The first great purpose, when the Lord com- 
manded the building of the temple at Nauvoo, was that a proper place 
might be provided for the administration of the ordinances of the 
house of the Lord in behalf of our dead ; and the Lord told us plainly 
that except we went to and completed that work, that the keys of 
authority for the administration of these ordinances might be conferred, 
he would no longer accept the administration of the ordinance of 
baptism for the dead as we had been administering it. 

Now, in connection with this I desire to call your attention to 
something which has direct application to it. 

THEIR OFFERINGS ACCEPTED 

At the time that the revelation was given commanding the construc- 
tion of the Nauvoo temple, which was about ten years after the one 
from which I have read, the Lord makes this plain and definite state- 
ment : 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of 
the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with 
all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their 
diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing 
that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of 
those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings. 

"Therefore, for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom I 
commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in Jackson County, 
Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith the Lord, your God." 

It reveals to us this great truth, that God does not require at the 
hands of men the accomplishment of that which is impossible — not 
impossible to him, but impossible to them. Whether it applies to this 
particular subject which I am treating, whether it applies to any other 
law that has been given of the Lord, and which the Church has con- 
scientiously endeavored to carry out and been prevented from doing so 
by the enactment of civil law which would bring us into direct conflict 
with the government under which we live, — the Lord holds that in 
abeyance. 

IN THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS 

Now, do not understand me to say, my brethren and sisters, or 
to infer that Jackson county, Missouri, will not eventually be the 
gathering place of the saints, that it will not be the place for the 
erection of the city which shall be known as the New Jerusalem; 
but it is very definitely certain that it was not the will of the Lord that 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it should be made the first great gathering place of the members of 
his Church in this dispensation. Otherwise he would not have brought 
the people to these valleys of the mountains ; otherwise the words of the 
prophets of old would not have been fulfilled. Isaiah, long ago, before 
the birth of the Redeemer of the world, declared, looking into the 
future, that it should come to pass in the last days that the mountain 
of the Lord's house should be established, — not upon the plains of 
Missouri, nor the rolling hills of Illinois, — but it should be established 
in the top of the mountains, and should be exalted above the hills, 
and all nations should flow unto it. Many people should go and say : 
Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house 
of the God of Jacob. For what purpose? That we may there be 
taught his ways and learn to walk in his paths. 

FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD 

If that scripture to which I refer has not been fulfilled by the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, during the past hundred 
years, it has not been fulfilled anywhere. Father Jacob, when he 
laid his hands upon Joseph, his younger son, declared that his heritage 
had prevailed beyond that of his progenitors. They were given 
Palestine, but his heritage extended to the utmost bounds of the ever- 
lasting hills ; to a land shadowed with wings ; to a land rich in gold 
and silver and the precious things of the earth ; to a land where the 
gathering of a people would occur, who would make the desert to 
blossom as the rose ; a land in which cities would be built in what had 
before been desolate places ; a land in which the voices of children and 
music would be heard, where before there had been silence and deso- 
lation. 

As I look at this congregation of Latter-day Saints today I see 
in it the fulfillment of these words of the prophet. There are gathered 
here people from all parts of the world. They have come to Zion. 
The}- are the sons of Joseph, the heritage to whose race and people 
was conferred upon his younger son, Ephraim. Oh, it is a wonderful 
thing, my brethren and sisters, if we could only understand it. The 
redemption of Zion is yet to come. 

THE UNITED ORDER 

I found on my desk yesterday a printed communication from a 
man, undoubtedly a good man, undoubtedly earnest in what he says, 
in which he declares himself to be a forerunner of the establishment 
of the United Order, the law of consecration which was given to 
the Church. He is a seventy in the Church and in good standing. He 
makes himself the self-appointed guardian of the Church, a watch- 
man upon the towers of Zion. 

The Lord gave us the law of consecration and the United Order, 
which is the order that God's people must sooner or later obey — 
I bear testimony to that ; I have tried it ; I know its benefits. It was 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS

not a failure on the part of the Church where I resided, but we were 
evidently not prepared for it. But the Lord told us, as recorded in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that this law should be held in abeyance 
until the time of the redemption of Zion. 

THE NEW JERUSALEM 

I would like to read if you will excuse me for possibly overrunning 
the time a little — from the Book of Mormon, something that has a 
direct bearing upon this subject. These are the words of the Redeemer 
himself who came and ministered to the Nephite people upon this 
continent. Speaking of that which was yet far future he says: 

"It shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of Israel. 

"And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of 
the covenant which I have made with your father Jacob. 

"This people" — he was speaking directly to the Nephite people. 

"And it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the 
midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you." 

Again, in the following chapter, speaking of the people that should 
inhabit this land, calling them to repentance, he says : 

"If they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden not their 
hearts, I will establish my church among them," — which he has done. 

"And they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this 
the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inheritance. 

"And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and also as many 
of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall 
be called the New Jerusalem. 

"And then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are 
scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem. 

"And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also 
will be in the midst." 

THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSES 

What a wonderful conception of the purposes of the Almighty we 
have, when we come to consider not only the accomplishments of 
the past century, but that which is still before the Church. The opening 
of the greatest gospel dispensation in the history of the world, for 
it means the consummation of God's work. It means the redemption 
of his covenant people, the bringing of them together, and their 
restoration to the promised lands of their fathers. It means that 
Judah shall return to Palestine, which they are doing. The World 
War brought about wonderful changes, all looking to the fulfillment of 
these words of the prophets. It brought Palestine under the pro- 
tectorate of Great Britain, the heritage of their own people, for Great 
Britain, the Anglo-Saxon people of the world today, are largely made 
up of the remnants of the ten tribes of Israel who were carried away 
captive by Shalmanezer. 

Thus the Lord moves in a mysterious way to accomplish his 
purposes. We do not always understand them. We do not always

understand the end in the beginning, but as we see the gradual de- 
velopment of the Lord's work we come to understand it. 

I suppose few people see, in the coming to the United States of 
Ramsay Macdonald, the prime minister of Great Britain, anything 
that has particular relationship to the word of God, but I see in it 
possibilities of wonderful accomplishment. He comes from this British 
nation, this nation of Christian people, this nation among which Chris- 
tianity was established while Rome was still a heathen nation, this people 
who were the first to erect a Christian church, as far as we are aware ; 
where from that time to the present the people — speaking of the people at 
large — have retained their faith in Christ, and according to the light that 
they have had, have served him. The Lord will use them as his instru- 
ments in the bringing about of these mighty purposes, one of the greatest 
of which is the gathering of these dispersed tribes. 

There are a hundred and thirty millions of people in Russia. Who 
are they? What is their ancestry? Prof. Chwolson of the National 
Museum at St. Petersburg, has traced more than seven hundred tombs 
of people that had been buried along the route traveled by the Ten 
Tribes from the time they left Assyria until they found their way into 
southern Russia, into the Balkan states, into the British Isles and 
northern Europe. They are the people from whom the harvest of the 
Church is being gathered today. 

A SIGNIFICANT THING 

An interesting thing that I noted here, to which I wish to call your 
attention, is that the Book of Mormon tells us that the Jews shall 
begin to believe, before the coming of Christ. At a meeting recently 
held at Hamburg, in Germany, attended by four hundred missionary 
Jews, it was announced that in Russia alone, during the past seven 
years since the World War — the World War gave liberty to the Russian 
people, the most down-trodden, priest-ridden people in the world who 
profess to be civilized — eight hundred thousand Jews have accepted 
belief in Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of Israel. Rather a significant 
thing, is it not, my brethren and sisters, if it is true ? 

THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOUSE 

I must not continue my remarks. I thought of this hymn which we 
sang yesterday: 

"High on the mountain top, 
A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations now look up ; 

It waves to all the world. 
* * * 

"For God remembers still 
His promise made of old" 
He hasn't forgotten it. 
"That he on Zion's hill 
Truth's standard would unfold! 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



101 



"His house shall there be reared, 

His glory to display ; 

And people shall be heard 

In distant lands to say: 

We'll now go up and serve the Lord, 

Obey His truth, and learn His word." 

I knew the good man who wrote these verses, inspired by the 
spirit of prophecy; for he declared just what we are realizing today, 
not only in behalf of the members of the Church, but thousands of 
people, who are coming here every year to this Bureau of Information, 
where they are asking for information regarding the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints; and they are receiving it, information 
properly given. Its influence is felt in all parts of the world. Away 
down in Czecho-Slovakia, where President Widtsoe has recently opened 
a new mission, the influence of this Bureau of Information lias made 
our elders welcome by the government of that country. 

So the words of Isaiah are being fulfilled ; the mountain of the 
Lord's house is established in the top of the mountains. That is 
what we are particularly interested in. It has been exalted above the 
hills, and many people have come here for the purpose of learning 
the way of the Lord, that they may learn to walk in his paths. 

NOT TEMPLES OF THE LORD 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. Do not allow this question 
of the building of the temple in Jackson county to worry you. A 
house may be built by these people to whom I have referred, but it will 
not be a temple recognized by the living God. One of the first things 
the Nephite people did, after they landed here, was to erect a temple, 
and they built it after the pattern of the temple of Solomon. They 
forgot the Lord. They denied him, and became idolaters, even to 
the offering of human sacrifice. And yet when Hernan Cortes landed 
in Mexico he found the most magnificent temples there, dedicated to 
the worship of the Devil, and they acknowledged that they worshipped 
the Devil, not because they loved him, but because they feared him. 
They said that he appeared to them in bodily form and instructed them 
regarding their duties ; and I believe there was something in it, myself. 
They were temples, but they were not temples that were accepted by 
the Lord. There was one small building at Tezcoco, on the shores 
of the lake, just out from the City of Mexico, in which there was 
no idol, in which no human sacrifice was offered, which was adorned 
"with flowers ; and when asked to whom the house was erected, 
the natives said it was to their Fair God who had visited them and 
gone away, but had promised that he would return, and they were 
waiting for him ; that he was a man who taught them peace and love, to 
abstain from war, to love peace, and help one another. Just a remain- 
ing vestige of the gospel of Christ which was left among that people, 
and they are looking for the return of Quetzalcoatl. 

I pray the blessing of the Lord upon you, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A duet entitled "An Angel From on High" was sung by Cyril 
Martin and Ida Hepworth. 

ELDER J. HOWARD JENKINS 

Former President of the New Zealand Mission 

Responsibility always makes us apprehensive, so this morning I feel 
entirely dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord for those things that 
I shall say. 

This is a time of refreshing. We have all come to conference this 
morning to be refreshed and to return home strengthened in our purpose 
in life, to carry on the ideals of this splendid Church. 

I feel like a watchman from the outposts of New Zealand this 
morning, when I say to you that the gospel is being preached in that 
land, and the inhabitants of that great domain of the British Empire 
are being given the opportunity of learning of the truths of the gospel. 
The elders are faithful and true, and I have been impressed with the 
splendid manhood of this Church. 

As I said in the beginning, responsibility makes us apprehensive. 
As fathers and as leaders of the Church I know that we are appre- 
hensive, but I see no cause. The young men of this Church are building 
splendid roads. They are building finer meetinghouses than we have 
ever enjoyed. They are building splendidly today, and I am satisfied 
that they are not going to neglect the important phase of our purpose 
in coming to the earth. I believe that there is a finer manhood in this 
Church today than has ever been before in the young manhood of this 
Church. I am grateful for the associations I have had with them. I 
have seen their splendid achievements. I have listened to their faith 
and their confidence in the gospel. I realize, too, that they are living 
the gospel each day. I am impressed with their cleanliness, their virtue, 
and their desires to magnify their priesthood in this great work. 

I believe today that greater opportunity awaits the young men in 
this Church than has ever been given to them before from the fact that 
the world is today looking for men who can carry responsibility in the 
true sense that the priesthood of this Church teaches us. I am mindful 
of the fact that our young men are being taught, those who attend 
priesthood meetings, and I feel inspired to say that no greater plan has 
ever been given to us as a priesthood than the movement that was 
inaugurated some time ago, whereby greater development can come 
because of greater opportunity of serving the Lord by magnifying our 
callings. 

I am impressed with a story of a young man who, when he stood 
in the pulpit explaining the principle of repentance, said this : 

"If I steal an article, God requires that I sincerely repent, that I restore 
that which I have stolen. If I have spoken an untruth, God requires that I repent 
in sincerity and restore the evil that I have spoken. The same if I lose my 
virtue, God requires a sincere repentance and a restoration," 



ELDER J. HOWARD JENKINS 



103 



So we come to the great responsibility resting upon us as a Church 
in these days, not only to make restitution for that which we do wrong, 
but to sincerely repent ; and if perchance we take those things that we 
are unable to restore, then a sincere repentance is impossible. And so 
we realize, on the verge of manhood, these great responsibilities when 
we are initiated into this priesthood. 

There was a time in my life when I doubted certain principles of the 
gospel, but through faith I can say to you today that I believe the 
gospel to be true, every principle of it. I believe in the divine leadership 
of the men who stand at the head of this Church, and I believe that God 
will so direct its affairs that it will fulfil its purposes, and that his 
purposes, in the end, will be fulfilled and sustained throughout the 
earth. 

I pray God to bless us in this great responsibility, that the young 
manhood of this Church will keep themselves sweet and clean, that 
the faith of their fathers may come unto them, and that the responsi- 
bilities of this great work shall be borne on their shoulders when the 
opportunity comes to serve, as it will. To this end I pray God's bless- 
ings upon this Church and this people, and I do it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LORENZO W. ANDERSON 

Former President of the Norwegian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I have never realized such a sight before, 
and I did not think that the Lord would ever give me the privilege 
of standing here in this tabernacle. I therefore ask him that he will 
bless me with his Holy Spirit, that the few words I may speak may 
be under its direction. 

I have certainly appreciated this morning's conference. The 
remarks made by Brother Ivins were remarks that I have desired to 
hear, and if Latter-day Saints are faithful they need have no fear about 
the future. 

God gave me a testimony of the divinity of President Grant's 
mission. I know beyond all shadow of a doubt that he is inspired of 
God. And as far as the prophets who have lived in the past are 
concerned, they were prophets unto their time ; but I need the direction 
and the counsel of a living prophet, just as much as they did in times 
that are past. Therefore my desire is that I may heed the instructions 
and counsels which the present prophet gives, for I feel that they are the 
ones that are most essential to me. 

I enjoyed my work in the land of Norway, and while it seems 
as though the government authorities are not as favorable towards us 
as they should be, I feel that this has been a source of blessing to us, 
for we were unable to reach the leading men of the nation before. 
The elders must register when they leave and must register when they 
enter a place, and through this means we are enabled to present unto 
the officers of that country a knowledge of the gospel.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Two missionaries were sent into a different branch to begin labor 
there. The police would not permit them to remain. We took the 
matter up with the American minister, and through his efforts we had 
a visit from a representative of the State Department. This repre- 
sentative called at the office and made all kinds of inquiries as to the 
morality and the standing of the young men who had been appointed to 
labor there. He was very favorably impressed, and we had the privilege 
of giving him a copy of the Book of Mormon — something that I do 
not see how we could have gotten to the State Department had not 
a representative of that department called upon us. 

We desired while there to have Boy Scout work, M Men work and 
Bee Hive work. Another elder and I called upon the secre- 
tary of the Norwegian Scout Association, and asked for the 
privilege of becoming members of that organization. He frankly 
told us that Mormons, Buddhists, Mohammedans and Communists 
could not become members of the Scout organization of Norway. They 
would, as a last resort, permit Catholics, but we were not permitted 
to become members. Later on we sent a written application, and a flat 
denial came back, which would not permit us to become members of 
that organization. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel that the time is near when many 
of the leading people in the land of Norway will accept the gospel. 
I have never been treated with greater respect, with greater courtesy, 
in my life, than I was by those people. They asked me many questions 
relative to the faith of our people, and I believe a good impression was 
made upon them ; but we lack missionaries in that field. 

I had the joy of being up among the Laplanders, and the minister 
who had charge of a colony of them asked me not to do any work 
among them. He said that the Laplanders were so simple-minded they 
would believe almost anything that was told them. But we had the 
privilege of leaving with them a Book of Mormon and a lot of our 
literature, and I believe the time will come that many of these blue-eyed, 
fair-haired people will seek after the gospel. 

Brethren and sisters, let us not do anything that will bring unto 
us sorrow, or bring unto us regret. Let us keep our covenants sacred. 
Let us uphold and sustain those of our brethren who are called to 
preside over us. God bless them ; God bless you, that we may all be 
true and faithful, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Standing before thft great congregation of people in this great 
tabernacle, and standing before a greater congregation, perhaps, the 
people that may be listening in over the radio, I feel the responsibility 
of my position. The thought that was in my mind, and the prayer 
that was in my heart when I was called by President Grant to appear 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 105 



before you, was this: O Lord, help me to glorify thy name, through 
faith, in my utterances this morning. 

DEPENDENCE UPON SPIRIT OF GOD 

As I was coming into the tabernacle yesterday forenoon a brother 
said to me: "President Clawson, will you be a speaker this morning?" 
I said to him: "My dear brother, the Council of the Twelve and other 
authorities of the Church have no notice whatever, at these general 
conferences, as to whether they will be called upon to speak or not; 
and furthermore in speaking, they are not told just what to say. 
They are expected, of course, to depend upon the Spirit of the Lord 
to inspire them." Now, if I shall speak to you this morning by the 
Spirit of the Lord, you will be edified, but if I shall speak to you by 
some other spirit there will be no instruction. So I invoke His Spirit, 
and pray that it may be upon me and upon this congregation. 

THE GOD WE WORSHIP 

We are here as a worshiping assembly. The God that we wor- 
ship, my brethren and sisters and friends, is a God of love, a God of 
mercy, and a God of power. The God that we worship is the God 
of the Bible, as set forth in King James' translation; he is the God 
of Adam and Eve, who were in the Garden of Eden; the God of the 
three great patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; the God of Moses; 
the God of Elijah and of Isaiah, Ezekiel and Jeremiah; the God 
of Jesus Christ who came in the meridian of time ; and the God of his 
apostles. Furthermore, the God that we worship is the God of Joseph 
Smith, the modern prophet. 

This Holy Being that I speak of is a God of body, parts and 
passions, as clearly and definitely described in holy writ, because we are 
told that man is in the image and likeness of God, hence God is in 
the image and likeness of man. Joseph Smith so declared him to be, 
for he saw him in a great vision. This God is comprehensible. He 
falls under the senses. There is something substantial about him, 
something that you can easily realize; but a God without body, parts 
and passions, I take it, cannot be comprehended. 

A GOD OF LOVE 

God is a God of love. Listen to these words by St. John: 

"Beloved, let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that 
loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 

"He that loveth not, knoweth not God ; for God is love." 

Now, isn't that a wonderful statement, that we cannot even know 
God without exercising this tremendous principle of love? He is love, 
and if we shall come to understand him and comprehend him, it must 
be in part through this glorious attribute. 

Jesus said to his disciples : 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Love one another, and if you love me ye will keep my commandments. 
If you love not one another you are not my disciples." 

So that love exercised a mighty influence in the life and work ol 
the Savior and in that of his disciples. , 

The greatest manifestation of the love of God, I take it, relates to 
the atonement, for we are told, in the gospel of St. John : 

"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 

"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the 
world through him might be saved." 

It seems to me this was a very wonderful expression of God's love 
for the children of men. 

THE FAMILY OF GOD 

We understand, from the scriptures, that Jesus Christ is our elder 
brother. If that be the case then we are his younger brothers and 
younger sisters ; we belonged to a great family before we came into the 
world. It was the family of God, for Jesus said : "When you pray, say 
our Father which art in heaven. Our Father is there, and we believe 
that we have a mother there. That thought was beautifully expressed 
in the hymn that the choir sang this morning. I think you will 
agree with me that it is a very wonderful thought indeed. At least it 
is interesting and worthy of profound consideration. 

"I had learned to call thee Father, 
Through thy spirit from on high, 
But until the key of knowledge 
Was restored, I knew not why. 

"In the heavens are parents single? 
No, the thought makes reason stare. 
Truth is reason. Truth eternal 
Tells me I've a mother there." 

To say the least, if we are led to believe that we have a Father 
in heaven, I think we are justified in believing that we have a Mother 
there. Who ever heard of a father where there was no mother? 

All this means that in heaven from whence we came we were the 
children of our Father, his children in spirit. This was prior to the 
time we came down to the earth and took upon ourselves these mortal 
bodies. Think of it, my brethren and sisters and friends ! 

TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES 

Surely it was a tremendous sacrifice the Lord in heaven made, 
when he gave his only begotten Son to die for the sins of the world, 
that you and I might be redeemed, that all the world who would receive 
the truth might be saved in the presence of God. 

Abraham was called upon to make a similar offering, in a lesser 
degree, when he was told to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice unto 



President rudger Claw son 



107 



God. It must have been a most terrific ordeal. How could he bear it ? 
Well, we don't know just how he could bear it, but we know that he 
did bear it, and we know that he was obedient and answered the 
commandment and undertook to carry it out because the Lord had 
.demanded it of him. The evident purpose of it was to test his faith, 
to try his very soul. 

A GOD OF MERCY 

God is a God of mercy. We are told in the Book of Exodus : 

"And the Lord passed by before Moses, and proclaimed, The Lord, the 
Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and 
truth." 

Then in a psalm: 

"The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy." 

Then again : ' 

"But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them 
that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; 

"To such as keep his covenants, and to those who remember his command- 
ments to do them." 

Have you remarked, as I read this scripture, that the principle 
of mercy that is in God, our Creator, is everlasting in its character? 
It is a great attribute of his character. It was so before the world 
was organized and projected into existence. It is a great and glorious 
virtue in every man and woman who exercises it, and it will ever 
continue to be so in worlds without end. I repeat God is merciful, slow 
to anger, plenteous in mercy. 

How is it with us, brethren and sisters? Are we merciful? Are we 
slow to anger, or do we give way sometimes to our feelings, and speak 
words of bitterness and words of anger, that we repent of later ? 

It seems to me if we are to become like our Heavenly Father — 
and that is most desirable — then we must exercise these glorious 
virtues, — the power of love, the power of mercy. 

A GOD OF POWER 

Now remember also that the God we worship is a God of power. 
There are many examples of this. We have seen it in our own lives. 
We have become cognizant of it in our own experiences. There are 
many examples in holy writ. Let me give you one briefly. 

The Holy Bible tells us that upon one occasion in ancient times 
Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, came up against Hezekiah, the king 
of Judah. He came up with his captains and a great army. His 
purpose was to take possession of the fenced cities of Judah, and to 
war against the children of Israel. Now, mark you, the difference 
between this heathen king and Hezekiah, the king of Judah, a servant 
of the Lord. 

Sennacherib came in the pride of his heart and in an arrogant 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



boastful manner. He notified Hezekiah that he was coming, and warned 
him to be ready to surrender. 

KING HEZEKIAH'S FAITH 

What was the attitude of Hezekiah, a man of God, a man of faith?. 
Did he sit down and cross his hands and wait for the Lord- to come 
and deliver him and his people? No, he didn't. He believed the Lord 
could do it. He believed the Lord would do it, but he at once instituted 
proceedings of defense. He gathered his people together. The record 
says he strengthened himself. He built up all the walls that were broken 
down and raised them up to the towers, and repaired Millo in the city 
of David, and made darts and shields in abundance ; and he set captains 
of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the 
street of the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying: 

"Be strong and courageous. Be not afraid nor dismayed for the king 
of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him : for* there be more with us 
than with him: 

"With him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, 
and to fight our battles." 

And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah, 
king of Judah. Mark it. The people were composed, and their 
feelings were calmed and they rested upon the words of Hezekiah, 
after preparing for defense. Hezekiah realized that faith without 
works is dead, being alone. 

Sennacherib's boastfulness 

Soon after came the great heathen king. He made light of the 
God of Hezekiah, held him up to ridicule, reviled him, and said, in 
substance, to Hezekiah: 

"Thinkest thou that thy God will deliver thee from my power? Why, all 
the gods of the heathens in the land with whom I have warred have submitted to 
my rule and to my authority, and think not that the God of Israel, or your God, 
will deliver you." 

And his servants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against 
his servant Hezekiah. He also wrote' letters to rail on the Lord God of 
Israel and to speak against him, saying: 

"As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people 
out of mine hand, so shall not the god of Hezekiah deliver his people out of 
mine hand." 

Then they cried with a loud voice to the people of Jerusalem that 
were on the walls, to affright them and to trouble them, that they might 
take the city. 

judah's deliverance 
Now, brethren and sisters, under those distressing circumstances 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 109 



what did Hezekiah do ? After he had prepared to defend his country 
and his liberty he prayed to the Lord, and "for this cause Hezekiah, 
the king, and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amos, prayed and cried 
to heaven." Don't you think, after he had taken every means to 
defend himself and his people, that that was the proper time and a good 
time to cry unto the Lord, and to cry unto him in faith? What was 
the answer ? Well, this is what it was : 

"Thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria. He shall not come 
into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast 
a bank against it. 

"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return^ and shall not come 
into this city, saith the Lord. 

"For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my 
servant David's sake. 

"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and 
smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand." 

Think of it — one hundred and eighty-five thousand — slain by the 
Angel of God in one night. 

"So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed, and went and returned, and 
dwelt at Nineveh." 

OUR PROTECTION 

Now, brethren and sisters, in conclusion let me say to you, with 
this wonderful example before us, and other things that we are familiar 
with, if we will keep the commandments of God and serve him, as 
Hezekiah served him, he will reach forth his powerful arm and lift 
us up and strengthen us and deliver us from our enemies, just as he 
has done up to this very moment. Never, in all the history of this 
people, covering a hundred years, were the Latter-day Saints more 
powerful, more influential and more numerous than they are today. 
I say to you great is their faith, and there is power in faith. 

God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALMA G. BURTON 

Former President of the Tahitian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I assure you that I feel weak in occupying 
this position ; and I, like the others who have gone before me, ask that 
I may have an interest in your faith and prayers while I stand here. 

While sitting in my seat, and looking into the faces of these men 
who are on the stand, looking over this vast audience of saints, listening 
to the very remarkable, inspiring, and interesting testimonies that have 
been borne, I experienced a most peculiar feeling of comparison, a 
feeling that was mingled with sympathy and with thanksgiving. 

My thoughts went back to the last annual conference of the 
Tahitian Mission, at which I presided. The saints were there gathered 
from many islands of the sea, some of them coming hundreds of miles, 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and some even a thousand miles to attend that conference. They were 
there for the same purpose that we are assembled here today, to receive 
instruction, admonition and inspiration in their work in the gospel. 
They do not have the opportunity of listening first-handed to our 
beloved President of today, and to the presiding authorities, but they 
are trying in their humble way to fulfil their duties, to magnify their 
callings and their priesthood. As I sat here with joy in my heart for the 
many good things that have been told to us, my sympathy went out 
to those people, to that portion of the house of Israel who are not so 
fortunate as we who can assemble in this great building and listen to 
the words of God. 

I bring to you today, my brethren and sisters, greetings from the 
people of the Tahitian Mission. I trust there is in your hearts a prayer 
for their success as well as the success of the saints who are scattered 
throughout the different missions of the world. It is with pleasure that 
I report to you that with the very humble and faithful efforts of our 
elders, we are making good headway in that mission. During the 
past three years we have had an increase in baptisms of over a hundred 
per cent each year. Our tithes have shown a great increase. We have 
also had an increase in attendance at sacrament meetings and in faith- 
fulness to other duties throughout the Church. 

Our principal efforts, however, have been with the young people. 
We have been successful in organizing Improvement Associations in 
many of the different branches of the Tahitian Mission. We have 
realized the importance of giving to these young people a knowledge 
of the gospel, that they, in turn, may fill the positions occupied once 
by their fathers and the older saints who have passed on before them. 

The condition of the people in general is good. We find that 
they are striving to pay an honest tithing. They are striving to live 
the gospel. They are striving to keep the commandments of God 
and to live the Word of Wisdom, that they may grow nearer and nearer 
to God. We have not had the privilege of preaching the gospel by 
radio, but we do have a publication of large circulation, and through 
that means have been able to reach many persons and homes we could 
not otherwise have reached. 

The most effective method of preaching the gospel throughout the 
islands is by personal contact. Perhaps many of you do not know that 
the Tahitian Mission includes the entire group of the Society Islands — 
a great number of islands scattered over a vast expanse of water, — 
and as our elders travel to and fro to the different branches they live 
with the native people, they come in personal contact with them, and 
they teach them how to live family life, hbw to pray, how to live near 
to God, how to magnify their offices and callings in the Church. 

My brethren and sisters, I have found in my experience that one 
of the most encouraging and inspiring things for an elder is to have 
a letter from home that encourages him in performing his duty, in 
living nearer to God. 

In the remarks in our priesthood meeting last evening the fathers 



ELDER ALMA G. BURTON 



111 



were asked to be more chummy with their sons. I want to take this 
opportunity 'to ask the fathers and mothers not to fail to put in their 
letters to the boys encouragement to live near to God, and to fulfil 
faithfully their duties. It will go a long ways in helping the boys in our 
mission, and I think it will in all the missions of the world. 

I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, that I have had the op- 
portunity of going into the world to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I am thankful for the opportunity I have had of serving with your 
sons and your daughters who are in the Tahitian Mission. I love them. 
I honor them for the courage and faithfulness they have shown in 
carrying the gospel message, the message of salvation, to that people. 
I have traveled with the boys on the sea. We have been in storms. 
We have been in hard circumstances, and I want to tell you, my brethren 
and sisters, that I am not a doubter regarding the youth of Zion. I think 
that the boys of today have just as much courage as those of other 
days have had. I have seen the boys when they had to meet situations, 
when it took men of courage to meet those situations, and our boys 
in the islands of the sea, and no doubt throughout all the other missions 
of the world, are successfully handling those situations every day. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I am thankful 
that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I know that God lives. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, 
and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth 
in the latter days. I know that the power of the priesthood has again 
been given to us, and is operative on the earth in this last dispensation ; 
and I know that the same power of the priesthood is operative out in 
the mission field as is operative here in Zion. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know that 
President Grant is a prophet of God, called to preside over the Church 
in this particular time. I am thankful for the association I have had 
with the President and with the presiding authorities, while laboring in 
the mission field, which has been mostly through letters. I have received 
some very fine encouragement, and I have learned to love them and 
honor them as men who are called of God. I trust that I may live 
true to the covenants which I have made in this great Church. 

In closing I wish to call attention to remarks that Paul, the great 
apostle of old, who knew Jesus Christ, made. He said : 

"Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel." 

Do we realize the importance of the message which is left for us to 
carry throughout the world in this dispensation? Paul realized it in his 
time, and he said : 

"I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the 
law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law ; 

"To them that are without law, as without law, * * * that I might 
gain them that are without law." 

That is the thing that we are trying to do in the mission field.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We are trying to win the people over, to give to them the message that 
the gospel has for them. The Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints teaches us to love the Lord with all our heart, and our neighbor 
as ourselves. How can we love our neighbors as ourselves, except 
to give unto them the happiness and the joy which comes to us through 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, which has been given to us in these latter 
days? I trust that the Lord will bless us all to that end, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir rendered the anthem "Inflammatus," solo part by Sister 
Laurinda P. Brewerton. 

Elder Ralph B. Keeler, President of the Juarez Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock p. m. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The hymn, "Praise to the Man who Communed with Jehovah" 
was sung by the choir and congregation. 

Elder James L. Nielsen, President of the Moroni Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A sextette, assisted by the choir, rendered the anthem, "The 
Heavens are Telling." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have a telegram from Brother James L. Dunford, announcing 
that he and others are enjoying the conference proceedings as they are 
received by radio at Paris, Idaho. 

I have a telegram from the Idaho Falls stake presidency an- 
nouncing the death of Patriarch Robert L. Bybee, who passed away 
yesterday at the age of ninety-one years. He was one of the early 
oioneers. The funeral will be held Monday. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Temple Block 

Mission. 

I have enjoyed this conference. It has given us the spirit of the 
Psalmist when he exclaimed: "Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my 
soul." 

Reference has been made to the work of the missionaries on this 
block. This is an important mission, and the twenty brethren and 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



113 



sisters, who come to help us meet the strangers within our gates, are 
doing a fine work — a work that is noble and true. They meet all 
people with a Christian-like attitude of mind. They love people, and 
that is why the tourists see that our message is one of love. If we 
can always keep here the spirit of Jesus Christ our Lord as expressed 
by the beloved John: "God so loved us, we ought also to love one 
another," then people will partake of the spirit of truth. 

We receive many letters expressive of the gatitude of the stran- 
gers who come to visit us. A famous Japanese educator recently spoke 
of our hospitality, and among the things he said was that on these 
grounds he felt the spirit of Christ. I am very thankful for this ; and 
very grateful that we have brethren and sisters working here who 
know the true service of the Master. 

We may surely say that it is to a large extent through such men 
and women that the Spirit of God kindles the fire of divine love and 
the longing for divine knowledge in the hearts of others. 

Mormonism recognizes that in this great age of new thought and 
progress, the power of the Divine is in the living present. The relig- 
ion of Jesus Christ our Lord gives us power to distinguish between 
the true and the false ; the eternal and the temporal ; spiritual substance 
and human opinion. Our great mission is to advocate an understand- 
ing between religion and the civilization of to-day ; and we must never 
fear to advocate the four great fundamentals of religion that we solemn- 
ly believe to be true. These are as follows : 

First, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God 
created he him." We are gods in embyro. The human mind is in- 
finite in its power to progress. In one of the finest passages of our 
great world-poet Shakespeare, he gives us his conception of the grand- 
eur of the human mind when he writes : 

"What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in 
faculty ! In form and moving, how express and admirable ! In action how like 
an angel ! In apprehension how like a god I" 

The second point that is fundamental to Mormonism is that Jesus 
Christ died for you and me. He atoned for the sins of the world and 
gave us eternal life. In the Book of Mormon we have these words of 
the prophet Helaman: 

"Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that 
it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written 
of them. 

"And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which 
desire is. that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do 
these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, 
and which fadeth not away ; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal 
life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers. 

"O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake 
unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby 
man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall 
come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world. 

"And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the 
city of Ammonihah ; for he eaid unto him that the Lord surely should come to 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, 
but to redeem them from their sins. 

"And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from 
their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare 
the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of 
the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls. 

"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our 
Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation." 

Through Joseph Smith, the priesthood has been restored in this 
day for man's salvation. This gives the Christian religion a new life 
force, and it becomes a demonstration in this modern day of divine life. 
It calls forth new activities in man, and is in keeping with the general 
development of humanity. We are expressing a divine — a very divine 
and vital truth — when we sav that the priesthood of God was restored 
in this age by John the Baptist and Peter, James and John. Therefore 
our task is a great one, for mankind must come to think of religion other- 
wise than they think of it today. We may feel then with the great writer 
Fichte : 'We should rejoice at the sight of that vast field which we are 
called to cultivate, and rejoice that we feel strength within us, and that 
our task is endless." 

Then there is the fourth great point of the Christian religion 
that "The Lord God hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his 
kingdom ruleth over all." We are working for the establishment 
of God's kingdom upon the earth. No nobler purpose could be in the 
hearts of men ; no greater motive could ever move them. With these 
principles, we shall be able to work out the highest principles of mo- 
rality, for faith in God and his work is the true basis of morality. 

I think we are held responsible for a rich creative work. One may 
call the principles I have cited old or new as one will. The question 
is whether they are true or not. I think that such ideas and ideals 
have always been common to man and have been expressed in different 
ways. There are today far more forces working — consciously and 
unconsciously— towards the goal of the Kingdom than we realize. 
These principles are not gained from books nor from experience, but 
from our contact with the Spirit of God which Jesus taught us could 
be done. So the simple truth of God's kingdom and man's divinity 
remain forever and ever. 

In closing, let me read to you the words of Adolf Harnak, one of 
the world's great scholars: 

"It is religion, the love of God and neighbor which gives life mean- 
ing ; knowledge cannot do it alone. Pure knowledge is a glorious thing, 
and woe to the man who holds it light or blunts his sense for it. But 
to the question, Whence 'whither, and to what purpose? It gives an 
answer today as little as it did two or three thousand years ago. It 
does indeed instruct us in facts ; it detects inconsistences ; it likens 
phenomena; it corrects the deceptions of sense and idea. But where 
and how the curve of the world and the curve of our own life begin, 
and whither this curve leads, knowledge does not tell us. But if with a 
steady will we affirrri the forces and the standards which on the sum- 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



115 



mits of our inner life shine out as our highest good, nay as our real 
self ; if we are earnest and courageous enough to accept them as the 
great reality and direct our lives by them ; and if we then look at the 
course of mankind's history, follow its upward development, and search 
in strenuous and patient service, for the communion of minds in it, we 
shall not faint in weariness and despair, but become certain of God, 
whom Jesus Christ called the Father and who is also our Father." 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

This has been a most glorious conference. I have been coming 
to this tabernacle for sixty years. In the year 1869 I sang with a 
choir from Brigham City, in this tabernacle. Never in all that sixty- 
years have I seen such a great multitude of people in this building and 
outside on this block as there is today. Zion is growing. 

We have every reason to rejoice in the work of the Lord. We have 
been blessed during this conference with splendid weather. As a matter 
of fact we have a great deal of good weather at conference time, even 
if it is the stormy period of the year. But how beautiful this day 
and the two days preceding it. Could you find anywhere else all 
the world, my brethren and sisters, such a delightful country to live 
in, with this rarefied atmosphere — three quarters of a mile above the sea 
level, and yet breathing salt sea air? No such atmospheric combination 
exists elsewhere on the known globe, because if you get salt air any- 
where else in the world you must go to sea level. So here we have a 
most marvelous combination which is best for vegetable life, for animal 
life, and for human life, making it the best country in all the world. 
That which was a desert and a wilderness eighty-three years ago, 
behold what the Lord has done! 

this is ZION 

The people have been blessed of the Lord in very deed. This 
city is a marvel of beauty all through the summer. As I ride around 
this city, I gaze at it with wonder, with admiration. I have said in 
my heart a hundred times, where in all the world is there a more beauti- 
ful place than this? Beautiful indeed, beautiful for situation, is Zion. 
This is Zion here in these mountains. Zion in the largest sense is 
perhaps North and South America. Zion is in Jackson County, as we 
heard this morning, but here also is the Zion of our God, the mountain of 
the Lord's house, as President Ivins read from the prophecy of Isaiah, 
which I will repeat, for it is good to hear : "And it shall come to 
pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house" — I take 
that to mean the headquarters, the chief part of it though not all 
of the Lord's house, for in the Book of Mormon, First Nephi, 14th 
cnapter, you can read that the saints of God should be scattered upon all 
the face of the earth ; but the biggest end of it, as we may phrase it, 
the "mountain" of the Lord's house "shall be established in the top 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the mountains." And here it is; here we are; and the works that 
we have produced, I think, are good, they are constructive. What 
Mormonism has done is a credit. 

This building, built here before there was any railroad within 
many hundred miles of here, was a marvel at the time, is a marvel 
now. That temple — is it not splendid? Whether you believe in the 
doctrines of our faith or not you must admit that as builders, as a 
constructive people, a people who do things and do them right, we 
are entitled to some credit. You can see that in a material way our 
works are good, are they not? No sane man, unless prejudice has 
blinded him — and then he isn't sane — could say otherwise. The works 
speak for themselves; and the doctrine of the Church, the faith of 
the people, has produced this kind of works. Therefore that which 
produces these good things must, of necessity, - be good itself, for an 
impure fountain will not send forth pure water. The tree is known by 
its fruit. Look at this block. Where will you find anything prettier 
in the world than this Temple block, kept up at the expense of the 
Church? We don't ask anybody to help us pay the expense. The 
Church pays it. Your tithes help to pay it, and it is a good work. 
Hundreds of thousands of people every year come here with a feeling 
in th%ir hearts, and say, "Won't you please tell us something about 
your religion?" They come and ask for it. Why, here is the chance 
for the greatest missionary service in all the world. I don't think 
we quite appreciate the opportunity that we have here. And the men 
and women who have served here, and are serving, we owe them our 
thanks for the good work that they are doing — men like Brother Joseph 
Peery, who has given so many years of service free — in fact, everything 
here is free. These organ recitals every day — free. There isn't some- 
body standing around at every corner with a hat or a tin cup to take 
your money, or to beg for money. I have traveled over the world. 
You missionaries, you who are here by the hundreds, you know what 
you find in the world. It is pay, pay, pay. Well, here it is free, free, 
free ; free organ recitals, free choir. I want to thank Brother Anthony 
Lund and the choir for their splendid work. They come here Monday 
afternoons at 4 o'clock, and if you will turn on your radio you will 
hear this wonderful choir. It is heard all over the United States. 
We have had letters from Long Island, from New York, from Wash- 
ington, from all around the surrounding country: "We heard the 
choir, we heard the organ, and oh, it was so good." That is all free. 
I want to thank those who employ the members of the choir, the 
merchants and others, who release them long enough to come here 
for a half hour on Mondays and sing, and do a good missionary work. 
It is all free,, and it is different from anything else 5 in the world. I 
am proud of it. I am proud of what has been accomplished. 

A POOR MAN'S CHURCH 

This Church is just what the Lord intended it to be — a poor 
man's church. Of course, it is also for the rich, if the rich choose 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. NIBLEY 117 



to come; but it has been built up by the poor. That was one of the 
signs that the Savior gave. When John was in prison and probably 
quite discouraged, he sent one or two of his disciples to Jesus, asking 
this question : "Art thou he that was to come, or look we for another ?" 
And Jesus said to those two : "You go back and tell John the sick are 
healed, the lame are made to walk, the dead even are raised" — because 
he had power to raise the dead — and as a further evidence, "the poor 
have the gospel preached unto them." 

So, in this day, two thousand of our missionaries are out in the 
world, preaching — to whom? Generally speaking, to the poor, because 
the rich haven't time to listen to them; they are too busy and secure 
with their money; and it is too much of a sacrifice yet to be called a 
"Mormon." It is not so much as it was fifty years ago, not by a long 
way, but it is still a sacrifice to give up family connections and wealth, 
to come and throw in their lot with the Latter-day Saints. The rich, as 
a rule, will not do it; but with the poor, it is different. Who were 
your fathers and mothers, all of you? Scarcely one that was not of the 
poor. I say that we get one thousand converts who are poor, where we 
get one who is rich. However, let us not overlook the fact that they are 
poor in worldly goods only. They are rich in spirit, rich in faith. They 
are the Lord's poor, and he loves them. They do not come from the dregs 
of society, but are of the highest type of manhood and womanhood. 

So the gospel in this day as was the case in the days of the Savior, is 
preached to the poor. The poor have the gospel preached to them, 
and it is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The poor, I want to tell you, have 
built up this Church. The poor are more faithful in devotion to the 
Church than are the rich, or those who are comparatively rich. That poor 
widow in your neighborhood, whom you know, probably washing for a 
living, has a son on a mission, helping to support him. She is the 
kind, and those like her, who are really sacrificing for this work. 
How much do you sacrifice? How much real sacrifice do we, who are 
better off, make for the work? Not so very much, because what 
we give we don't feel, and the reason that we don't feel it very much 
is because we don't give very much, in proportion to what we have. 
But the poor — that poor emigrant girl in your ward, who is there 
at fast meeting, bearing her testimony, probably in broken English, 
her tithing is in the hands of the bishop. Let me tell you she is helping 
to build up the Church, she is sacrificing. I take off my hat to such 
as those. I bow my head in their presence because they are better than 

FOR BUILDING UP THE KINGDOM 

We heard from the President of the Church that a very consider- 
able part of the work is halted because of the lack of missionaries. 
With the call for missionaries comes the call for meeting houses. 
It is different from what it was in the world a while ago. People want 
to hear about Mormonism now and they want a decent place to come 
to that they may hear about it. So that takes a great deal of money, 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and we need ten times more for that same work of the Lord ; hot 
for me, not for President Grant, not for the authorities of the Church, 
but for the building up of the kingdom of God. We need ten times 
more. And let me say, if you and I and all the rest who are well- 
to-do — if the entire membership of this Church, paid their tithes 
honestly, there would never need to be another call on the people for 
anything in building up the kingdom of God. The law of the Lord 
has provided all that would be needed. But we don't fully observe 
the law. We don't contribute the means that we promise, and that 
we are under obligation to do. Brother McKay, in the first day of 
conference, called attention to that very point, that you are under cove- 
nant, I am under covenant, to keep that commandment. I know some 
of the brethren will say: "I don't know that I have promised to pay 
tithing." Oh, yes you have; yes, you have. Every Sunday, if you 
go to fast meeting or sacrament meeting, you promise it, clearly, 
definitely, if not gladly. You should do it gladly, for before you eat 
that morsel of bread symbolizing the body, the death, burial and the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ, a prayer is offered, in which you make 
the pledge, "that we may witness unto Thee, O God the Eternal Father" 
— that is a pretty solemn pledge, brethren and sisters — "witness unto 
thee, O God the Eternal Father, that we do remember him, that we are 
willing to take upon us" — willing, mind you — "willing to take upon us 
his name," — and what else? "And keep his commandments which 
he has given us." Isn't that a pledge? Isn't that your promise? Well, 
we haven't kept it. We don't keep it. And so the Church hasn't means 
enough to help carry on and build up the work of the Lord. 

Here is what the Lord says about the poor. It is in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, Section thirty-five: 

"And the poor and the meek shall have the gospel preached unto them, and 
they shall be looking forth for the time of my coming, for it is nigh at hand." 

Then again, section fifty-six : 

"Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, 
for your riches will canker your souls ; and this shall be your lamentation in 
the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation — The harvest is past, 
the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved ! 

"Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are 
not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed 
from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of gfeediness, 
and who will not labor with your own hands ! 

"But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, 
and whose spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God coming 
in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the earth 
shall be theirs. 

"For behold, the Lord shall come, and his recompense shall be with him, 
ana he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice; 

"And their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to generation, 
for ever and ever." 

IN THIS GOODLY LAND 

Those are the promises made to the poor. We, descendants of the 
poor, are placed in this wonderful, goodly land, with riches, with 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NlBLEY 119 



abundance ; and yet we are so stingy, I was going to say. Our hearts 
are not what the Lord would like them to be, for the Lord loveth 
a cheerful giver, not a stingy giver. It will not bring so much blessing 
if it is given niggardly. 

I recall hearing Brother Golden Kimball tell of his father, who 
happened to come into possession of a very fine horse, a beautiful horse, 
and the boys thought they needed it; whereas he, Brother Kimball, 
thought he had better pay it in on tithing — for we used to pay in kind, 
in those days, when there wasn't any money in this country ; wheat 
was paid, and butter and eggs, cattle and sheep, and everything that 
was produced. Well, this was a beautiful horse, and the boys thought 
they ought to keep him. Finally Brother Kimball had to say: "You 
take that horse right down to the bishop there' in the tithing office, 
before my heart puckers up." 

Well, we figure out how little we can pay, ant! our hearts "pucker" 
up, and we don't keep the covenant, the pledge we make every Sabbath 
day at the sacrament table. And yet I don't want to scold. Rather 
I want to bless ; it is in my heart to bless, to bless the faithful workers, 
for after all, are we not the best people in all the world? I don't want 
to be associated, here or hereafter, with any other kind of people than 
my own. They are good people. 

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 

I see the signs of the times that have been pointed out to you and 
those who try to watch for them. Brother Young has mentioned 
Ramsay MacDonald, Premier of the British empire, coming over here 
to talk peace, to try to help to bring peace to the world, — blessed 
peace! Herbert Hoover, the farmer's son, grown up from a 
poor boy who had to work his way through school, standing at the 
head of the greatest nation on earth, and Ramsay MacDonald, one of 
the poor, the poor exalted, meeting there this day in those Virginia 
hills and talking things that are of most momentous concern to the 
whole world. I bless the Lord for them. As far as I have authority 
to bless — and I have, as an elder of the Church — I bless Herbert 
Hoover in the great effort that he is making now, and I bless Ramsay 
MacDonald, and ask God to bless them, that they may do that which 
makes for righteousness. 

BLESSINGS INVOKED 

In the president's office the other day, when Ramsay MacDonald 
was landing at the pier in New York, we turned on the radio — wonder- 
ful radio — and we could hear the whistle of the steamship blow; we 
could hear the tumult and the shouting and all the rest of it, the bands 
playing; and after they got up to the city hall we heard Ramsay Mac- 
Donald's rich, Scotch voice; he rolled out his r's when he said: "We 
want to bring peace to the wor-rld," and I enjoyed it. It was music 
to my soul, and I said in my heart and soul, "God bless you." I say 
it now before this congregation. By the power and authority of the 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



holy priesthood that I hold, I bless the President of the United 
States and the Premier of Great Britain, that God Almighty may give 
them success and blessing from the Lord. 

I bless you, my brethren and sisters, by that same power and that 
same authority, that our hearts may be opened to the work of the 
Lord, and that we may not fail in keeping the covenants we make. 

I bless my brethren here on this stand. I want to say here that 
with the General Authorities of the Church I don't believe there ever 
was a time in the history of this Church when there was more una- 
nimity, more of fellowship, more of real effort, so far as we are able 
to put effort forth. There may have been greater men; doubtless 
were ; but for real united effort, united strength, and the power of God, 
never has there been, in the history of this Church, a more United 
band of brethren than the General Authorities of the Church are this 
day. I glory in it. * quote with pleasure the prophecy made, I think 
by Isaiah, when the Lord should bring again Zion, and he is bringing 
it now. 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together 
they shall sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall 
bring again Zion." 

That is the condition today. I bear witness of it. I bless the 
President of this Church for his integrity, for his humility and meekness 
and power. I bless his counselors, that they may be helps to him; 
also the Twelve, and the Patriarch. I bless the Patriarch with all my 
heart, that he may be healed. I bless the Presidents of Seventies, the 
Presiding Bishopric, and" all you presidents of stakes, and bishops of 
wards, and every faithful worker, male and female. I bless you sisters, 
who so nobly and efficiently direct the splendid labors of your organ- 
izations. You are not stingy like your husbands are. I mean it. You 
are not that kind. You give more freely. God bless you. I bless you 
all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. — Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH L. PETERSON 

Former President of the Danish Mission 

This, my brethren and sisters, is the biggest thrill that I have 
ever experienced. To gaze over this vast audience is an inspiration and 
an opportunity of a lifetime. 

I bring you the love and greetings of the missionaries and saints 
in the Danish Mission. This mission is probably one of the smallest 
in the world, but I can assure you it is a live mission. It is the second 
oldest mission in Europe ; and in this small country of Denmark there 
have probably been more converts, according to the population, than in 
any other country in the world. Thousands have embraced the gospel, 
and there are still thousands that are waiting to accept it. 

I can assure you, my brethren and sisters, that the missionaries 
in that mission are performing an excellent work. They are not idling 



ELDER JOSEPH L. PETERSON 



121 



their time away, nor neglectirig their calling. I can assure you that 
they are enjoying the spirit of their work. Many of these elders have 
spent as high as two hundred and ninety hours in a single month 
tracting from door to door — more than ten hours per day. They are 
all enjoying the best of health. The saints are active. We have 
auxiliary organizations in practically all the branches of that mission. 
They are all functioning and doing a splendid work. 

Through the kindness of the First Presidency we have disposed 
of our old mission property, Korsgade No. 11. This place, which 
has been owned by the Church for a great many years has outlived 
its usefulness. Wte have now secured, through the aid of President 
James E. Talmage, one of the most beautiful sites in the wonderful 
city of Copenhagen. Strenuous protests were made by the clergy, 
not only to the Bank of Copenhagen who sold us the property, but 
also to the city council, to thwart or to hinder the granting of a building 
permit, but in all cases these protests were turned down. At the time 
the protest was made to the city council in Copenhagen by the clergy, 
headed by the Bishop of Seeland, they informed the council that we 
were not Christians, that we were heathens, and had no right to own 
property or erect a church in that city. One of the councilmen arose 
and stated that he thought it would be a splendid idea to have these 
heathens come within the shadow of their church, so that they could 
be converted. Our building site is directly in front of one of the 
large Lutheran churches in that city. 

I would like to make an appeal to you parents of Scandinavian 
ancestry, to urge your sons to take missions or accept missions to 
Denmark. I can assure you that they will be kept busy, that they will 
enjoy their work, that they will get just as much, and possibly more 
experience than in any of the missions to the south of that country. 

I trust that you parents will also be very considerate as to the 
sending of money to your boys. Rather send them an extra letter than 
too much money. The more money you send, the less efficiency will 
take place. 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that 
I am proud of that country, proud of the work that has been performed 
in that land. I have a testimony of the gospel. I know that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. I 
know that Joseph Smith was divinely commissioned to again establish 
this work upon the earth. I pray that we may all strive to do our 
duty as members of this Church, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER JOHN P. LILLYWHITE 

Former President of Netherlands Mission 

I stand here today in the midst of one of the greatest revelations 
that God could give of the divinity of Mormonism. As I gaze into the 
ten thousand or twelve thousand faces of those who are sitting in this 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



audience this afternoon, I see the manifestation of God's hand in gath- 
ering his people together in these latter days. You men and women 
have received the gospel of Jesus Christ. Its sweet influence has touched 
your souls, and has made you happy ; it has made you rejoice in the day 
in which you live; and it is in fulfilment of the words of the Savior 
to the prophet Joseph Smith in this last dispensation, when he said : 

"Blessed are they * * * who have obeyed my gospel ; for they shall 
receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth 
in its strength." 

Surely this word has been fulfilled in the presence of these ever- 
lasting hills. The men and the women gathered out from the various 
nations of the earth, poor men and poor women, as we have heard today 
from President Nibley, have been made rich; first, in their souls, by 
the mellowing, sweetening influences of the gospel of the Son of God ; 
and then, by reason of their faithfulness and the keeping of his com- 
mandments, they have been made rich in their store-houses. They have 
received from the earth in abundance, as the Lord promised to those who 
would keep his commandments : - 

"And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with 
commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time — they that arc 
faithful and diligent before me." 

This promise has also been fulfilled. There is no organization in 
the world today that has received more revelation, more blessings than 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are witnesses 
to the fulfillment of these promises. Glorious is this organization. 
Every man and woman, every boy and girl, has a place in this wonder - 
ful Church ; a place for development, for growth, aye, for the perfecting 
of their characters, if they will be obedient to God's laws. 

"Wherefore I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind and strength, 
and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him. 

"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal, neither 
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it. 

"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. 

"Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even 
that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit." 

This sacrifice is not too great for you nor for me. God does not 
ask of you that which you cannot give, but it is within the power of 
every man and woman to offer unto him a broken heart and a contrite 
spirit ; and in return for this sacrifice he promises to reward with bless- 
ings and with commandments not a few, and that the earth shall bring 
forth in its fulness. 

I love the gospel, I love to bear witness to the truth ; for God has 
let me know, through the inspiration of his Spirit, that Mormonism is 
the gospel of his Son, and will perfect every man and woman who is 
willing to keep and obey his commandments. 

I am thankful for the privilege I have had of laboring in the 



ELDER JOHN P. LILLY WHITE 



123 



mission field, thankful for the splendid men under whose direction I 
have labored : President Grant, President Nibley, and President Ivins, 
of the First Presidency; President George Albert Smith, President 
Orson F. Whitney, President David O. McKay and President James 
E. Talmage. I call them presidents because they were so and are so to 
me. I have enjoyed their acquaintance and the wonderful influence 
that has come from them into my life. I have been with them, and I 
have never heard them say one word nor have I seen them perform one 
act but what was elevating, but what would make me better, and other 
men better. And I can say the same thing of the other brethren who 
have been and who are laboring as the General Authorities in this 
Church. God bless them, and keep them happy in his service. 

I bring you greetings from President and Sister Widtsoe. The)' 
asked that we convey to the brethren and to the saints their good will 
and their love. They are wonderful people, and are wielding a tremen- 
dous influence throughout the European Mission. They are loved by 
all the saints and by the missionaries, and they are doing a great deal of 
good, as these other presidents have done. 

I bring you greetings from the saints and the missionaries in 
Holland. They are splendid people. There are no better upon the 
earth, — men and women who are willing to serve God and keep his 
commandments. The Dutch people are kind to the missionaries. They 
are kindly disposed towards the gospel. They open their homes and 
their hearts to its influence. Many of them are accepting the gospel. 
I congratulate the fathers and mothers who have sons in that mission. 
They are wonderful young men. We have labored with them. We have 
lived with them. We love them. Yes, we love them as our own children. 
Their success is our success; their joys are ours. God bless them for 
their faithfulness, for they are faithful. There is a wonderful spirit 
prevailing in the Netherlands Mission, a spirit of brotherly love, of 
kindness one toward another, of mutual helpfulness and benefit ; and the 
saints are being blessed in all they do, as well as the elders. 

May the Lord help us to be faithful, and keep his commandments. 
When we partake of the sacrament let our hearts and hands be clean 
and pure, and let our testimonies and our obedience be as firm and 
implicit as our declarations; for I hold that a man's testimony of the 
gospel is no stronger than his obedience unto its principles. 

God bless us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I dislike very much to limit the brethren, but we still have four 
speakers that we would like to hear from, we have the authorities to 
present, and I would not object to having two or three minutes left 
for myself. 

We had three most splendid testimonies from our sisters, all three 
of whom occupied a total of eight minutes between them. A very fine 
example.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

Former President of the North Central States Mission 

It is an honor to any man to be called to preside over a mission 
of the Church. From such a position there comes a joy and happiness 
that can be received from no other source. About four years ago I 
was called to preside over the North Central States Mission, as its 
first president, and I had the joy and happiness of my life in that labor. 

I have been thinking today that if Mormonism is true there must 
be an abundance of evidence of it; and I would like to give just 
briefly, if I may, an evidence to me of the divinity of this work. This 
Church has been organized now nearly a hundred years. During those 
hundred years we have been sending missionaries to every part of 
the civilized world, and these missionaries have been largely young men 
and women who were unsophisticated, untrained, and unlearned, per- 
taining to the religions of the world. It has been estimated that we 
have sent into the mission fields between sixty-five and eighty-five 
thousand men and women during that period of time, and so far as I 
know, there has never been a single case where a missionary, young 
or old, has written back or sent word, "I have found something in the 
world that is better than you sent me out to preach. I am leaving the 
service of this church and joining another institution." I think there 
never has been a single case of that kind. If there has been, I have 
never heard of it. How is it, if Mormonism is not the divine truth, 
that these young men and women go out and meet the learned preachers 
of the day, and are not won away from their religion? 

I want to testify today that I come back to Zion with my heart full 
of gratitude to my Heavenly Father for my standing among this 
people, for my faith in this great latter-day work, and that I have 
found nothing in the world that has been any inducement whatsoever 
to me to leave the faith of my people and identify myself with any 
other work. 

I want to leave the rest of my time, if there is any, to President 
Grant. God bless this work, with him at the head, and all who labor 
with him in this service, that this work may be consummated as God 
intended it should be, through the faithfulness of this people, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

This is a surprise but I suppose it should not be. 

I am happy in the performance of my duties as a missionary. As 
Brother Allred spoke I could not help but think that I was never 
busier or more intensively occupied in my life. But the joy that has come 
to me in that labor of love, is greater than that realized in any other 
undertaking. 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



125 



This is a glorious work ! It is my privilege to labor with a splendid 
band of young missionaries, who have been an inspiration to me, 
especially as I have heard them report their labors in the mission field. 
I have felt that their experiences are similar to those of the seventies 
in the days of the Savior. When they returned and reported to him 
their labors and what they had witnessed, he said : "I thank thee, O 
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from 
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." 

These young people are not wise in this world's learning, or ex- 
perienced; they are youthful, inexperienced, frequently uneducated, 
and crude, but enjoying an experience and receiving an education 
superior to that obtained anywhere else. We value the privilege of 
educating our children in the great universities of the world, preparing 
them for life's duties ; but is it not far more important that they should 
be prepared both for this life's duties and those of the life to come, the 
eternities ? 

It is the greatest university training, to be thus divinely inspired, 
guided and educated. It is more than what people call religious 
training. There is in it also a most practical training for life's secular 
duties as well. It develops more than any college work will, initiative, 
self reliance, leadership, moral character, virtue, love of f ellowmen, and 
above all the love of God, and a knowledge of him. 

I should be glad indeed to relate some of the really marvelous 
experiences of these young people. The Savior said, "This is life 
eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ 
whom thou hast sent." That is what these young people are learning 
and of which they are testifying. Many of them are able to say, with 
clear consciences and fervor, that they know that God lives, that he is 
their Father, and that Jesus Christ is their Savior. 

I read the Monday morning New York papers, giving an account of 
the Sunday discourses of the learned "Divines" of that great city. 
Rarely does some one of them fail to say something indicating a need 
of a new or different religion. Some openly advocate, even orthodox 
preachers, that there must be a broad rational religion in which all can 
unite. In other words, that the gate should be wide, easy to find, and 
the way broad and easy to walk in, to eternal life. 

These young people are testifying that there is "One Lord, one 
faith, one baptism;" that the way to eternal life is not to be so easily 
found, "because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which 
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." 

Not long since that very noted preacher Dr. Emerson Fosdick, of 
the Park Avenue Baptist Church, one of the most noted New York 
preachers, said, "Religion in this country, with its conflicting creeds, 
is a good deal of a mess. That many people are confused over it, 
looking at it as a kind of jungle without a road through it, everybody 
knows. And thus to be bewildered about religion is to many a source 
of mental and spiritual agony. The wish for certainty in religion is 
one of the most important desires of man. We can stand having all 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

sorts of things shifting on every side of us, but when the solid ground 
itself shakes it is intolerable. Though we can welcome change in many 
realms, scientific, cultural and economic, when our basic ideas of what 
life is all about begin to vacillate, that means spiritual vertigo" — or 
stomach ache. 

Only a week or two since Dr. Beck, in the Unitarian church, said 
that "Ghosts of the past are all that keep Christianity together today." 

Fifty years ago or more when I was a boy, and when spiritualism 
was being introduced, I heard the elders of the Church say that the 
time would come when all of the great truths of the gospel would in 
some way be more or less duplicated, as spiritualism was then attempt- 
ing to duplicate one of the features of the truth revealed in our time. 
Later came a science of healing by faith and a popular religion, its chief 
corner stone being healing by faith. 

Not long since, in Washington, a great conclave or general con- 
vention of the Protestant-Episcopal church was held, in which there 
was a somewhat remarkable report made by a very dignified commission 
which had been appointed by that church six years before to study the 
merits of faith or spiritual healing. That commission consisted of a 
number of noted bishops and deputies, among whom were three dis- 
tinguished physicians, one Charles H. Mayo of Mayo Brothers, than 
whom there are no more distinguished physicians. This commission, 
after studying the subject for six years, made report confirming what 
the Prophet Joseph Smith learned in a day, in which they said that, 
"Christian healing has passed beyond the stage of experiment and its 
value cannot be questioned." 

Three conclusions were drawn by the commission, and the report 
asked the general convention to "thankfully recognize the deepening 
of the spiritual life of the church which had come through the growing 
recognition of the healing power of God." 

The conclusions were, "that throughout the world spiritual healing 
is no longer the hope of a few, but the belief and practice of a large 
and rapidly increasing number of persons ;" that such healing is an 
experience of mankind that can no longer be questioned; that while 
faith in any supposed remedy produces some effect, faith in God, as 
revealed in Christ, is followed by results which are more sure, more 
lasting and of a more evidently spiritual character. 

What is called spiritual healing is rapidly becoming popular in 
many of the churches. 

Today, as we are commencing to rely more than formerly upon 
the power of the physician, should there not be a revival among us of 
that deep and profound faith which has so notably characterized Latter- 
day Saints, so much in advance of all the churches? 

I am trespassing on the time allotted me. May the Lord help us 
to enjoy the blessings of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ and its 
work in which we are engaged and which means so much to us, is 
my desire in the name of Jesus, Amen. 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 



127 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, in having the opportunity of 
reporting very briefly the activities of the East Central States Mission. 
I was resting quite easily for the reason that the time was passing so 
rapidly and there are so many to occupy it. 

I am very pleased to state that during the first eight months of this 
year we have performed two hundred and forty-three baptisms in the 
new mission. From the first of September until the time that I left, 
about a week ago, the average would run about seventy for this month. 
So that you can see that we are active in that mission. 

I have spent considerable time just recently in visiting the near-by 
settlements or branches, where I could reach them by auto, and in the 
latter part of the season we will make the longer journeys by rail. I 
have found, in visiting these branches, where mothers have traveled as 
far as five miles over the hills, carrying their babes, with two or three 
children by their side, making the journey with them. One of our 
beloved sisters, and her sister who was not a member of the Church, 
made an eighteen mile journey across the hills on horse-back to a sta- 
tion and took a train from there to the place we were holding our 
meeting. This shows to me that the faith is strong among those people, 
and they are living the gospel to the best of their ability. 

I am very sorry to say that we have had the misfortune just 
recently of losing one of our most efficient missionaries, although all 
of them are very efficient. We haven't one in the mission who is not 
energetic, early and late, going wherever called to go at any time. 
The one to whom I have reference is a humble elder from Arizona. 
He, with his companion, Elder Baird, was asked to visit Edmonton 
county, in Kentucky. They wanted to visit a certain family belonging 
to the Church and leave their blessing with them, and in order for 
them to do so it was necessary that they cross a river. When they 
reached the water's edge they waited for some time, thinking that 
someone would come along and bring the little boat, which was on the 
other side, across to where they were. After waiting for some time, 
Elder Fenn decided that he would swim the river and get the boat, 
come back and dress, and then he and his companion could cross to 
the other side. After preparing to swim across the river he turned to 
his companion, and said, "God bless you, Elder Baird, in your labors." 
Then he plunged into the water. He had proceeded a little more than 
half way across, when, for some cause he turned back, and almost 
immediately disappeared. The river at that point is three hundred feet 
in width and from eighteen to twenty-five feet in depth. 

Word was sent to us at headquarters. My secretary and I left 
m a very few minutes in an automobile, and arrived at the place where 
the accident occurred, at about 8:30 o'clock at night. We spent the 
greater part of the night there, and when we discovered that, we were 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



unable to recover the body immediately, we retired for the evening, 
leaving several men there to go on with the work as best they could. 
When I awoke in the morning there were three things that stood out 
distinctly in my mind. The first one was, Telephone for the ambulance 
to come at once ; the second was, We will soon recover the body ; and 
the third was, Tell Elder Baird to prepare himself to accompany the 
body to the home of Elder Fenn in Arizona. I immediately acted 
upon those impressions. 

We had already arranged for a man and his son to make prepara- 
tions for dragging the river. In the morning they stretched a line across 
the river some fifteen feet below where Elder Fenn disappeared, and 
then started dragging it. I walked along the bank a short distance, 
and as I gazed out over the water it was made plain to me that Elder 
Fenn's body lay about twenty feet below the line and about thirty feet 
nearer the bank than where they were making their attempt to find it. 
I acted upon that impression. I showed the man who was in charge 
the place where I knew the body was located, and after three or four 
casts they recovered it. From then until Elder Fenn's body was 
returned to his family in Arizona everything moved along satisfactorily. 

My brethren and sisters, there are some things that come into our 
lives that require our dependence upon the Lord Almighty for guidance 
and direction. I have found this to be true on several occasions in 
the mission which I have the honor of laboring in at this time. 

In conclusion I want to say to the friends of Elder James W. 
Price, that when he met with the accident of which some of you have 
heard, the doctors said that his usefulness was past. But through the faith 
of the ninety-seven elders and lady missionaries in that mission, who 
fasted and prayed for his recovery, and through the administration 
that he received, he was restored to his health and strength ; and he is 
in his field of labor today, an earnest defender of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

I leave with you my testimony that this is the work of God, and 
I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters: With all my heart I rejoice in this 
opportunity of expressing my pride and gratitude for the honor that 
has come to me of presiding over one of the missions of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, — of announcing myself in full 
accord with all of the instructions and with the testimonies that have 
been borne from this stand during this conference, — and of pledging 
to you, my brethren and sisters, and to the presiding brethren under 
whom we serve, that I will do my best not to be a disappointment to you, 
or to them, or to our Heavenly Father whom we serve. 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 



129 



Will you please think of the North Central States Mission as a 
great block U, with one corner resting on the Yellowstone Park, where 
Montana and Wyoming meet; and the other on the Iowa line at the 
Mississippi, below St. Paul and Minneapolis ; and extending north from 
these beginnings indefinitely; including Montana east of Great Falls, 
North and South Dakota, and Minnesota in the United States ; and 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and parts of Alberta and Ontario in Canada. 

I do not know how many million people we have to work with. 
We have about seventy elders and lady missionaries. Since it has 
been said (in 'the Priesthood meeting Saturday evening) that we need 
not ask for more missionaries, except to Scandinavian countries, it 
may be remarked, in passing, that we are very strongly Scandinavian, 
President Grant. In the city of Minneapolis, our headquarters, we have 
a population equal to that of the state of Utah, mostly Scandinavian. 

I have been all through the mission twice, since June ; once with 
my predecessor, President John G. Allred, whom you have heard today, 
and Brother Ballard, of whom and for whom I may say to you, that 
no man ever received a more favorable introduction to a field of labor 
than I did to mine; and nobody appreciates that privilege and honor 
more. I nave been through the mission again since, have met all the 
elders twice and have twice heard them bear their testimonies, in 
public and in missionary meetings. I can testify to you that they are 
a loyal band of workers, and that they 'are performing a service similar 
to that spoken of by all the other mission presidents. 

The work in which we are engaged is the truth. This is the Church 
and kingdom of God. The authorities who preside over us I sustain 
with all my heart ; and ask the blessings of our Father in heaven upon 
them and upon our missionary labors. It is a glorious work. I am 
grateful for it ; and 'leave you my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GRATITUDE FOR SUCCESS OF CONFERENCE 

I rejoice in the very splendid conference that we have had. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



echo and endorse the words of blessing for the President of the United 
States, for Ramsay Macdonald, for our good sisters, and for the people 
generally, as uttered, I believe, under the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord, by my counselor, Brother Nibley. 

I thank each and all who have taken part in this conference. It 
is an astonishing fact that there have been forty-three speeches made 
here during the conference, including the one that I am now making. 

I can truthfully say that I rejoice beyond all the ability with 
which God has endowed me to express my thoughts, and my heart 
is full of gratitude for the rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord 
and his blessings that have attended us during this conference. Ever 
since I was a boy I have heard the statement made at the close of each 
conference that it was one of the very best we had ever had. To me 
this is one of the great testimonies of the divinity of the work in 
which we are engaged. We hear, year after year — I have heard from 
childhood unto the present time — the same testimonies, the same words 
almost, in explaining the gospel and testifying of it, but we never 
weary if our spirits are only right; and the spirit of this conference has 
been one of joy and peace and happiness. 

BLESSINGS INVOKED 

I leave my blessing upon you, my brethren and sisters — not only 
upon all within the sound of my voice in this great 1 auditorium, but 
upon all those who are listening in. I pray God to bless every soul 
who is striving to do good upon the earth, every soul who is honest and 
upright, loyal and true to his God and to his country. May the peace 
of heaven abide with all the honest the world over; and particularly 
do I pray for the blessings of the Lord upon the Latter-day Saints. 1 
do it all in humility and by the authority of the priesthood of the living 
God that I know I hold, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our 
Redeemer and Savior. Amen. 

Solo and chorus, "The Earth is the Lord's," was rendered by 
Sister Jessie Evans and the choir. 

The Hallelujah Chorus from "The Messiah" was rendered by the 
choir. 

Elder Andrew Jenson, Assistant Church Historian, pronounced the 
benediction, and the Conference was adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing. Accompani- 
ments and interludes were played on the great organ by Tracy Y. 
Cannon and Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

JOSEPH ANDERSON, 
Clerk of the Conference.

delight." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is certainly an inspiring sight to see this building so well filled 
at the first session of our semi-annual conference. I feel truly grateful 
to the Lord for his blessings to us as a people during the past year. 
Our harvests have been very abundant. There is a feeling of con- 
tentment today throughout this intermountain country, where the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are located, that is very different, financially speaking, 
from what it was two years ago today. 

We are grateful indeed for the blessings that have come to the 
people during the past two years, and we humbly pray that they may 
be continued upon the Saints, that the land may yield abundantly, 
and that peace and prosperity may continue with all of the people gf 
the Lord. Above all it is the desire of the Presidency of the Church 
and the General Authorities that the Latter-day Saints may grow in 
the light, the knowledge, and the testimony of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, which has been restored to the earth again, through the 
instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. While we rejoice in the 
material prosperity of the people, we rejoice more in the growth of faith 
and knowledge and the love of God and a desire to serve him on their 
part. 

president's visit 

During the past six months we have had the privilege of receiv- 
ing a visit from the President of the United States, who spoke from 
this stand, and who later visited the Southern part of our State. We all 
know that he has since been called from this life. As I stated here 
upon one occasion, I am very grateful that President Harding had the 
opportunity of meeting and mingling with the people of our State and 
of the adjoining States, where so many of the Latter-day Saints are 
located. I rejoiced when he said to me as I was dining with him in 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

the Yellowstone Park, that his good opinion of our people had been 
enhanced by his visit among them. I am grateful that the high office 
lie held until his death is now occupied by a man who I believe with all 
my iieart is worthy of that exalted position. I desire, and I am sure 
that al! Latter-day Saints desire, that the inspiration that comes f rom 
God may be given to President Coolidge in the great office which 
he holds, and that wisdom may come to him and his cabinet in directing 
the affairs of our beloved country. 

We as Latter-day Saints have much to be thankful for. We are 
just completing in Idaho Falls a magnificent hospital, which when 
completed and furnished, will cost about four hundred thousand dol- 
lars, and will be a lasting monument to the integrity of our people and 
their devotion to God. Otherwise we would not have had the means to 
have created such a magnificent structure in our adjoining state. 

TEMPLE DEDICATED 

There has been dedicated a temple to the Most High God in a 
foreign land, the first that has ever been erected outside the confines or 
dependencies of the United States. The cost of the Alberta Temple, 
including furniture, equipment, lawns, grounds, and in fact the build- 
ing complete, is seven hundred and eighty-one thousand, four hun- 
dred and seventy-nine dollars and ninety cents — over three quarters of a 
million dollars expended there in completing a house to God, dedicated 
for sacred purposes. Many of us had the opportunity of attending the 
sessions, eleven in all, at each of which the dedicatory prayer was read, 
and remarks were made upon more than one occasion by all of the 
General Authorities who were in attendance, by many of the officers 
of the Church, and by many of the people who were there as visitors. 

I rejoice in being able to say that that same sweet, peaceful, God- 
like and inspiring spirit that I have had the opportunity of enjoying 
at the dedication of the Logan Temple, of the Manti Temple, of the 
Salt Lake Temple, and the one in the Hawaiian Islands, was present 
with us upon all of the occasions when we met in the Alberta Temple. 
I rejoice that there was a rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord 
during all of the eleven sessions that were held in that Temple, and 
that those who were present partook of that spirit, and that the visitors 
and the local people were satisfied in their hearts and able to bear 
witness that the Lord, by the rich outpourings of his Spirit was with 
us throughout the sacred services. 

There stands out in my mind in the various dedications of temples 
that I have had the privilege of attending, a feeling of gratitude and 
thanksgiving to God that I was permitted to be present at these dedi- 
cations, and to partake of the spirit that was always present. It is 
the spirit that giveth life, while the letter killeth ; and I can testify that 
the spirit of the living God has been present at the time of the dedication 
of each and all of the temples that I have had the great privilege and 
honor of attending.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SPIRITS ATTUNED 

If we, as Latter-day Saints, live the gosped of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, our spirits are perfectly attuned, so that we really partake of 
the inspiration of the living God that is present in the conference gather- 
ings of the Latter-day Saints and I know that no faithful Latter-day 
Saint could have been present at Logan, at Manti, at Salt Lake City, 
in the Hawaiian Islands, or in Cardston at the dedication of the several 
temples but what he or she was thrilled by the spirit of God that was 
present upon all of those occasions. No Latter-day Saint has attended 
any of those sessions who has not gone away with an increased love 
of God, with an increased desire to serve God, with a renewed deter- 
mination to live more faithful the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
that we have espoused. 

It call to mind two occasions while in the missionary field that 
were remarkable to me, for they compared in my affections and in 
my feelings with the blessed experiences incident to the dedication of 
these temples. One of them was when we had all of the Elders of the 
British mission and representatives from Europe present at Bradford 
— several hundred missionaries, and we had a spiritual feast. We had 
what would be called "a red letter day," spiritually. The Lord God 
Almighty blessed us abundantly upon that occasion. I call to mind 
another instance in Rotterdam, where many of the missionaries of the 
Netherlands mission, including Belgium and Holland, and many from 
the Swiss and German mission were present. Our meeting lasted until 
midnight, and I am sure that no one of the many elders who were 
assembled there was the least bit weary because of the length of 
the meeting. There were tears of gratitude and thanksgiving to the 
living God for an abiding knowledge and testimony of the divinity 
of the work in which we are engaged, shed in great profusion upon that 
occasion. The fear of God was with us, and we rejoiced exceedingly. 

CUMORAH CONFERENCE 

On the 22nd day of last month we had the privilege — four of the 
General Authorities from this city and one who was located at Brooklyn 
as the president of the Eastern States mission, Brother Brigham H. 
Roberts — of being present at the wonderful conference held at the 
Joseph Smith farm, in the Sacred Grove, and at the Hill Cumorah, 
celebrating the one-hundredth anniversary of Joseph Smith's first 
view of the plates from which the Book of Mormon was later translated. 
A very remarkable conference for three days was held there. A rich 
outpouring of the Spirit of the living God was experienced. I am grate- 
ful, indeed, to President Brigham H. Roberts for arranging that con- 
ference, for I am free to confess, that in the multitude of duties and 
responsibilities resting upon me, I might have neglected that one- 
hundredth anniversary. I feel grateful to Brother Roberts that he did 
not allow it to pass without a very splendid conference. It was one 
that each and every person who attended will look back to with that 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



5 



same pleasure and joy and satisfaction with which we look back upon 
the dedication of our temples, and the passing of other mile-stones, so to 
speak, in the history of this Church. 

IN THE SACRED GROVE 

I remarked in the first meeting that we were sorry beyond expres- 
sion that President Roberts' health was such that he could not be 
present, that it seemed to me very much like the great play of Hamlet 
with Hamlet left out. Brother Roberts had prepared a very remarkable 
program, covering many episodes and historical matters in connection 
with the rise of the Church through the one hundred years, nearly, of 
its history; and there were no words with which we could convey 
adequately our regret that the man to whom we were indebted for all 
of these labors could not take a more active part than he did because of 
his poor health upon that occasion; and yet we rejoiced that he was 
able to lift up his voice on several occasions during that conference, and 
also to be present during some of the meetings, although his health 
was such that he had to withdraw from a few of them before their close. 
I have expressed, and heard others who were present express sincere and 
heartfelt regret that the prayer delivered by Brother Roberts in the 
Sacred Grove on Sunday morning, Sept. 23, was not taken down in 
writing. I cannot remember when my heart has been more stirred, and 
when I have had my affection called out to the Lord more perfectly 
than upon the occasion when Brother Roberts uttered that prayer in the 
Sacred Grove, where the Lord God Almighty, and where Jesus Christ 
our Redeemer, had appeared and conversed with the prophet, or more 
properly speaking, with the boy Joseph Smith, afterward the prophet 
of the living God. 

FAITH INCREASED 

We know, of course, that the world doubts that God and Jesus 
Christ spoke in that grove to Joseph Smith ; but there is no Latter- 
day Saint living who has kept the commandments of God, and has 
received the witness of the Holy Spirit, that we are engaged in his 
work, who has any doubt in his or her mind that the Lord God Al- 
mighty, that Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, the Savior 
of mankind, did talk to that boy. And those of us who had the privilege 
of assembling in that Grove Sunday morning, Sept. 23, and partaking 
of the sacrament of the Lord's supper, in witness to God of our remem- 
brance of the death and suffering, and of the atoning blood of our 
Redeemer, and who listened to the inspiring words of the prayer of sup- 
plication by Brother Roberts, had our fa'th increased and strengthened, 
and had our hearts mellowed in gratitude to the living God for the rich 
outpourings of his Spirit at that sacred spot. I believe that if I had more 
thoroughly partaken of the spirit of that conference prior to going there, 
that arrangements would have been made to have had hundreds of the 
Latter-day Saints present. It was only a very short time prior to this

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



one-hundredth anniversary that I felt impressed that I ought to go there. 
Last May I thought, perhaps 1 would go, but scarcely felt the full inspi- 
ration of it. However, just before the conference was to be held, the 
impression came to me that it would be a very serious mistake if the 
man whom the Lord had seen fit to honor in placing him to preside over 
the Church of Christ, established through the instrumentality of that 
boy who, one hundred and three years ago, conversed with God, the 
Lather, and the Savior, and one hundred years ago saw for the first time 
the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, did not 
attend that celebration. I was very grateful that two of the Council 
of the Twelve happened to be in the East at the time, so that they could 
also be there; and in thinking the matter over I felt that it would be 
very fitting indeed for one of the blood relatives of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith to be there at that remarkable celebration of the one-hundredth 
anniversary of the first view of the plates from which the Book of Mor- 
mon was transcribed. 

NEW INSPIRATION 

I have read within the past few weeks what a lot of rot the Book 
of Mormon is, what an absurd, ridiculous book it is. I want to say 
that it was my pleasure to be very intimately acquainted with the late 
William W. Riter, than whom there are few men in all the Church 
who were greater readers and greater students and who had more 
analytical and thoughtful minds. The last time that I heard Brother 
Riter speak was in a meeting in the ward where I reside. He was a man 
who read and studied a great deal. Among other things he made the 
statement, which was greatly to my surprise, that for many many years 
he had read the Book of Mormon through regularly every year. I 
never dreamed that he would take the time to do so. And he said that 
he found new inspiration, new uplifting thoughts, that he enjoyed the 
book, he believed, more each time that he read it than he had previously 
done. He said that nobody could find anything in that book that was 
not calculated to uplift mankind, and to improve them ; that there was 
no book that more perfectly inspired a love of the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
Redeemer of the world, by its contents, than did the Book of Mormon ; 
that there was not one single incident, not one paragraph in that whole 
book, that could offend the most sensitive soul. I have regretted beyond 
expression that the very remarkable and splendid sermon that he gave 
that night was not taken down in shorthand. 

THE ARIZONA TEMPLE 

I am pleased to be able to inform the people that the work on the 
Arizona temple is progressing satisfactorily, that next month we hope 
to lay the corner-stone and deposit some records in that stone, and 
that we hope in the near future to have that building completed for 
sacred ordinance work. 

We are making very extensive improvements, almost completed 
now, giving greater facilities for taking care of larger numbers of 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



/ 



people in the Salt Lake temple. Many of those improvements, however, 
have had to be made underground because of the conditions that face us. 
We have made some improvements, also, in the Logan temple for 
increased capacity in doing temple work there. 

There have been changes in the following missions : 

Hugo D. E. Peterson has been made the president of the Swedish 
mission, succeeding Gideon E. Hulterstrom. 

John S. Hansen has been made president of the Danish mission, 
succeeding Carl E. Peterson. 

Angus T. Wright has been made president of the New Zealand 
mission, succeeding George F. Taylor. 

Ernest LeRoy Butler has been made president of the Samoa Mis- 
sion succeeding John Quincy Adams. 

MISSIONARIES SAFE 

Martin A. Robertson has been appointed to succeed Lloyd Ivie 
as president of the Japan mission. Brother Ivie has not yet returned. 
We received a cablegram, however, from him, stating that our mission- 
aries in Japan were safe. We have not yet had a letter from him since 
the terrible catastrophe of earthquake and fire in that land, but we are 
grateful indeed to the Lord that all of our missionaries in Japan were 
preserved during the awful calamity that came to that country. 

Albert R. Peterson has been made president of the Norwegian mis- 
sion, succeeding August S. Schow. 

Fred J. Tadje has been made president of the Swiss and German 
mission, succeeding Serge F. Ballif. 

Charles S. Hyde has been made president of the Netherlands mis- 
sion, succeeding John T. Lillywhite. 

The work in all of our missions is progressing very favorably 
indeed. We are thankful for the splendid labors being performed in 
all of the missions throughout the world. The one cry that comes 
to us from every mission is: Send us more elders. The people are 
becoming interested in the work of the Lord. "We could use twice 
as many elders," is the word that comes from many of the missions. 

IMPRESSIVE SLOGAN 

The Mutual Improvement Associations of the Church have aji 
impressive slogan this year. They stand for spiritual growth among the 
Latter-day Saints through family and secret prayers. I wish to com- 
mend the young people for adopting this slogan. I am convinced that 
one of the greatest and one of the best things in all the world to keep 
a man true and faithful in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, is to 
supplicate God secretly in the name of Jesus Christ, for the guidance 
of His Holy Spirit. I am convinced that one of the greatest things 
that can come into any home to cause the boys and girls in that home to 
grow up in a love of God, and in a love of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
is to have family prayer, not for the father of the family alone to pray, 
but for the mother and for the children to do so also, that they may 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



partake of the spirit of prayer, and be in harmony, be in tune, to have 
the radio, so to speak, in communication with the Spirit of the Lord. 
I believe that there are very few that go astray, that very few lose their 
faith, who have once had a knowledge of the gospel, and who never 
negiect their prayers in their families, and their secret supplications to 
God. I am grateful for this slogan. I am also grateful that in addition 
to this slogan die fifty thousand or more of our young ladies are being 
requested that thev shall, during the next six mo llhs, observe rigidly 
and strictly the \Vo r d of Wisdom. 

If you or I possessed a letter from the late President Warren G. 
Harding, I am sure that we weald prize it, that we would hold ii as a 
keepsake all the days of our lives, and that we would leave it as a legacy 
for our posterity — a communication from a man that had been honored 
by being the President of our great country. Do we ever stop to think 
that the Creator of heaven and earth, the Maker of all that we see in this 
great universe, the Father of our spirits, the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ in the spirit and in the flesh, has communicated with us, 
that he has given us counsel and advice such as will lead us back into 
his presence, that will give us vigor of body and of mind? 

A MATTER OF REGRET 

And yet there are hundreds, there are thousands among the Latter- 
day Saints to whom the Lord God Almighty has given a testimony and 
a knowledge that he lives, a knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, a knowl- 
edge that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living God, and 
who are able to bear that witness and to testify of it at home and 
abroad, who, when the Lord God Almighty, the Creator of heaven and 
earth, tells them what is good for them, physically and spiritually, and 
writes them a letter, neglect to pay any attention to it. I am sorry to 
say that today there are many of the sons and daughters of the Latter- 
day Saints — some of the sons and daughters of leading men and women 
in this Church, who are having social gatherings and who think that it 
shows a spirit of liberality and of broadness to drink wine and to have 
their tea and coffee and to play their cards, and to do those things that 
we have been taught are not good for us. I am going to read to you 
a letter from the Lord to the Latter-day Saints : 

"Revelation given through Joseph Smith, the prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, February 27, 1833." Ninety long years ago since the Lord wrote 
this letter to you and to me, and to every man and woman and child in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known as the Word of 
Wisdom. What is there in all the world so valuable as wisdom ? Noth- 
ing. The one thing of all others that King Solomon sought after was 
wisdom. "Abstinence from wine, strong drink, tobacco and hot drinks 
enjoined — moderation in the eating of meat — wholesome foods — prom- 
ises to those who live according to these precepts. 

"A Word of Wisdom for the benefit of the council of high priests, as- 
sembled in Kirtland, and the Church, and also in Zion. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

GIVEN WITH PROMISE 

"To be sent greeting: not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation 
and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God," in a letter 
telling you telling me, the will of God "in the temporal salvation of all Saints 
in the last days — 

"Given for a principle with promise," don't forget that promise, "adapted 
to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all Saints, wh'o are or can be 
called Saints. 

"Behold verily thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of 
wisdom by revelation — 

"That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, 
behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling 
yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 

"And behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, 
of your own make. 

"And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of 
your bodies." 

I remember hearing the most eloquent address that I heard dur- 
ing all of the campaign for prohibition of liquor delivered by Dr. 
Geisel, a lady who was connected with the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 
Michigan, and she stated that there were scores and hundreds of doc- 
tors that had become absolutely convinced from their scientific investi- 
gation, from their personal experience, that alcohol or strong liquors 
were absolutely worthless as medicine when taken internally, but that 
they were good for the washing of the body, that there was a stimulat- 
ing and invigorating effect that those who were sick enjoyed by washing 
their bodies with alcohol. 

FAVORABLY IMPRESSED 

I remember after hearing her remarks in the Twenty-fifth ward 
Sunday school that morning, that I asked permission to ride to the 
depot with her in the automobile. She had a watch lying in front of her 
and agreed to talk within ten minues of train time. In going to the 
train I said : "Dr. Geisel, I am delighted to hear that your investigations 
in America, France and Russia regarding alcohol confirm what we 
knew seventy-five years ago through a revelation of the Lord to Joseph 
Smith the Prophet." And I told her of the Word of Wisdom, and 
she said she was coming back here some time to spend an entire sum- 
mer vacation, that she had found so many remarkable things in our 
faith and our doctrines, that she wanted to investigate them. 

"And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judg- 
ment and skill. 

"And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

"And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for 
the constitution, nature, and use of man — 

"Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; 
all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

"Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used 
sparingly ; 

"And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of 
winter, or of cold, or famine." 

TEACHINGS CONFIRMED 

I remember recently reading' that many of the doctors had come 
to the conclusion that excessive use of meat was one of the great causes 
of cancer, and of many other of the diseases that are destroying the 
human race. Year by year the inspiration comes to men through study 
and research to confirm, one by one, the teachings that came by the 
inspiration of the living God to Joseph Smith, the prophet of this last 
dispensation. 

All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of 
life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, 
and all wild animals than run or creep on the earth. 

"And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and 
excess of hunger. 

"All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that 
which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground — 

"Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, 
and rye for the fowls and for swine, and barley for all useful animals, and for 
mild drinks, as also other grain." 

Now, O ye Saints, listen to the promise of the Lord God Almighty 
in this letter written to you as to what shall he your heritage if you 
obey these simple words of wisdom : 

"And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow 
to their bones ; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

'And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. .Amen." 

Let me read the last verse once more : 

"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

BENEFIT OF OBEDIENCE 

In the same book you will find it recorded that there is a law irre- 
vocably decreed in heaven, before the foundations of the world, upon 
which every blessing is predicated, and when we receive a blessing we 
receive it because we fulfil the law upon which the blessing is predi- 
cated. I wish to bear my witness here that I believe with all my heart 
and soul that if I had not obeyed the Word of Wisdom, if 1 had not 
kept these commandments, that I would not be standing before you 
this day as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I believe that I would not be alive but for having obeyed this 
commandment, but for having fulfilled the law which was irrevocably 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



decreed before the foundation of the world, whereby I was entitled to 
live. 

We have the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have the plan of 
life and salvation revealed to us — temporal salvation, spiritual salvation. 
We have the gospel that will bring to us life eternal in the presence of 
God our Father, Jesus Christ our Redeemer, and of our loved ones 
who have gone before, who have been faithful. 

REJOICE IN TESTIMONIES 

I thank the Lord God Almighty for the faith, for the integrity, for 
the devotion to him and the gospel of his Son Jesus Christ 
in the lives of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. I thank the Lord 
that they were true, even to the clay of their martyrdom. 
I rejoice in the testimonies at the Hill Cumorah, at the Joseph Smith 
farm, and at the Sacred Grove, regard' ng these men. I rejoice 
in the marvelous integrity and devotion to God of Brigham Young 
in the days of apostasy, in the days when murder was in the hearts of 
many who had once been Latter-day Saints. I rejoice that when men 
said that Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet, Brigham Young was as 
true as steel, and would have given his life at any time for the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I rejoice in the wonderful accomplishments of Brigham 
Young. 

I rejoice in the integrity and devotion to God of John Taylor, of 
Wilford Wodruff, of Lorenzo Snow, and of Joseph F. Smith with 
whom I was intimately associated "for forty-one years this identical 
month. I know the hearts of these men. I knew the inmost desires of 
their lives, that which they desired most to accomplish, and I know 
that every one of these men loved God with all his heart, and with all 
his being, that they all loved the people of God, and that the one and only 
thing in their heart's desire above everything else in the world, was the 
advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the spread of it, that men 
who knew not the truth might learn and accept the plan of life and 
salvation. 

LOYAL TO COUNTRY 

I know that their thoughts, their prayers, their ambitions, were all 
for the good of this people and their advancement spiritually and mor- 
ally, intellectually and patriotically. I know as I know that I live that 
no men ever graced the footstool of God who were more loyal to their 
country, who believed more firmly that the Lord God Almighty inspired 
the men who brought freedom to this country under George Washing-, 
ton and inspired the men who wrote the Constitution of our beloved 
country. I thank God for these men, and with all the power of my 
being I pray God that I, having been honored in my weakness and my 
lack of strength in comparison to them, may lead this people as they did, 
in that straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal. I desire to 
read just two paragraphs from the prayer given at the dedication of the 
Alberta temple:

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"We thank thee, O Father, for the knowledge which we possess, that thou 
dost live, and that thy Son Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and our Savior, and 
that thy servant Joseph Smith, Jr., was and is a prophet of the true and living 
God. And, O Father, may we ever be true and faithful to the, gospel of thy 
Son Jesus Christ, revealed through thy servant Joseph. 

"We especially pray thee, O Father in heaven, to bless the youth of thy 
people in Zion and in all the world. Shield them from the adversary and from 
wicked and designing men. Keep the youth of thy people, O Father, in the 
straight and narrow path that leads to thee, preserve them from the pitfalls and 
snares that are laid for their feet. O Father, may our children grow up in the 
nurture and admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ. Give unto them a testimony 
of the divinity of this work as thou hast given it unto us, and preserve them in 
purity, and in the truth." 

And I say unto you, O fathers in Israel ; if you will set an example 
by being honest before God in the payment of your tithes, if you will 
observe the Word of Wisdom, if you will observe your family and your 
secret prayers, God will give you strength to preserve the youth of 
Zion as mentioned in this supplication. 

May the Lord bless us and pour out upon us richly his Holy Spirit 
during this conference, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I was just thinking of that part of the hymn that we have been 
singing which ,says : "What more can he say than to you he has said ? 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled." I feel filled to overflow- 
ing with joy and satisfaction and testimony concerning the great work 
in which we are engaged, and rejoice in the strength and power, phy- 
sically and spiritually, which is possessed by our beloved President, 
Heber J. Grant. I can bear my humble testimony to the truth and in- 
spiration of the wonderful discourse to which we have listened, and in 
saying that, I but feebly express the sentiments of this great, congre- 
gation. 

THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF GOD WITH THE CHURCH. 

I rejoice in the Lord my God. I am filled with gratitude in my 
soul today for all his mercies to me, and I can see many of those things 
which will be in the day when "the veil o'er the earth" will be not only 
"beginning to burst," but when it shall burst over all the earth, clothed 
with the light of God, blessed with the presence of its Redeemer and 
King, and all things be subdued unto him who is our living head. 
God be praised this morning for the things that we have heard from 
the leader of this people. It is evident that the Lord is with him, as 
he has been for many, many years, and that the same spirit and power 
brought to earth from on high by the presence of the Father and the 
Son, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, are here today, and have been 
with the Church from the time of its organization down to the present 
moment. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 13 



THE SUCCESSORS TO THE PROPHET JOSEPH MEN OF GOD 

Those great men who succeeded the Prophet Joseph Smith in the 
presidency of this Church were indeed men of God. I was acquainted 
with them all personally, as President Grant has testified concerning his 
acquaintance. I knew the men ; I knew their private feelings, their in- 
most souls. I was familiarly acquainted with each of them, and shared 
the joy of their confidence and their good will, and the manifestations 
of God to them in private as well as in public. I can testify, as I am 
willing to do to all the world, that they were indeed men of God, clothed 
upon with the power of that holy Priesthood restored to earth in the 
last days through divine messengers sent from on high to introduce the 
work of the last dipensation of the fulness of times. I am very thank- 
ful to be here this morning. It is better than anything else I can 
think of, to be here with this great congregation and listen to the words 
of inspiration that have come to us today. I rejoice in the past, I feel 
full of happiness and peace for the present, and my soul is filled with 
joyful anticipation because of the future. I know that this is the work 
of God, and I also know a little of what it will be when tha't vieil of 
the covering is taken away, and the light of the Lord shines out from 
above, from the Most High, and the earth is redeemed and clothed upon 
with his glory and his power. I am thankful for this testimony in my 
heart. I know it has come, not from any great effort of mine, any 
great abilities or learning of mine, but by the word of the Lord to me. 
I know that he has been with me all the days of my ministry in this 
Church. I was ordained an elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, according to a certificate which I carry with me, on 
the sixth day of January, 1851, and from that time to the present I have 
felt that I am an Elder in Israel, a servant of the Most High God, 
that I was dedicated to his service anywhere and everywhere and at all 
times, under all circumstances and seasons, in all the nations of the 
earth; and I have realized the blessings of the Lord in supporting me in 
all the efforts I have been able to make for the furtherance of this great 
divine cause in the world. I know that the Lord is with this people, 
that he has been with them from the beginning, that he has been with 
those who have been called to lead them from the beginning, and that 
he will continue so to do. 1 know that he will be with us, every one 
of us, if we will carry out the things that have been taught to us this 
morning. They are not new" by any means ; delivered in a new way, 
perhaps, and in an impressive manner that comes right down into our 
souls, but they are the word of the Lord and have been delivered to' this 
people from the time of the organization of the Church; and the work 
has been gradually developing, getting bigger, stronger, mightier, hav- 
ing more influence in the earth. 

PLEASURE IN THE PROGRESS OF TEMPLE WORK. 

When we hear these glad reports concerning the spread of the work 
in foreign lands, it gives us pleasure and gives us courage to still press 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



forward and do our part in the great cause. The building of these 
temples which have been dedicated to the Lord is a wonderful mark 
of the work of the Lord, and of its promise to us. The building of the Al- 
berta temple — some will call it the Cardston temple, or the Canadian tem- 
ple, but it is the Alberta temple, that is the name of it — the building of that 
structure upon English soil is an indication to us of what the Lord will 
do. The temples will not be confined altogether to Zion, even though 
that may cover both North and South America. The work will spread 
forth in other lands as the veil o'er the covering continues to burst. 
The spiritual and temporal, the heavenly and earthly, will be closer, in 
being joined together, and the time will come when we shall have plenty 
of work to do, in the millennial season, the one thousand years, the one 
"day of the Lord," when we get communications from the priesthood 
behind the veil to the priesthood in the earth, in the temples that will 
be erected. In those holy conversations we read about in the revela- 
tions of God, concerning the building of a house to him, that day is not 
very far off, as the Lord sees things. It may be quite a while as we 
see them, but they are real, and that which God has promised concern- 
ing them will surely come to pass. The wonderful work that is going 
on in these temples now is but an indication of that which is to come. 
The building of the temple in Hawaii, shows that we go to the heathen, 
as we have been invited to do sometimes by £>ur good Christian friends, 
going to the Islands of the sea, fulfils the command of the Lord. These 
things will be increased and multiplied, and temples will be built in the 
north and in the south, in the east and the west, so that all that needs 
to be done in the great work of redemption for the dead, as well as for 
the living, will be accomplished, and brought about just as it has been 
revealed by the prophets. 

OUR DUTY TODAY. 

The great thing for us Latter-day Saints today, gathered here in 
conference, representing the people that could not get here — for this 
is a representative body in conference assembled, representing the Saints 
in all the stakes of Zion — the thing for us to do is to take the word of 
the Lord today, to do that which the Lord requires of us, obey his com- 
mandments, walk in obedience to his sayings, keep in the line of duty, in 
the strait and narrow way, and not go off to the side, to the right or 
to the left, and not get mixed up in those entangling alliances which 
some of our people enjoy with the institutions of the world. I don't 
want to say one word against those institutions that are established 
in the world, in the way of charity or literature or science, real sci- 
ence, or art, or anything that is called religion, even though it be not 
much of a religion, but beneficial in its sphere, I would not say a word 
against them. But for us, what should we do, elders in Israel, ser- 
vants of the living God, called of God in the latter-days to hold this 
divine authority to preach the gospel to all the world, to every nation 
and kindred and tongue and people? That is what these temples sig- 
nify to me. This was the word of the Lord from the beginning. The 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



15 



gospel was brought from heaven to earth for all the world, and it is our 
business to see that it goes there as far as we can. 

WE BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST; THIS IS HIS CHURCH 

Now. what is our duty? Our duty is to walk in the straight way, 
and find out the will of the Lord and do it as far as we have power, in 
the weakness of our human bodies, teach it to our children, bring them 
up in the fear of the Lord, keep them in the path. It is a sad thing 
when our people stray off into organizations that are not in conson- 
ance with the word of the Lord and his ways. It is not a good thing to 
be tangled up with them, my brethren. It is good to stay in this 
Church. When we came into it we were baptized into it over head 
and ears, and feet, the whole of us, body and spirit. The soul of man 
went into the water of baptism, and so we belong to the Lord. We 
took upon us the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer; we belong to 
him, and he purchased us by the price of his own blood. To say that 
we do not believe in Christ is so ridiculous that we need not say any- 
thing in trying to confute it. This is his Church ; he started it ; he has 
continued with it ; he is with it today. The Spirit manifested today 
in the leader of the Church is the Spirit of Christ. Don't you know 
that? I am sure you do. I need not say anything on that. You feel 
it not only "in your bones," but in the .soul of you, the spirit of you. It 
is within you. You feel that the Spirit of God has been with us here 
today, and has been with the president through all his administration, 
and he is growing with the years. He is getting younger in mind and 
body, and he is full of light and life and power, and I am proud of be- 
ing associated with him. Thank God for the privilege. I thank 
God for being a member of this Church. It is a wonderful privilege. 
It is a great blessing from on high, to be baptized into Christ, to try and 
put on Christ in life and labor and spirit and energy and power ; to be 
with him and to feel that I can approach God the Father through and 
by him and have fellowship with him, as well as with my brethren 
and sisters in the Church. It is by that Spirit that the Lord has 
blessed me and guided me through the years that have passed, and I 
bless and praise and glorify his holy name in the congregation today. 

ZIOX WILT. PROSPER REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS OF HER OPPONENTS 

I know that this work will go on and I know that it has prospered 
in the past, in this respect that I am about to mention, and will go on in 
the future. The Lord promised that all that is formed against Zion 
shall not only not prosper, but it shall be turned to the welfare and 
benefit of Zion. Now be assured that this will be the case; that the 
present efforts being made by those who are not of us, but who are 
against us, that whatever they may do, whatever they may say, will be 
turned around in the sequel, to the glory of God, and the salvation of 
men, through and by this Church and its priesthood. That is as sure 
as that the sun rises in the morning after it has appeared to set at 
night. This work will go on and on, and we will see it, if we live 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



long enough on the earth, and I suppose we will if we get away. I 
don't know how much we shall see whem we get out of the body, but we 
will see a good deal more than we can while we are in the body. But 
we will see that this promise is fulfilled. All these schemes, these plots 
and plans, and all these ridiculous efforts that are being made will 
show up to be so ridiculous, so feeble, so false, that they will turn 
around to the good of this work in which we are engaged, to the glory 
of God and the salvation of men. So do not be discouraged by any- 
thing that may be said against the Church or its leaders. It has been 
said from the beginning, right from the start. Before Joseph Smith 
go,t even direction to organize the Church, he was assailed by the most 
religious people in his vicinity. But the things which they said against 
him eventually turned around to strengthen him in the minds of decent 
and reasonable and religious people and so will it be in the future. We 
need not be concerned about that. Only let us be concerned with our 
own lives and labors, and the performance of our duties. 

WE NEED NOT BE CONCERNED. OUR DUTIES ARE PLAIN. 

They are very plain. They are set down, most of them, in black 
and white. We can read them in the Doctrine and Covenants. I wish 
all our elders, priests, teachers and deacons, would become fully 
acquainted with Section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Many of 
them do not know much about it. It is there in the book we read, and 
all the revelations contained therein have the ring, in my ears, of the 
gospel of the light and love of God, and the power of God unto salva- 
tion. Now my brethren, let us be acquainted with what the Lord has 
revealed, and take it into our souls. Let us realize and feel that we 
are a part of this work, a true and living and active working part. 
Every man called to hold the Priesthood is called of God to work in thi r 
great Latter-day cause, that God has revealed, and if we will take the 
advice, received by us this morning from our President, whose right 
it is to direct us, we will be going right all the time. I am sure of that. 

CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE VISITS OF MORONI 

I thank the Lord for the great manifestation of his power on the 
Hill Cumorah and in the Sacred Grove. I have been to those places 
and I felt the importance of the things that were done in the neighbor- 
hood of the Hill Cumorah, which the brethren visited, on the crown of 
which they held a splendid meeting, participated in by a great many 
people not of our faith. This meeting was commemorative of one of 
the most wonderful events that have ever occurred in this world. The 
first thing of importance in the revelations of God in the latter-days 
was the manifestation of the Father and the Son in that Sacred Grove 
to the boy Joseph. The next in importance, and as an opening of the 
work of the last days was the visits of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet 
Joseph, in his bedroom. When being reminded in his soul of the import- 
ance of the message he had already received, and feeling that he had 
not been faithful and true to the spirit of it in his own life, although 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 17 



he had not done anything of very great consequence that was wrong, 
he humbly confessed to God — and by this you shall know, the Lord says, 
when a man repents, "behold, he will confess his sins and turn away 
therefrom." That is real repentance. Joseph repented, and while in this 
mood, this angelic visitation came. I understand it to some extent. I 
have had what I call dreams, some people call them by other names. I 
can see that gathering of light in that chamber of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I can see the form of the Angel Moroni appearing right in 
that light, not standing on the floor but above the floor, so that Joseph 
could see him and the beautiful glory that surrounded his personality, 
and I bear testimony that he was a real personage, that he did come to 
the Prophet Joseph. What he revealed has, in a very large measure, 
been fulfilled, and that which has not been fulfilled will all come to 
pass. 

Read the account of that vision. Brother Ivins read it here in 
the tabernacle, a week ago last Sunday. Read it yourselves. It is 
published in the Pearl of Great Price just as Joseph revealed it to the 
world. The vision or revelation that he received from the Father and 
the Son is told there in his own words. Then follows the account of 
the visitations of the Prophet Moroni, three distinct times in the one 
night. Moroni feeling impressed to repeat it so that Joseph should not 
forget it, and adding other things that he had not thought of himself 
when he first came. Three times he appeared to the Prophet. They 
were real appearances, and what Joseph saw and what he heard were 
from God. Moroni was a messenger from on high. There has been 
a little discussion I have been told, by a few of our brethren holding 
some kind of a priesthood class, a little distance from the center of 
this city, over the wonderful question whether it was Moroni or 
Mormon who sealed the records called the Book of Mormon. They 
called up a friend of mine at eleven o'clock at night, after discussing 
it for three hours, to know which was the right thing; and he re- 
plied : "Why you have been singing it for the last forty or fifty 
years : 'Sealed by Moroni's hand, it has for ages lain, to wait the Lord's 
command, from dust to speak again." Yes, we have been singing it, 
and how much do we know wha£ we are singing sometimes? I merely 
mention that so we may call to mind what we sing, and what we pray, 
and what we have agreed to do, and what our covenants are, what we 
are here for. We spend a good deal of time, I think, in some of our 
classes in discussing matters that are not of very much moment. It does 
not matter much to me whether it was Moroni or his father Mormon 
who sealed the record, although it is best to be accurate and right in all 
things. Be careful to be right, and do not add to what God reveals. 
When you speak his word, give it as it is. 

NEED OF PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIPTURE. 

Now, my brethren, that was a real visitation that came to Joseph, 
and if we will read it carefully, we will see how wonderfully was opened 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



up and prefaced, the things that were to come in the bringing forth of 
the Book of Mormon in its acceptance by prayerful souls and rejection, 
by the world. Many things that are of great moment were revealed to 
Joseph at that time, and they are recorded in that simple statement of 
his, which you can read in this Pearl of Great Price, which is a very 
precious document, as it contains revelations given to Moses the Pro- 
phet, about things in the beginning when the earth was made, first 
spiritual and afterwards temporal. Many things are in the Book of 
Genesis, which, historically, were evidently traditions among the people, 
during the time from Adam down to the time of Moses, which was over 
twenty-four centuries — don't forget that — and many stories are told 
about things that occurred, and I fear that some of them are mingled 
together in the same chapter, different things occurring that are put 
in such a way that we sometimes are a little mistaken in our views con- 
cerning them. In regard to the manifestation of God to Abraham, there 
is no need to say that one of those three men whom we read of in Gen- 
esis 18, came to Abraham when he was sitting in his tent door in the heat 
of the day, and ate veal with him. was God Almighty. There is no 
need to suppose that, and if you will read the chapter carefully you will 
find that God's conversation with Sarah and Abraham at that time 
might be entirely separated from the story of those three men. I merely 
mention that, now, because some of our elders are using that chapter 
as an argument to prove that our heavenly Father is a personage of 
tabernacle, and they can prove that without going to those narratives 
that are told there or elsewhere. 

Now I think that it is a very important thing to get the word of the 
Lord as it comes to us, as we can read it, as we can receivd it in our 
hearts, ourselves : but do not add to it or take away from it. Let us 
keep the word of the Lord and preach it to the world. We are called 
to this. This is our ''job" ; this is our business. Every elder of the Church, 
every man holding the Priesthood, is called to be a minister for God, 
and among the peoples, to set as good an example as he can, consider- 
ing the weaknesses of human nature. We are none of us entirely per- 
fect : but we expect to "go on unto perfection," by keeping the will and 
word of the Lord. By and by we will arrive at that position when we 
will receive our bodies, quickened with the power of an endless life, 
and they become spiritual ; and our spirits, which are the sons and the 
daughters of God, are embodied in them to be continued — to be con- 
tinued, to be unrestricted in their united existence ; not for a time or a 
season; spirit and element inseparably connected, receiving a fulness 
of joy. And the time will come when we will receive that grand glory, 
a resurrection of our mortal bodies to become .spiritually united with 
our spiritual beings, the sons and the daughters of God, and all eternity 
will be before us and will open to us glory and honor and power and 
dominion and increase, perpetually, forever and ever. That is what 
is coming to us, and it will pay us for all the difficulties and troubles 
through which we are called upon to pass sometimes, here in this mor- 
tal state. We can let them go by. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W . PENROSE 



19 



WE MUST PREACH THE GOSPEL IN ALL THE WORLD. 

There is a ridiculous song being" sung, popularly — I forget the title 
— but it is "Let the rest of the world go by." Well, we can't do that. 
We can't let the rest of the world go by ; we must go to all the world 
and preach the gospel, to every creature, to every kindred and tongue 
and family and person, so far as we can reach them, and we have done 
pretty well through the hundred years that have intervened between 
the time when Moroni came, and the Book of Mormon was brought 
forth, and the present day. I believe that the Lord is pretty well satis- 
fied with us, with all our infirmities and all our weaknesses, our short- 
comings and our lack of faithfulness which applies to some people, it 
not to others. 

THE LORD WELL PLEASED WITH HIS PEOPLE. 

With all that, I believe that on the whole the Lord is well pleased 
with this people, and his Spirit is with them, and his power is with 
them. I believe that the authority and power of the holy Priesthood 
are being manifested in a greater degree than ever before in the his- 
tory of the Church, and the work going on in the temples is something 
astonishing when we come to read the reports from the presidents of 
those temples, what they have done and what they are preparing to' do. 
It is something wonderful, and it shows that the Lord is working in the 
world, as well as we are. We want to take the words that Jesus said 
about himself : "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." Let us 
feel the same. The Lord is working for us and with us. Now let us 
work and do our duty and the Lord will be with us, and everything 
predicted concerning - the glory and building up and prevalence of this 
great Latter-day work will come to pass. The Lord will live and rule 
and reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients, 
gloriously. He will bless everyone who labors in his cause in faithful- 
ness and sets a good example to his fellows. 

TESTIMONY. 

Now I do not want to occupy much time. I am very thankful for 
the privilege of bearing my testimony. I testify to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that what we have heard this morning is true, and you 
know it in your hearts. I testify to you that I know that God lives, that 
Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Savior 
of the world. It is through his atoning blood that we gain remission 
of our sins, given to us in the waters of baptism. It is by His power 
that we live and move, and by it that we receive this authority which 
God has given to us to labor in his cause ; and he will be with us if 
we are wih him in keeping his commandments and walking in his 
ways. 

I bear testimony to the mission of the President of the Church. 
Presdient Heber J. Grant is a great leader in Israel, and we give the 
glory of his work to the Lord, as he does. I feel honestly and sincere- 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ly in my soul today that all that I have been able to do, through the 
years that I have labored, has been by the blessing and providence and 
leading of Almighty God, and his Spirit has been with me, and I have 
had the privilege of having it and enjoying it with Latter-day Saints 
in different countries that I have visited, no matter what their language, 
no matter what their customs, no matter what their ways or surround- 
ings, the Spirit of God, the same Spirit that we feel here in Zion is, meas- 
urably, enjoyed by them, and so I can say of the whole Church. We 
have one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one hope of our calling. 
W e are one with the powers of God ; and by-and-by we will be united 
with them, and crowned with glory on the right hand of our Father, 
which may God grant, for Christ's sake, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR 

(President of the Garfield Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I am delighted to have the opportunity 
this morning of looking into the faces of so many Latter-day Saints. 
Were I to attempt to express the great love that I have for this work, it 
would be difficult for me, indeed. I have enjoyed immensely this 
morning the testimonies and messages that have been given to us by 
the President of the Church and his First Counselor, President Charles 
W. Penrose. I was particularly impressed with the paragraph of that 
wonderful dedicatory prayer which was read by President Heber J. 
Grant. I believe, my brethren and sisters, that, as Latter-day Saints, 
the majority of us who are here assembled have so destined and shaped 
our lives that it matters very little what may be said to us, but that 
the important thing to us is, what can we do as parents in Israel to shape 
the destiny of our boys and our girls? I rejoice in the great keynote 
that was sounded by our beloved President, that if we, as Latter-day 
Saints, will observe to do the will of the Father, if we will live exem- 
plary lives we will be able to have influence and power with the youth 
of Zion. I believe that the youth of Zion will become thoroughly quali- 
fied; however, I am sorry to say that in our part of the coun- 
try we are drifting in a degree, and we feel that some of the insin- 
cerity that is manifested by us as parents is being reacted in the in- 
dolence and in the idleness of our children, and in their failure to fully 
perform their duties as members of this great Church. 

I rejoice in the wonderful meeting we had this morning. I have 
never before experienced such a spirit, and never before had the feeling 
within my soul that the veil was so thin as when the prophet of the Lord 
was speaking this morning, and 1 felt that he is the prophet of the 
Lord to our great Church. 

I bear you my testimony that I know this is the work of the Lord. 
J. am delighted with the pleasure and privilege that I have had 
in laboring in the Garfield stake of Zion. I might say that in our 
stake we have eight wards and two branches. It is one hundred twenty- 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 



21 



five miles across our stake ; however, we are delighted to say to you 
that we believe absolutely in the statement of the Apostle Paul, as re- 
corded in the scripture, where he said : 

"And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on 
all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appoint- 
ed, and the bounds of their habitation ; that they should seek the Lord, 
if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far 
from every one of us." 

I am delighted to say that we have been preserved_and reserved by 
the Lord to come forth in this day and age of the world. We who are 
living out in the southern part of this state, are happy, contented, and 
are seeking and finding the Lord. Hundreds of our people have strong 
testimonies that this is the work of the Lord. 

May the Lord bless us, may we enjoy this conference as we have 
never before enjoyed any conference, and may we take the message 
back to our people that the greatest thing that will redound to our 
welfare and make for success in the rearing of our children, is the 
example that is set by parents. May the Lord bless you is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH J. LARKIN 

(President of the Curlew Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I am happy this morning to be a Latter- 
day Saint. I am thankful that I have been born in this day and time 
when God has again spoken from the heavens, when he has restored 
the Priesthood to the earth, and has given man authority to preach 
the gospel. I am thankful that I have the privilege of being here 
this morning and listening to the remarks of our beloved President. 
He certainly has given to us, as Latter-day Saints,the key that will 
enable us to enter our Father's kingdom. I am thankful that he has 
inspired his servants as he has done in these last days to lead and guide 
the people. I want to bear my testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that if we will listen to their words that we will gain a sal- 
vation and exaltation in our Father's kingdom, if we will follow the 
instructions given to us this morning — observe our individual and 
family prayers, and observe the Word of Wisdom. It seems to me 
that if we will do those three things we will be led to do other things, 
for by so doing we will be led to keep the commandments that our 
Father in heaven has given to us. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, as I know that I stand here 
this morning, that the gospel is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet 
of God, that he was raised up in this the last dispensation, to establish 
his work here in the earth. I know it, and I pray that the Lord will 
bless and inspire our hearts to keep the commandments that he has 
given to us through his servants. I want to say to you here that if we 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



will follow the counsel that is given to us by the servants of the Lord, 
we will never go very far estray. 

I wish to bear my testimony to you regarding one other thing, 
and that is the matter of the home evening that the Latter-day Saint 
parents have been counseled and advised to hold with their families. 
If you will call your families together, my brethren and sisters, once 
a week and hold a home evening with them, pray with them, and 
sing with them, it will be one of the greatest helps to you in holding 
your boys and girls in the fear of the Lord. That is my experience, 
that is my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, here this morning. 
I pray that the Lord will bless us with the desire to serve him and 
keep his commandments, that in the end we may gain eternal life. I 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MARK AUSTIN 

(President of the 1'remunt Stake of Zion) 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, that 1 rejoice in having 
the opportunity of attending (his conference, and listening to the in- 
spiring words of our beloved President Heber j. Grant. Surely the 
testimony, the spirit and power of the message of the Prophet of 
God must have found the innermost parts of our souls. The Lord 
is with this people, and with his servants whom he has given charge 
concerning this great Latter-day work. 

Surely the people of the world must discover that we love them 
when we send thousands of our boys and girls to the ends of the earth 
to cry repentance unto mankind, and to deliver the message that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith gave to tlrs people. My brethren and sisters, 
I thank God that I was born of goodly parents, who hearkened untq 
the voice of the elders in a foreign land, and that they gathered with 
this people. I thank the Lord for my standing in the Church, and 
for my association with the General Authorities, and the brethren 
and sisters of this Church. 

We have a splendid people in the state of Idaho. They are serv- 
ing the Lord, determined to keep his commandments, and establish 
the truth, that men everywhere may know that our Father has set 
his hand to accomplish his work and to save bis children, to bring 
about peace in the earth and good will to men. May the Lord bless 
us and help us to accomplish every desire of our hearts, and to this 
end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

PART OF TIIK HILL CUMORAH PURCHASED 

I forgot one item that we have here, namely that we are now the 
owners of a part of the Hill Cumorah. The Church, a few weeks 
ago, purchased a farm of ninety odd acres, which embraces the West 



PRESIDENT HE HER J. GRANT 



23 



slope of the Hill Cumorah, about one-third of the way up the hill. 
There is a nice farm house, and it is a very fine piece of property. 
Elder Willard Bean, in charge of the Memorial Home, or the Smith 
Farm, wrote us that he could purchase this property, and we are glad 
now that at least part of the hill is in the posession of the Church. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O say, what is Truth?"' 
The closing payer was offered by Elder Albert Choules, pres- 
ident of the Teton stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Crant presided. 

The meeting was opened by the choir and the congregation singing, 
''How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Robert D. Young, president of the 
Sevier stake. 

Mrs. H. C. Snell sang a sacred solo entitled, "Fear Not Ye, O 
Israel." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My dear brethren and sisters, I am very happy to be able to bear 
testimony to the inspiration of the addresses made this forenoon. I 
was deeply impressed by the opening address of President Grant, and, 
as to one of the stake presidents, to me. it seemed that seldom had 
we had such an opportunity to recognize the nearness of the prophet 
of the Lord who stands at the head of the Church to that divine 
power which we know guides this Church. I noted also with great 
rejoicing the constant reference to the great event that occurred in New 
York state just a little over one hundred years ago — one of the very- 
great events in the history of the world. 

TRUTH NEEDS NO BOLSTERING 

I was reminded by a remark made by President Penrose of a state- 
ment made to me by one of my young friends not very long ago, who 
had been studying the Book of Mormon. Me said: ''1 have been 
devoting some time to the study of the pre-historic remains in South 
and North America and they are a wonderful confirmation of the truth 
of the Book of Mormon." "But," he added, and he added it impres- 
sively, "as I have read and studied the Book of Mormon I have come 
to the conclusion that I have no need of confirmation of the truth- 
fulness of that wonderful book by the remains of pre-historic peoples 
found anywhere on the face of the earth, because I have discovered 
that the book, within itself, carries its own witness of its truthfulness." 
T was glad to have this young friend bear this testimony, for I knew 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thereby that he learned the chief lesson that comes to every member 
of this Church who discovers for himself, by the testimony of the 
Spirit, that this is indeed the work of God. It is almost a truism, 
that if we deal with high truth, a great truth, such a truth carries 
within itself evidence of its correctness. That is, one does not need 
go outside the truth for evidence to sustain that truth. This is one of 
the characteristics of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for within it are all 
the evidences that man may need to establish the conviction that lies 
at the foundation of a living, perfect and continuous testimony of the 
truth of this work. 

As we read the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, or the Pearl of 
Great Price, or any of the works produced through the instrumentality 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, we observe this wonderful characteristic 
— that each revelation, within itself, carries to those who read, study, 
and live it, a witness of its truth. One does not need to search the 
world for evidence of the truth of this work. The evidence lies within 
the work itself. 

TRUTH ALWAYS COMES IN LIGHT 

In the remarkable visitation of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, it seems to me, we have an illustration of the fact that 
truth carries with it the evidence of its authenticity. It may seem 
unnecessary to say this to Latter-day Saints, yet young" people espe- 
cially, and sometimes older people think that they must go far afield 
to secure evidences of the truth of the revelations to Joseph Smith. 
1 have been impressed deeply in reading, as I have done time and 
time again, the simple, direct story of the Prophet Joseph Smith con- 
cerning the visitations of Moroni, with the internal evidence of the 
truthfulness of that account. Note for instance, as remarked by 
President Penrose this morning, that the angel came in light, not in 
darkness. Truth always comes in light, it can not come in darkness; 
It doe.suiot come hooded and covered and formless ; it does not come as 
do initiations into the secret societies of the world ; but it comes in open 
daylight, or in a light above that of daylight; which makes it clear 
and understandable tol the human mind. It has always been to me an 
evidence of the truthfulness of Joseph's simple story, that the Prophet 
declares in all sincerity that Moroni came in a burst of light ; that out 
of thq light, as pictured by President Penrose this morning, came the 
figure and form of Moroni, as the Prophet's eyes, through the power 
resting upon him, were able to recognize the happenings in that room. 

The story itself, direct and simple, is a splendid piece of literature 
which carries with it conviction that here is a man who is telling the 
simple truth, just the thing he saw, just the thing that he believed to 
have happened, the thing that he knew, in fact, had happened. Those 
who tell falsehoods and attempt to deceive the generations of men, 
seldom speak with that lucid clearness, wiht that simplicity of style 
which characterize the wonderful story of Moroni's visitation, found 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



25 



in the Pearl of Great Price, which President Penrose recommended us 
to read. 

THE WONDERFUL PEDAGOGY OF MORONl's TEACHING 

President Penrose also called attention to the wonderful pedagogy 
of Moroni's teaching. The angel came to impress upon the boy 
Prophet the message that he had been sent to deliver. Three times! he 
rehearsed the message, and the night had passed by the time the third 
telling had been completed. The boy, worn with the night's vigil— 
because his spirit dwelt in a mortal body — went out to labor in the 
field, when for the fourth time the angel came to him, and there in 
full daylight, to make certain to the boy's mind char this ching was 
not a delusion of the night, in' the full glare of the sun, the angel came 
again and repeated the same message to the boy. 

I am an old teacher of boys and girls, and I stand in admiration 
before the wise method of teaching employed by the Angel Moroni in 
impressing upon the mind of the boy the tremendous story that he was 
to initiate in this last period in the history of the world. This is 
another evidence of the truthfulness of this remarkable vision. This 
seventeen-year-old boy had no background of experience or training, 
beyond that which belonged to the back woods of New York, to enable 
him to manufacture and lay before the world such a truly wonderful 
system: of pedagogy as lies in the simple story of Joseph's communica- 
tion with the Angel Moroni. 

It has been said, and I believe properly, that if any person will 
read with care the account of the first vision referred to this morning 
by President Grant, when the Almighty Father of us all, and his Son 
Jesus Christ, appeared to the boy in the grove in Palmyra, and will 
read in that connection the full story of the visitation of Moroni, in 
those two episodes in the history of the Church, lie the germs of every- 
thing that happened later in the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
At the very beginning of the career of the Prophet, before the Church 
was founded, at the initial time, the whole future was reviewed; as a 
seed is planted which produces a complete plant. Thus, in the seeds 
sown in the Prophet's mind and placed before his understanding in 
the first two great visitations lie the germs of all that the Prophet 
was to develop throughout his life, or that we are developing today. 
This, also, is a convincing evidence to me of the simple truthfulness 
of all that pertains to the work of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Wherever 
we turn, whatever we touch of the work he did. to those who care 
to read and think properly, comes the conviction, that here was a boy 
who saw, who knew, who told the truth, who was not capable of false- 
hood, who made no attempt to garnish or change or enlarge that which 
had come to him. 

THE DIVINE NATURE OF THE MANIFESTATION 

Not only are all these things wonderful, and many more, with 
respect to the great anniversary which we are practically celebrating at 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this conference, but one thing, almost above all others, makes us feel 
the divine nature of the whole manifestation. As the visit continued 
throughout the night, upon each occasion the Angel Moroni, at a cer- 
tain time, not clearly described to us in the story as given us by the 
boy, quoted from the Bible. Certain quotations were quoted just as 
they stand in the Bible. Some few were changed. One in particular 
was changed and to such a degree that it is found among the latter- 
day revelations, as Section 2 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "Behold 
I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the 
Prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 
And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to 
the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. 
If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his 
coming." Moroni had shown the boy a picture of the past, of the 
present and of thei future, of something that had happened, that existed, 
that should happen. Then this seventeen-year-old boy was taught that 
to accomplish that which was pictured, the authority of the Priesthood 
of Almighty God would be necessary. The plan of a railroad may 
easily be projected, but it takes power to build the railroad. The boy 
was told that it would require the authority of the Priesthood to 
accomplish the coming work that had been revealed to him, laid bare 
to him, during that long night and on the following day, and that that 
authority would extend into the past, to save those who had died 
without obeying the law. Elijah was to turn the hearts of the children 
to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children. P>y this 
doctrine, all time is made one, all events are made parts of a great 
progressive plan : all things and time are united, with God at their 
head. As this principle is elaborated, it becomes perhaps the most 
tremendous of all the principles restored in these latter-days through 
the instrumentality of the Prophe f Joseph Smith. Need I say that the 
fact that the need of this principle to cement all the other principles and 
teachings of Moroni is a great evidence of the truth of the Prophet's 
story of Moroni's Aasitations? 

TRUTH EVER SHAPES THE DESTINY OE HUMANITY 

Has the sword, the cannon, or the implements of warfare shaped 
human destiny? No. A truth; a true idea, presented to the earth 
has ever shaped the destinies of humanity. Men had forgotten the 
Gospel of Christ. Then the Christ came, laid down his life for our 
redemption and among other truths restored the one that man shall 
not sleep forever in the grave. This glad truth of eternal life, as it 
bursts upon the earth, has changed the field of human activity for nearly 
two thousand years. It has made wars and stopped wars, but the effect 
of the wars of the nations has been small in comparison with the 
influence of that tremendous truth that man after death shall live 
again. Similarly the boy Joseph Smith sent out over the earth the 
mighty truth that under the priesthood there is a coherence of all time ; 



ELDER JOHN A. W1DTS0E 



17 



and that the dead shall not only live again, but may gain that which 
they failed to win on earth, that the power of the priesthood transcends 
the limitations of time, and is endless. Therefore we build temples. 
Already this truth is beginning to reshape the views of men, and in 
time it will help remodel our warring world. Truths guide humanity 
whether recognized or not. Let me paraphrase two lines from the 
Irish poet: 

"One man with a dream, at pleasure, 
May go out to conquer a crown; 
And two. with a new truth's measure, 
May trample a kingdom down." 

That is the power of great truths. 

WE ARE MADE FEARLESS AND UNAFRAID BY TRUTH 

Those who have truth are not afraid, they are fearless and un- 
afraid. Latter-day Saints have truth ; therefore, there is no fear in 
their hearts. Every page of the history of this Church proclaims its 
truth. Every line in holy writ proclaims the truth of this great latter- 
day work. Every chapter in the history of this Church from the 
Prophet Joseph to the Prophet Heber J. Grant, proclaims the same 
truth. With the sword of truth we shall wiri the battle in which God 
has enlisted us. 

I remember reading, when a boy, a helpful passage from the 
Doctrine and Covenants. Let me read it here in conclusion. As a lad 
I felt fear, sometimes of men. but more often of the dark outside 
forces. I often wondered if this persecuted people after all would 
be able to accomplish all that was pictured in its destiny. Then I found 
in my reading of the Doctrine and Covenants this passage which has 
been a joy and a help and a strength to me all my life, for the Lord 
said to his people in Llarmony, Pennsylvania, before the Church was 
organized : 

"Therefore, fear not, little flock; d r o good; let earth and hell combine 
against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail. 

"Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and sin no more: perform 
with soberness the work which T have commanded you. 

"Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. 

"Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the 
nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall 
inherit the kingdom of heaven." 

What do we care for the slanderer or the liar ; what do we care 
for the enemy who arises to defeat our holy purposes? We have the 
truth, the mightiest weapon God has given to his' people, and we shall 
win, in the end, if we do the thinsrs that God requires us to do. May 
we be strong in God's service and in that sendee may we be fearless 
and unafraid, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

While the President was speaking' this morning he referred 
to the very important incidents connected with the celebration of the 
one-hundredth anniversary of the visit of the Angel Moroni to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. While my soul was thrilled with the recital 
of that memorial service, I was asking- myself the question : 

What is the purpose in the bringing forth of the Book of Mor- 
mon? What was the primary object and purpose of the Lord in 
revealing the existence of those plates to the world in this generation? 
I recognize that there are many reasons why the Book of Mormon 
was and is needed. What a comfort it brings, what enlightening 
knowledge it gives to us concerning the ancient inhabitants of the 
American continent, and also how it magnifies the Lord Jesus Christ 
in his ministry among men upon this continent, as another witness 
for him and for the Lord's work. 

TO BRING TO PASS THE REDEMPTION OF THE LAMANITES 

But I thought of one of the revelations in the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants that gives more specific information upon this subject, 
and with your permission I shall read a few verses from the third 
section. The Lord said : 

"Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowl- 
edge of a Savior has come unto the world 1 , through the testimony of the 
Jews, even so shall the knowledge of the Savior come unto my people. 

"And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephit.es, and the 
Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers. 

"And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, 
and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled in the unbelief be- 
cause of the iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy 
their brethren the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abomina- 
tions. 

"And" for this very purpose are these plates preserved, which contain 
these records — that the promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he 
made to his people; 

"And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, 
and that they might know he promises of he Lord, and that they may 
believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ and be 
glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance 
the}- might be saved, Amen." 

For this very purpose, therefore, were these plates preserved, to 
bring to pass the redemption of the children of father Lehi, known in 
North and South America, in Central America, and in Mexico, as 
the American Indians and some of the natives upon the isles of the 
sea. I feel, therefore, that as we celebrate the anniversary of this 
appearance and the first knowledge and information concerning this 
sacred volume of Scripture, it is a most fitting time for our attention 
to be called to the uncompleted task which yet rests upon the priest- 
hood and the membership of this Church — to see to it that the Book of 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



29 



Mormon accomplishes its full and complete mission in being an in- 
strument in the hands of the Lord in bringing to pass the redemption 
of the Lamanites. Men have predicted the extermination of the 
Indians. They have foretold, as they thought, a time to come when the 
Indians would be no more. But the Lord has spoken upon that sub- 
ject and said that the Lamanites shall flourish. No power can defeat 
the purposes of the Almighty. I have seen evidences in my own 
missionary work, having had the great privilege and pleasure of 
laboring a portion of the time at least, for ten years, among the 
Indians, which convinced me that the day of their redemption is 
coming. The Lord gave me to see and understand during that labor 
that he was performing many things in preparation for their re- 
demption. He is giving them a language at the expense of the govern- 
ment of the United States, who in its generosity has spent millions 
of dollars in training and preparing the Indians in the English language, 
until the records show that in this country at least, nearly sixty per 
cent of all the Indians read or write the English language. The 
government has generously provided for them allotments of land that 
will be ample to sustain them and their posterity for generations to 
come, if only they will preserve these lands. I have seen the hand 
of the Lord at work in preparing the way for their redemption, and I 
wish to bear witness to you that their redemption shall come, and that 
the day of their redemption is near at hand, when these thousands, 
yea these millions of Lamanites on this Western Continent who have 
the blood of Lehi in their veins, or of his descendants, shall be 
touched by the power of the Almighty, and the day of their redemption, 
when it does come, will be one of power. 

I desire that the Latter-day Saints, young men and young women, 
shall appreciate the Book of Mormon and read it and prepare their 
hearts and themselves so that when the time does come that they shall 
ibe called to go forth, that they shall be prepared to go and discharge 
the obligations which the Lord has placed upon us as the custodians 
of this record, to see to it that it does fulfil its mission. Its mission 
is not completed yet. 

The Book of Mormon was given as a new witness to the wotld. 
The very best evidence, perhaps, that the Lord ever has given that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, is the Book of Mormon. Men may 
scoff at the idea of the Father and Son having visited him in the 
Sacred Grove ; they may think that they can dispose of it to their 
own satisfaction at least, by calling it a fraud or a delusion, but 
the Book of Mormon is a real substantial thing. It is the miracle 
of "Mormonism." It cannot be disposed of in any such manner. It 
must be reckoned with, it must be accounted for, and all who diligently 
and earnestly seek to account for it shall come to acknowledge what 
Joseph Smith said is indeed the truth, that by the gift and power of God 
he translated the records from the plates that were placed in his hands, 
that record which is known among us as the Book of Mormon. It 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



stands, and it shall stand forever and ever, and it cannot be defeated nor 
can it be thrown down. 

TO BLESS, BENEFIT AND SAVE THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD 

I believe also that the Lord raised up the Book of Mormon and 
brought it forth, and in connection with it the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith for a given and definite purpose, to be a benefit and 
salvation to the peoples of this world. I think that our Father in 
heaven is very much like an earthly father. He is more or less limited 
in his power to do things because of law that he observes and must 
observe. An earthly father cannot set aside the law of the land, nor 
can he veto the law of nature. If that father has a wicked and re- 
bellious son who violates the law of the land or the law of God or the 
law of nature, that earthly father's great anxiety cannot save his son. 
All that earthly father can do is to warn his son of the danger, point 
out the difficulties that are before the boy, plead with him to change 
his course, and afier he has made his appeal he can point out the way of 
safety, and then the father's powers to save are ended. All his over- 
weaning love for that boy cannot go further. Our heavenly bather is 
very much in the same condition. You will discover, if you will read 
the first section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, what the Lord 
said as he gave this wonderful address in the First Section to all the 
world through his servant the Prophet Joseph Smith. Reading from 
the seventeenth verse we find the following: 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come 
upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, 
Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets — " 

Let me now read from the twenty-second verse : 

"That mine everlasting covenant might be established, 
"That the fulness of the gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and 
the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

"Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of 
me, and 1 were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner 
of their language, that they might come to understanding." 

I understand from this that the Lord plainly knew the condition 
of the world, what it was in 1830, and what it would De today m the 
year 192'3. Knowing the calamities that were coming to his children, 
unless they changed their course, knowing their disposition that there 
would be no repentance in their hearts, and yet with a great desire 
to save them, he called upon his servant. Joseph Smith, to warn men, 
to call repentance, and others to join in this great proclamation to all 
men: "Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.'' And not only to 
warn men that there was peril and danger ahead, but to offer the 
means of escape from the perils that would come. Our merciful 
Father never has left his children in a condition of dire peril from which 



ELDER M EL VI N J. BALLARD 



31 



they could not extricate themselves, either in the days of Noah, in the 
days of Sodom and Gomorrah, or in the days of the Redeemer him- 
self, or in these latter-days, — it is all the same. He has always in 
ample time given his sons and daughters full and complete warning - of 
the perils and dangers that are ahead of them, and has, in that con- 
nection, clearly pointed out the way of escape. That has been true in 
this dispensation, and the warning has been proclaimed on the islands 
of the sea, in the continents of the world, and through the states of the 
United States, and among even Pagan nations, the warning voice of the 
servants of the Lord has been heard, for nearly one hundred years, and 
it is a warning voice that also comes with a kind invitation to all the 
Father's children, showing the means of escape, which is the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ restored again among men. I stand here 
without any fear and say without any danger of anybody successfully 
being able to prove the contrary, that if the warning voice of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and the elders of this Church had been heeded 
by the nations of the earth, we would not have seen the dreadful 
calamity of war through which we have passed, that these problems 
could have been solved and averted. The means was provided, and 
the means was rejected, and then when our Father has clone this, 
though he be God, is yet limited -to law, by obedience to which he 
became God, and he must honor the same, he cannot step beyond those 
limitations and set aside the law. The law must take its course, 
and when men refuse the offer and tender the Lord has given by 
which they may be saved, they cannot blame the Lord if calamities, 
judgments and destructions come upon them. The Lord cannot avert it, 
it must take its course, and yet our Father in his kindness and mercy 
has offered the way and the means of escape. 

god's voice crying repentance through the elements 

Now 1 want to bear witness of something else : You will find 
it recorded in one of the revelations to the" Prophet Joseph Smith 
and the elders of this Church, that after the testimony of the elders 
should come the testimony of lightnings, of thunder, of earthquakes, 
of the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds, and of destruction, 
the elements being" engaged in bearing testimony — the thunder would 
cry repentance. And yet in that same revelation the Lord said they 
would not heed that warning voice no more than they had heeded the 
warning voice of his servants. But I want to call the attention of the 
Latter-day Saints, and indeed if 1 had the power, the attention of all 
the world to the fact that God is speaking through the elements. The 
earthquakes, the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds, bringing such 
dire destruction as we have seen are the voice of God crying re- 
pentance to this generation, a generation that only in part has heeded 
the warning voice of the servants of he Lord. Oh, that men would 
hear the voice of the elements proclaiming repentance, and if they shall 
not hear it they shall be visited with dire calamity, for this is the 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



day of settlement, the day of reckoning, the hour of God's judgment has 
come. I rejoice not in the prospects of the chastisement that awaits 
the nations of the earth, I desire that they would save themselves. The 
means is yet at hand. By repentance and by turning to the Lord Jesus 
Christ they may find that salvation, but without it there is no salvation 
for this world. 

SIGNS OF THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST 

When Jesus spoke to his disciples in answer to their query : "Show us 
when the end of the world shall come, and the time of thy coming," he 
told of certain signs that would indicate the time of his coming, the 
very signs that the world, if they only had eyes to see, could be be- 
holding today: Said he: judge the matter even as you would judge 
the coming of spring. When you see the fig tree putting forth its 
leaf, ye know that summer is near, and so when you see these signs, 
you may know that the coming of the Son of man is nigh at hand. 
I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was just geologist enough to 
know the time when this earth would quake, when the processes of 
nature should go forth to cause great upheavals, and knew the hour, 
just as an astronomer can predict the time of eclipse. The Lord Jesus 
knew when that would happen, and he knew it was coincident and 
immediately preceding the wonderful events that would happen in pre- 
paration of his coming. 

YOU SHALL SEE WONDERFUL THINGS COME TO PASS IN THIS GENERATION 

These are the last days spoken of by the prophets of old. These 
are the signs. Oh, Latter-day Saints, let us, though we be in Zion, 
be not asleep, for this is the day when no man can be at peace, nor 
shall we remain at peace in sin or in transgression ; for everything 
will be shaken that is not built upon righteousness, and every man, 
whether in Zion or elsewhere, who does not keep the commandments 
of God, shall be shaken and shall fall, and shall feel the chastening 
hand of the Almighty. Oh, let us be good, obedient children, that we 
may learn in time, the lessons the Lord wants us to learn, and if 
we shall do it, if we shall keep the advice and counsel of the President 
of this Church, in the address given this morning, the judgments 
shall pass over us as they did in the days of ancient Israel, and those 
who keep the commandments of God have no need to fear, and they 
will discover that the Lord has seen this from the beginning, and he 
has known where to plant this people, and this people shall here be 
preserved if only they shall serve the Lord. They need not fear any- 
thing else, only to serve God and keep his commandments, and you 
shall see wonderful things come to pass, even in this generation. 

THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL TESTING TIME 

May the Lord teach us to be obedient, to be humble, to be 
peaceable, and to be faithful, to stand in this testing time, for 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



33 



this is a testing time, when individuals are being tested — no great assault 
against the Church, but a mighty assault on the part of the evil one 
against every individual. This is an individual testing time, and the 
enemy is at work, and he is in the midst of this people, seeking to 
capture souls that he may have them on his side in the coming conflict, 
for there is a coming conflict, and the powers of the evil one on the 
earth, and in hell shall be arrayed in deadly conflict for the victory 
of rulership and power and dominion over this earth against the Son 
of God. And the hosts of the righteous, living and dead, shall be 
victorious, and the evil one and all his power shall be overcome. But 
there is coming the time of strife, and there will be no peace from this 
day until that conflict is ended, by the victory that shall come to the 
Lamb of God and his faithful Saints. And may the Lord shorten 
those days for the elect's sake, and preserve us on the side of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and his faithful sons and daughters, I pray in his holy 
name. Amen. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I have enjoyed the tremendous inspiration of our heavenly Father 
that has been poured out upon us during this conterence. Nearly 
every speaker thus far has referred to the visit of Moroni. When 
the 21st day of September came, very naturally, like the rest of 
you, I thought of this visit. I read from the Pearl of Great Price that 
wonderfully concise and convincing story of the life of the boy Joseph 
Smith. 

MORONI'S MESSAGE. 

As Brother John A. Widtsoe has already said, the Angel Moroni 
repeated his message three times, once, twice, thrice in a single night, 
.and by that time daylight appeared. Again the following day, Sep- 
tember 22, the boy Joseph Smith, but seventeen years of age, found his 
way, guided by the vision of the night before, to the Hill Cumorah 
and there discovered the plates. The message was repeated for the 
fourth time. In this message many passages of scripture were re- 
ferred to and quoted. I read these references. While but a part of 
the third chapter of Malachi was quoted, I read it all. 

THE LAW OF TITHING. 

The part of this chapter which refers to the law of tithing I 
read with very great interest. It says: 

"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein 
have-we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 

"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat 
in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will 
not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that 
there shall not be room enough to xeceive it."' (Malachi, 3:8, 10.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is a wonderful promise. It looks as if the faithful are 
to be rewarded in the near future. Reports I have heard of late are 
to the effect that the prices of our crops generally are very good. The 
price of wool, the price of wheat, the price of potatoes and the price of 
heets — all these prices are very satisfactory. We are comparatively 
large producers of alfalfa seed, and it is reported that in all probability 
we shall receive this year an unusually high price for this product. 
The prices of the products of our farms are also comparatively high. 
It looks as if the day of prosperity is coming. The hearts of the 
people are filled with good cheer. As a rule they are looking forward 
with fine satisfaction to the future. The Lord has said it. and his 
words cannot fail: ''Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, 
if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a 
blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." 

THE WORD OF WISDOM AND ITS PROMISES. 

The President in his remarks this morning referred in his usual 
clear-cut and forceful way, to the Word of Wisdom. In this Word 
of Wisdom, "the letter from the Lord," as President Grant called it 
this morning, there are four clear-cut and most desirable promises 
made to all Saints who remember to keep and do the things con- 
tained in the Word of Wisdom, "walking in obedience to me command- 
ments." 

The first of these choice and desirable promises is health. What 
more desirable blessing can anybody Wish ? Yet the Lord says very 
clearly that all Saints who remember to keep and do the sayings in 
the Word of Wisdom, walking in obedience to the commandments, 
"shall receive health." Is health not a rich compensation for the 
effort required to live in accordance with the teachings in this "letter 
from the Lord"? 

After health what would we naturally select as a choice blessing 
if we were given the right to choose it? In this "letter from the Lord'' 
it says very clearly that all Saints who remember to keep and do the 
sayings in this Word of Wisdom, walking in obedience to the com- 
mandments, shall have this second choice blessing, which is wisdom. 
Certainly we all desire to be wise. Few of us see a single day in all 
the years of our lives in which, if we had wisdom, we could not use 
it to advantage. The second great promise to those who will keep 
and do these sayings is wisdom. 

After health has been secured and wisdom, what third great 
gift or blessing would we naturally desire? Would it not be knowl- 
edge, the third great promise contained in the Word of Wisdom? 
The promise, in this "letter from the Lord," is clear-cut and unequi- 
vocal, that all Saints who remember to keep and do the sayings, con- 
tained in the Word of Wisdom, walking in obedience to the command- 
ments, shall find great treasures of knowledge, yea, even hidden treas- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 35 

l 

ures. Can you imagine greater compensation or greater reward for any 
effort? 

If to these three choice blessings or promises a fourth were 
added, can anyone imagine a blessing more choice or more desirable 
than the fourth promise in this Word of Wisdom, namely, that the 
Lord himself gives unto all those who remember to keep and do these 
sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, "a promise that 
the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and 
not slay them." 

These four most choice and desirable blessings, the Lord himself 
promises to all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, 
and walk in obedience to the commandments. These four are, first 
health ; secondly, wisdom ; thirdly, knowledge, yea, even hidden 
treasures of knowledge ; and fourthly, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them as the children of Israel and not slay them. 

ENFORCE THE ANTI-CIGARETTE LAW 

Since this Word of Wisdom teaches that tobacco is not good for 
man ; and, further, since I am a Mutual Improvement worker — one 
of the General Superintendency — and our Mutual Improvement or- 
ganization has had a slogan referring to the use and sale of tobacco, I 
desire to make a few remarks concerning our so-called anti-cigarette 
legislation. I am glad to be able to say that so far as I know, in the 
whole State of Utah, there is not one individual who is not satisfied 
with the legislation upon this subject which we now have on our 
statute books. Since all the people seem to like the law, and since 
all the people seem to be in favor of enforcing it, as a Mutual Improve- 
ment worker I appeal to you now, stake presidents, high councilors, 
bishops, and bishops' counselors, and leading men in every part 
of the Church, and out of it for that matter, to do your utmost to 
have this splendid law enforced. Since it is unlawful for those under 
twenty-one years of age to have tobacco in any form in tneir possession, 
and further, since it is unlawful for any individual in the State of 
Utah to sell or give to minors tobacco in any form, we have a splendid 
opportunity by enforcing this law to keep our young people from using 
cigarettes. All good citizens too should be interested in seeing to it 
that only those who are paying a license for the privilege of so doing 
be permitted to sell cigarettes. A considerable amount of good is being 
accomplished too by suppressing, under the law, all advertising of 
tobavCO in any form on bill boards. If the citizens generally will 
see to it that this law is enforced, the number of boys who smoke 
cigarettes will be rapidly and materially decreased. 

Since we are placing such emphasis on this matter of the Word 
of Wisdom, some may feel as did the man in the mission field when 
he asked the missionary : "Do you mean to tell me that with this 
doctrine you call 'Mormonism,' you propose to conquer the whole 
world?" 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE GOSPEL WILL ULTIMATELY CONQUER THE WORLD 

I can reply as did the boy missionary : "Well, I will not say that 
witli 'Mormonism' we expect to conquer the whole world, but I do 
desire to say to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ will ultimately 
conquer the whole world, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is the gospel 
we teach." Men may criticize, men may ridicule, men may find fault, 
but nevertheless this is the Church and Kingdom of God. There is 
not one before me now in this great audience who cannot testify that he 
has been made better, he has been made stronger, he has been made 
happier in proportion to the degree of accuracy with which he has 
lived in accordance with the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
He who has found sorrow, he who has found regret, has found this 
sorrow and this regret because he has failed to live in accordance with 
these teachings. 

We seek all that is virtuous, all that is lovely, all that is upright, 
all that is uplifting in all the world. It is our aim to secure all these 
things, to produce a generation of splendid people the like of which the 
world has never known. 

ANOTHER PROMISE OF THE LORD 

Before closing I desire to refer to one other promise the Lord has 
made : 

"Jesus answered them and said, my doctrine is not mine, but his 
that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." (John 
7:16, 17.) Keep the commandments. Live in accordance with the 
teachings. Struggle to live in accordance with the example of our 
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Do these things and the promise is to 
all the people forever, you shall know of the doctrine. There is no 
uncertainty, there is no question, there is no doubt, positively none. 
The statement unequivocally is : "He shall know of the doctrine, 
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." 

SPLENDID LEADERS IN THE CHURCH 

To be associated with you who are now sitting before me, you 
splendid men, wonderful men, remarkable men, and glorious women, 
is the joy and pride of my life. I thought as I sat here this morning 
when the President began calling some of the stake presidents : "Who 
can imagine what is contained in the hearts of these excellent men who 
are in this audience? Who knows what they could say if they were 
given an opportunity to stand before this audience and speak?" 

I was in a stake conference only last Saturday and Sunday. 
I wanted the Stake President to speak, but he said only a few words. 
At a later meeting I insisted saying : "speak again," Again he said but 
a few words. He did not seem to desire to make a real address. When 
Sunday night came, however, and the building was crowded with the 
young people of the stake at the Mutual Improvement meeting, I ex- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



37 



plained that on the regular program for that particular session there 
were three different topics intended for three different speakers. All 
the visitors but the two Mutual Improvement workers had returned to 
Salt Lake City. So I said to the president: "Mr. President, here is a 
topic upon which I desire you to speak. The subject is prayer." 
Without warning, without notice, up he stood : and by the Spirit and 
power of God he testified, and thrilled us, through and through, 
with his own personal experiences as a result of placing his confidence 
and trust implicitly in the Almighty. 

"we stand for divine guidance" 

In free America, in this Christian country, the country of Wash- 
ington, the country of Lincoln, the country of Franklin, the country of 
Roosevelt, the country of Harding, can any loyal citizen object to the 
work that is being done by our great Mutual Improvement organization ! 
As President Grant has already said, our slogan for this year is on the 
subject of prayer. Like those great statesmen who devised, who 
created, who under divine inspiration wrote the Constitution of the 
United States, we Mutual Improvement workers, one hundred thousand 
strong, today have for our slogan the following: "We Stand for 
Divine Guidance." May we have this guidance, may we be able to 
distinguish the whisperings of the still small voice, may we be able 
to live in accordance with the teachings of the great Master, thus 
placing our trust and confidence in divine providence. If we do this, 
our faith is founded on a rock, it will not, it must not, it cannot fail. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR 

(President of the Granite Stake of Zion.) 

I trust the Lord will inspire the few remarks that I may make 
on this occasion. I was delighted, and my being was thrilled with 
happiness, in the free and inspirational talk that was given this morn- 
ing by our President. While listening to the remarks made, in the 
forenoon session, as well as this afternoon, I felt that I have a duty 
devolving upon me as the president of a stake of' Zion, to carry this 
message back to the people in our stake. It is true that only a .small 
part of the Saints can gather in these conferences. The great mass 
of the people are at home, and the strength and the efficacy of this 
work, in this conference, will be felt, I am sure, if the representatives 
who are gathered here will take the message given, and the spirit 
thereof, to their respective people at home. I feel that I should call the 
priesthood of our stake together and in a humble way impress them 
with the importance and dignity of the messages that we have been 
listening to, and will listen to, during the sessions of this conference. 

I sense very deeply the responsibility that rests upon me as a Lat- 
ter-day Saint, and when I remember the convenants that I have made 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with the Lord, and recognize my membership in this Church, I almost 
tremble in the fear that I am not measuring' up to that which the Lord 
expects of me as a member of this Church. 

As a high priest in the Church, I should live a life that would 
be well worthy of imitation by all the people who live in our midst. 
I would like the high priests in our stake of Zion to cleanse them- 
selves, to purify themselves, and put themselves in harmony with the 
divine will of our Father in heaven, so that they may enjoy every grace, 
gift and power pertaining to their high and holy calling in the Church, 
and stand as watchmen upon the towers of Zion, so that every boy and 
every girl observing their lives, and things that they do before their 
fellow men, can see hope and good cheer, and go on and do the things 
that are pleasing in the sight of God the eternal Father. 

I believe the seventies living in our midst should so order their 
lives that they may enjoy 1 the .spirit of that office and calling, and have 
a desire within their hearts to proclaim the word of the Lord to all who 
will give heed to their warning voice and the testimony that they have 
in their hearts. I realize that right in our wards, in our own commun- 
ities, there are people who. I am sure, are hungering after the word 
of God. When seventies are called to a holy calling, it appears to me that 
they should so order their lives that they may always have within iheir 
hearts and souls, a burning witness of the Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the work that 
we are engaged in, and be in the front ranks always in the purity of 
their lives, in their example, and in delivering the word of the Lord 
that may come to them to bear off this message, both at home and 
abroad, and be magnified in the sight of all men in carrying this message. 

I would like to see the elders in our midst stand as a home guard, 
keeping the commandments of God, and ordering their lives so that 
they also may give hope, courage, and inspiration to their neighbors ; 
that their neighbors may see in the work of the Lord, and in the lives 
of those who hold this holy Priesthood, an example that they will feel 
to follow after, and see in the work of the Lord those things which 
will convince them of its divinity ; and that the children and the peo- 
ple at home, will see the power, the strength, and the inspiration that 
emanate from men who hold the Priesthood of God. 

I know it is pleasing in the sight of the Lord that men who hold 
this Priesthood should magnify it for the salvation of the children of 
men. I hope our boys of the Lesser Priesthood will see in the lives 
and examples of the elders in the Church, something that they can emu- 
late and follow after, as they witness their acts and their deeds in the 
Church ; that they may be led to go on and keep the commandments of 
our eternal Father. I hope that no man who holds the Priesthood 
will ever be a stumbling block to any boy who has a desire in his 
heart to keep the commandments of God. 

After hearing what I have listened to this day, especially from 
the President of the Church, I feel that I want to go back to my 
stake of Zion and try, with all the power that the Lord gives me, to 



ELDER ERANK Y. TAYLOR 



39 



build up our people in the faith of the Church of Jesus Christ, to 
have them keep the commandments and do that which is right in the 
sight of the Lord. 

There was reference made here by one of the brethren to our homes. 
I believe that I need to set my house in order. I believe that the 
people in this Church need to set their houses in order, and that their 
homes should be houses of prayer, where the Scripture is read, where 
the word of God is given, that the boys and girls may grow up under 
the fear of our Father in heaven, and worship him in our homes. I 
think that our auxiliary organizations are doing a wonderful work, 
which is accomplishing great good in the midst of Israel, and yet the 
Lord expects me, and you, as fathers in this Church, to be responsible 
for the faith of our boys and girls. I was pleased with the remarks 
of one of our brethren in speaking of what he termed our "home 
evening." I think we should return to good old principles again, and 
have our homes as places of worship, where the Lord may be exalted 
and his word taught, and the -right example set. I believe that we 
would not have so many of our boys wandering away from the in- 
fluence, touch and power of their fathers, if we would gather them 
close together with us in our homes, more often than we do, and not 
depend too much upon the Mutuals and upon the Sunday schools and 
other organizations. The Lord has said that he will hold us responsi- 
ble for the conduct of our children, and none of us will be held 
blameless unless we do our full duty along the lines of teaching them 
the way of the Lord. Our children are more valuable to us than our 
flocks and our herds, our bank accounts, and the honors of men. No 
man will be honored before God who neglects his children, and he 
will hold us reseponsible as to how we teach and how we are directing 
them. I feel, furthermore, in regard to our home evenings, that in 
these gatherings we ought to have worship of God the eternal Father, 
in view, and they should be occasions when the father can know his 
boy John, and John may know his father ; where the parents may get 
up close to their children, so that there shall be such harmony, peace 
and love, as the Lord intends should exist in our midst. Furthermore, 
I believe that too many of us send our boys to Mutual, too many of 
us send our boys and girls to Sunday school, too many of us send our 
boys and girls to the amusement places, instead of going with them, 
we do not go to chaperon them, to be in touch with them, and find 
out what they are doing. In a measure we could give dignity and grace 
and inspiration to places of this kind if the fathers and mothers would 
put aside their earthly affairs and mingle more with their loved ones. 
In the future we should then have, growing up in the Church, glorious 
and well behaved boys, and beautiful and amenable girls, who would 
glorify the work of the Lord. May the blessings of our Father in 
heaven abide with us, that we may accomplish his purposes. May we 
return to our stakes and wards, carrying to our membership, the mes- 
sage of our inspired leader who stands as the representative of God 
upon the earth, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER SAMUEL W. PARKINSON 

{President of the Franklin Stake of Zion) 

If I survive this shock, I .shall he very grateful. President Grant 
has afforded me a great honor, and also has placed upon me a great 
responsibility. I humbly pray that the few moments I may occupy I 
shall enjoy the Spirit of the Lord. I have indeed enjoyed the proceed- 
ings of the conference thus far. I have been coming to conference for 
many years, I think it will date back thirty or thirty-five years. I have 
attended conferences and have listened to the prophets of the Lord, 
and I assure you that my testimony has been strengthened. Indeed, 
I might say, I have received a testimony in listening to the prophets of 
the Lord explain the plan of life and salvation. It is a great opportunity 
to come and behold the wonderful sight that is before me on this oc- 
casion. I feel very grateful for it, to come into this wonderful tab- 
ernacle and be associated with men and women of the Lord, the 
leading authorities of the Church, and to listen to the beautiful music 
furnished by this world-renowned choir. 

I remember the dedicatorial services of the temple, thirty years 
ago, when President Woodruff was president of the Church ; he stood 
out on the platform and said : "Attention, all Israel. We are about 
to dedicate this temple to the Lord." I remember going into the 
temple and listening to those services, and I want to bear you my 
testimony, at this time, that, although I was only a boy, I obtained 
a testimony, in that temple, of the divinity of "Mormonism." I have 
tried to keep a close touch with the Church from that time until the 
present, and I feel proud, and rejoice to know that I am a member 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I rejoice to know 
that we have such great men and women at the head of this Church, 
men who are gifted, men and women who are qualified to advise us 
in the ways that we should go. My testimony unto you this afternoon 
is that Toseph Smith was and is a Prophet of the Lord, and that Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant is a prophet, seer and revelator unto this people. It 
is my desire to carry out the instructions of the authorities of the 
Church. T feel proud that I have been called to preside over the Frank- 
lin stake of Zion, in Idaho, one of the youngest stakes in the Church. 
T feel proud of this calling, and it is my purpose and my desire at 
all times, to carry back to the people the counsel and instructions that 
are delivered to us in these conferences, regarding their duties in the 
Church. May the Lord bless us and help us to magnify our callings, 
is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER Q. HALE 

(President of the Boise Stake of Zion.) 

I have been thrilled beyond adequate expression by the instruc- 
tion and the inspiration of this conference. The address of Pres- 



ELDER HEBER Q. HALE 



41 



ident Grant, in our opening session, seemed to affect me more deeply 
than I have been touched by anything I have ever heard from his 
lips. I know that he speaks with divine authority and that he stands 
at the head of the Church upon the earth as the representative of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

President Penrose referred to the commandments of God as stand- 
ing out before us in black and white, which, fortunately for us, is true. 
This statement brought to my mind, however, a wish that all of life's 
problems might stand out as black and white before our eyes, that we 
might be able to differentiate clearly between the right and the wrong, 
the true and the false, as we differentiate and recognize the lines of 
demarcation between black and white. But, alas, too often life's 
problems present themselves as a mingling of the two as shades ot 
gray, and it is sometimes quite impossible to determine, with our 
natural minds, where the black leaves off and the white begins. 

One has said that it is given to every man to know so much as 
whether or not he knows. To know a thing, it must be made compre- 
hensible and convincing to our understanding. In the solution of 
such problems as 1 refer to, we need human intelligence plus some- 
thing else, namely : the light of the Holy Ghost. To him who has been 
baptized by authority, following his sincere faith and repentance, is 
given the championship of the Holy Ghost as a light to his path, 
illumination to his mind, and warmth to his soul. It is true that fires 
will not burn except they have fuel, whether they be fires of love, 
fires of industry, fires of achievement, or fires of holy zeal. These 
fires must be fed that they might burn. Those who receive the Holy 
Ghost should cultivate and encourage the Spirit, that light might be 
thrown upon their path, that their way may be made clear, that 
their minds may be illuminated, and that they may clearly differentiate 
between right and wrong. Keep the fires burning within your souls ; 
do not let them go out ; for remember, you cannot rekindle ashes. 

Dr. Widtsoe's interesting reference to truth brought to my mind 
something I read a few years ago to the effect that as air, fuel, and 
water, in proper proportions are necessary to sustain the body, so 
inspiration, truth and purpose, in equally proper proportions, are 
necessary to sustain the mind. As we reason upon this hypothesis 
we can readily reach, I think, three safe deductions: first, that inspir- 
ation with insufficient truth and purpose means lack of common sense, — 
insanity. It means a light without organizing truth and without 
a directing hand to make it applicable to the utility of life. Secondly, 
truth without sufficient inspiration and purpose gives to the world 
its mere theorists, its pedants ; men who have fine theoretical con- 
ceptions, and yet without the practicality of their application to the needs 
of every day. Thirdly, purpose with scant inspiration and truth gives 
us our mere dreamers ; men who project fine conceptions, but never 
reach a conclusion ; men who are going somewhere always, but never 
arrive. P>ut the infallible outcome of inspiration, truth and purpose 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



properly compounded by the hand of work, always brings personal 
power, achievement, success, wether it be in temporal or spiritual 
things. 

Our light may be a little one. but we must make it shine. The 
crying need of the hour is for us to do the very best we can with 
what we have and what we are. We must have confidence and faith 
in ourselves. We should see to it that we have confidence and faith 
in our brethren, and in our Church and in our God. As necsesary 
as these things are. it is likewise important that we should so con- 
duct ourselves that our fellowmen and our God can have faith and 
confidence in us. 

I know with all my soul that my heavenly Father lives ; that his 
Son Jesus Christ is my Redeemer ; that he came to earth, that he 
marked the way, that he died on Calvary's hill, and redeemed a fallen 
world, and that he opened the door for the resurrection of the dead, 
as an actuality and not a mere belief. 

In the language of another, may I say : 

I asked an angel for some motto sweet, 
Some rule of life by which to guide my feet ; 
I asked and paused : he answered soft and low : 
"God's will to know!" 

Will knowlege, then, suffice, dear angel. I cried. 
But ere the question into silence died 
The answer came: Nay, this remember, too: 
"God's will to do!" 

Once more I asked : "Is there more slill lo tell" ? 
And once again the answer sweetly fell : 
"Yea, this one thing all other things above : 
"God's will to love!" 

Oh, that we may love God's will and thereby be led to know his 
will and carry on to do his will, that through us his will may be done 
on earth as it is done in heaven, that his kingdom may come, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN 

(President of the Alpine Stake of Zion.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I rejoice greatly in the spirit of 
the meetings of this conference, thus far ; and my spirit and feeling 
have been in accord with the principes of the gospel and the testimonies 
that have been borne by those who have spoken. 1 hope and trust that 
I may be able to stand true and faithful to the covenants I have made, 
that I may always be found sustaining those who preside over me 
in the Church ; that in the stake of Zion where I have been called to 



ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN

preside, my life be such that it will not be a stumbling block to 
the members of the Church, but that it will be an inspiration, and 
help them to roll on the work which the Lord has established in this 
Church. 

I was impressed with one of the subjects that was asked and 
outlined for our consideration in the Parents' class of our Sunday 
school: "Wherein are we different from the people of the world?" 
It is a great subject, an important subject to the Latter-day Saints. 
The organization of the Church of Jesus Christ is a striking feature 
in which we are different from the people of the world. There is 
nothing like it in all the world. The Word of Wisdom was spoken of 
here by our President this morning. If the Latter-day Saints could 
live in harmony with that law and uphold the Word of Wisdom among 
the people, what a power this people would have in the world ! We would 
certainly be different from many of the people of the world. When 
we speak of the law of tithing, the means by which the Church is sup- 
ported, the method that we have of receiving and disbursing the tithes 
of the people, oh, how different from the people of the world! And 
when we speak of our marital relations, being united together in the 
bonds of matrimony by the authority of God, which binds on earth and 
in heaven, I say again, we are different from the world. May we, my 
brethren and sisters, let our light so shine before the world that they 
may see the good works of this people and be led to glorify his name. 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang "Do what is right.'' 

Elder Allen Park, president of the Gunnison stake, offered the 

closing prayer, and the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, Saturday 

morning. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

Meeting opened at 10 o'clock a. m., Saturday, October 6, 1923. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The opening hymn was sung by the choir and congregation, "Guide 
us, O thou great Jehovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder George E. Browning, president of 
the Weber stake of Zion. 

A sacred solo was sung by Mrs. J. E. Ellsworth, "Come, ye 
blessed of my Father." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, as I respond to the 
call of the President to occupy this position for a short time. I earn- 
estly pray that I may have aid and assistance from our Father, in 
the hope that I may be able to say something under his inspiration 
that will be of some value to us in our great work. 

ACHIEVEMENTS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 

I am sure that we have all been impressed with the thought that 
we cannot celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the memorable 
event which brought to us the great volume of Scripture which lies 
largely at the basis of our work, without contemplating the achieve- 
ments of the Lord's prophet, Joseph Smith. I do not desire to be 
extravagant or to go beyond the bounds of plain, safe statement of 
truth, when I say that no other man who has lived since the time of 
the Redeemer, has made such a contribution to the philosophy, the 
enlarged conception, and the righteousness of civilization and the 
world, as did the Prophet Joseph Smith. That, perhaps was to be 
expected, since it was through his instrumentality that the gospel ot 
Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. I do not claim that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith brought to us new things, or original ideas in great 
abundance because he restored rather than originated the conceptions 
of life, which constitute the theology of the holy gospel. What he 
did also, was to interpret and construe the gospel so that it touches all 
the affairs of life, and weaves itself into the fabric and tissue of all 
life and civilization. 

A REMARKABLE CONCEPTION OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT. 

Among the large contributions which Joseph Smith made was 
that remarkable conception of civil government which he gave to 
the world, for it was he who emphasized, if he did not first teach. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



45 



the doctrine that all governments are instituted of God for the benefit 
of men ; and it was he who first plainly declared — assuming that some 
attention had been given to the same thought before — that the Con- 
stitution of the great land in which we live came from the inspiration 
of God through men who were raised up for the purpose of estab- 
lishing it as an instrument of government. I have always been grate- 
ful for these conceptions of government and I have felt in recent 
years that until the great ideas of government which he promulgated 
among this nation find their place more securely and firmly in the 
minds and hearts of the citizenship of this country, America will 
never achieve her great destiny and will never be what she was in- 
tended to be, the beacon light of liberty and freedom and civil right- 
eousness to all the world. 

My attention has recently been directed, by my colleague, 
Brother Richard R. Lyman, to a book which is off the press but a 
few months, in which the author, Mr. Clarence True Wilson, sets 
forth rather more clearly than I have ever seen it stated before, the 
conception of government which has been taught in this Church for 
nearly a hundred years. The author points out that for more than 
thirty years he has studied all the works which have been written 
upon the Constitution of this country, the influences which brought 
it about, and the influences exercised upon its framers, which culmin- 
ated in the form and plan of government which find expression in 
that great document. He says that never in all his research has he 
discovered a single author who attributes the Constitution to the in- 
fluence of the Bible and God. He points out that some contend that 
influences derived from the Assyrian, the Babylonian, the Greek, and 
the Roman attempts at Republican government found their expres- 
sion in this great document. 

INFLUENCE OF THE BIBLE ON THE CONSTITUTION. 

He .says that most commentaries on the Constitution pay homage 
to the influence of the common law of England and the English 
experiment in free government, but in no works on this great docu- 
ment does he find a single expression which indicates that it was the 
Holy Bible, the scriptures of the Lord, which furnished the founda- 
tion for this great instrument of government, and yet, says he, the 
Bible is the only book with which all the framers of the Constitu- 
tion were intimately familiar. It was the book which they had read 
from their childhood to their maturity. It was the book from which 
they learned their spelling; it was the book from which they learned 
their English, it was their thief literature; and he asks this question: 
"Is it not reasonable, natural and logical, to draw the inference that 
it was the influence of the Scriptures of the Lord wnich permeated 
the hearts and the minds of those patriotic men in the formulation 
of the greatest instrument, which Gladstone says, ever fell from the 
pen of man?" Time will not permit to make anything like an analy- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ticai comparison between the fundamental institutions of our govern- 
ment, as they were esablished in the Constitution, and the Hebrew gov- 
ernment which was established under the hand of God, and which pre- 
vailed for so many centuries under his divine guidance. It might 
be said, however, in a moment, that there is not a single fundamental 
institution of this country, ordained and established under the Con- 
stitution, that does not have something like a counterpart in the Israel- 
itish form of government which prevailed prior to the time of the 
coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 

I SHALL MENTION BUT A FEW ITEMS 

There has been no king in this country. Do you know that 
Washington was upon several occasions requested, almost demanded, 
to assume the role of king, for that was the form of government which 
was best known to those who established this one. He persistently 
declined, and the makers of our Constitution saw the wisdom of his 
action. They recognized too that kings and the so-called divine 
right of kings, were not compatible with the great spirit of liberty 
and democracy which was to underly the structure of our government. 
Does it not seem somewhat significant that in the Israelitish form of 
government, for a period of four hundred and seventy years, there 
were no kings to rule in Israel, in spite of the repeated demands of 
the people for a king, that they might be like other nations. They 
were told that God was their king, and, that no king should rule 
them so long as they subscribed to the great principles of truth and 
righteousness which the Lord had laid down for them to follow. 

Then, too, in the Israelitish form of government there were 
no class distinctions. It is true that there was the order of the Priest- 
hood, and that the priesthood exercised righteous authority over the 
people, but class distinctions were absolutely forbidden. 

The twelve tribes were united together for governmental pur- 
poses, and so our thirteen colonies were united. 

I wish I had the time to show how the ten commandments have 
lain at the basis and foundation of substantially all our penal law. 
There is not one of them which has not been in some way or other 
enacted into the laws of the States of the Lnion. 

So might be pointed out, if time would permit, a large list and 
line of comparisons which establish a very close relation between the 
government which predominated during the time that the children of 
Israel were governed by their judges, and the government established 
here. I wonder how many know that in that form of government 
which prevailed in olden times, there were three departments which 
are comparable to our three departments of government, namely, the 
legislative, the executive and the judicial. Perhaps it is not generally 
understood that the judiciary held supremacy in the old time as in 
reality it holds supremacy now. For while the three departments of 
government are usually said to be co-ordinate, every student of our 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



47 



institutions knows that it is the Supreme court of the United States 
which has the last word to say with reference to the interpretation 
of law and its enforcibility in this country. Time will not permit 
further detail, but there is abundant evidence to warrant the con- 
clusion that the fathers drew liberally on their knowledge of, and 
training in, the Hebrew scripture, in building the democracy of the 
New World. 

how the Principles of this government can endure. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I state these points of comparison 
and draw your attention to these things for this purpose — we all love 
this country, we love America, we want the principles of government 
which we espouse to endure. I ask this question : Will these princi- 
ples of government endure? Is the Constitution safe for the future, 
and for the generations to come ? 

I answer the question in this way, that the Constitution and the 
sacred principles which it unfolds in the form of government, will 
endure if the people of America will subscribe to and defend and 
uphold the fundamental principles of religious righteousness upon 
which it is built, and not otherwise. Righteousness, in its last 
analysis, is a religious term. God is the author of righteousness. The 
f ramers of laws have, to a large extent, recognized that doctrine. 
The gospel is the compilation, the aggregation of all principles of 
righteousness, and into the form of government which we uphold and 
support there has been woven the principles of individual and com- 
munity righteousness which are underlain by truth which emanates 
from God himself. You can't have a good government without good 
people, and goodness is a religious term. Much as many of our phil- 
osophers would contend that it is to be defined in terms only of 
ethics, and of social convention and understanding, I maintain that 
all true morality is supported by and finds its basis in religion, and 
we cannot hope in this country of ours to sustain the great Con- 
stitution — and you know that that is a matter of much concern now — 
unless we adopt into our lives those principles of civic righteousness 
and of morality and of truth which underly it. I wish that could 
be said to the whole people. I am just as thoroughly convinced that 
there is a dependence upon our Father in heaven for the carrying 
forward of the great principles of government, which we espouse in 
this nation, as I am that our own work depends upon his pravidem ; 
and his protection and his guidance. 

the principles of this government a part of the gospel. 

Indeed I regard these great principles of government as a part 
of the blessed gospel that God has given to his children, and so we 
must sustain them. To us is committed the obligation and the op- 
portunity of maintaining these great principles of righteousness in 
their undiluted truth and beauty. We must conserve them, we must 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



preserve them for the generations to come. America must not fall 
from the standards of truth and righteousness that underly the struc- 
ture of her government. 

So, I say to you that Joseph Smith has made the greatest contri- 
bution toward proper conception of civic government that has ever 
jbeen given by any man in all these years of history. We are in- 
debted to him, so are all our fellow citizens though they know it not. 

Do we love America? Why! We worship the sacred principles 
upon which America and her government stand. There are no truer 
Americans, there are no Americans who have a broader, more com- 
prehensive view of the righteousness of government, than do the 
Latter-day Saints, and I make the statement with deliberation, know- 
ing that it is true. 

God bless us that we may keep these sacred principles inviolate, 
sustain the government, engender respect for law, and uphold the 
mighty Constitution, that lies at the basis of all our institutions. We 
could repeat with propriety the prayer of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in the Kirtland temple, which prayer, he said, was given by revela- 
tion from God : 

"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth ; have 
mercy upon the rulers of our land ; may the principles, which were 
so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, 
by our fathers, be established forever.'" — Doc. & Cov. 109 :54. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Wherever I go among the Latter-day Saints, as my duty calls 
me, meeting them in the various wards and stakes and in the missions, 
I find them imbued with a spirit of deep earnestness, hopefulness, 
confidence, trust and faith, mingled with concern and serious thought. 
They are happy : nevertheless, their happiness is more than levity, 
for in their rejoicing there is thoughtfulness and deep interest as to 
their present and future. 

We rejoice that the work of God is progressing, that through the 
ages "one unceasing purpose runs" ; that all that is past has been in 
preparation for that that now is, and is for that which is to come; that 
there was a beginning, even as there shall be an end, to this particular 
phase of the Lord's purposes concerning his children. 

THE PURPOSE IN THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 

The earth was created primarily for the carrying out of the divine 
purposes respecting man. The astronomer regards it as one of the 
stellar units ; the geologist looks upon it as the field for his investiga- 
tion ; but beyond such conceptions we regard it as one of the many 
spheres created with definite purpose, in which (he destiny of the 
human race is the chief element and was the principal concern of the 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



49 



Creator, in bringing it into existence. We read, as the Lord revealed 
unto his friend and servant, Abraham, that before the earth was 
framed the Creator and those immediately associated with him looked 
out into space and said : We will take of these materials, and we will 
make an earth whereon these unembodied .spirits may dwell ; and we 
will prove them herewith, to see if they will do whatsoever the Lord 
their God shall command them. 

CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EARTH AND MAN 

Now, that being the purpose for which this world was created, 
we can readily understand that there is a very close relationship between 
earth and man. We read that when the transgression in Eden was 
passed upon by the voice of judgment the Lord said unto Adam : 
"Cursed is the ground for thy sake ; * * * Thorns also and thistles 
shall it bring forth to thee ; * * * In the sweat of thy face shalt thou 
eat bread." 

This seemingly dire pronouncement would be nothing but fiction 
did it not mean that a great change came upon the earth itself under 
the curse: and the Scriptures reveal a very significant relationship 
between the development of earth processes and that of mankind. 
Tndeed the earth has been personified. Righteous Enoch, we are 
told, regarded it as a being conscious and sentient, for we read: 

"And it came to pass that Enoch looked 1 upon the .earth; and he heard 
a voice from the bowels thereof,, saying: Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; 
I am pained, I am weary, because of the wickedness of my children. When 
shall T rest, and be cleansed from the filthiness which is gone forth out of 
me? When will my Creator sanctify me that T may rest, and righteous- 
ness for a season abide upon my face?" (Moses 7:48). 

Following further revelation unto this prophet and seer, concern- 
ing the then future development of the human race and the purposes of 
God concerning such, he cried out in anguish to the Lord: "When 
shall the earth rest?" Tt was then shown unto him. that the resurrected 
Christ would return to the earth in a dispensation to be known as 
the last, the dispensation of fulness and restitution ; and that he, the 
Lord, would inaugurate the millennial reign of peace. "And the day 
shall come that the earth shall rest, but before that dav the heavens 
shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth ; and 
the heavens shall shake, and also the earth ; and great tribulations shall 
he among the children of men, but my people will I preserve." 

Has it not been made known unto us that we may sanctify the earth 
or defile it according to our acts? There is a close connection be- 
tween the righteousness or sinfulness of mankind and the occurrence of 
natural phenomena, benign or malignant as we regard them, good 
or bad, -preserving or destroying as the case may be. Now the gross 
materialist may say there is no relationship between the righteousness 
of man and earthquakes, or between man's probity and floods. But 
there is ! i ,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



MAN AND EARTHLY PHENOMENA 

Touching this matter, I read to you my own words, including 
scriptural citations, spoken on an earlier occasion : We learn from 
Scripture that Adam's transgression brought about a fallen condition, 
not of mankind alone, but likewise of the earth itself. In this and in 
numerous other epochal events, wherein the direct interposition of 
Divine action is affirmed, nature is seen to be in intimate relation 
with man. 

Thus the sins of mankind may produce calamity in the form of 
destructive phenomena, which we may properly call natural because 
deserved ; and human righteousness may invoke peaceful and benefi- 
cent cooperation of the elements. 

''Cursed is the ground for thy sake" was the Divine fiat to the 
first man. In contrast, note the assurance given to Israel that by 
faithfulness the seasons should be made propitious, that nurturing 
rains should come, bringing such harvests that the people would lack 
room to store their products. (See Mai. 3:8-12). 

Abject apostasy from the laws of God in Xoah's time brought 
about the Deluge, in which "were all the fountains of the great deep 
broken up, and the windows [more properly flood-gatesj of heaven 
were opened.'' 

Enoch, who lived before Noah, was sent to proclaim repentance 
to the degenerate race, and so great was the power and authority vested 
in him that "he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, 
and the mountains fled, even according to his command ; and the 
rivers of water were turned out of their course." He foresaw the 
coming of the Xoachian flood, and the events of history, including the 
Savior's ministry, down to the days of the Lord's second advent, when 
"the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover 
the earth ; and the heavens shall - shake, and also the earth." 
(Moses 7:13, 61). 

As a fit setting for the tragedy on Calvary, a pall of darkness 
fell about the place, and. when the crucified Lord expired, "the earth 
did quake, and the rocks rent." (Matt. 27:51). 

DISRUPTION SIGNALIZED THE SAVIOR'S DEATH 

On the Western Continent, widespread disruption signalized the 
Savior's death : and destruction befell the wicked who had flouted 
prophetic warnings and inspired admonitions to repentance. Many 
of the Nephites had forgotten the signs and wonders by which the faci 
of the Lord's birth had been made known, and had fallen into abom- 
inable wickedness. Then, at the time of the crucifixion, great and 
terrible tempests broke over the land, with thunderings, lightnings, 
and both elevations and depressions of the earth's crust, so that moun- 
tains were sundered, and many cities destroyed by earthquake, fire, 
and the inrush of the sea. For three hours the unprecedented holo- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



51 



caust continued; and then thick darkness fell, in which it was found 
impossible to kindle a fire. The awful gloom was like unto the dark- 
ness of Egypt in that its clammy vapors could be felt. This condition 
lasted until the third day, so that a night a day and a night were as 
one unbroken night; and the impenetrable blackness was rendered the 
more terrible by the wailing of the people, whose heartrending refrain 
was everywhere the same : "O that we had repented before this great 
and terrible day!" Then, piercing the darkness, a Voice was heard, 
proclaiming that destruction had befallen the people because of wick- 
edness, and that those who had lived to hear were the more righteous 
of the inhabitants, to whom hope was offered on condition of more 
thorough repentance and reformation. (3 Nephi, Chap. 8). 

MODERN PROPHECY ON THE SUBJECT 

As was foreseen, aye, and foretold, by the Christ himself and by 
his prophets who lived before his mortal birth and by those who lived 
after, in the earlier ages, and by the prophets of the present dispensa- 
tion, great destruction has come and shall come upon the earth because 
of the sins of the human race. In section 88 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, that section known unto us as the "Olive Leaf" as named 
by the prophet who received the word from the Lord and gave it unto 
the people in 1832, December 27, it is thus declared : 

"For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and 
fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to 
give light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and the stars shall be- 
come exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that 
falleth from off a fig-tree. 

"And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the 
people. 

"For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that 
shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground 
and shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the 
voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and 1 the voice of the 
waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts 
shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people." 

THE RECENT CALAMITY IN JAPAN 

What has been called the greatest calamity in history is fresh 
in our minds. Hundreds of thousands of human beings have lost 
their lives in the great seismic disturbances in Japan. I have only to 
say that the occurrence of such earthquakes is in accordance with 
predictions. The Lord forbid that I should assume to pass judgment 
upon those who are immediately affected, upon those who have lost 
their lives through such catastrophies. It is beyond the wisdom of 
men to correctly deduce resuhs bv applying general laws or causes to 
individual cases ; and whenever the judgments of the Lord are per- 
mitted to fall upon the earth and upon i f s inhabitants, there are many 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the innocent who suffer with the guilty. Many go down who are 
not personally culpable and who are not directly responsible for that 
which has come. 

RIGHTEOUS AND CULPABLE SUFFER TOGETHER 

We know the Lord does permit these calamities to come upon 
those who, according to our means of judgment and powers of 
analysis, may not have deserved the fate, but death, remember, is not 
finality. It is that which follows death with which we should have 
concern. Many are allowed to die in tempest and earthquake, whose 
death is but a passage into the blessed realms, because they are deserv- 
ing of blessings; while unto others death does come as a judgment; 
and the Lord knows who fall because of their sins and who are per- 
mitted to fall because of their righteousness. 

We have an instance in point concerning the connection of afflic- 
tion and distress with individual culpability. You remember the Lord 
and his apostles once came to a blind beggar upon the street near the 
temple gates; "And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did 
sin. this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?" 

Incidentally let us note that those who asked that question had an 
understanding of premortal existence, for surely the man could not 
have sinned in the flesh and brought upon him blindness at birth as 
a result. But the explanation given by the Lord is the important point 
for us to consider: "Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, 
nor his parents ; but that the works of God should be made manifest 
in him." The Lord's purposes were worked out in the case, for the 
man was healed, and the instance stands as a testimony for or against 
those who have become acquainted with the circumstance. 

Incident to a period of cruel intolerance in religious matters among 
the aboriginal people of this continent, we read that evil-hearted perse- 
cutors put to death many women and children by burning, thinking 
that bv this means they could terrify the rest intol a denial of) their faith. 
The Prophets Alma and Amulek. were forced to witness the awful 
scenes. Though themselves in bonds they were brought there to witness 
the agony of the victims ; and Amulek with zeal and righteous indigna- 
tion desired fo invoke the power of God to save those innocent suf- 
ferers : "P>ut Alma said unto him : The Spirit constraineth me that I 
must not stretch forth mine hand ; for behold the Lord receiveth them 
up unto himself, in glory ; and he doth suffer that they may do this 
thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to 
the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exer- 
cise upon them in his wrath may be just ; and the blood of the innocent 
shall stand as a witness against them, vea, and crv mightily against 
them at the last day." (Alma 14:11). 

NATIONS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS HELD TO ACCOUNT 

The Lord deals with individuals; and salvation is an individual 
affair; but, nevertheless, he deals also with nations, for he is the God 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



53 



of nations, which are set up or put down, are preserved or destroyed, 
according to their fitness ; and all this is done in the Lord's due time 
and way. "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord," sang the 
psalmist. "Righteousness exalteth a nation ; but sin is a reproach to 
any people," declared the author of the book of Proverbs. 

It has been pointed out that a distinguishing feature of the last 
days and of the imminence of the second coming of Christ would be 
the proclaiming of the gospel amongst all nations. "And this gospel of 
the kingdom 1 shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all 
nations ; and then shall the end come," said the Lord himself in the 
flesh on the very eve of his great sacrifice. So also in these latter- 
days the Lord has made plain the fact that nations shall be held to 
account. In a commandment to the elders of his Church, given in 
February, 1831, and recorded in section 43, he said: 

"Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, 
both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the 
great day of the Lord; 

"For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and' call upon you to 
repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the 
thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the 
ears of all that live, saying — Repent, and prepare for the great day of the 
Lord? 

"Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east 
unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make 
the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words — Repent ye, for the great 
day of the Lord is come? 

"And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: 
Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the word's of that God who 
made you. 

"O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you to- 
gether as a hen gathereth her chickpns under her wings, but ye would not! 

"How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by 
the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of 
thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, 
and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice 
of famines and pestilences of .every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, 
and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, 
and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!" 

In another revelation, section 84, we read : 

"For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations to scourge 
them for their wickedness. 

"And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth 
until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness — 

"Until all shall know me, who remain, even from the least unto the 
greatest, and shall be filled with knowledge of the Lord." 

Yet further: 

"And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth 
shall mourn, and with famine and plague and earthquake and the thunder 
of heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of 
the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of

an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made the full end of 
all nations. (87:6). 

Now, I do not believe in trying to explain away the words of 
God that predict calamity, but are nevertheless full of assurance unto 
the righteous, be it a righteous man or a righteous nation. We should 
awaken to their dread import. The Lord is dealing with the nations 
of the earth, and his Spirit has departed in large measure from nations 
that have defied him and his commandments, and as a result, they, 
being left largely to themselves, war with one another, and seek all 
means by which they can destroy one another most expeditiously. 
'Now, the Lord is not the author of these evil things ; the nations are 
bringing these inflictions upon themselves, and there shall be a consum- 
mation brought about as the Lord hath decreed, which shall mean 
an end of all nations as such, if they will not observe the law and the 
commandments of the Lord their God. 

THE WAV OF ESCAPE 

Is there any way of escape? Yes, there is. The Lord sent word 
by his prophets unto the wicked city of Nineveh, and the cry was 
raised in her streets: "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be over- 
thrown." Then from the king upon his throne, down to the beggar 
in the streets, the people wailed because of their wickedness, and 
opened their hearts to the warning voice. They fasted and prayed, 
and confessed their sins before the Lord, and Jonah, the prophet who 
had been sent unto them, looked on to witness the destruction of the 
city, and seemed indeed to be disappointed because he was denied a 
view of the spectacle he awaited. But the Lord reasoned with the 
prophet in this wise : The people have turned to me, and have 
repented of their sins. Shall I- destroy them when they have turned 
unto me? 

Even now, if the nations will turn unto the Lord it shall be 
unto them as it was unto Nineveh — they shall be spared ; but if they 
will not, then the Lord will permit the predicted judgments to come 
upon them until they are brought to a realization of the fact that they 
do depend upon the Lord (Sod of heaven and of earth. The forces 
of nature are co-operating- and are permitted to wreak destruction and 
the end is not yet. Latter-day Saints, remember the admonition of 
the Lord: "Stand ye in holy places," and we cannot do that unless we 
are holy. "Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved," but await 
the working out of the Lord's purposes, the while living lives of 
righteousness and crying repentance unto the people of the world. 

the time of Christ's advent is near 

This is the day of consummation, and the coming of the Lord is 
nearer than we are willing to admit. Let us not seek to set times or 
dates, for such we are told shall never be made known until the. day ot 
the Lord's coming : not even the angels in heaven are to know before- 



'ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



time. Therefore, away with all attempts to fix times for the Lord. 
But he has told us that the time of his advent is near ; and it is over 
a hundred years nearer than it was when he spake first to his prophet 
in this dispensation. I pray that we be prepared, and that we be found 
ready for the consummation of the ages, the coming of the Lord in his 
might and majesty to rule and reign. I ask this in his name, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I feel dependent this morning upon the Spirit of the Lord to 
guide me. in what I shall say. Nor is this an uncommon feeling, 
for when I stand before the people I have a spirit of timidity and feel 
my weakness. 

EVENTS OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO 

A number of the speakers have referred to topics in relation 
to those most important events which occurred one hundred years 
ago, and I desire to add one or two thoughts in this direction. In 
the year 1820, when the declaration was made to Joseph Smith by 
the Father and the Son that the truth was about to be restored, that 
youth was fourteen years of age. Nevertheless his story created 
a good deal of consternation and ridicule in the world, and brought 
upon him much criticism, and even persecution. It seems to the 
world a strange thing, and an impossible thing, that the Lord would 
call upon a youth, inexperienced, untrained, lacking in the education 
of the world, to stand at the head of any great marvelous work ; and 
also a very strange thing that any one with such a common name 
as Joseph Smith should be called. When the elders go forth to preach 
the Gospel, and bear witness and testimony to the truth of his words, 
the people, in ridicule, state : "Surely the Lord would not call upon 
anyone by that name. It is so common.'' It did not have even 
the aristocratic "y" in it. (Smyth). I suppose the Lord desired to try 
the faith of the people, at any rate we do know that his ways are not 
the ways of men. Perhaps, if Joseph Smith had been named Martin 
Luther, or John Calvin, or John Knox, or John Wesley, or some other 
John, it might have had more weight with the disbelieving world. 
But to be an ordinary, common, every-day Smith was more than they 
could stand. And yet this is the way the Lord works. The world, I 
suppose, has an idea that anyone with such a name, if he has any 
qualifications whatever, those qualifications would be what the name 
might suggest — the qualificatons of brawn and muscle, and not of 
spirituality and intelligence. 

JOSEPH smith's contrirution to spiritual thought 

It has been stated here this morning that Joseph Smith gave 
to the world the greatest contribution in civil government that the 
world has ever known since the days of our Redeemer, and I can 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testify that likewise he has added, or given a contribution to the world 
in spiritual thought, and religious government, that is greater than 
anything that has been given to the world since the days of our 
Redeemer. 

No matter if his name is common, the youth, young and un- 
educated, and untrained in the things of the world, I am fully in 
accord with the expressions and sentiment, recorded in that beautiful 
hymn by President John Taylor, one verse of which I shall read 
because it appeals to me, and we so seldom hear it sung. 

"Of noble seed, of heavenly birth, 

He came to bless the sons of earth; 

With keys by the Almighty given, 

He opened the full rich stores of heaven; 

O'er the world that was wrapped in sable night, 

Like the sun, he spread his golden light; 

He strove, O, how he strove to stay 

The stream of crime in its reckless way; 

With a mighty mind and a noble aim, 

He urged the wayward to reclaim: 

'Mid foaming billows of angry strife, 

He stood at the helm of the ship of life." 

And so I recognize him as the one who stood by appointment 
of the Lord Jesus Christ at the helm of the ship of life, possessed 
of the Priesthood, clothed in power and authority to establish the 
work of the Lord for the last time, that men might be brought 
to repentance, might have the opportunity, the privilege of embracing 
righteousness and truth and finding salvation in the kingdom of God. 

WITNESSES TESTIFY TO JOSEPiLS WONDERFUL MANIFESTATIONS 

Now just one other thought: If this young man bad come before 
the world declaring his testimony, bearing witness to the wonderful 
manifestations of the power of the Lord as made known to him 
in marvelous vision, and had stood alone, then there might be some 
question raised in regard to that statement or testimony ; but in keeping 
with the work of the Lord and the promises that he has made from 
the beginning that all things shall be established by witnesses, others 
were called to testify, to bear witness with Joseph Smith that the 
things of which he spoke and of which they spoke were true. 

ANCIENT PROPHECY FULFILLED 

In the revelations given anciently by a prophet of the Lord who 
lived upon this continent, the promise was made that the word of the 
Lord, as recorded in that early day, should be preserved to come forth 
in this age of the world's history as a testimony unto the world thai 
God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. Nephi says of that which he 
wrote and that which should be written by the prophet succeeding him : 

"Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as 
long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



57 



pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged 
of them according to the words which are written. 

''For we labor diligently to write, to persaude our children, and also 
our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we 
know that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do. . . . 

"And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, 
we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies that our 
children may know to what source they may look for a remission of 
their sins." 

And then still prophesying in relation to these things which are 
written Nephi says: 

"Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the word's of 
the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good 
will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word 
of God!" 

Again, in relation to this record, he says: 

"And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto 
you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have 
slumbered. 

"And behold 1 the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a 
revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending 
thereof. 

"Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things 
which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and 
abominations of the people. Wherefore the book shall be kept from them." 

And we may judge that we are still living in the days of wickedness 
and ahomination, because the things which were sealed have not yet 
been delivered to the world, nor have they been delivered to the mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In relation to 
this matter. Mormon writes, as we find it in the 26th Chapter of the 
Third Book of Nephi, as follows : 

"And when they," that is, the people who live now, "shall have 
received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their 
faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall 
the greater things be made manifest unto them. 

"And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall 
the greater things be withheld from them, unto their condemnation." 

ARE WE PREPARED FOR NEW REVELATION? 

We have not prepared ourselves yet to receive the things which 
were sealed, and which the prophet was not privileged to interpret 
and to publish — to our condemnation, to our shame, and to the con- 
demnation of all the world. To our shame, I say, because we have 
not learned through our study, our faith and our perseverance, these 
lesser things which have been given and have been revealed, contained 
in the record now made manifest to us, known as the Book of Mormon, 
and it behooves us as Latter-day Saints to follow the counsels, the 
advice, and the teachings of the gospel as revealed in this record and 
in other records. These letters referred to by President Grant, given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith from the Lord, contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, we must study, master that which they con-

tain ; thai is, make it a part of our lives, and keep the commandments, 
and live in accord with every word that has been revealed from the 
mouth of God, and if we will not do it, those other things cannot 
be given unto us — to our condemnation. 

Oh my brethren and sisters, let us keep the commandments of tht 
Lord, honor him and his word, be faithful and endure in all things to 
the end, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 

I have been attending conference in this tabernacle pretty regularly 
since the year 1867. That is fifty-six years. 1 can «ay with entire 
sincerity that, during all those years I never attended a better opening 
service of the conference than we had yesterday forenoon, which was 
the opening session of this conference. Never was the power of presi- 
dency, the power and spirit of the Holy Ghost, the power of God, 
made more plainly manifest to the congregation of the Saints than in 
that meeting yesterday morning. So, also, in each of our meetings we 
have had a rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord. 

As Latter-day Saints, we are not by any means what we ought to 
be in respect to living our religion, and keeping the commandments 
of God ; and yet, I believe that, in the main the Lord approves of the 
work and labors of his faithful Saints. I am glad to report that the 
tithes of the people have increased a little over what they were a year 
ago at this time, and that the people seem to be more faithful in 
observing that law and paying their tithes while they have the means 
to pay, monthly, or at any season, whenever the means comes into their 
hands. They seem to be more faithful in honoring the Lord by con- 
tributing to this work in the payment of their tithes. 

This w r ork is growing and it is a power in the land ; a power for 
good and not for evil. It is an agency of peace and good will. It 
labors with me and with you through the teachers, of the wards and 
in other ways, to have peace in our homes ; peace in the family. And 
that, I say, is a good thing, for, after all, the home is the foundation 
of civil society; of civilization itself; and there is no organization 
in the world, that I know of, that so labors with humankind, with its 
membership individually and collectively, so that we may have peace 
and good will and good order and good government, as this organ- 
ization does. It is quite true, as Elder Stephen L. Richards has 
stated to us this morning, that this organization called "Mormonism," 
is a distinct and an added contribution to the stability and permanency 
of our civil government. It is not an organization in opposition to 
any government, or to any church, for that matter, for we are com- 
manded here in the book of revelations which were given through 
the prophet Joseph Smith, to contend against no church, save it be 
the church of the devil, which means that we should contend against 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



59 



wickedness and sin and all that goes with that, but that we are not to 
contend, not to quarrel, not to fight among ourselves or with our 
neighbors and friends who are not of our faith, nor with any church 
or any organization whatsoever. Our mission is peace and good will ; 
good order ; security of life and property and the general upbuilding 
of the community. 

It is astonishing to me, my brethren and sisters, and must be, I 
think, td every student of history, to know the opposition which is met 
by an organization of this kind with such righteous intent and 
producing such excellent results as are apparent to all the world ; which 
men cannot help but see — the good works which have been accomp- 
lished by this organization. It is astonishing, I say, that it should still 
meet with so much opposition. It is true that when anything like 
this comes into the world and sets itself up to be that which the world 
has not hitherto received: to be a little better, so to speak, at least in 
advanced thought, and also in achieving results for good, which have 
not hitherto been accomplished : and something in advance of any- 
thing that the world has hitherto received ; it is natural I say that 
contention should be aroused against it for a short time until its mean- 
ing and purpose and achievements can be a little more clearly under- 
stood. It is true that when people come to us and say. here we have 
something better than you have, this that you have was good, in its time, 
and was a sincerity once, but you have "changed the laws, transgres- 
sed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant.'' Now we 
have brought you the old, true and everlasting principles back again, 
restablished with divine authority. Naturally, that arouses in human 
nature a. spirit of resentment, for human nature, you know, rarely 
changes ; but when the thing has been put to the test and demon- 
strated ; when it has existed and grown for nearly a hundred years, 
and its works are apparent, and its principles are known to all men 
who will look into it with unprejudiced minds, ought it not to receive 
more favorable consideration ? Yet, even now, in this twentieth cen- 
tury, with never before such means of information and communication 
between countries and peoples, knowledge increased until books and 
papers are published by the million, many people running to and fro, 
people coming and going and visiting, learning and knowing concern- 
ing us ; yet. in a country as liberal as England, there could be raised, 
and was raised during last year such a howl, going aip there in good 
old liberal England as to what great and terrible things the "Mormons" 
were doing, bringing over shiploads of young girls to be made polyga- 
mous wives, and all that sort of stuff and nonsense that anybody who 
would take the least pains to investigate, anyone who had only ordin- 
ary intelligence would know was absolutely absurd and ridiculous, and 
yet it was believed by the million. 

I recall that some fifty years ago, after the Pacific Railroad was 
built across our coun'ry, Governor Stanford of California, president 
of the Central Pacific Railroad, with whom I happened to come in 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



contact a few times, made this statement, and 1 believe he made it also 
to President Young himself ; but this statement I heard, that he con- 
sidered that the property values of the Central Pacific Railroad, as it 
was then called, were safer in the territory of Utah in consequence of 
the "Mormon" Church being there, than were the property values of 
their lines in other states of the Union. That was fifty years ago. 
Since that time we have been, and are being much better known as 
to our purpose ; as to our intent ; as to the righteousness of the people. 
During these fifty years, times without number, men who have had 
large interests, large investments, men of prominence, high character 
and great ability, men who cannot be hired with small sums of money, 
but who command the highest salaries have said repeatedly, and I 
heard one of them say in substance, the same thing within the last 
few weeks : "We consider your organization a direct contribution to 
safety, to observance of law and order, to that which is permanent, and 
we appreciate it." That is the voice of that class of men; the judg- 
ment of which one, I will say, to paraphrase the language of Hamlet, 
the judgment of which one must in your opinion outweigh a whole 
multitude of others — others who are rampant, loud-mouthed, blatant, 
defaming, crying down the Church, complaining of the Church. I 
would rather take the judgment of the men whom I have referred to 
than the judgment of these others. There are some that we have 
among us. and always will have, I suppose, once in awhile, one here 
and one there, a loud, blatant hireling, here and there, full of sound 
and fury, who will get up and defame and try to tear down the 
Church, signifying nothing. They do not amount to anything. They 
put me in mind of a story that my Catholic friend, Joseph Geoghegan 
used to tell. He told the story of an Irishman who came to this 
country and secured a good job. He wrote back to his friend: "Pat, 
he says, "come over. I have got an iligant job. Oh, it is a beautiful 
job. I am tearing down a protestant church, and I am getting paid 
for it." So that is the case, too, with some of these others who yelp 
rather loudly against the "Mormon" Church. 

The "Mormon" Church, as an organization, stands for peace. 
It was organized by the Prince of Peace, himself. It will subdue the 
world through the process of peace — not force. I was glad to note 
that President Coolidge the other day, and I was rather surprised at 
the advanced thought that he gave out, speaking of the Red Cross' he 
said : "Here is an organization that goes about doing good without 
any compulsion ; without any force. In our civil government we are 
still compelled to use force, but the higher law is to secure the cooper- 
ation and harmony of society by moral suasion and without the use 
of force." Now, that is exactly what the "Mormon" Church organ- 
ization is doing. There is no force, in this sense, in the gospel of 
Jesus Christ ; no compulsion whatever. Every man and every woman 
is absolutely free — free to do as they please with respect to the Church ; 
to live in it ; to obey its principles and pay tithes or not, as they please, 



ELDER CHARLES IV. NIB LEY 



61 



but they are persuaded and constrained by the power of the Spirit 
of the Lord ; they are grateful to be impelled by a spirit which comes 
from God, and which teaches them to yield willing obedience to the 
righteousness of its principles, If there is anything lovely, or of good 
report, or praiseworthy, they seek after these things. That is one of 
the articles of our faith, and so, I say to my discontented non- 
"Mormon" friends, possess your souls in patience! The "Mormon" 
Church is here to stay. The "Mormon" Church is here to fill its 
mission, which is a mission of peace ; which contributes to good gov- 
ernment; to good order; to righteous living; to all that makes for a 
higher and better civilization. And it is accomplishing great results 
in respect to this. Is it not a good thing, think you, for an organiza- 
tion to have brought thousands and tens of thousands from distant 
lands, from all over the world, and planted them here? They are 
infinitely better off here. They own their own homes ; they own 
their own land; they are free men, free women. Isn't all that good? 
That is what all our Chambers of Commerce, Commercial Clubs, and 
other organizations of that kind, are seeking for — to bring people here 
who will build homes; who will help build up the country, cultivate 
the isoil and increase production of the necessaries of life. I say, all 
that is good. I believe that everyone — even those embittered in their 
narrow souls against the Church must concede this. For it is good. 
Then, what is there wrong about it? I can find nothing in; the Church 
discipline that is wrong. Nothing in the Church principles that is 
wrong. Individuals may sometimes go wrong. You and I, we may go 
wrong, and do, doubtless, at times, but the principles that govern this 
organization; all that this organization stands for, makes for right- 
eousness and for the well-being of the citizens of this country, for 
that which Elder Richards so. forcefully and plainly pointed out to us 
this mornnig, the establishing, upholding, maintaining of the govern- 
ment of these United States. That is what this organization is here 
for. I repeat, it is to bring peace to the world, not contention. It 
begins, as I said before, at the home. It spreads to the little com- 
munity governed by the bishop of the ward ; all the agencies, all the 
powers of the Priesthood that can be used to promote well-being by 
persuasion ; by long-suffering ; by kindness and knowledge, by love 
unfeigned; no force, no compulsion! All these are used to promote 
the well-being of humankind. What a splendid thing it is to be en- 
gaged in a work of this kind. These agencies our Church 
is using every day to bring to pass the establishment of the kingdom 
of God on the earth, and I say that is a splendid thing, the best that 
man can be engaged in. 

Only the other day a very prominent gentleman from New York, 
who is in charge of large interests in this state, said to me: "Through 
your organization you .seem to< have your feet more solidly on the 
ground, with more of that which makes for safety and security right 
here in Utah, than we find in any other part of the country." 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Brethren and sisters, let me say in closing that we have it of 
record, that the prophet Joseph Smith said the time would come 
when, through secret organizations taking the law into their own 
hands, not being governed by law or by due process of law, but becom- 
ing a law unto themselves, when, by those disintegrating activities, 
the Constitution of the United States would be so torn and rent 
asunder, and life and property and peace and security would be held 
of so little value, that the Constitution would, as it were, hang by a 
thread. But he never said, so far as I have heard, lhat that thread 
would be cut. I believe, with Elder Richards, that this Constitution 
will be preserved, but it will be preserved very largely in consequence 
of what the Lord has revealed and what this people, through listen- 
ing to the Lord and being obedient, will help to bring about, to sta- 
bilize and give permanency and effect to the Constitution itself. That 
also is our mission. That also is what we are here for. 1 glory in 
it. I praise Cod with all my heart and soul that I am a member of it. 

I know the work is true. The Lord has established it. You know 
that also, and when the hands of the elders at the waters of baptism 
were laid upon your heads and it was said unto you, "Receive ye the 
Holy Ghost', that you did receive and have continued to receive until 
there has grown within you a power, a potency, a spirit which, when 
you yield to and live by, makes you better everv way. You know that 
it is the power of God unto salvation, lo this people, to this nation, and 
to all the world, and the time will come, as the prophet of the old 
Bible has declared, when every knee shall bow and every tongue con- 
fess that Jesus is the Christ, to the glory of God the bather. But it 
will never be done by force. The knee will willingly bow, gladly 
bow and acknowdedge that here is the best government ; here is the 
best that has been produced on earth in the way of good government 
and good ordef and security and justice and righteousness and mercy, 
just as men do now acknowledge, those thinking men and wise men 
that have investigated this system, that here is the best there is any- 
where that can be found. So in time, all over the world, the knee will 
bow, the acknowledgment will be made, not through force nor com- 
pulsion, but willingly, loyally, with gratitude and praise to God that 
he has so established his work that man may see what he has done, 
and they will glorify his name and adhere to it. 

That the Lord will hasten it all in his time, I humbly pray, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

(Member of Congress, Former President of the Uintah Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, when the brethren were called so un- 
expectedly yesterday from their places in the audiences, to speak, the 
words of the late President Anthon H. Lund came to me, which he 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 



63 



spoke many years ago to a group of missionaries who were leaving 
for their fields of labor. 1 happened to be one of that band. Said 
he, "When you are called to speak, it matters not how suddenly that 
call conies, if you will remember the "sixth verse of the fourteenth 
chapter of Revelations, and if you have a testimony that the prophecy 
therein recorded has been fulfilled, bear that testimony and the in- 
spiration of the occasion will give you utterance. 

I bear testimony to you this morning that I know the gospel is 
true, and that the angel has come to which the Revelator referred 
when he said : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
nation, and 1 kindred, and tongue, and people. 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the 
hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and 
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

This conference has partaken somewhat of the nature of a com- 
memorative service of that event. Two great events have rather 
grown together among the Latter-day Saints, namely : the coming of 
the Angel Moroni, in fulfilment of this prophecy that I have quoted, 
and the work that we are doing in our temples, for the dead. Some 
one has said that the truest test of any doctrine is whether or not it 
can lie and is being translated into the lives of those who believe it. One 
of the speakers yesterday, in referring to the Book of Mormon, said that 
the greatest evidence of its truth is found in the book itself. So with 
"Mormonism" as a whole, the greatest evidence of its truthfulness is 
found in its teachings and in its practices, and in the effects it has had 
upon the lives of those who have accepted it. The building of temples, 
the constant work being done therein, the desire that comes into the 
hearts and souls of men and women everywhere to work for their dead 
relatives, are direct fulfilments of the prophecy that Moroni made that 
God would send Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, 
and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest he come and smite the 
earth with a curse. Where else in all the world are the hearts of the 
children turning to the fathers that have gone before? T feel an absolute 
assurance, this morning, that the hearts of the fathers that have gone be- 
fore are turning to their children, else why the desire to do this work- 
that is being done in our temples, and the desire that comes into the 
hearts and souls of the children of men everywhere, who accept the 
gospel, to come to these temples. How the words of our President yes- 
terday morning appeal to us who are living! How we have thrilled as 
we have listened to those who have spoken, and we want the instructions 
they have given unto us to become translated into our lives. How we 
have resolved to reflect those teachings, to make of ourselves examples 
worthy of imitation ! 

Oh, I am not afraid of the assaults without, if we can but set 
our own houses in order ; if we can keep our own lives clean, I am not 
afraid of the result. They who fight this work forget one thing, namely : 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the assurance given to every individual member of its truthtuiness. 
What does it matter to us if they fight our leaders? We do- not sus- 
tain these men solely because they are good men. We sustain them 
because there is an assurance in our hearts that God has spoken 
from the heavens, that he did send the Angel Moroni to reveal the 
Book of Mormon to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Before they can up- 
root in our souls the testimony that our faith has planted there, nay, 
that the Spirit of God has planted there, concerning the truthful- 
ness of "Mormonism," they must do more than attack the leadership 
of this Church ; they must convince us that we are wrong, that our 
homes, started under the inspiration of God, are not good homes. Oh, 
I know they attack "Mormonism" because they say it is not conducive 
to good homes. How little they know of what they speak when they 
say that ! 

A few months ago I happened to be in the office of a man who 
holds a high position in this government. I noticed above his desk 
a picture of Brigham Young. I commented upon it. He said: "Yes, 
I am making a collection of the photographs of all the great men that 
have been born in Vermont. I regard Brigham Young as one of the 
greatest, because," said he, "he taught the necessity of home building, 
the necessity of going out upon the land and possessing it ; and if all the 
people everywhere would teach and practice it as Brigham Young 
taught it, America would be safe." 

They who seek to uproot this testimony in our souls must con- 
vince us that our fathers and mothers were wrong when they bore tes- 
timony to us as little children, day after day of the truthfulness of this 
work, of the divinity of Joseph Smith's mission. They must show me 
that my own mother when she sent me forth as a missionary, was 
mistaken when she said: "Though your going grieves me, and I am 
sorry for the parting, yet I want you to go, and I want you to remem- 
ber this one thing : I can bear to see you go ; and I can bear to see 
you come back, if necessary, in your casket, if God wills it, but I 
cannot bear to have you come back unclean or untrue to the teach- 
ings of the gospel which I know to be true." 

More than that, God takes these missionaries who go out as stam- 
mering, hesitating boys and girls, standing! upon the street corners 
in humility, asking for his help, and makes of them mighty preachers 
of the gospel, insomuch that they are able to confound the learned 
men of the world. Those who would destroy this work must make 
these men and women believe that that spirit, which enables them to do 
that, is a delusion and a snare. 

More than that they must make us all believe that the testimony 
which has come to us in the lonely hours of our lives, when we have been 
alone upon the mountain tops or out on the prairies, when God has been 
with us and the conviction has come overwhelmingly to our souls of 
the truthfulness of this work and the divinity of the mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, is false. They must make us believe that when 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 



65 



we have sat in the meetings of this conference and listened to the in- 
spiring words of our beloved president and other speakers, and the 
witness is given to us that what they say is true, is a delusion and a 
snare. 

For be it known that "Mormonism" rests upon the testimony that 
God gives to his children of its truthfulness. If you will do the work 
you shall know whether these men speak of God or whether they speak 
of themselves. 

In humility add with all the earnestness of my soul I bear tes- 
timony that I know that the Angel Moroni came and revealed the 
Book of Mormon, that Joseph Smith w : as the instrument in the 
hands of God of establishing upon the earth God's Church, through 
which his gospel may he preached to all the world; and I bear wit- 
ness of its truthfulness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the 
day of salvation." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Robert I. Burton, presi- 
dent of the Mt. Ogden stake of Zion. 

The conference ad j ourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

The afternoon meeting was opened at 2 o'clock, October 6, 1923. 
President Heber J. Grant presided and announced that the choir and 
congregation would sing "Come, come, ye Saints." 

After the singing of the hymn, Elder Joseph R. Murdock, of the 
Wasatch stake of Zion. offered prayer. 

A solo, "Be thou faithful unto death," was ,sung by Elihu Call. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I am very glad, my brethren and sisters, that we have the am- 
plifiers installed, and I hope they are in working order, for I have 
such a cold and hoarseness that hut for these helps I fear .1 would 
not be able to make you all hear. I sincerely hope to be able to say 
something to you this afternoon which will be worthy of your hear- 
ing. 

A PHASE OF THE ANGEL MORONl'S MESSAGE. 

In the brief period of time which I have been invited to oc- 
cupy this afternoon, I desire to speak upon that phase of the Angel 
Moroni's message to the boy Joseph Smith, which relates directly 
to the salvation for the dead, or as we commonly speak of it, gene- 
alogy and temple work. Genealogy and temple work go hand in hand. 
In both are seen the spirit of Elijah and the accomplishment of one 
would be impossible without the accomplishment of the other, that is 
to say, the temple work and salvation for our (dead, would be impossible 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of accomplishment without first having a knowledge, some genealogy, 
of our dead. I realize that there are many people who do not ac- 
cept of the visitation of the Angel Moroni to the boy Joseph Smith 
as a truth, therefore I desire to read three verses from the Old 
Testament, which all good Christians claim to believe, and which 
bears upon this subject. 

SCRIPTURE "REARING ON THE SUBJECT. 

I will read the first, the fifth and the sixth verses of the 
fourth chapter of Malachi: 

"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, 
yea, and all that do wickedly; shall be stubble; and the day that cometli 
shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that 'it shall leave them neither 
root nor branch. 

"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord : 

"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the 
heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with 
a curse." 

I doubt if there was any man living at the time of the visita- 
tion of the Angel Moroni to Joseph Smith who could properly in- 
terpret this passage of scripture. There was very little information 
among men upon the earth at that time in regard to this very im- 
portant principle of the salvation for the dead, and the visitation of 
the Angel Moroni and his message were the first word in this dis- 
pensation in( regard to the matter. The angel, referring to this 
same subject, while addressing the boy Joseph said: 

"For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, 
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall burn as stubble ; for they, that come shall 
burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root 
nor branch." 

"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah 
the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 

"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the 
fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers; if it were 
not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming." 

THE INTERPRETATION. 

An explanation of the meaning of these passages of scripture 
is given in the 128th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
reads as follows: 

"It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with 
a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the 
fathers and the children, upon some subject or other — and behold what is that 
subj«ct? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made 
perfect ; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we 
be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also." 

It would seem from the quotation made by the angel to Joseph 
that the earth would be wasted at the coming of our Lord, if we do 
not do this important work, if the hearts of the children be not, in 



ELDIiR GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



67 



this dispensation, turned unto their fathers ; which, interpreted by 
the Prophet Joseph means : if we do not consider our dead ances- 
tors, those who have gone before, obtaining sufficient knowledge 
and genealogy concerning them that will enable us to go into the 
temples, builded for that purpose, and there perform this import- 
ant work of baptism. But be it known, my brethren and sisters 
and friends, that not only is it necessary that our dead who have 
not had the opportunity in life of hearing and embracing the gos- 
pel shall have the opportunity of hearing it on the other side 
and shall have the privilege of baptism by proxy by their living 
friends, but it is necessary that every ordinance of the gospel that 
is necessary for the salvation of the living shall also be administer- 
ed by proxy for the dead. 

Some will say they do not believe in this proxy business. To 
me, one may as well say that he does not believe in the atonement 
which was wrought out by our Lord and Savior for the redemption 
of the human family; for that is certainly a work of proxy. He 
becomes the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. We become the re- 
cipients of the blessings of the atonement, so far as being redeemed 
from our individual sins is concerned, only when we have accepted 
him as such, and when we have accepted of his mission as the Re- 
deemer and Savior of the world. So men are authorized to act for 
the Lord by authority given them, and do for their dead kindred, a 
proxy work; thus they may become Saviors of men. So that with 
those for whom the work shall be done properly, as the Lord has re- 
vealed it through his servant, the Prophet Joseph, when they ac- 
cept of the work done, it becomes efficacious for their salvation. 

RESPONSIBILITY UPON THE PERSON, THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD. 

With regard to this expression: if it were not so the whole 
earth would be smitten, would be utterly wasted at his coming, it 
seems to me that this refers not only to the individual members of 
the Church, but to the Church as a whole, and not only to us, but 
to the people of the world. Elijah came in fulfilment of the pre- 
diction that he would come before the great and glorious coming 
of our Lord and Savior, and he conferred upon Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland temple, on the third day of April, 
1836. the keys of the dispensation of the turning of the 
hearts of the children to the fathers; and he told them on that oc- 
casion that by this they might know that the great and dreadful day 
of the Lord was nigh, even at our doors. Eighty-seven and one- 
half years have passed since that time. We are that much nearer 
the great and dreadful day of the Lord, and his coming is assured. 
Is the earth going to be wasted at his coming? I firmly believe from 
my experience and observation, and from what history tells us, that 
there has never been a time since the visitation of the Angel Moroni to 
Joseph Smith, when there has been so much wickedness as now in the 



68 



GENERAL C X) NFER EX C E 



world and so much destruction of life and property, all fulfilling 
the predictions of the prophets, being signs of the time of the com- 
ing of our Lord and Savior. 

THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH. 

When Elijah delivered his message, there went forth to the 
world a spirit, even the spirit of Elijah, which was seen in Great 
Britain, in the parliament of that great nation; for almost immedi- 
ately, we learn from the history, they enacted laws making it oblig- 
atory upon the parish clerks and others in the subdivisions of the 
government of Great Britain that they keep correct records, rec- 
ords of births, records of deaths, records 'of marriages, etc., the 
very data that are required to enable us to perform the work for 
our dead in the temples of the Lord; and a place was designated for 
the safe keeping of these records as they became completed. In Great 
Britain, in other nations of Europe, and throughout the United 
States, from that time went forth a spirit and a desire among men 
to know of their kindred dead, such as had never been witnessed be- 
fore, and genealogical societies were organized, and men and women 
of wealth and nobility have expended their fortunes and years of 
their time in searching" for the very information that we desire and 
need in order to discharge ourselves of the obligations resting up- 
on us concerning the dead, and we have now accessible all through 
the country, libraries containing thousands and thousands of print- 
ed histories of families and ol branches and of counties and shires 
and parishes, and 1 think that the people of the world are doing their 
duty in this respect, perhaps as well as are the Latter-day Saints. 
We have builded temples at great cost and are maintaining them ar 
great expense, and there are but a few of us who have been very 
active in looking after our kindred dead. 

IMPORTANCE OF TEMPLE WORK. 

The importance of this work was stated emphatically by the 
Prophet Joseph when he said that the Lord has never laid upon this 
people a greater responsibility than that of looking after their dead, 
which means, inquiring after them, learning of them, building tem- 
ples and redeeming them by administering unto them the saving or- 
dinances of the gospel. 

The gospel is preached to the world ; it is the poor of the world 
who are receiving the gospel. This work in the Church is being 
performed by the poor of the Church. Think it over, brethren and 
sisters, we have men of means, we have men who could well afford 
to inquire after their dead, make extended research, and could pay 
for proxy work in having that work done, and men, too, who are 
active in other religious lines of work, who seem never to have let 
this important question enter into their minds ; who have never been 
active in obtaining genealogy and in doing temple work. My motive 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



69 



is, in speaking these few words this afternoon, brethren and sisters, 
that I might inspire in the minds of some of my brethren and sisters 
who have been neglectful of this responsibility, a desire and a de- 
termination to take up this work, to learn where their responsibilities 
lie, and to discharge themselves faithfully of these responsibilities, 
while they have the opportunity. 

AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT HOME. 

Time will not permit me to extend my remarks upon this sub- 
ject, which is one of the most glorious and most important, and many 
examples of faithfulness on the part of our people are worthy of 
the emulation of the whole. I would that all could know the sac- 
rifices which some are making in these temples, and in obtaining 
a genealogy for their dead. Those who cannot go abroad to preach 
the gospel, who are physically disqualified, men who are wrapped 
up in business and professions, so that they cannot answer the call, 
have an opportunity here at home to ido a work for which they are 
well adapted, where they can use their means to the very best ad- 
vantage and accomplish just as great and glorious a work as if 
they were abroad in the world preaching the gospel. Will you do 
it, brethren and sisters? That is the question. Are we going to 
be as the world — hearers of the word and not doers of it, deceiving 
ourselves? T trust this will not be the case. God help us to dis- 
charge our duty faithfully, that the earth may not be wasted at his 
coming and that we may not be reproached when our life's work is 
ended, with having neglected our dead, I humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I feel very weak this afternoon, and I desire your assistance and 
the blessing of my heavenly Father that I may be able to say some- 
thing that will be profitable to you. 

GRATITUDE AND THANKS EXPRESSED 

My soul is filled with a deep gratitude that I cannot express, 
for membership in this wonderful organization. I am thankful that 
my lot has been cast with this people, I am grateful that I was born 
of goodly parents, and that the environment of my life has been such 
that I have participated in the greatest blessings that the Lord has 
bestowed upon his children. While listening to the brethren who 
have addressed us, I have felt to pour out my soul in thanksgiving be- 
cause of what we are enjoying. No other people upon the face of the 
earth have been honored as we have in having been given the know - 
ledge of the gospel of our Lord. Think of belonging to a Church that 
has deposited with it the information and authority that is necessary 
for all humanity to possess before they can realize the purpose of their 
creation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I sometimes feel that we do not appreciate the Holy Bible, and 
what it contains, and these other scriptures, the Book of Mormon, 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price that have 
been referred to by our beloved President as letters from our heaven- 
ly Father. They may be so received, at least they are his advice and 
his counsel to all the children of men given to them that they may 
know how to take advantage of their opportunities, that their lives 
may not be spent in vain. One of the sorrowful things in life is 
to see a man or a woman laid away in Mother earth with a realiza- 
tion of the fact that they have refused the greater blessings that our 
Father offered to them, and have continued grasping at the bubble 
that has itself disappeared. When I think of the millions of God's 
children in the world, and realize how little they are striving for 
the things that are really worth while, I feel sad, but when I see 
tins body of people here today — representatives of the great Church 
that bears the name of the Redeemer — and realize that we who have 
accepted the gospel have been chosen, as it were, from among the 
multitude of our father's children to understand him and to know 
why we are here, my heart is filled with gratitude and praise to Him 
for his blessings unto us. 

We believe in a pre-existence. The Lord has taught us that in 
the Scriptures, but there are millions of those who profess belief 
in the Floly Bible who do not believe in, or at least do not under- 
stand, what pre-existence really means. They do not realize that 
we lived before we came here ; they do not comprehend that this 
body has been given to us as a reward for faithfulness in the 
spirit world before we came here. They do not know that by par- 
taking of certain ordinances prescribed by our heavenly Father, we, 
as husbands and wives, may be united for time and eternity and en- 
joy the companionship of our children for ever. How thankful we 
should be for that knowledge that has come to us. 

As I stand here now, realizing that from infancy until manhood 
I had the teaching of a loving father and a tender, sweet mother, and 
that I had explained to me what I should do in order to prepare for 
eternal life in the presence of our Father, I feel grateful indeed. 

If I were to think, as many of the people of the world think, 
that now my beloved parents are gone, they have passed out of my 
life forever and that I will never see them again, that would deprive me 
of one of the greatest joys that I have in life, the contemplation of 
meeting them again, and receiving their welcome and their affection, 
and of thanking them from the depths of a grateful heart. These are 
some of the blessings that appeal to me as coining through the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

THIS LIFE IS NOT THE END. 

I am thankful that there has been revealed to us and made plain 
in this latter-day that this life is not the end, that this is but a part of 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



71 



eternity, and that if we take advantage of our privileges here, that 
this is but the stepping stone to greater and more desirable conditions. 
We are all of us passing rapidly to that time when we will be called 
hence. If we did not understand that there is a future life, if we 
did not realize that there is something more than the influence that 
we have received thus far, if there was not anything but the vanity 
and vexation of life for us to live for there are many, it seems to 
me, who would grow weary in the struggle that is to be made for 
existence here. But in the mercy of our heavenly Father he has 
bestowed upon us the most wonderful gifts that come to human kind. 
Think of the tenderness of our fathers and mothers, reared as we are 
under the nurture and admonition of the Lord ; think of the homes 
of prayer wherein we have been taught that we must pray to our 
heavenly Father if we would be pleasing unto him. Think of the 
teachings that have come to us of honesty, of industry, of integrity, 
of sobriety, of purity, and cleanness of life. Think of the blessings 
that have come to us, inspiring in us charity for those who are less 
fortunate than ourselves. All the ideals and virtues that mankind 
has known, or will know, have been bestowed upon the members of 
this great Church. 

NO DOUBT AS TO THE OUTCOME 

We are not in doubt as to what the outcome will be. The Lord 
has not only said unto us, ''In my Father's house are many mansions," 
"I go to prepare a place for you," but in the day and age in which 
we live the Lord has described the very places lo which his children 
may hope to go. He has explained to us that there are various de- 
grees of glory, has described to us certain requirements which must 
be complied with if we would enjoy those degrees of glory. The 
man who drinks with the drunken, and who lives an immoral life, 
and who gives himself up to evil things, should not hope to go into 
the celestial kingdom of our heavenly Father, for the Lord has said 
he cannot go there. But the people of the world do not understand 
that. There are those who profess Christianity, who believe that even 
the murderer who has imbrued his hands in the blood of his innocent 
victim may, by saying the words, "I believe in Jesus Christ," be 
ushered into the presence of the Redeemer of mankind. This is 
false doctrine and I am thankful that this people are not deceived 
by such teachings, but that on the contrary we are placed in a con- 
dition to know- how we may obtain the blessing of Celestial glory, 
and not be disappointed. 

SOME CHOICE BLESSINGS THAT WE ENJOY. 

I am glad that there is in this great organization a determination 
to sustain the laws of the land in which we live. I am grateful for 
this great government that our heavenly Father gave to us, for he 
has said that he raised up wise men to prepare for us the Constitution 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of this great nation, and I am thankful that he lias given unto us the 
revelation that as long as the people of this land work righteousness, 
that he will he their God and their king, and that no other kings shall 
dwell upon this land. It is pleasing to know that this land has been 
consecrated to liberty, and that the way was prepared for the coming 
of the gospel in this great and wonderful nation. 

1 am thankful to know that all that is good and pure and holy, all 
thai is sweet and that is worth while in life, may be enjoyed by the 
members of this Church within the folds of the Church. There has 
not been withheld from us one single blessing that mankind may 
enjoy, because of our membership in this Church. ( )n the contrary, 
the Lord has taught us to be brothers and sisters in very deed, and. 
not only has he given to us the Old Testament scriptures and the New- 
Testament scriptures, but he has given to us the American volume of 
scripture that supplements the teachings of the divine mission of our 
Lord, and in our day has. revealed to us through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith the doctrines that are necessarv for us to observe in order that 
we may have the companionship of our wives and our children, our 
fathers and our mothers, throughout the ages of eternity. 

These, my brethren and sisters, are some of the choice blessings 
that the Lord has bestowed upon us in this day, and 1 wonder if we 
appreciate them. All that he has asked of us in return for the ful- 
ness of the earth, all that he has asked of us in return for the bless- 
ings of this life, all that he has asked us to do in order that we 
may enjoy eternal life in his celestial kingdom, is to follow the simple 
teachings of our Lord, that he has given to the children of men, 
that all men may follow if they will, and while doing it, peace of 
mind, contentment and happiness may be theirs. The gospel of Jesus 
Christ is not a difficult road to follow, it is the pathway of peace, and 
gives assurance of the blessings of the Lord when life's labor on 
earth is completed. The gospel of Jesus Christ does not reqire us to 
torment ourselves with physical pain. On the contrary it teaches 
us that we may so live that health and vigor and strength will be ours, 
and that we can avoid the pains and anguish that are the result of 
violation of our Father's laws. 

ARE WE WORTHY TO BE CALLED SAINTS? 

I am grateful for that wonderful Word of Wisdom, simple as it 
is, and as the Lord says, "adapted to the capacity of the weak or 
the weakest of all wdio are or can be called Saints." I pause to ask 
this great congregation, are we worthy to be called Saints ? All 
who hope to be called Saints should certainly be observers of the 
Word of Wisdom. And what does it mean to us? It gives us 
sweetness of life, it takes from us the poisonous vapors that many 
people breathe as the result of smoking tobacco. It avoids for 
us that nauseating condition that is the result of chewing tobacco. 
It preserves us. if we observe it, from the infirmities due to taking 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



73 



into our systems the narcotics contained in tea and coffee, and from 
the disatsrous effects of, liquor and hot and strong drink. Our heaven- 
ly Father, not only tells us what we should avoid, but tells us what 
we may use with profit. He has said to us that all grain, all whole- 
some herbs, the fruit of the vine etc., are good for man. Flesh of 
beast and fowls of the air; and these things he refers to we may use 
wlith prudence and thanksgiving ; and, I want to emphasize with 
thanksgiving. 

THE LORD OF LORDS OUR TEACHER 

Brethren and sisters, you have had the greatest instructor that 
the world knows anything" about. You have had for your school 
master the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the. Creator of the 
heavens and the earth ; who in his wonderful tenderness and con- 
sideration for us in this day, has sent his prophet into the world to 
explain to us, and to make clear to our minds the things that he gave 
to the world hundreds of years ago that have been misunderstood 
and have been misinterpreted very much to the detriment of our 
bather's children. But in our day he has renewed to us the truth, has 
given to us the blessed teachings that should qualify us to be men and 
women after his own heart, has held out to us the promise that if 
we will do the things that he advises our lives will be pure and holy, 
peace will be our portion here, and we shall dwell with him through- 
out the ages of eternity. What more could he give unto us, or, as has 
already been quoted by one of the brethren : "W hat more can he 
say than to you he has said, you who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled?" 

THANKFUL FOR NOBLE MEN TO REPRESENT X'S IX Till'. NATION. 

I felt grateful today when one of the members of the House of 
Bepresentatives of the Congress of the United States, our great 
legislative bod}', stood here as a humble representative of the com- 
munity in which he lives, as an Elder of the Church and testified 
of the truth, while at Washington he should radiate an influence for 
the uplift of every soul that he comes in contact with without be'ng 
contaminated with the evils that beset mankind. He is a legislator 
of the greatest nation on earth, but he is more, he is a representative 
of our heavenly Father, with authority to officiate in the ordinances 
of the gospel of our Lord for the blessing of mankind. I am grate- 
ful for him and his brethren wdio are there with him. I am thankful 
that by reason of faith and good works we see men rising from the 
ranks, year after year, to stand in high places in our government, 
not to tear it down, not to break in pieces the structures that have been 
reared by others, but to show where the better way lies, to say to 
the children of men who are crying out for a change, and who are 
not satisfied with conditions : Let us legislate that we may all live 
m peace in the land and that we all may enjoy the blessings of 
the Lord while we live upon the earth.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



LET US NOT CHANGE OUR BLESSINGS FOR FOOLISH ATTRACTIONS. 

My brethren and sisters, I am thankful for my membership in 
this Church. I am grateful to be permitted to have the companionship 
of my brethren and sisters. I prize my citizenship in this great 
nation, and from the depths of my soul I am thankful that my 
lot has been cast with you. This great government was established by 
our Father, this land was prepared by him, and the particular part of 
it that is inhabited by the Latter-day Saints has been beautified until 
the eyes of the world are turned towards us, because of the pictur- 
esqueness and the grandeur of the home that the Lord has prepared 
for us. He has blessed us with all this and with every comfort, with 
the loving companionship and 'association of wives and husbands and 
parents and children and the presidency of the Priesthood of out- 
Lord. Let us not be blinded by the cunning of the adversary to 
exchange any of these wonderful gifts for the foolishness that at- 
tracts mankind, for the pitfalls that have been prepared by the enemy 
of all righteousness. This is our Father's work, this is the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, it is the power of God unto salvation to ali those who 
believe and obey it, and I pray that we who are here this day, may 
return to our homes with renewed determination to be loyal and faith- 
ful to those things that are righteous, and that we will live to honor 
him who gives all we enjoy, and who offers us the blessings of 
eternal life, eternal progress, eternal increase in his celestial king- 
dom. May the Lord help us to merit his blessings, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

No person who has attended the sessions of this conference is more 
thankful to our heavenly Father than am I. I want you, brethren 
and sisters, to know that whenever one of the general conferences is 
held, and I am unable to attend, I feel greatly the loss of it. 1 con- 
stantly pray to my heavenly Father that, on account of conditions that 
prevent me from attending the conferences, I may partake of the same 
spirit that is manifested through all of the speakers when I have the 
privilege of reading the reports. 

APPRECIATION OF CONFERENCE AND THE SPEAKERS. 

In standing before you this day I crave the assistance of my 
heavenly Father in what I may say at this conference. I trust that 
I may have the same degree of his spirit that has been enjoyed by all 
the former speakers. I have never attended conference where the 
testimonies had such an effect upon me, beginning with that of the 
President of the Church and continuing with every speaker that fol- 
lowed him. My soul and spirit said : "Amen" to the many truths 
uttered, and to the testimonies borne. I have heard President Grant 
bear his testimony to his knowledge of this gospel many times. I have 



ELDER REED SMOOT

heard him speak since he has been President of the Church, but never 
in my life have I been impressed with the power that he exercises, 
through the gift of God, as in his opening address at this conference. 
As President Penrose stood upon this stand, a servant who has 
declared the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ for seventy-two years, 
I believe, even before any of the other General Authorities of the 
Church were born, and with the power that he exercised, granted to him 
by God; and the truths that were uttered rang through my soul, and 
I thanked God for such men. 

CONDITIONS IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD 

Much has been said at this conference as to the conditions existing 
in the world, based upon the predictions of the prophets of the liv- 
ing God. It called to my attention the fact that on July 27, this year, 
Brother John A. Widtsoe and I were in Sweden, and at that time the 
great Baptist congress or conference of the Baptist churches in all 
the world was held there, and an account of the meetings held upon 
that day was cabled to the New York Times. I am going to take 
the time now to read from the New York Times of July 28. this 
year, a report of that particular meeting. It is dated, Stockholm, July 
27: 

"The Christian church has no message today for a dying world. As a 
matter of fact, the Christian church is preaching many gospels, and the result 
is confusion and failure," said the Reverend Doctor Curtis Lee Laws, of Brook- 
lyn, in addressing the Baptist World Alliance here today. "Audiences arc being 
rent asunder today," he said, "and those who have long been brethren are in 
warring camps contending, not only over non-essentials, but also over the very 
fundamental principles of Christianity. If this theological war is fought to a 
finish," he said, "at least the present generation will perish for lack of vision. 
Believing in the sincerity and high moral character of these theologians, I beg of 
them, in the name of Christ and perishing humanity, that they will quietly and 
lovingly gather about the table with God's book before them and let them settle 
every disputed question. That book is the ultimate ground for authority." 

A MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD 

I might add, my brethren and sisters, that there is a message in the 
world today for all its peoples. God has revealed to his servants the 
fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It was given through his ser- 
vants, as a message to the world, and humble as our missionaries may 
be in presenting that message to the world, dying, as the minister has 
already said, for want of a message, if it were heeded by the world 
today, existing conditions could not be as they are. It is true that there 
is a suffering" world, it is true that there are dissensions; among all the 
sects of the world, it was true when God spoke to the Prophet Joseph, 
calling his particular attention to it, and it will be true until the world 
accepts the message that God has given in this last dispensation of the 
fulness of time. Ridicule, my brethren and sisters, is not going to 
change that message, and the mere fact that someone says that in this 
enlightened age, the people of this dispensation, in this day of under- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



standing and enlightenment, will never believe that the Angel Moroni 
appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that he did deliver the 
golden plates to him, just as the Prophet testified. 

THE PROBABILITY OF ITS TRUTH 

Mere ridicule of such a statement does not make it untrue. Is it 
any more difficult to believe that an angel from heaven did just as the 
Prophet Joseph stated, deliver those plates to him and usher in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, as practically every prophet in every dispensation 
has predicted — is it any more difficult to believe that than for the 
world's Christian people to believe the Bible? Isn't it just as probable, 
if they want to use that word, as when Moses is credited with the power 
conferred upon him by God, to have the waters of the Red Sea divide 
and the people of Israel go across dry-shod, is there any more mystery 
about one than there is about the other? If God's power with Elijah 
could enable him to stand upon the banks of the Jordan and smite the 
waters of the river and cause them to divide hither and thither, and he 
cross over dry-shod, isn't it just as probable, even to a skeptic, that the 
truth, as delivered by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is as it occurred? 
There are too many recitals of incidents in the Bible that are much more 
miraculous than the fact that an angel from heaven showed to the 
boy prophet where the records were concealed. 

A TRIBUTE TO MOTHER 

Together with Brother Widtsoe 1 had the privilege of visiting 
Europe during the months of July and August. While thus upon a 
special mission, and by the assistance of Brother Widtsoe, I had the 
privilege of visiting the Scandinavian countries. I also took the time 
during my last visit to go there, primarily, I will say, to visit my 
mother's old home. While a young man 1 used to say to mother : "Some 
day we will go back to the old home." I left it too late, as so many 
things are put off until it is too late; for my mother died when she was 
sixty years old. But I made up my mind that sooner or later I would 
go to the old home and see some of my relatives there. 1 haven't the 
time today to express to you the feelings I had when I stood upon the 
very spot where she was born, and when I saw the old homestead as it 
was. When I went into the old cow-shed and opened the old door 
that she had opened perhaps hundreds and hundreds of times, when I 
looked upon the spring back of the house, that I had heard her speak 
of when I was a boy and, as I stood under the shade of that wonderful 
tree her mother had planted and which she used to tell me about ; and 
as 1 saw conditions surrounding that homestead, I want to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, I thanked God from the bottom of my heart 
that the gospel of Jesus Christ reached my mother, and that she knew 
it was true, when she was but a girl. All opposition and all persecution 
on the part of her father and her mother and her loved ones never had 
one iota of influence upon her testimony that God lived and that Jesus 
is the Christ.

A YOUNG CONVERT S TELLING TESTIMONY 

My cousins brought to me the old family Bible, and as I lifted the 
lid I saw a writing and at the bottom of the last page of it the name 
"Anna Kirstine Mauritz-datter." I could not read the writing, but I 
asked Brother Widtsoe to copy it as quickly as possible, then tell me 
what was in it. I desired to have it translated word for word. It was 
a message to her parents written on the day that she left home — the day 
she was driven from home by a loving father and mother who thought 
that she would not be gone very long, but that she would soon return 
and ask forgiveness, and deny that she knew that God lived and that 
Jesus is the Christ. She was only a girl, then, but I am going to take 
time now to read to this congregation, that letter, because it gives forth 
the spirit that makes women such as she. It is filled full of the spirit 
of our fathers and mothers who were willing to sacrifice all in this 
world for the gospel's sake ; aye, it is the spirit of a missionary, teaching 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. This was written in her own hand-writing, 
and it was the last farewell of a girl who loved her country, who loved 
her father and mother, and who loved her. home, but who loved the 
gospel of Jesus Christ more : 

"A few words from your daughter Kirstine, Dear, tny parents : Pray God 
for courage to accept this great truth contained in this book and now restored, 
so that rejected knowledge may not be a testimony against you on God's great 
day to come. I pray God that on that great day we may be able to gather together 
in joy and happiness, and that we may then be crowned to God's glory, and that 
he may say to us all: 'Come now, my faithful children, you shall be rewarded 
for your labors.' This matter, and my desire that you may know the truth and 
accept it, have made me shed in secret many burning tears, and they have been 
increased when I have thought of the ungodliness of mankind. The years are 
speeding on, the day is approaching when all must listen to the Shepherd and 
render obedience to his will, or receive punishment. The great King is coming 
to reign and to rule. Sin and evil will be banished. May God grant that you may 
be among the worthy ones. My heart grows tender when I think of these things. 
God give that all mankind may repent. I shall pray to my heavenly Father that 
all who read these lines may comprehend the true purpose of his holy book, and 
may lay down the burden of sin. That which I have written is for all who may 
read these lines. I pray God to lead you into eternal lift. 

' Kirstine Maurits-datter, Drammen, Sept. 1, 1854." 

NOT ASHAMED ANYWHERE OF THE RESTORED GOSPEL OF CHRIST 

I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ; I am not ashamed 
of the testimony of the mother that gave me birth. I care not where I 
go upon the face of the earth, whether it be with kings, potentates, or 
any class of people in the world, I want them all to know that I am a 
member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I pray 
God that I may have strength to do those things that he wants me to do, 
to say those things that he wants me to say, to live in a way that he 
wants me to live, and bear a testimony of his truth and of his work, that 
will be worthy of a man who comes from a mother such as I had. 

THE BURDEN OF WAR THE RESULT OF THE BURDEN OF SIN 

Yes, the burden of sin today, the cause of the World war, and the 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

if 

resulting burdens of debt, are on the backs of the people of Europe, and 
if they are fortunate enough to live, and if there is peace in the world for 
another hundred years, they will not entirely remove the burdens that 
have been placed upon them as a result of the world war. 

Let me cite you a case: Take England, with her forty-five mil- 
lions of people. I mean Great Britain and Ireland, not all of her col- 
onies nor any of them. What do we find? Forty-five millions of 
people carrying a burden of over eight hundred dollars for every man, 
woman and child. We find the average tax imposed upon them equal 
to one hundred and two dollars every year, for every man, woman 
and child. We find that the costs of the last war, to England, were 
more than the maintaining of the British government for two hundred 
and twenty-six years, including all former wars. We find hardly a 
home in all England but what there came, through that war, the death 
of one or more of the family. We find unrest even there, and 1 want 
to say now to the good people here that I pray God that the time never 
will come when the English speaking peoples of the world will become 
enemies. I never want to see a conflict between England and America ; 
for if it ever comes, just as surely as God lives, the English speaking 
peoples of the world will not thereafter control the destinies of the 
world. 

WORLD CAN BE SAVED ONLY BY A KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND THE USE OF 

COMMON SENSE 

I have started, my brethren and sisters, upon a subject that will 
take too much time. I bear you my testimony that this is the work of 
God, and the only thing, it seems to me, that will save the world today 
is to acknowledge God and use good common sense. I hope and trust 
that the members of the Church will be even more willing to serve God 
than they have been in the past. Look to your homes, my brethren and 
sisters. See that the home is made the place where all in it will thank 
God for his many mercies, and are willing to acknowledge his hand in 
all things. May God bless not only our people here, but bless all the 
peoples of the world, and, as we often pray, hasten the day when Zion 
shall be redeemed, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission.) 

I do not know that I have ever attended a conference when I have 
felt more of the Spirit of the Lord and the power of testimony than in 
this conference; and I trust that I may enjoy a continuation of God's 
Holy Spirit and be led to say that which he would have me say at 
this time. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is growing and 
will continue to grow until it fills the earth. Daniel, a prophet of 
God, made such a prediction, and it will not fail for God's word has 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION 



79 



never failed. Men have failed but his word has never failed, neither 
has the word of his servants. Wicked men, for periods of time, have 
prevented his power from growing in the earth, but: when opportunity 
has come and when it has been expedient, he has restored it again. 
This power he gave unto Adam and it has been in the earth; whenever 
his authority has been in the earth in the different dispensations of the 
gospel. The strength of the Church, it has been said, does not lie in 
its numbers, or in its wealth, or even in its educational work, but it 
is vested in the principles of the gospel which the Lord our God has 
revealed. 

We are accounted a strange people and a peculiar people by some, 
and it is true, in a way, that we are. Our belief separates us from 
the rest of the world gathered together in the great churches of the 
day. As they meet to worship our Father, they are taught doctrines 
that are not in harmony with the gospel as the Lord gave it unto 
Adam, Noah, and Abraham and unto all who represented him in the 
earth before the Christ, and as he restored it in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. Think of the millions of people called Christians 
'who today are worshiping a Father without body or parts or passions 
and who sits on the top of a topless throne — something that really 
could not be ; yet men and women enlightened by the theology of men 
and by the science of the earth believe that their Father and your 
Father and mine is without a body and without form. They believe 
also that they had their beginning here. Go where you may you will 
find few if any public speakers in any of the churches of the day who 
teach the ante-mortal state of man. They do not believe in preexist- 
ence. They believe that Christ existed before but that man had his 
beginning here. They believe that a man's life here is the end of his 
opportunity to work, that the Lord has provided a way for him and all 
he has to do is to acknowledge the Christ and be saved regardless of 
the life that he has lived. 

It is no wonder that mere boys and girls who are sent into the 
world, can "hold their own" with the great leading minds of the country 
who study the scripture for their guide. These missionaries have the 
truth, the power of truth. The fact that a man is on the right side 
and has the right to operate and to stand for the Redeemer of the 
world makes him strong. It is no wonder that boys in the missionary 
field can hold meetings night after night, occupying one and two 
hours at a time, preaching to the congregations of the world the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. It is not to be wondered at, when we know that they 
have the truth. 

The things that our missionaries accomplish are almost miracles. 
During the past summer, in the Central States Mission, two of our 
missionaries, and one of them with only a few months' experience, 
have held as many as ten meetings, night after night. The same 
congregation of people came again and again to hear them discuss the 
principles of revealed religion : that God who sits enthroned in yonder 



80 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



heavens is an immortal Being who has a body of flesh and bone and 
that we are his children, fashioned and made after him ; that we lived 
before we came into this world ; that we did not come here as a matter 
of chance but that we came here according to appointment ; that some 
were leaders, some were followers, some were men of faith ; that this 
time that is allotted unto men here in the great school called life is 
but preparatory for the future which surely must come to every son 
and everv daughter of our father in heaven: that to those who 1 have 
not had the privilege of receiving the gospel of the living God in mor- 
tality, .shall be given a chance in the hereafter. 

These are only a few of the things that God has revealed which 
make life of interest and worth while, which cause men and women 
to say to themselves : I believe the voice of that young man or that 
young woman ; the logic appeals to me. I want to say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that the world is filled with honorable men and 
honorable women, if we could only reach them. It takes time to 
change them, it is true, because they have lived believing they are 
right. They ought not to be condemned ; God will not condemn them 
until he gives them a chance. That is, why we are here today. That 
is why this Church lives. That is why the work of (Joel will grow. 
Our father will give his children a chance. He gives- his missionaries 
opportunities. He is by their side. If the veil could only be lifted, we 
could see that his representatives are with them in the, earth. It is not 
the power of man they possess, but the power of the eternal God, be- 
cause they are only acting in his name. They are his agents, his represent- 
atives sent into the world in this da)- to give the people a chance to be 
redeemed. 

The strength of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is vested in the truth which God has revealed. Men need only be 
willing to serve him, and by his power miracles are wrought from 
the pulpits. By his power miracles are wrought through the laying 
on of hands, through the speaking in tongues, through the logic given 
unto his children unto the convincing of the honest in heart that he lives 
and that the world is not without him, that his Priesthood is here in 
the earth, and that the authority to act in his name is here. 

May God give the Latter-day Saints the power to continue to edu- 
cate their children, whom they hold in trust for him, so that the Lord 
may be able to use them for the glorifying of his name, through his 
Son who died that we might live, I pray in the name of Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission.) 

When the president of the Church was speaking yesterday morn- 
ing, the feelings of that vast congregation were such as were described 
by the two disciples who walked with Jesus after his re.»urrection. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



81 



They said : "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with 
us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" And 
our hearts burned with the fire of the Spirit which has been 
rekindled and renewed by President Penrose and the rest of the 
speakers as we have listened to the message of life and salvation they 
have delivered. 

This Church, I boldly proclaim and devoutly believe, has blessed 
the United States of America and all the world by its existence and 
by the doctrines it has taught. It has given to this nation especially, 
and to the world a treasure-house of scripture. I refer to the sacred 
Nephite record, the Book of Mormon. Let us take from this treasure- 
house one or two of the gems of truth. One of these gems is as 
follows : 

"And there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name 
of jesus, save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity." (Ill 
Nephi 8:3.) 

Isn't this a clarion call to purity of life? The cleaner our lives, 
the purer our thoughts, the greater will be our power, by the prayer 
of faith, to heal those who are afflicted with bodily ills. It is the 
truth that the many mighty miracles that Jesus the Redeemer wrought 
was due to the fact that he lived so close to the Father, lived so 
perfectly the celestial laws of God, that unto him was given that 
superhuman power. 

Another truth: God said: "For my work is not yet finished; 
neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time hence 
forth and forever." 

"The works of God continue, and worlds and lives abound ; 
improvement and progression have one eternal round." 

Over the portals of the prison house which God hath prepared 
for the sinners, the sectarian world has written this inscription: 
"Abandon hope all who enter here." But the Church ot Jesus Christ 
has written above the entrance : "Prisoners of hope ;" for God's mercy 
endureth forever, and shall reach the penitent and repentant when 
wrongs have been fully expiated for, even to the uttermost farthing. 

Again, in the world today, who are denying the divinity of Jesus 
Christ, and also his resurrection? Some of the very people who have 
brazenly declared that this Church is not a Christian Church. Go 
to that splendid book of Mosiah and read the soul stirring testimony 
therein concerning the atonement of Jesus Christ, delivered by Abinadi, 
who sealed his testimony with his blood and suffered death by fire 
for daring to proclaim that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God, and through his atonement came forgiveness of sins and a re- 
demption from the grave. 

These are some of the gems from the treasure-house of scripture 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have given to the 
world ; and I glory in and am thankful to God for the comfort and 
instruction in that book. It is true that many of the learned are de- 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



nying the divinity of Jesus Christ. To he learned is good, says the 
Book of Mormon, if they hearken unto the counsels of God ; when 
scholarship is made tributary to the truth of God, then blessed is 
he who uses his powers of learning in promulgating that truth. It 
was the common people who heard Jesus gladly. These ministers who 
arise in the pulpit and deny Christ's divinity and resurrection, are 
under the condemnation of the Redeemer who said : "That every 
idle word that men shalh speak, they shall give account thereof in 
the day of judgment." The words which deny the divinity of the 
Redeemer are idle words and shall have to be accounted for in the 
day of the great jugment. 

I bear you my testimony that this gospel is true and of God. 
It is the power of God unto salvation, because through the gospel 
have come to light, life and immortality, and Jesus Christ hath abol- 
ished death and brought redemption from sin, death and the grave. 
I bear my humble testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God ; 
and that President Grant stands in the power and right of his calling 
as President of the Church : and oh, how blessed are we who listened 
to his inspiring teachings yesterday morning, when to every heart 
was brought home the great truth that he is favored of God and 
magnified in his calling as President of this Church and the leader 
of this great people. This testimony I bear in humility, in truth, and 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

CLERK OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Edward H. Anderson 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish to say that I have been very gratified indeed with our meet- 
ings here today. I feel that the Lord has abundantly blessed us in our 
gatherings and that we have had a rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit. 

I regret exceedingly that we have to limit our brethren to a very 
few minutes when they speak here. There is hardly one of the brethren 
who has stood upon his feet but what, I am sure, could edify this con- 
gregation for an hour or more if the opportunity were presented ; but 
if you stop to think of the fact that there are twenty-six of the general 
authorities, and that we are anxious to hear from the mission presi- 
dents and from as many stake presidents as we possibly can, you will 
realize that we can only barely have testimonies borne by most of the 
brethren in these conference meetings. 

The congregation sang "High on the mountain top,' 5 and the closing 
prayer was offered by Elder Wallace Calder, president of the Uintah 
stake of Zion. 

The meeting adjourned until Sunday morning, 10 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

Sunday, October 7, 1923. 

At 10 o'clock President Heber J. Grant announced the opening 
of the conference meeting. All the seats in the Tabernacle were occu- 
pied and every available standing space in the building, while many 
were unable to get in. An amplifying device had been arranged so that 
the large congregation assembled at the Bureau of Information and also 
in the Barratt Hall were able to hear the speakers in the Tabernacle. In 
the Assembly J [all, at which an overflow meeting was held, under the 
direction of Bishop David A. Smith, separate speakers were provided. 

The choir and congregation sang. "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Heber S. Allen, of the Taylor stake 
of Zion. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret to say that Brother Whitney's health is of such character 
that he has not been able to be with us during our conference, so far, 
and he feels that he cannot come this morning nor this afternoon. 
1 am pleased to inform you, however, that his health has very greatly 
improved, during the past six months, and that he is again able 
occasionally, in fact nearly always, to meet with us once a week in 
the temple in the regular council meeting of the Presidency, the 
Apostles and the Patriarch. But considering the state of his nerves 
at the present time, he does not feel that it is wisdom to he here and 
mingle with a large crowd. lie is with us in spirit and we hope 
and pray that he may be here in vigor of body and mind six months 
from today. 

The choir sang, ''1 saw a mighty angel fly." 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

Like Elder George F. Richards, I am very thankful this morning 
for these amplifiers, for, like him, I am suffering from a cold which 
somewhat affects my voice. 

TRUE AND FALSE EVOLUTION. 

A gentleman said to me some time ago: "Do vou believe in evo- 
lu'ion?" 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I said, "Yes sir, I do.'' And then I said, "You will remember 
that there are two views of this question of evolution, one bears upon 
true evolution and the other bears upon what I call false evolution." 
And I called his attention to the fact that the scriptures tell us — we 
find it in the first chapter of Genesis — that God created animals after 
their kind — that of man and that of animal — and it is set forth beauti- 
fully in these words : 

"And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 

"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature af- 
ter his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after 
his kind : and it was so. 

"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle 
after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after 
his kind : and God saw that it was good. 

"And God said. Let us make man in our image, after our like- 
ness;" [and we might add: after our kind], "and let them have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and 
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing 
that creepeth upon the earth. 

"So God created man in his own image," [and we might add: 
after his kind] "in the image of God created he him: male and female 
created he them." 

ONE KIND OF ANIMAL NEVER CHANGES INTO ANOTHER KIND. 

And so I remarked that following this test and this view set 
forth by the scriptures, one kind of animal never changes into another 
kind, that an elephant never changes into a man, because if he did 
there would be a tremendous reduction of avoirdupois, and as a matter 
of fact he does not. Neither is a mouse changed into a giraffe. But 
I did remark that animals might be improved after nieir kind and 
along their line, as we know to be the case. And then I added also,, 
that man may be improved along bis own line by education, by study 
and reflection and by worship of the God of heaven. 

TESTIFYING IN SONG AND SERMON THAT JOSEPH SMITH IS A PROPHET 

OF GOD. 

I was thrilled with the opening song this morning. It was 
wonderful that a great congregation of people, numbering thousands, 
should be testifying in song that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; 
and mark you, they have been singing that song into their lives and 
into the hearts of their children for many years. I' have also re- 
joiced, oh, how much, in the testimonies of this congregation, in the 
remarks of our President and the brethren who have spoken. And let 
me remind you, brethren and sisters, that on Friday night there 
was a great body of men gathered in this tabernacle — nineteen hun- 
dred forty-five filled the auditorium of the tabernacle — and these 
men. these solemn, earnest, and determined men, consisting of the 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 



87 



Presidency and other general authorities of the Church — high-priests, 
seventies, elders, bishops and members of the Lesser Priesthood — 
represented and stood for divine authority. Oh. how thankful I am 
that all of the authority of God pertaining to his work does not rest 
Upon the President of the Church, who is the prophet. He carries 
a great responsibility, let me tell you, in holding the keys, and by these 
keys this divine authority is distributed down through the Church, 
and rests upon all the male members of the Church. God is no re- 
specter of persons, because this glorious authority and blessing even 
reaches to the women of the Church, for they will share and do share, 
in this divine authority through their husbands, which emphasizes 
most powerfully the great principle of marriage for time and mar- 
riage for eternity, because this divine authority not only comes tc 
us upon earth, but goes with us into eternity. 

CHURCH GOING FORWARD WITH INCREASING TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL 

POWER. 

Tt seems to me, brethren and sisters, after one hundred years, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which is involved 
the kingdom of God, shows forth great strength in spirituality and 
increasing temporal power. If it were all spiritual, the Church would 
be top-heavy. If it were all temporal, the Church would be top-heavy; 
but the spiritual and the temporal are fitly joined together by a 
dividing line that is invisible — you cannot see it but you know it is 
there — the spiritual merges into the temporal, the temporal merges 
into the spiritual, and thus the Church of God is established and will 
be built up on the earth. 

And now you know, brethren and sisters, why we have to do 
temporal tilings as well as spiritual things. Some people find fault 
with this and they think the leaders of the Church ought not to be 
interested in temporal things. Weil, if they were not interested in 
temporal things the Church of God could not continue, would not be 
built up. So I rejoice in the temporal as well as in the spiritual. 
Think of the great things that have been accomplished already, spiritu- 
ally and temporally. Look at these great temples of God that are 
temporal and material in part, but they represent to us great spiritual 
blessings, because I fancy we could not rise to glory and exaltation 
without the blessings imparted unto us in the temples of God . There 
you see the temporal and the spiritual fitly joined together. 

TESTIMONY. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I glory in these things. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I know it throughout my 
whole being. My soul responds to this testimony, and I know and re- 
joice in the fact that whatever of Priesthood and authority I enjoy 
and am able to exercise have come down to me from the Lord through 
Joseph Smith the Prophet. Oh, how I do revere the memory of 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that man. I do not worship him. No, I do not worship him, but 
I reverence his good name, and I reverence the authority that he 
held and exercised, and I reverence the authority that is held by one 
of his successors, our present leader, President Heber J. Grant. I 
sustain him with all my heart as the prophet, seer and revelator and 
the president of the Church. Oh, how sweet to me is the knowlege 
that Jesus is the Christ, because if he was not the Christ, if his blood 
was not shed for the sins of the world, his Church would not be, 
and could not exist in the earth. This is the testimony I bear and 
the testimony that 1 leave with you. I pray God's blessing upon you, 
brethren and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Eastern States 

(Mission.) 

Recalling the remarks of Elder Reed Smoot made yesterday, 
respecting the sacrifices and the burdens England incurred in the 
World War, I wish to say that I was very proud of England, the 
land of my birth, because I could not help but remember that England 
made those sacrifices, and took upon herself those great burdens of 
debt, not because of any iniquity on her part, but because she was 
determined that international obligations and treaties should be some- 
thing more than mere "scraps of paper." Also I could not but remem- 
ber that when she went to the side of Belgium and France, she did so 
in the interest of world-freedom, and against and to destroy the men- 
ace of autocracy, which endangered the freedom of t'.ie world. Also 
1 could not help but remember that our own burdens in the same great 
war were made comparatively light because England's burden had been 
made so heavy. My heart was moved with great sympathy for Eng- 
land by these reflections, and I pray that, under the blessings <M 
Almighty God, she may be relieved of those great burdens assumed in 
this great cause of human freedom as against autocracy, something 
before a hundred years shall elapse. You will pardon me, but I 
thought it was due that this much at least should be said in the exten- 
sion of what was said yesterday, since just at this particular junction 
our shores are being visited by England's great war Prime Minister, 
Mr. Lloyd George. T am sure, however, you will not expect me to say 
anything further upon this subject; but you will most likely expect 
me to make some reference, in the nature of a report, concerning the 
Eastern States mission, and our summer campaign in that mission. 

Our mission comprises the most densely populated territory within 
the United States. It extends from Maine to Maryland and West 
Virginia, ft is the industrial, commercial, financial, and manufactur- 
ing district preeminent of the United Sta'es. Its population is equal 
to the population of the whole of the United States, nearly, at the time 



ELDER BRIGUAM H. ROBERTS 



89 



our Church was organized. During- the last six months we have had 
a varying number of missionaries, from one hundred and thirty to 
one hundred and forty in the field. This force constitutes an irregular 
and here and there broken line of workers, extending through the 
twelve states that comprize the mission. You can well understand that 
our numbers are very insignificant for so great a field of labor. We 
have less than five thousand as a membership of our Church, in that 
great mass of people, a very little leaven indeed to leaven so large a 
lump of territory and of population. Yet 1 am happy to report that 
the workers of this thin, long line are extremely faithful and devoted 
to the work in which they are engaged. 

MISSION MOTTO 

( )ne of the mottoes by which they are guided in maintaining their 
spiri tial uplift is — 

"A mission in the Eastern States means absolute consecration of 
one's self to the service of God and fellozv men; with all light-minded- 
ness, folly and sin eliminated.'' 

We recognize absolutely the great doctrine of the Christ, expressed 
in these terms: ''Without me ye can do nothing." And so, as a word of 
good cheer to each other to be spoken in moments of sensed weakness 
or hesitance, we say to each other :" Immanuel !" which, being Interpreted 
is, "God with us." And if God be with us, we shall not and cannot fail. 

These are principles that actuate your sons and daughters who are 
performing missionary work in the Eastern States. Our faith is in 
God; our trust is in him; we realize that he is the source of wisdom 
and of power, and that if he does not sustain this work; if he does not 
magnify it in the eyes of men. and does not give us the ability to set 
forth the great message that he has committed to his Church in the 
earth, then we can do nothing. 

the summer's campaign 

The outstanding feature of our work during the last six months 
has been the summer campaign, commenced on the 15th day of May, 
the ninety-fourth anniversary of the restoration of the Aaronic Priest- 
hood to the eanh, the first divine authority officially communicated to 
man in this dispensation of the fulness of times. There was a recon- 
secration of our missionaries in the Eastern States that day to the work 
of the Eord. We had abandoned our lodgings, the elders took in their 
small grips all their earthly possessions, a little clothing and a few 
books, in a way burned their bridges behind them, and went out trust- 
ing in God to open the way for food and raiment and lodging. I think 
very likely if I had not myself had some experience in this kind of work, 
and had not learned how God can and will open the doors of deliverance 
for his servants, supplement their efforts by his own powerful aid. 1 
should not have dared to put your sons and daughters to this great test 
of faith and patience and endurance. But recalling the providences of 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God to me in the early days of my own missionary experience, I did 
not hesitate to put them to the test, and the result has been glorious. 
They were not left to themselves ; God abundantly opened doors to them. 
While they went out seeking disciples, they themselves in many, many 
cases, found God. They also found disciples, and it is a matter that 
greatly encourages me that we found so many of God's disciples in the 
Eastern States mission. He has caused it to be written in one of his 
revelations that "whosoever receiveth God's servants, that clothes them 
or feeds them, or gives them money, the same is his disciple, and by Lhis 
we know God's disciples." (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 84:87-91). And we 
found many disciples. I kept in close touch with the development of 
this work. Through the kindness of one of the brethren in the mission, 
I had placed at my disposal an automobile. We found a chauffeur, 
among the elders, and so I visited many of the missionaries out in their 
fields of labor, where they were traveling, two and two. I joined with 
them in the rural meetings that they were holding, and witnessed their 
sublime effort at fulfilling the duties and obligations as servants of 
God, right in the field. So. throughout the summer I watched the devel- 
opment of this experiment of preaching the gospel, trusting in the Lord 
to open the way. 

THE CONFERENCE AT CUMORAH 

This summer campaign of four months was to culminate in the 
conference that we held at Cumorah, a fitting climax, I thought it 
would be, to the splendid labors of the missionaries in our Eastern 
States mission. I trust it turned out to be a great conference. There 
was one thing said about it in the Rochester Herald that I would like 
to put in the record of this conference, that it might have a permanent 
lodgment in the history of that event. It was written by no tyro of the 
press, but a man of comprehension, and I think also of deep feeling. 
It consists of but two brief paragraphs but the passage is of high value 
as an historical note. It is found in the Roclicstcr Herald of Sept. 22, 
1923, and is as follows : 

"Unfolding like some graphic panorama pf the past, epic in implications 
am! dramatic in content, the story of an ancient civilization that peopled the 
plains and hills in this vicinity was the chief topic of discussion before 
the centennial conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints today. Reaching so far back into the dim yesterdays of history, 
back to days more than 2,500 years ago, this story came with a strange 
emphasis in tite very places where its climaxes and denouements are sup- 
posed to have been reached. The narrative is the very basis of 'Mormon' 
theology and belief and 1 leads directly up to the x revelation given through 
Joseph Smith of the foundations of the 'Mormon' Church. 

"The speakers at the conference told the story with the simplicity and 
directness of a Norse saga. As point after point of drama of the lost tribes, 
of their rise to a great civilization and of their final downfall in the bitter- 
ness of war was related, those not conversant with the tale were gripped 
and fascinated by the strangeness of the recital, and when a speaker 
dramatically pointed to the earth and mentioned that upon the very spot 
where he stood' some of the epic events might have taken place, there was a 
decided thrill to being there." 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



91 



We tried to so arrange the program of the conference that we 
should live again in the places and near places where the chief events 
took place in which the Church of the Latter-day Saints had its origin 
■ — we tried, I say, to live again, so far as we could in story and testi- 
mony and song, through the great epic events that resulted in the crea- 
tion of this latter-day work. It is unnecessary for me to recount the 
visitation of angels and the revelations in which the work had its 
origin. You are familiar with them all. 

THE MESSAGES OF THE BOOK OF MORMON 

There is just one other thing, however — nay, perhaps two, that 
I want to call your attention to. The great outstanding thing in the 
Book of Mormon is the fact of the visit of the Redeemer to the inhabit- 
ants of this western world, and the message of life and salvation that 
he delivered here ; the Church which he brought into existence, the 
divine authority which he established here in the western world. This 
is what makes the Book of Mormon of so much importance — it is a new 
witness for God and Christ and the truth of the gospel. These things 
being true, makes the advent of the Book of Mormon into the world 
the greatest literary event of the world since the writing of the Deca- 
logue by the finger of God, and bringing it forth by the great Prophet 
Moses ; or the collection and the publication of the testimony in the 
New Testament that Jesus is the Christ; that he is the resurrection 
and the life of men ; the greatest event since the recording of the Sermon 
on the Mount, or the summary of the law by Christ : for the Book of 
Mormon is supplemental to all this, the necessary part to a consistent 
whole which manifests the mercy and the justice of God in providing 
these great things of the gospel for the men of the Western world, as 
well as to men in the Eastern world. 

The other thing referred to is this: The Book of Mormon con- 
tains a wonderful message to the great Gentile nation — the United 
States of America — whose rise and supremacy it predicts. If you go 
no further back than 1830, when the Book of Mormon was brought to 
the knowledge of the world, it remains one of the mightiest prophecies 
that is of record — this prophecy of the rise of a great Gentile nation, 
upon this land of America. Here and there also we catch glimpses of 
the fact that the inspired men whom God raised up to found this nation, 
and whom God also raised up to preserve it by their wise counsels — 
here and there, I say, we get glimpses of the fact that God has inspired 
their minds to understand the great principles upon which this nation 
of ours may maintain its pride of place in this Western world, and 
in the whole world. For instance, in his very last public address, made 
before the Historical Society of New York, in 1852, Daniel Webster 
said : 

"Let me say, gentlemen, that if we and our posterity shall be true 
to the Christian religion, if we and they shall live always in the fear of 
God, and shall respect his commandments, if we and they shall maintain 
just, moral sentiments and such righteous convictions of duty as shall con- 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tro! the heart and life, we may have the highest hopes of the future fortunes, 
ot our country; Dut if we and our posterity rej.ect religious instruction 
am" authority, violate the rules of eternal justice, trifle with the injunctions 
ot morality, and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds 
us together, no man can tell how sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm 
us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity." 

And recently, in the Atlantic Monthly, for August of this year, one 
of the foremost statesmen in these modern times, in a very brief article, 
more widely read I think, and more largely commented upon, than any 
other utterance that has been made of late, said this, when treating of 
the subject: "The Road Away from Revolution." Mr. Wilson, Ex- 
president of the United States, for it was he who wrote the article 
referred to, said : 

"The sum of the whole matter is this: that our civilization cannot sur- 
vive materially unless it be redeemed spiritually. It can be saved only by 
becoming permeated with the spirit of Christ, and being made free and 
happy by the practices which spring out of that spirit. 

Only thus can the discontent be driven out, and all the shadows lifted 
from the road ahead." 

But before Mr. Webster made this utterance of warning', and 
long before 1 'resident Wilson uttered these sublime words of warning 
to the American Nation, the Rook of Mormon, ages ago, but brought 
forth into the world in 1830, contains this message from God in respect 
of all this spoken by Webster and by Mr. Wilson: — 

"Behold, this is a choice land, [referring to America] and what- 
soever nation shall posses it shall be free from bondage and from cap- 
tivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve 
the Cod of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested 
by the tilings which we have written." 

Such are the two great messages of the Hook of Mormon revealed 
now some hundred years ago, and they constitute the sublimest message 
ever delivered to the world, because the witnesses whose words are 
within the book, testify of the Christ and of the truth of the gospel, of 
the eternal life of man and his power to become indeed, not only the 
sons of God, but the glorified sons of God: and also because it gives 
to us a sublime message for the great Gentile nation of this land, telling 
them the conditions upon which they may continue to enjoy the favor 
and blessing of God, and maintain their place and power for good in 
the world. 

God has made his Church — this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
dav Saints — his herald to the world concerning these things. May the 
Lord make us equal to so great a mission, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang. "An angel from on high." solos by Sister Sarah 
Wood and J [yrum Christensen. This hymn was sung on the Hill 
Cumorah recently on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the 
visits of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith. On the present 



ELDER SERGE E. BALLIF

occasion only three of the verses were sung. President Heber J. Grant 
read the remainder of the words as follows: 

The time is now fulfilled, 

The long expected day; 
Let earth obedient yield, 

And darkness flee away; 
Remove the seals, be wide unfurled 
Its light and glory to the world. 

Lo, Israel filled with joy, 

Shall now be gathered home, 
Their wealth and power employ 

To build Jerusalem; 
While Zion shall arise and shine; 
And' fill the earth with truth divine. 

Words by Parley P. Pratt. 

ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 

( Former President of the Swiss-German Mission.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I can assure you that my heart 
and soul have been touched to their very depths with the things we 
have heard during this conference. 

We are here assembled in answer to prayer one hundred years 
ago, when that boy prophet went into the woods and called upon 
God. I want to testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know 
beyond all question of doubt that God the Father and Jesus the Re- 
deemer of the world appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
spoke to him in distinct and clear tones in answer to his question: 
"Which of all the religions in the world is correct?" The answer 
came, without a doubt : "They are all wrong," and these words re- 
sound throughout the ends of the earth today — that all the other Chris- 
tian denominations are wrong; they are founded upon a false founda- 
tion. 

I rejoiced in our first session of this splendid conference, when 
I heard our president relate the experiences of the past six months, 
when he told of his dedicating the temple at Cardston. He also re- 
lated his attendance at a conference in Rotterdam. It was my pleas- 
ure to be in attendance at that conference, and at that time I said 
that I never before had felt the Spirit of the Lord in such power 
manifested as it was at that time. It was also my good pleasure to 
be called by the president to attend the conference at Bradford, in 
England, to which he has made reference, and there again we heard 
some wonderful testimonies which made an impression upon my 
soul, which never can be eradicated. I also had the pleasure of ac- 
companying our president through Germany, through Norway, Swe- 
den, and Denmark ; and I also had the pleasure of once being in a 
room with him at one o'clock in the morning. He called me in, and 
he took a newspaper and read from it in the light of the midnight 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sun. And I have thought: O, what a joy it would have been to 
me could I have attended that service at Cardston — the dedication 
of that temple. We have heard that a number of the leading au- 
thorities of the Church were present and men from all parts of the 
Church gathered at that most wonderful gathering. There were the 
presidency, the prophet who holds the keys, the only man upon the 
earth who holds the keys and the powers to commune with God for 
the good and for the advancement of his people here upon the earth. 
Those keys were conferred upon him when he met there to dedicate 
that temple. There were not alone these men, living here in the 
flesh, but I have felt, deep down in my soul, that that great man, 
our prophet and president, Joseph F. Smith, the great leader Brig- 
ham Young, and the Prophet Joseph Smith were present in spirit. 
Why? Because they are not alone interested in the work of the 
living here upon the earth, but they know the conditions on the 
other side, they know that there are thousands who are waiting for 
the ordinances that will be performed in that sacred temple. The 
doors will be unlocked and they will be made free through its or- 
dinances. It must have been a grand and glorious vision and sight 
to see. 

In ispeaking of the services to) which President Roberts has 
referred, this morning, at the Hill Cumorah, I thought when our 
president said that the prayer offered on that occasion was not re- 
corded, that we are making history today for the unborn generations, 
and a servant of the Lord, under the inspiration of God, uttered a 
prayer inspired of Almighty God, and oh, what a joy it would be 
for generations to come to be able to read that divine instrument. I 
know, although I did not see the Angel Moroni when he appeared 
to the Prophet Joseph, that beyonjd all question of doubt, he did de- 
liver those sacred records to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. I re- 
ceived a testimony of this before I was born. My mother received 
the gospel in her native land, and when she passed through the shadows 
of death to bring me into this world she sealed upon me a testimony 
of the divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in this great work. 
If the president will just permit me to do so, I would like to read 
something. In my meditation after the first session of the conference, 
these words came to me : 

O, stop and tell me, Red Man, 
Who are you, why you roam, 
And how you get your living; 
Have you no God, no home? 

With stature straight and portly, 
And decked in native pride, 
With feathers, paints and brooches, 
He willingly replied: 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 



95 



"I once was pleasant Ephraim, 

When Jacob for me prayed; 
But oh, how blessings vanish, 

When man from God has strayed ! 

O, my brethren and .sisters, those words resound in my soul ! O, 
now unhappy, how unfortunate is man when he is left unto himself 
and the Spirit of God is withdrawn from him! 

"Before your nation knew us. 

Some thousand moons ago, 
Our fathers fell in darkness, 

And wandered to and fro. 

'"And long they lived by hunting 

Instead of works and arts, 
And so our race has dwindled 

To idle Indian hearts. 

''Yet hope within us lingers, 

As if the Spirit spoke, 
He'll come for your redemption, 

And break your Gentile yoke. 

"And all your captive brothers 

From every clime shall come, 
And quit their savage customs, 
To live with God at home. 

"Then joy will fill your bosoms, 
And blessings crown our days, 

To live in pure religion, 

And sing our Maker's praise." 

I want to say a word, my brethren and sisters, about the Swiss 
and German mission. I believe that it is one of the greatest missions 
in all the world. I believe that the blood of Israel is found in rich 
abundance in those lands. There are ninety millions of people in Ger- 
many, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and the borders of Russia. It has 
been my pleasure to travel over that land and. I want to say that God 
has touched the hearts of those people ; he has prepared them ; they 
have gone through the burning siege of persecution; they have suf- 
fered ; and I want to say that the poor people in Germany today are 
suffering, they are going through an ordeal that few people in the 
world have gone through. The rich are growing richer; but the poor, 
honest people, many of them, I fear, will be hungering before another 
year passes by. I am in touch with President Tadje, of the Swiss 
and German mission, a good, faithful servant of the Lord. In that 
mission we have thirteen conferences, and he is visiting them. He has 
been in very poor health for a short time, but today his health is re- 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



stored and he is traveling among those conferences and increasing 
the numbers, and the great thing that he needs today is help. The 
people are ready, they are waiting for the gospel. Oh, if we could 
just go through that land — the borders of Russia and all through that 
country! Those people are impregnated with the blood of Israel. They 
are waiting for the message, and we are living in the last dispensation, 
the dispensation of the fulness of times, when God has spoken, and he 
has called us, and our mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
to warn the world and establish his ' kingdom here upon the earth. 
Oh, my brethren, let us help these people! They are hungering and 
thirsting, they are traveling from sea to sea and hunting for the 
word of God. 

I want to say just a few words about our missionaries. Those 
boys over there are working with all the might and strength and power 
they have. God qualifies and fits them for their mission. The Lord 
transforms them when they come into the mission field as humble 
elders, faithful and true to their covenants. 1 want to endorse the re- 
marks of President Roberts. I know through exnerience, beyond the 
question of doubt, that the best way to proclaim the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the way that our Maker, the lowly Master, without a place to 
lay his head, proclaimed his mission among his children I am convinced 
that if your sons will go into the mission field, depending upon God and 
not upon their pocket-books, 1 promise you that the Lord will come 
to them, he will come to their rescue : he will bless them and provide 
them with food and with every necessity of life. 

The other day I met a person here in the city and he said : "Well, 
it is a mighty nice thing to go out on a mission and draw a big salary 
and have a good time, like you have." 

I want to testify to you that this is not a Church with a hired 
ministry. I have been in the mission-field in 1890, 1904 and 1920. 1 
have spent twelve years of my life in the mission field, and I never 
have received one penny of salary, not one penny. The Lord has 
blessed me. He has raised up friends to minister to my wants, and 
I want it understood, absolutely, so far as I know, .so far' as f am con- 
cerned, there is no paid ministry in the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. But, on the contrary, when a man goes into the mis- 
sion field depending upon the Lord, he will bless him and raise up 
friends and give him money and clothing, all that he needs. I know 
it, I demonstrated it in this last mission. We had many elders there 
who went from month to month, depending upon the Lord to take care 
of them. I hope Brother Stoff is here in this house — one of our mis- 
sionaries who depended upon the Lord. At one time he was called 
to go several hundred miles. He hadn't a penny in his pocket, and he 
said : How can I go and attend that conference ? He did not ask me, 
but he went direct to the Lord, and the Lord knew his condition, and 
he prayed to him: "O Father, I am called to fill a mission; open the 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 



97 



way for me." Two days passed 1 by and no answer came to his prayer. 
The third day he started out. He said : I am going if I have to walk. 
He met a man, as he left the building, who said : "Where are you go- 
ing?" 

"I am going to a conference." 

He put his hand in his pocket and gave him. 1 think, two hundred 
marks. It was not very much, but it was more than enough to pay 
his way. How did that happen? Was that a chance? Was that luck? 
No, there is no such thing as chance and luck. The Lord sent that 
man in answer to his prayer and he administered to his wants and 
made it possible for him to go and attend that conference. Give the 
Lord a chance and he will bless his servants. This is his work, and! he 
has set his hand to accomplish it here in the earth. God bless you. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
California Mission) 

I rejoice very much, my brethren and sisters, in the opportunity 
afforded me of being present in this great conference, and I have re- 
joiced, more than I expect to be able to tell, in the spirit of the coiv 
ference, and in the remarkable things that have been brought forth 
from the servants of the Lord by the power aqd inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord. My heart was made glad, in the opening ses- 
sion, by the manifestation of the power of God, and the spirit of pres- 
idency and leadership that were so evident in the counsels and in- 
structions that were imparted by President Heber J. Grant in his 
opening address. I surely felt in my soul that the Lord our God 
was present, that he was directing and guiding his work in keep- 
ing with the promises that have been made, both by the prophets 
of this dispensation, and by the prophets of the Lord from the very 
beginning of time. There has been sounding in my ears the declar- 
ation made, again and again, by the Lord of heaven in the revela- 
tions that were given to the prophet of this dispensation in the be- 
ginning of this work. You who are familiar with the book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants know that many of those revelations commence 
with language something like this : "Behold, a marvelous and won- 
derful work is about to come forth among the children of men." I 
could not help but think, as I looked upon this vast congregation, 
how wonderfully the promise of the Lord has been fulfilled that 
was made through the mouth of his prophet, even before there was 
any Church organization. I take it that nowhere upon the face of 
the whole earth this Sabbath day is there such a gathering to worship 
God as we have here in this great tabernacle, to say nothing of the 
thousands who are gathered in other buildings upon this ground.

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



It seems astounding to me that men who observe the ever increas- 
ing strength of this cause cannot discern the hand of God and his 
power in this work of the latter times. 

Many years ago, when I was laboring in the British mission, 
I attended upon one occasion a lecture that was delivered by Mr. 
Charles H. Bradlaugh. His lecture was entitled, "Is Christianity 
a persecuting religion?" And he told a most terrible story of the 
things that had been perpetrated in the name of religion. A young 
man in the congregation wanted to know from him if it was not 
an evidence of the power of God and the existence of God, that those 
early Christians in the meridian of time, notwithstanding the fact 
that the wisdom and strength of the nations were opposed to them, 
were preserved and made to prosper? I wondered what manner 
of answer could be made. [ thought in my own soul: ''Surely the 
history of those early Christians is an evidence of the protecting 
hand of God." I was very greatly surprised when that great in- 
tellectual giant made answer, for his answer was : "Young man, 
away out in the Western part of America there is a people whose 
history is more wonderful than anything that has ever been written 
of the early Christians. That people have not only been opposed by 
the nations of the world, but they have had to contend with the re- 
ligious prejudices of all mankind, and in spite of all this opposition, 
the}' have made more wonderful advancement than was ever made 
by the early Christians. I speak of the 'Mormon' Church of Utah. 
Do you think their preservation is an evidence of the power of God ?" 

My brethren and sisters, I don't know what may have been in 
the minds of that company of men who heard that lecture, but in 
my own soul there was a very great degree of joy and satisfaction 
in the thought that when Mr. Bradlaugh, with all his intelligence, 
sought for a religious organization that would parallel the history 
of the early Christians, he had to go to my people and to my Church, 
and I was convinced that he singled out the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints for the reason that they more completely di3 
parallel the history of the early Christians than any other religious 
denomination upon the face of the earth. 

When I was on my last mission in Great Britain I picked up 
in one of the great cathedrals, a pamphlet which was headed : "Why 
I am a Roman Catholic." I think it would not be amiss right here 
to read a paragraph or two from that pamphlet. It was written by 
a Catholic priest : 

And again, when Luther, Calvin, Henry VIII, and their followers were 
starting in their mad career, either the true religion was then in the world or it 
was not. There isn't any room for argument in relation to that declaration. 
Of necessity the true religion was either in the world or it was not. If it 
was they committed grievous crimes in making new religions to oppose it. 
And if the scriptures be true, that statement is just as true as the first de- 
claration, for we can read in the scriptures of divine truth the testimony of 
the Apostle Paul, that "though we, or an angel from heaven preach any other 



ELDER JOSEPH W. Mc'MURRIN 



99 



gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be 
accursed." 

So declared the ancient man of God as he was lit up by the in- 
spiration and power of God. So that this priest was fully justified 
in making the statement that I have read, that if the true religion 
was in the world in the days of those reformers, the reformers com- 
mitted a grievous sin in seeking lo establish other religions in op- 
position to the truth. 

If it was not, they were powerless to create it. It takes a Christ,, 
not a Luther, to create a Christianity. On either supposition, there- 
fore, Protestantism is not the true religion of Jesus Christ. 

I believe in that doctrine. It matters not how earnest may have 
been the desire, or how anxious to do good on the part of the men 
that we speak of as the reformers, if the true religion had vanished 
from the earth, they did not have power to create it or restore it. 
Thank God, in the dispensation in which we live, we do not assume 
an authority without revelation, like the religions of the day. We are 
in harmony with the declaration that is made by this Catholic priest: 
that because of the absence from among men of the truth of God that 
was revealed for the salvation of the human family, it was necessary 
that the author of that religion who is the source of power and au- 
thority should restore it. The message of "Mormonism" is that in the 
dispensation in which we live the Lord our God, and his Son, our 
Redeemer, and holy angels, who formerly exercised authority as mor- 
tal men, have come to earth in their resurrected bodies and they have 
restored that lost authority. When the infidel could see the marvel- 
ous character of this work, when the Catholic priest could discern the 
fact that if the truth of God had been lost from the earth, it could 
only be restored by the Redeemer of the world, surely we who have 
received the restored gospel ought to comprehend that fact, and in our 
souls there should be that joy that passeth understanding. 

I am glad to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that this testi- 
mony and understanding is in the hearts of the men and women who 
have been assigned to labor as missionaries in the preaching of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the California mission, and not- 
withstanding the fact that they are young men and young women, 
that they have had but little experience, by the mysterious power of 
God there has come into their souls an absolute conviction that Jesus 
is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, and according to their 
strength and power and ability, they are delivering that message to 
the people in the California mission. God, in some mysterious way, 
touches the hearts of men and women, no matter how weak the in- 
strument that delivers his word, and brings conviction to the souls 
of men, and they come out from the darkness that is in the world and 
from the religious nonsense that many are teaching, and receive gladly 
the truth of God that has been revealed. It has been revealed, 
men and women, the heavens have been opened, the Lord our God

has made his appearance, divine authority has been conferred upon 
men. I would to God that we had the power to declare it in the 
ears of all who live, for it is the truth of God. May our Father in 
heaven so bless us that we may be true to the faith and work out our 
salvation, and so let our light shine before men that they will be led 
from darkness to the light that has thus been made manifest, and 
plant their feet in the path that has been revealed — for, as God Al- 
mighty lives, the truth has been revealed that will take men back into 
the presence of the Lord our God. May we all travel in that path 
faithfully all the days of our lives, I humbly pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

(Patriarch of the Church.) 

I am very grateful indeed, my brethren and sisters, for the 
opportunity to add my testimony to the glorious truths, and principles 
that have been treated in this conference. 

It was my privilege to attend the dedicatory services of the 
Alberta Temple, and I am very grateful for that sacred privilege. 

I have enjoyed the testimonies of my brethren concerning their 
visit at the Hill Cumorah. Kver since my early childhood, the 
story of Joseph the Prophet concerning his wonderful experiences 
lias been a very touching story in my life, and I can scarcely read it 
or bear it related without tears coming to my eyes. It was a most 
astounding declaration, for a boy seventeen years of age to make to 
his friends or his loved ones in a little family gathering, that his 
name had been named by heavenly messengers, and the statement 
made that his name should be had for good and ill in all the world, 
among all kindreds, tongues and peoples. Hundreds of us living 
bear the testimony from experience in the world, among all civilized 
nations, that this is a fact, for the name of Joseph Smith has been 
heard and is spoken of today for good and ill in all the vvorld among 
civilized nations thereof. 

Another very startling declaration made to that boy was that he 
was to be the instrument in the hands of the Lord in receiving that 
glorious message which had been foretold hundreds of years before, 
that in the last days the Lord would restore the keys and powers 
of the holy Priesthood at the hands of Elijah the Prophet. Some 
one was to be prepared to receive the keys. This youth declared to 
his father and his mother, his brothers and his friends that this 
message had been delivered unto him during the night of September 
21, 1823. About twelve years later this glorious truth was fulfilled, 
for the Prophet and his associates declared that the Prophet Elijah 
came and delivered to them in the Kirtland temple these most glorious 
keys of power, and many have borne witness that these keys have 
been turned for the blessing of both the living and dead. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



101 



I bear my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know 
from my brief experience in the Church, that these keys of power 
are in the Church today, and that not only those in the Church but 
hundreds out of the Church have been influenced by this glorious 
mission of Elijah, for their hearts are being turned toward their 
fathers, both living and dead. Genealogical organizations all over 
the world have been and are being organized. Great efforts have 
been put forth, and family circles, both in the Church and out of the 
Church, have been organized, records have been established and hun- 
dreds of people know not why they are making this great effort; 
but little by little, as time goes on, more of the representatives of the 
families hear the sound of the everlasting gospel and come out of 
the world, if they are not already out of it, and are privileged through 
the inspiration of the call of the Lord to go into these holy houses 
prepared for him, and dedicated to his name, for his purposes, that 
in the day of the Lord the great curse which was referred to by the 
Prophet Elijah should not come upon the earth, but that the families 
may be united in the bonds of a family circle forever and forever. 
I know, my brethren and sisters, that the keys of this great work 
are in the hands of the authorities of the Church today upon the earth, 
and I am very grateful, indeed, that I have been permitted to officiate 
for both living and dead in these sacred houses. 

My heart is full of the warmth of the truth concerning these 
blessings, and I pray that God will continue to bless us, that we may 
do our part when called to labor, whether at home or abroad, that 
his glorous blessings may come to all, that the families of the world, 
the great posterity of Adam and Eve may, in the due time of the Lord 
be enabled to find their own names and places in the fold of Christ. 
I pray, my brethren and sisters, that we may all find our places, that 
we may be able to stand in them and be found in them when the Lord's 
call comes to us. Whether the service required of us be small or 
great, may the Lord find us in our places and prepared to serve and 
labor to bring about his glorious purposes. 

May the Lord bless us in all our endeavors to do good in all 
the world, to know the truth, to defend it, and to live it, in our homes 
and in our labors wherever called to labor, that his blessings may be 
upon this great work and all who are engaged in it, from the Presi- 
dent to the least and last one called, whether at home or abroad, is 
my prayer and blessing for us all in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The inspired hymn that Elder Ballif read was also one of the 
hymns sung at the conference at the Hill Cumorah. The author of 
it is William W. Phelps. 

David O.. McKay is absent from us, as you all know, he is per- 
forming an excellent work, presiding over the European mission and

also over the British mission, and is accomplishing a splendid labor. 
We hear from him frequently. He is thoroughly enjoying his work. 

The choir sang an anthem, "God is our refuge and strength. - ' 
Prayer was offered by Elder E. Frank Birch, president of the Tin- 
tic stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a.m., Sunday morning, October 7, 1923. 

Elder David A. Smith, of the Presiding Bishopric, presided. 

Music and singing were furnished by the Holliday ward choir, 
Cottonwood stake, under the direction of Charles R. Pike, with Tracy 
Y. Cannon, organist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel." 
Prayer was offered by Elder Don C. Walker, Rigby, Idaho. 
The choir sang, "Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell." 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach nnto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God 1 , and give glory to him; for the 
hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and 
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

During this most splendid conference, my brethren and sisters, 
frequent reference has been made to the fact that we commemorate 
in this conference the one hundredth anniversary of the coming of that 
angel to earth with a dispensation of the everlasting gospel to preach 
unto the children of men everywhere. Truly it is remarkable to review 
the past one hundred years of achievement by this people, and it is mar- 
velous when we contemplate that from that humble beginning there has 
grown the mighty Church of. which we now form a part. And truly 
we cannot contemplate without believing, it seems to me, that this 
Church is the answer to those prophetic words, when we contemplate 
that this gospel has been and is being preached in all the world as a 
witness unto all people everywhere, and the honest in heart from out the 
nations of the earth are being gathered together in bodies and in organ- 
izations, and are being taught more fully in the gospel plan. 

We note, from the scripture that I have read, that this gospel is 
eternal. It is everlasting ; it is unchangeable ; it is today what it was yes- 



ELDER REV L. PRATT 



103 



terday, and will always continue to be the same. There are manv 
churches uponi the face of the earth ; there are many systems that are 
called the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I should like to analyze this morn- 
ing, for a few brief moments, this word. I shall refer you to the defini- 
tion of the gospel as given by Paul in his epistle to the Roman Saints. 
He says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ ; for it is the 
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew 
first, and also to the Greek." So that we see in this gospel as established 
very distinctly two things : it is eternal, and it is the power of God 
unto the salvation of all men who will believe it. And the Savior said, 
"'He that believes on me, the work that I do he will do also." So that 
true belief implies, not a lip confession, but works that will harmonize 
our lives with the principles, the ordinances, the teachings of the gospel, 
and the commandments of our Father in heaven. An article of our 
faith states, "We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all man- 
kind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the 
gospel." 

We have in the world a great many faiths and a great many gos- 
pels. But let us apply the test for a moment to them. We find 
recorded in scripture, words to this effect, that no unclean thing can 
enter into the kingdom of our Father in heaven. The man who is a 
thief, who is a liar, who is an adulterer, who is unclean in any sense 
of the word, cannot enter the kingdom of our Father in heaven. But 
the gospel is given as a power of salvation from those very things. 
Now, I ask you to reflect for a moment and answer the question to 
yourselves : In all the history of the great Catholic church, has it been 
able to save the world from sin? I do missionary work in a Catholic 
country, and I recognize the fact, my brethren and sisters, that there are 
many, many sincere people who live the best they can, considering the 
light that they have, but I want to tell you that sin exists today perhaps 
to a greater degree than it has ever existed before in that Catholic 
country, and the "power of God unto salvation" of the Catholic people 
is not being manifest through their church nor through the gospel that 
they preach. 

Now, I ask you, my brethren and sisters, in the three or four hun- 
dred years' existence of the Protestant churches in the world, have the 
Protestant gospel been able to rid the world of sin? It seems to me, 
as we read in the current press that we are constrained to believe that 
perhaps as much today as in any age of the world's history, there is 
crime, there is vice, and there is disloyalty among the children of men, 
people professing to have the gospel of Jesus Christ. 1 ask you. if it is 
what Paul says the gospel is, why then is it not operative in the lives 
of these people ? Can they, consistent with the scripture teaching, be 
saved in our Father's kingdom before some power is applied in their 
lives to cleanse them from sin and save them from it? Why, no. In 
the Book of Revelation, the Apostle John says, ''Come out of her 
[speaking of Babylon], my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, 
and that ye receive not her plagues." 



104 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Has the gospel, as revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
as restored by the angel that flew through the midst of heaven one hun- 
dred years ago been a power unto salvation, unto the children of our 
Father in heaven who have received it? You know yourselves that it 
has been ; in some instances, of course, more and in some instances less. 
But because it has not operated in the full cleansing from sin of all 
those who have received it, judge not that the whole system is wrong, 
for those who have obeyed it have been able to overcome the tendencies 
in their nature that were contrary to the precepts of our Father in 
heaven ; they have been able to harmonize their lives to his will. 

Attention has been called during this conference to the Word of 
Wisdom. Our beloved President calls that document a letter sent from 
our Father in heaven to his children here for their guidance. Now. 
those who have lived it have found even a temporal salvation. They 
have found their bodies made healthier, stronger ; their resistance 
greater, their minds keener; and their intellects brighter; and they 
have wisdom, yea even hidden treasures of wisdom, and the hand of the 
destroyer has passed those people by as it has not passed any other 
people on the face of the earth ; for statistics prove the wonderful fact 
that the death-rate per thousand among the "Mormon" people is lower 
than perhaps among any other people in all the world. If it can do 
this, then it is, in its operation in our lives, the very power of God unto 
salvation. 

On the first Sunday of last month I was in San Antonio, Texas, 
in a fast meeting, and we had our Saints bear their testimonies upon 
that day, as they do at home, testifying of the goodness of our heavenly 
Father to them ; and one little woman, in fear and trembling, stood up 
in the back of the hall. She had only been a member of the Church 
for five months, but she testified that she knew the gospel to be true, 
and she gave as one of her reasons the following; "From my infancy, in 
the home of my parents, I was given coffee to drink. I grew up with 
the idea that I could not live without it. When I became a wife, in my 
home, we continued to use it. But for the last five or six years I have 
been practically a nervous wreck. I did not know what was the matter 
with me. All I wanted was my coffee. I did not care for food. I 
was becoming so weakened that it looked as if I would have to take to 
my bed. And the elders of the Church of jesus Christ came to me with 
the message of the gospel, and among other things they taught me the 
Word of Wisdom, and the Lord has said that coffee, among other 
things, is not good for man." She testified that she could not sleep, she 
could not rest, she was nervous and near to break down, but when she 
received the waters of baptism, she discarded along with her other 
bad habits, the habit of coffee drinking. And she says, "Here I stand, 
a witness before God today, that 1 have been benefited ; my health has 
returned to me ; my appetite has returned ; my ability to rest and sleep 
has returned." 

Can we say. then, that the gospel, as we have received it, is not the 
power of God unto salvation? It is even in that sense in the life of 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



105 



that little woman? And so it will be in every other instance wherein 
we apply it. 

All the ills of this world can be corrected by living the principles 
of this restored gospel. There need be no more war, there need be no 
more bloodshed, there need be no more strife, there need be no more 
dishonesty between and among the children of men, if men will only live 
the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. No man needs to knock 
at the door of heaven with his garments soiled with the sins of the 
world and of the generations in which he lives, if he will apply the 
blessed principles of repentance, if he will receive repentantly and in 
faith the ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; 
for although his sins may be as scarlet, in the blessed blood of our 
Redeemer, through compliance with these ordinances, he will be washed 
white as snow, and he shall enter, a new-born creature, into the king- 
dom of God, even as a little child, even in the similitude of that com- 
parison made by the Redeemer himself, when his disciples asked, "Who 
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" and he called a little child 
and placed him in their midst, and said, "Whosoever therefore, shall 
humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom 
of heaven." 

Now, brethren and sisters, I know that the gospel is true. I 
know, and bear you my witness here today, that verily the angel did 
fly and he did come and he did converse with the boy prophet Joseph 
Smith, and he did deliver in due time into his hands the records that 
were for the first time shown him a hundred years ago, and the boy, 
through the inspiration and revelations direct from our Father in 
heaven, translated that most wonderful book, the Book of Mormon. It 
contains a history of the fulness of the everlasting gospel. It is being 
preached in all the world, and it will continue to be preached until every 
creature shall have heard the warning message. 

It is being preached, my brethren and sisters, with a double pur- 
pose, first to save those who will accept, who will believe and who will 
obey the sacred teaching of the gospel ; and second, it is being preached 
as a witness against those who will not do so. I tell our missionaries, 
in the mission when they are discouraged sometimes with the fact that 
more are not receiving the gospel, that if they are conscientiously and 
humbly and earnestly declaring their message in the world, they are 
ridding themselves of all responsibility. The responsibility of carrying 
this message, of a truth, rests upon the membership of this Church, but 
when we carry it forth, as I have said, and declare it to the people, then 
we roll the responsibility from off our shoulders onto the shoulders of 
the people of the world and they are left without an excuse. 

We have not done it all, by any means, owing to the magnitude of 
the work in the missionary field. We at home, I sometimes think, little 
realize it. I wonder, sometimes, if we at home are inculcating into our 
family spirit the missionary spirit of this Church. W T e cannot, my 
brethren and sisters, side-step the issue, it is before us. The signs of 
the time point to the fact that the end is near. One of the brethren 



106 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



said yesterday, "how hear we are not willing' even to recognize." And 
still I recall that this gospel, this everlasting gospel, this gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which is the power of God unto salvation, must yet be 
preached even more extensively than it ever has been preached ; for the 
Savior said that as the culminating incident that should precede his 
second coming, "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in 
all the world, for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end 
come." Until we have done our full duty that responsibility weighs 
heavily upon us. 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord to attend this Church. I further 
testify that not only do I know, my brethren and sisters, that the man 
chosen of God to initiate this great movement in the world was a pro- 
phet of God, but likewise that each of his successors, even to the man 
who stands in our midst today, Heber J. Grant, is a prophet of God. 
He speaks with divine appointment and by divine power, and it is for us 
to listen to the word of the Lord as it comes through him. We should 
cast out from us evil, and just so far as the gospel has not been able to 
perfect us, it illustrates the fact that it is not applied in our lives to the 
full extent that it might be applied. If I drink liquor, if I smoke tobac- 
co, if I lie, if I gamble, if I steal, it is not an evidence that the gospel is 
not true; it is merely an evidence that I might have all the wires and 
globes, but the current of light is not turned on in my life. The Holy 
Ghost, that was given me as a spiritual birth in the kingdom of God, is 
not permitted to operate, because I choose to love darkness rather than 
light. 

So let us clean up our own houses. Let us take the word of the 
Lord that came to us in the opening" address of this conference, and 
as parents live and breathe in our family circle such a spirit that we can 
correct the evil tendencies of the age in our own children. I am a 
parent, and 1 realize what that means. No one knows better than I. 
perhaps, what a great responsibility it is to keep boys and girls 
going just right. My boys and girls have to live out in the world; they 
are not surrounded with all the environments here, and if it were not 
for a home influence, they would be just like the world, I am sure: 
so we have to strive to keep that alive. 

I do not wish to occupy more of your time. May the Lord bless 
you and help us to live more in harmony with his teachings, and to 
clean up our own homes and our own lives, that we may live so that 
the gospel of Jesus Christ can be in our lives in very deed the power 
of God unto salvation, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY 

(President of the Canadian Mission.) 

My dear brethren and sisterss If there ever was a time when 
I stood in the presence of a congregation of people and needed the 



ELDER JOSEPEI QUINNEY 



107 



Spirit of God, it is the present time. I appreciate fully the great 
responsibility that rests upon an elder who is called upon to occupy 
a place of this kind in delivering the message of life and .salvation 
to the children of men, therefore I do humbly pray with all the power 
that I have that I shall be directed in my remarks this morning by the 
Spirit and influence of our Father in heaven. 

If there is any one thing that has impressed itself upon me more 
than another during the sessions of this conference, it is the positive- 
ness with which the message has been delivered to the Saints residing 
in the stakes of Zion, and I am convinced, as I have listened to these 
messages of truth, that God has never permitted anything to come 
into the world pertaining to life and salvation but what that message 
has carried with it a positiveness that has not been misunderstood. And 
I have wondered, as I have listened to these inspired discourses, as 
they have come from the lips of the Prophet and the apostles of 
the Lord, how it is possible for us to doubt the divinity of this great 
and mighty work as it has been established in this dispensation of 
the fulness of times. 

I have wondered if there could have been any other way of present- 
ing and introducing the gospel of Jesus Chrict, other than the way 
in which it was introduced into the world. God has a message 
to deliver. Who but he could have delivered that message with more 
positive understanding? When I reflect upon that vision that came 
to Joseph Smith the Prophet, I realize and appreciate its power 
and importance. I must come to the conclusion that God has estab- 
established his work here upon the earth, because of ttie fact that it 
was so important that he came and introduced his Son Jesus Christ, 
who is the author of our salvation, to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and com- 
manded him to listen to the Redeemer of the world. This, to my mind, 
is the greatest event in the history of the human race and bears wit- 
ness of the fact that whenever God has a message to deliver to the child- 
ren of men pertaining to their eternal salvation he speaks to them in no 
uncertain terms and impresses upon their souls the necessity of coming 
in contact with the divine, in order that they may become qualified to 
assume the great responsibilities that are resting upon them from time to 
time. Subsequently, when it became necessary to fulfil the prophecy 
that we have heard read to us this morning, that same positiveness, 
that same assurance accompanied the message that was delivered to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, as was delivered to him when God, in his maj- 
esty and glory, together with his Son Jesus Christ appeared to him. 

I would like to read again a passage because of the strength and 
the power that it conveys. It refers to a time when God's judgments 
were to be poured out upon the inhabitants of the earth as a witness that 
he had spoken through the instrumentality of his holy angels, and sub- 
sequently through his Prophet Joseph Smith here upon the earth: 

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 



108 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to 
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for 
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, 
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

Now, in connection with the delivery of this message, I want to call 
attention to one or two important things ; first of all, this message of the 
gospel should come in the day of God's judgment, and it should come 
in a time when we were to call upon him and worship him who made 
heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters. And this is 
a day of God's judgments. So important and so mighty was this gospel 
message that was committed to this angel that it was necessary for him 
to come not only once in that night when he delivered himself with the 
power and glory of God, hut it was necessary for him to repeat that 
message — not just once or twice or thrice, with the identical words, ac- 
companied with the power of the Priesthood that he held, but it be- 
came necessary upon the following day for him to appear with the same 
glory and majesty and power, so that there would be no mistake made in 
the delivering of that gospel message. 

And these are things, my brethren and sisters, that make this work 
stand out as the great gospel plan of God, as he has revealed it to the 
children of men through his divine and inspired prophet in this day and 
time. And I want to say to you that as we carry this message to 
the hearts of the children of men, we are convinced as we give our 
testimony that God speaks, and speaks with that power that causes 
strength to be added to the testimonies that we have in the mission 
field, and we are able, through this divine power of God to develop 
that love within our souls for the hearts and the souls of the chil- 
dren of men, so that they may understand and appreciate what God 
has said in this day and time. It is a mighty message, a message, 
my brethren and sisters, that our sons and our daughters are car- 
rying with them in humility; and understanding the pow r er there 
is in humility, they pray as they never prayed in, all their lives 
before, so that they can come in direct contact with that union that 
connects them with God the eternal Father. 

I bear my testimony that I know, as I know that I live, that 
God speaks to his prophets here upon the earth, because I am a 
living witness in seeing the fulfilment of prophecy in the convinc- 
ing of the, honest in heart of the divinity of this great work, I have 
heard them testify that they have been lit up to that extent that 
they have had the courage of their convictions to come and 
apply for baptism and testify of God's great and mighty power. I 
know that he lives, and I know that this is his Church. I am a 
living manifestation of his power. I have been raised, as it were, 
from the dead, to life eternal, and I bear witness of God's power 
as it has been made manifest through his holy priesthood. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY

God grant that we will appreciate, as the days come and go, 
the power there is in this Church, the divine instruments that 
we have in proclaiming and living this great religion that has 
come to "-us. O, may we be humble and prayerful and bring into 
our very souls a love for one another and appreciate the injunction 
that Christ himself gave when he made that declaration in answer to 
the question, Which of all the commandments is the greatest? "Love 
the Lord thy God with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with 
all thy mind," and then, "Love thy neighbor as thyself." 

God grant that we will take advantage of this privilege granted 
unto us of cultivating that divine love, that there will be strength 
added to the testimonies that we already have, that we may have the 
courage of our convictions and convey this truth in power and in 
strength, to the convincing of the thousands who are ready to under- 
stand it and accept it. God bless these remarks to our good and us 
to the service of God is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A tenor solo was sung by Elder John Bowers, entitled, "Hosanna." 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

(President of the Northern States Mission.) 

I Avill read a few of the words of Moroni to the people : 

"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be 
wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful 
the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam, even 
down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your 
hearts." 

It seems to me that this verse is a preparation to the people 
who may read this holy book, that they shall have in their hearts 
a desire to know the truth, and to have brought to their remembrance 
the fact that God has been good to his children upon the earth ; and 
that, irrespective of the many things that they have done which have 
been evil in his sight, God has been willing to forgive them, make him- 
self manifest to them, and bear record of the truthfulness of his word. 
W hen we realize how good God has been to us, then desire and hope 
come into our hearts, and make us humble before God, and we rather feel 
that God will also be merciful unto us, his children, and bring testimony 
into our hearts. I dare say that whoever reads this holy book, and 
reads this first verse, will have a desire that God shall be merciful to 
him, as he has been merciful unto his people before: 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost." 

What we can know and find out for oursleves is the truthfulness 



110 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



of God's word to us as found in the Holy Scriptures and in the Book of 
Mormon. If we shall have real intent in our hearts to know, then God. 
will manifest the truth of these things by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Some, even among our own people, will think from reading these words 
that they can commence at the beginning of the Book of Mormon and 
read it through and a divine testimony will come of the truthfulness 
of the book. We are forgetting that we must have a desire in our 
hearts to know and have real intent and sincerity back of us ; and then 
shall the testimony of God the eternal Father come to us as to the truth- 
fulness of this holy book. 

God always has left testimony and has borne the same to all of 
his people that they may know of the truthfulness of his work. It 
is the testimony given to us through the power of the Holy Spirit of 
God that makes! us know of its truthfulness. I am not leaving out the 
fact that we must study, that we shall seek God, that God is intelligence ; 
I am not forgetting all of these things, but by the power and the gift 
of the Holy Ghost comes testimony in our hearts. 

God, speaking unto his people at the baptism of the Savior, bore 
record to the people and to the world, "This is my beloved Son." When 
he appeared to the Nephites, God bore testimony again, "This is my 
beloved Son." In this day, unto Joseph Smith, God again bore testi- 
mony, "This is my Son." And who can read in the Book of Mormon 
or the Doctrine and Covenants, or the Bible, the simple testimony of 
God, "This is my beloved Son," and with a prayer in his heart, with- 
out feeling that God is speaking to us, and that we know for a surety 
that God lives and that Jesus Christ is the Son? 

You remember when the sons of Helaman went out to war for 
their liberty against their own people that they said in speaking to 
the people, "We do not doubt our mothers knew it." The testimony 
of God had been given to the two thousand by the testimony of their 
mothers at home. It was that simple, beautiful statement, that came 
from the lips of the mother that made the boys seek after God the 
eternal Father, and they did not doubt, because, by the power of the 
Holy Ghost came testimony into their hearts. 

As a boy, I used to go to fast meeting and wonder why father 
and mother would insist that I go to a meeting of that kind, where 
men and women were standing up one after another and saying, "I 
know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God." How well they knew that, as I sat Sunday 
after Sunday in the meeting hearing what to me are now beautiful 
testimonies, that testimony was coming into my heart and helping me 
to understand that God indeed does live and that Jesus Christ is his 
Son. 

You mothers and fathers, bear testimony in our fast meetings, and 
our other meetings, as to the truthfulness of God's work, that the 
people may hear your testimony, but I sometimes wonder how often 
we take our boys and our girls on one side, or how often we gather 



ELDER JOHN II, TAYLOR 111 

them before the family fire, and when all is peaceful and quiet, bear 
testimony as fathers and mothers to the girl and the boy and let them 
know from our lips that God lives and that he has spoken again in 
these latter clays. That testimony shall stay with the boys and with 
the girls and go with them into many lands and fields, and some day, 
because of the simple testimony from the father and the mother, that 
boy and that girl shall bear testimony unto the world of the truthfulness 
of God's gospel, because you made it possible and softened their hearts 
that they wanted to know 1 for themselves as to the truthfulness of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I am grateful for this gospel. I am glad that it is a gospel where 
you have to fight your own fight ; for, not forgetting the beloved 
mercies of God the eternal Father and his Son — not forgetting all of 
these wonderful things — after all, it is an individual fight with the 
help of God to win your life through and make it worth while. Jesus 
Christ presented his plan, and the son of the morning presented his 
plan. We accepted the plan of Christ, and now Satan, it seems to me, 
would lull us into the sleep of forgetfulness that we havd accepted the 
plan of Jesus Christ, which meant free agency, and brought us to 
the fighting ranks, into the front of the line ; and he sought to substi- 
tute his plan which lost out once, and must ever lose because it is not a 
just plan. If we win out, it is through the mercies of God and the 
lives that we live. I would rather lose the fight and pay the penalty, 
and belong to the Church of Jesus Christ, than to belong to something 
that would make me feel that I could disobey the laws of God and still 
so back into the presence of my Maker. 

May God bless us and help us. May the sweet testimony of 
his Spirit come into our hearts and into the hearts of our boys and 
girls, that this Church may continue to grow and increase in spiritual 
power and, because of the lives of the people and the testimonies that 
God has given to us, stand out as a living testimony to the world that 
this indeed is the Church of Jesus Christ, I humbly ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission.) 

My soul has been stirred, as never before, during the sessions of 
this conference. 

I desire that I may have the same sweet spirit that has influenced 
the remarks of my brethren. I would like to emphasize one thought 
that has impressed me. 

Frequent reference has been made to the holy scriptures, the 
Bible, the ISook of Mormon, and the Pearl of Great Price as the in- 
spired word of God. As I listened to the opening address of Presi- 



112 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



dent Grant, and others of the brethren who have spoken, 1 have felt 
in my heart their testimony and words of instruction, were just as 
binding upoq the Latter-day Saints as any part of the written word. 

"Holy men of old wrote and spoke as they were moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost." 

Prophets of God live today, and when moved upon by that same 
power, their message is of equal force upon the world and particularly 
the Latter-day Saints as the word of God spoken or written centuries 
ago. 

All who listened to the testimony and instructions of President 
Grant must have felt, in, their souls, that he spoke as one having au- 
thority, commissioned of God to declare his message to the Saints of 
latter days. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every 
one that believes, and obeys its teachings. A testimony of its truth 
is not reserved for the presiding brethren of the Church. It is with- 
in the power of every baptized believer to have assurance and testi- 
mony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and thac Joseph Smith 
not only was, but is a prophet of the living God, also that those who 
are at the head of the Church today have the same authority and power 
possessed by Joseph Smith. We will reserve that witness of the 
Spirit in direct proportion to our obedience to' law. If we are im- 
plicit and absolute in our obedience to the commandments of God 
we shall know the truth. Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, 

"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and 
ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." 

I read from the Doctrine and Covenants, section one : 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;" 
"Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven ;" 

"And he that repents not. from him shall be taken even the light which 
he has received, for any spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the 
Lord of Hosts." 

"And again verily I say unto you, - O inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord 
am willing to make these things known unto all flesh," 

"For 1 am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily Cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace 
shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own 
dominion." 

We must keep ourselves clean and unspotted from the sins of 
the world. 

! have here, a clipping that was forcibly brought to my mind 
this morning. Reference was made by one of the speakers to the fact 
that a minister of one of the great Protestant churches in a convention 
recently held, declared that the churches had no message for the 
world. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has a 
message for the world, which is definite and positive. That message 
was delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early part of the 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



113 



nineteenth century, by messengers sent from the presence of God. It 
is the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness and power. 
The clipping 1 have is from a Minneapolis paper and reports the Rev. 
C. E. Ames of the Congregational church as saying: 

"In a spiritual sense there is a crying need today for pioneers to 
lead us into new lands away from the worship of idols. We need not so 
much scribes and priests as we need prophets. Prophets are spiritual pioneers, 
pilgrims, pathfinders. The spiritual pathfinder needs faith to venture, courage 
to endure, a vision of freedom to strive for. He cannot be satisfied with the 
life about him. He loses smug content in a desire for better things. In- 
spired by the living Christ, the prophet for our day must lead by voice and 
life. He cannot permit the message God has given him to be throttled 
by any force economic, social or military. He may not be praised ; far more 
probable his lot will be persecution, but he will lead the world to new lands 
of spiritual growth and happiness." 

Truly the world is in need of prophets, spiritual pathfinders. We 
have them! Joseph Smith was the pioneer in the dispensation in 
which we live. He directed the attention of the world away from the 
worship of idols, taught the personality of God and of his son Jesus 
Christ and revolutionized the popular idea of an incomprehensible 
Deity. He taught men the fundamental doctrine of salvation. Faith 
in God, faith in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus of Nazareth, the neces- 
sity of personal purity, and repentance, baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost and every other principle and doctrine taught by Christ 
and his apostles. 

It has not been necessary to call a convention of the elders of 
the Church to consider fundamentals in order to enrich the articles 
of our faith. They will be the same in all dispensations of time; and 
will lead the people of the world to spiritual growth and happiness. 
Joseph Smith did not permit the message God had given him to be 
throttled by any power, social, economic, or military; though his lot 
was persecution, hounded, driven and plundered by his enemies, he 
bore solemn testimony until death that he had seen the Father and 
the Son in glorious vision, that holy men as ministering angels had 
visited him and conferred the authority of the holy Priesthood upon 
him with all the keys and powers of former gospel dispensations, 
and that under their direction the Church of Christ had been estab- 
lished never more to be thrown down. We Latter-day Saints are his 
witnesses that these things are true. 

In the days when Christ was upon the earth he called the atten- 
tion of the Scribes and Pharisees to the fact that many of them 
said in their hearts, had we lived in the days of the prophets, we 
would have done differently than our fathers. But he said unto 
them : 

"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ! because ye build the 
tombs of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, 
if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers

CONFERENCE PRO CEEDINGS 



with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore, ye be witnesses unto 
yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Ye 
serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?" 

Joseph Smith undaunted and unafraid went to a martyr's doom 
in 1844. Future generations, no doubt, will adore the name of the 
prophet of this dispensation whom their sires put to death. 

Missionaries of the Church are calling the attention of the world 
to these great truths and warning them of the judgments that are 
about to come upon the earth. This year is the centennial anniversary 
of the visit of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith, pre- 
paratory to the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon. In our mis- 
sion, the Western states, we have stressed the coming forth of this 
volume of scripture, this new witness for God, and kept it prominent- 
ly before the people. Some of our friends have been wrought up in 
their souls and have endeavored to stay our progress. One such was 
kind enough to distribute a little pamphlet through the eastern part 
of South Dakota. I desire to read a portion of what appeared in 
the article. It was unsigned : 

"In spite of their awful doctrines, they get followers. There are multitudes 
of poor, deluded folk that want something different. They are easy prey 
to the schemes of men and devils. The 'Mormons' are skilled deceivers. 
They use the Bible to teach repentance, faith and baptism, but hold back 
their awful doctrines. They teach that God once was as we are now. and that 
we may become what God is now. They teach that we have a heavenly Father 
and a heavenly Mother." 

That is an awful doctrine isn't il ? 1 have not time to read all 
of this pamphlet. I call your attention to the closing paragraph. 

"They say that Joseph Smith can make scripture as good as the Bible, that 
God has many revelations, as the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants and other publications of their Church. Records are kept of thousands 
of living persons wdio are baptized in their temples for the redemption of the 
dead. Their writings can be produced to show that they teach these things. 
The above is enough to condemn the whole system ; for they set up their writings 
equal to the Bible and leave place for added revelation. Gods word is a finished 
revelation, and woe to him that adds to or takes away !" 

My time has expired. It is not necessary to make any comment 
in the presence of a congregation of Latter-day Saints. It shows ; 
however, the attitude of the world towards a prophet of God. The 
crying need of the hour is for inspired men. We have them in the 
Church of Jesus Christ, and they are leading Israel by the power of 
God. May the Lord add his blessings, that we may appreciate to the 
full our responsibilities. Let us turn our faces towards the rising 
sun, set our hearts like flint against the evils of the world, and en- 
deavor to reduce to practice in our lives the counsels and instructions 
that have been given and. will yet be given at the sessions of this 
conference, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

( Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

I rejoice, this morning, that I find my soul in harmony with 
the remarks of this conference. I thank God for this, and pray that 
while I shall stand before you, he will assist me in the remarks I may 
make. Enough has been said already during this conference to assure 
us our salvation, if we believe and put into practice the good advice 
and admonition. 

In looking over the congregation today, judging from the ex- 
pressions on your faces, I am satisfied that those who have attended 
feel that they can go to their homes fully determined to carry out the 
instructions received. It will not be long before many of us are again 
plunged into the affairs of business and some will perhaps forget this 
wholesome, elevating influence. 

It was my good fortune to accompany President Grant and others 
to Canada for the purpose of attending the dedicatory services at 
the temple, and for four days most of the General Authorities were in 
meetings almost continuously for from twelve to fifteen hours each 
day. Every moment of the time was a joy to me, and I thought while 
there, how easy it would be to keep the commandments of God, if I 
could constantly be surrounded with such an influence. This cannot 
be, it seems, for we must labor to provide food and comforts for our- 
selves and families, and our labors take us into channels where that 
spirit is not always 1 present. Some of us, I am afraid, feel it is 
sufficient to keep the commandments of God as they pertain to our 
spiritual welfare. We attend sacrament meetings, our priesthood meet- 
ings and other meetings that are held for our benefit and edifica- 
tion. Our lives are clean in thought and action, yet many times we 
overlook the fact that it is also necessary that we so live that our 
every action may be influenced by the Spirit of God. In the world 
today, it seems, people think mainly of their selfish interests, hoping 
constantly to get about them those things which will bring luxury and 
comfort, and in their anxiety to gather about them luxuries, they 
forget God and the teachings of the Lord and Savior, and sometimes 
those who are active in their Church work give way to selfishness and 
greed, when it comes to business activities. 

On our way home from Canada, President Grant received a 
telegram from the Commercial Club, at Great Falls, asking that while 
there, President Grant and party be guests of the Chamber of Com- 
merce. President Grant answered he had had a hard week and 
would prefer to spend the evening quietly. But another telegram came, 
requesting that President Grant and party be guests of the Chamber 
of Commerce at Great Falls. Upon arriving we were met at the train 
by a committee who took the party by automobile to tRe Rainbow hotel, 
where arrangements had been made to hold a reception. Remarks were 
made by leading citizens. In their statements of welcome they ex- 



116 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



pressed a desire to be friendly with the members of the Church, and 
encouraged them lo come to that country to settle. They stated, not 
those words, but in thought, that they were not concerned with the 
teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but were 
very much interested with the effect of those teachings upon the 
members of the Church who had gone there to settle. A leading banker 
made this statement: ''We have discovered that where we have *Mor- 
mon' families in our community, they are a hard-working" class of 
people ; they farm intelligently, and confer with one another as to 
the best method of farming and if need be, they co-operate with 
one another to get the best results in their farming. Only a few days 
ago my attention was called to a condition where one of them had been 
taken sick. His crops were ready to be harvested ; he did not have 
the means to harvest them himself. His associates, seeing his con- 
dition, fixed a time, went in a body and harvested the crops and saved 
them for him. This is the class of people we want to come amongst 
us. If we have more of them we will have fewer I. W. W's. and Bol- 
shevists.'' I do not know whether this man made the statement purely 
through selfishness or not but 1 do know he had discovered in those 
few farmers who had gone there a condition that should always be 
manifested in the actions of those who believe in the teachings of 
Jesus Christ. 

While this condition is seen by those who hope to make capital 
out of it, many of us who should see it and feel the importance of 
cultivating this spirit of fellowship, have very little time to do so. It 
is through our thoughts and actions that we succeed. If our thoughts 
are unclean, our actions will become unclean. If our thoughts are 
selfish, then we will become selfish. We may attend our meetings, 
pay our tithes and offerings, but at the same time hold ourselves aloof 
from the Saints, and thus fail to partake of the spirit of fellowship 
and personal contact, which is so helpful and comes only through 
mingling with each other in the spirit of friendship as taught by the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. W hether we are engaged in operating a store, 
laboring in a professional capacity, or in any other of the activities of 
life, we should not permit the spirit of selfishness to enter into our 
hearts. We should look upon our brother in need as one to whom we 
should stretch a helping hand. 

The other day, I heard a man from Los Angeles make the state- 
ment : "We must look to Utah for subsistence. Our farming ground 
is being rapidly built up. Utah must supply our meat, our poultry, 
our eggs, our butter and our cheese." Many times, when farseeing 
men in the stakes of Zion have made an attempt to have the people in 
their district see the importance of co-operation and recognize that 
they may be more helpful to one another in producing" to the best 
advantage and for the purpose of putting" their produce upon the 
market to the best advantage, there have been some who. in each 
case, in the spirit of rebellion, refused to lend aid to this movement, 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

feeling that the leaders had a selfish motive in advising the people 
in this manner. There are a few in our midst who have this spirit and 
they mistrust every man who tries to do good, and, perhaps, because 
of that mistrust, on the part of a few, the large majority, rather than 
force their ideas upon others, sit back content with looking after their 
own affairs, and because of this we fail to accomplish all that we 
might accomplish. 

I want to say to you, my brehtren especially, that it is just as 
important for us at times to discuss in our priesthood meetings our local 
affairs as they pertain to our business, the crops we should raise and 
the best method of producing or marketing, as it is that we discuss 
things which pertain alone to our spiritual, welfare. In all, we should 
be guided through prayer, faith and works, remembering the com- 
mandments of the Lord to Nephi, as found in III Nephi 18:15-25 : 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye 
be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him. 

"And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, 
among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name/ Behold I am 
the light; I have set an example for you. 

"And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto his 
disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said unto them : 

"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto "you, ye must watch and pray always 
lest ye enter into temptation ; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may 
sift you as wheat. 

"Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name; 

"And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, 
believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you. 

"Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your 
wives and your children may be blessed. 

"And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any 
man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that 
they may come unto you and forbid them not; 

"But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so 
be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, 
in my name. 

"Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold 
I am the light which ye shall hold up — that which ye have seen me do. Behold 
ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed. 

"And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, 
but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel 
and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this 
commandment suffereth himself to be led 1 into temptation." * * * 

The Lord in his wisdom has given us a commandment which is a 
guide: (III Nephi 18:28-30.) 

"And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that 
ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood un- 
worthily, when ye shall minister it ; 

"For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth 
and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is 
unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid 1 him. 

"Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall 
minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and 
if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye re- 
ceive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood."

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Yesterday, in this building, one of our bishops told us what was 
being accomplished in his ward by way of leaching the young men, 
holding the Lesser Priesthood, how to become active in Church work. 
Young men holding the Lesser Priesthood are generally of an age 
when they learn mainly through observation. Think of the effect upon 
these young men just beginning their ministry in the Church, knowing 
that men should not partake of the Sacrament unless they are clean in 
their lives and in their actions, when we disobey this instruction : let 
Vis partake of the Sacrament often and witness anew that we are 
willing to take upon us the name of the Lord and keep his command- 
ments. 

I see that my time is up. I pray that when we go to our homes 
we will not feel that it is sufficient for us to labor in a spiritual 
capacity alone, but that it is also necessary to keep with us such spiritual 
guidance in our every-day walks of life, and apply to all we undertake 
to do, the Golden Rule. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints we are one big family, and to receive the blessings promised 
should keep in mind that fact, remembering the words of the Savior: 
"Pray always, lest ye be led into temptations," for no man can pray as 
God would have him pray, with a spirit of envy, malice or selfishness 
in his soul. 

God grant that through our efforts to serve him we will prove 
our worthiness to receive his blessings, which I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Let the mountain shout for joy." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder William L. Rich, of the. 
Bear Lake .stake of Zion. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

The second overflow meeting was held in the Assemblv Hall at 
2 o'clock. October 7. 1923. 

Elder John Wells, of the Presiding Bishopric, presided. 

As in the morning session the Holliday ward choir furnished the 
singing under the direction of Charles R. Pike, with Tracy Y. Cannon 
as organist. 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Don C. Walker, Rigby, 
Idaho. 

The choir sang, ''This is the day which the Lord hath made." 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

( Former President of the Canadian Mission.) 

I am truly thankful for the privilege of coming into this holy 
place on this beautiful day to worship the God of our fathers. I am 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



thankful that I have in my heart a desire to bow my head and lift my 
heart in praise to the Maker of all. 

I returned home from a mission to Canada last April, rather 
worse for wear. I was a little better than a corpse and not quite as 
good as an invalid. But through the mercy and goodness of our 
heavenly Father, I have been greatly strengthened in my body dur- 
ing the last six months. I am thankful with all my heart for the 
testimony that I have that God does hear his children wdio come un- 
to him with broken hearts and contrite spirits, in the times of their 
need and their distress. I pray that the spirit of our heavenly Father 
shall attend me in my utterances this afternoon. During my term of 
missionary service in the Dominion of Canada I learned that there 
is very little that any of us can do, in and of ourselves, to bring to 
pass the righteousness of God in the w r orld. I have learned to know 
that there is only one power anywhere that can really purify and 
ennoble the human heart, and that is the power of God's Holy Spirit. 

During the last year or two I have had occasion to read three 
noteworthy books. All three of these books are addressed to the 
great theme of "salvaging the wrecked civilization of the world." One 
of these books was written by a great teacher of psychology, Dr. G. 
Stanley Hall. The second was written by a distinguished man of 
letters, H. G. Wells. The last was written by an English philosopher, 
G. Bernard Shaw. All three of these distinguished men attempt to 
answer the big question, "How can we save the wrecked civilization 
of the world?" 

G. Stanley Hall gave to his book the name, Morale. In it he 
attempts to show that the spiritual and intellectual wellbeing of the 
world depends upon physical wholesomeness. He arrives at the con- 
clusion that all that we need to save the world from ruin is more 
abundant physical health. The professor did not seem to remem- 
ber that, if the heart is evilly-disposed, the more of vitality and 
strength there is back of it the more there is of fuel to feed the 
flames of passion. Morale, in the sense in which Dr. G. Stanley Hall 
uses that word, will not save the world. 

H. G. Wells took for the title of his book, Salvaging Civilization. 
Mr. Wells is an intellectualist. He is a profound believer in the 
supremacy of mind over matter, lie believes in education. In hi? 
book he goes on to say, in effect, that what the world needs is more 
education, more enlightenment. Mr. Wells seems to have forgotten 
that the brighter the mind, if it is attached to an evilly-disposed heart, 
the greater its power for evil in the world. The recent history of 
the world written in the blood of millions killed upon the battle- 
field, and the tears of weeping widows and orphans, confirms the 
truth, that brightness of mind without rightness of heart leads to 
frightfulness, and the wreckage of the world. 

The last of these writers, the philosopher, G. Bernard Shaw, 



120 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



took for the title of his book, Back to Methuselah. You know Mr. 
Shaw is an evolutionist. He tells us in his book that there is in 
operation in the world a universal principle of evolution, social evo- 
lution, political evolution, and moral evolution; and that the only 
reason why the human race is not saved is because men and women 
do not live long enough. He contends that if man could live a 
thousand years, so that the process of evolution could do its effective 
work the race of man would be saved from evil and error. But the 
philosopher seems to have forgotten that the longer a bad man lives 
the worse he becomes. 

Now, the strange thing, to me, about these three great books 
is the fact that all three of these writers, of international note, claimed 
to believe in the supremacy of Jesus Christ as the moral and ethical 
teacher of the world. Mr. Hall, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Shaw all be- 
lieve that Jesus Christ was the greatest moral and ethical teacher 
the world has ever seen. Now, just why these three men should 
not recommend to the human race Christ's panacea for the ills of the 
world, I am not able to understand. That remedy is found in one 
simple sentence in the first chapter of Mark's gospel. In this chap- 
ter we read : 

"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, 
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying. The time 
is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent ye, and be- 
lieve the gospel." 

In that simple sentence is found the cure for all the ills of the 
world. In it is found the only medicine that can save this sin-sick 
world. 

When I think about it. I am reminded that sometime ago Mr. 
Bok, one of our great American writers, made an offer to the world 
of a hundred thousand dollars for the best plan for bringing peace 
to the world. Some time subsequent to the publication of this offer, 
a Florida newspaper came out with a short editorial, in which the 
writer said, "We win in two words — Stop fighting." You can turn 
the world from wrecklessness and sin to righteousness and peace, 
with just two words, "Stop sinning." 

Does this command apply to me? Yes. It includes you and 
me. and all mankind.] When you and I and all our neighbors are 
peaceable the peace of the world will be secure. And, by-the-by, it 
is not the usual sins that damn the world. I used to say to my com- 
panions in the missionary field, "You need not be concerned about 
the sin of robbing a bank, because you are not going to rob any bank." 
It is just the little daily sins of you and me, of wrong-thinking, that 
damn our souls. 

Now, one of these little prevailing sins which I have found since 
I came home is the sin of pride. You know we have a lot of people 
who worship the'r automobiles more than they worship God. There 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



121 



are many who have more pride in their professional skill than they 
have in the beauty and the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In 
my profession, I frequently meet young members of the bar. When 
some of these young" men have read two or three law books, and 
have got about two legal ideas into their heads, they begin to think 
that they are too wise to take any stock in gospel truth. 

Now, you cannot get into heaven in that sort of a spirit. You 
cannot ride into the presence of God on a high horse. Jesus, the 
greatest of all teachers, said, "Except ye become as this little child, 
ye cannot see the kingdom of heaven." What we need is more child- 
ishness of heart and less childishness of mind. We need more of 
old-fashioned humility and devotion in the Church. Humility is 
nobility. 

Just a few weeks ago I was invited to spend a few moments 
in looking over a splendid Packard sedan, that had cost $5,000. I 
did not buy it. A friend of mine was the buyer. Now, while we 
were admiring this beautiful car, a young man spoke up, "It's heaven 
inside of it." There are some of our people who seem to think that 
when they get into a sedan they are in the celestial glory. Now, 
don't misunderstand me ; I haven't anything against the automobile. 
It is a splendid instrument of utility in the commercial and indus- 
trial world. It is also a legitimate source of pleasure used in mod- 
eration. 

Many of us have become engulfed in the mad swirl of worldly 
pleasure. Our age is coming to be an age of gratification. It should 
be an age of glorification. In every age of the world when the 
children of men have given themselves over to pleasure, and selfish 
gratification, there has been a marked decadence physically, morally 
and intellectually of the race. And in every age of the world when 
mankind have remembered in meekness and gratitude the God of 
heaven, and have worshiped him, they have progressed and ad- 
vanced, in all of the fine things that make for the ennoblement of the 
children of men. 

My brothers and sisters, let me make this appeal to you. Be 
not deceived by the glitter of this vain world. There is a deeper 
joy than the pleasure of gratification. There is the joy of knowing 
God, of having sacred fellowship with him through the Holy Spirit. 
That is the deepest and the purest joy in the world. We cannot 
have this joy unless we live near to God and serve him and keep 
his commandments. 

I am thankful with all my heart for the humble part I have 
had in telling the world of the great things of God's latter-day glory. 
I love the truth ; I love this work ; I love this people ; I love to wit- 
ness their advancement and their progress; and 1 pray that God 
will help us to be true to the truth and faithful to the faith, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, I feel very grateful for the oppor- 
tunity I have of standing before you for a few moments and report- 
ing conditions and affairs in the Northwestern States mission. I 
have come to a realization as never before, of the great value of a 
human soul. To the degree that I stand at the head of that organ- 
ization, I have been entrusted with the most precious things that 
God has in the earth and that we, as parents, possess in our families, 
your sons and daughters. We are endeavoring, so far as lies in our 
power and, according to the best judgment we possess, to guide them 
in those wavs that will make of them what God intended they should 
be. 

We realize in the mission field, as in no other place in life, the 
real meaning of life. And I want to say to you, that your sons 
and daughters are among the most noble creatures it has ever been 
my good fortune to affiliate with. They do not hesitate at the per- 
formance of any noble duty, no matter how humble or how much it may 
call for what we term sacrifice. But when I think of that term sac- 
rifice, I am constrained to the conviction that we are entirely mis- 
taken respecting it. We think it is a sacrifice, some of us, to keep 
our sons and daughters in the mission field. There is no blessing 
that comes to a father or a mother equal, in my judgment, to main- 
taining in the mission field for the length of time necessary one of 
the members of their family, because of the value it is to their fam- 
ily and particularly to the young man or young woman. 

There is a great deal of criticism and attack by those who have 
constituted themselves the judges of this community and this or- 
ganization and this work. I think the best answer that can be given 
men who attack this organization, this Church, is the lives and ac- 
complishments of the boys and girls who go into the mission field; 
because they learn the best, the most vital, the most enduring thing 
that can be learned in all the world. Your sons and daughters 
stand up in the communities of Christendom affirming, with all ser- 
iousness and in humility, that God has spoken, that they have re- 
ceived a witness of that fact. They have stamped upon their lives 
the great fact that God is our Father and that their duty to him 
and his children is the greatest consideration of life. And that duty 
teaches them the strictest and most beautiful morality. It teaches 
them honesty; it teaches them service, service to God and his chil- 
dren. Can there be formed or found in all the world a higher idealism 
than the worship of God and the service of his children? And when 
people attack this organization and this community, they are attack- 
ing the highest idealism known to man, found in the worship of 
God and doing good to humanity. 

We sometimes think that the missionaries are subjected to great 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 



123 



sacrifice. I have an instance in mind. There is in the mission a 
young woman. She comes from Sevier county. Her name is Velma 
Nebeker. She is educated, beautiful, and possesses all of the requi- 
sites not only for a successful missionary but for a woman fitted to 
occupy the highest social position, a woman who some day will make 
her mark and write her name large in the history of this commu- 
nity. She is a paragon of excellence as respects appearance and dress. 
The mission needed a teacher on the Indian reservation at Wolf Point, 
a most forbidding place. Our Church sits on a little hill, wind-swept. 
It is desolate. It is on the great arid/ bottoms of the Missouri river, 
mostly of mud, stunted cottonwoods, and poor growth of grass. In- 
habiting that particular part of the country is a tribe of Indians, and 
there has been established among them, or was established during 
the days of Elder Ballard, of the Council of the. Twelve, an Indian 
school. We have an enrollment of nearly thirty pupils, and we teach 
from the primary up to the sixth grade. This young woman, among 
her other accomplishments, is a school teacher. The mission needed 
just her stamp of woman for the performing of the duties, necessary 
to the instructing of those little Indian children. I called her into 
the office. I had been praying for a month as to the selection that 
should be made, because I recognized its importance. And when I 
called her into the office — Wolf Point is the most abhorent to all 
the missionaries, because it is the most difficult and sacrificial place 
in which to labor — and said to her, "Miss Nebeker, I want you to 
go to Wolf Point," her face blanched. The tears shot from her eyes, 
but she set her teeth and said, "I'll go." She went, and I said to 
her before she departed, "I want to say to you that when you re- 
turn from your mission you will say — and I know it now as well 
as I shall know it in the future — that your labors in Wolf Point have 
been the very crown of your missionary labor." She is a heroine, 
and you men and women, parents in Israel, have hundreds of young 
people out in the mission who are just like that. They do not hes- 
itate at any duty. There is no sacrifice they are called upon to per- 
form that they do not go willingly, depending upon the Almighty not 
only for the knowledge that they disseminate but for their food and 
their shelter. 

We have recently concluded our great summer work, in which 
the boys (not the young ladies, because we do not entrust to them 
that duty) have gone into all the surrounding country, through Ore- 
gon, Washington, parts of Idaho, all of Montana, and into British 
Columbia, proclaiming the gospel without purse or scrip. And I 
want to say to the parents of these young men and women, if you 
want to give your sons and daughters the very best, or leave for them 
and fix in their lives the very best that you can, there is nothing that 
can be bestowed that will be of as much value as missionary experi- 
ence. They go out in humility, but they acquire information with 
great rapidity, and some of our boys who come from the remote dis- 



124 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



tricts come into the mission field crude, it is true ; their grammar is 
poor; their knowledge of the gospel is almost nil; but in a few week-, 
you commence to see a fire in their eyes, you commence to see a 
bearing and a manner in their attitude toward one another and the 
world, you begin to see an intelligence shooting forth from their 
whole being that was not there when they came. They improve with 
remarkable rapidity, and it makes of them the kind of men and women 
that the world needs for its regenerating, for its saving; because if 
it is saved, it will be by men and women who possess the quali- 
fication and the understanding that these young men and women 
have who go out into the world as missionaries. 

And when they come back to you, they will understand that the 
highest duty they have to perform is the duty of marriage — parent- 
hood, good citizenship, as children of God our Father. And it can- 
not but be that this community will rise to an eminence that has been 
and will be enjoyed by no other people, because of the younger peo- 
ple of the community and the teachings that they receive in the mis- 
sionary field which fit them for the great duties of life. They learn 
that it is themselves who are responsible to themselves and to God 
for that which they do in life. They learn the value of life. They 
know what time means. They are preparing for eternity. And I 
want to say, brethren and sisters, encourage the young people to go 
on missions. 

Do not write discouraging letters to the missionaries as to your 
circumstances, if it can possibly be avoided ; it affects them in their 
labors; it affects them in the finest duties they have to perform, not 
only there, but it seriously affects their future. So encourage them, 
keep them out there, though you may have to struggle to get the 
money to maintain them. If you do not send them as much as you 
have been in the habit of sending them, let them live on less ; it can 
be done. There are young men in the mission, and young women, 
too, who are living on very much less than some others are using. 
And even though you have to restrict the amount you are sending 
them, make every effort to keep them in the missionary field. 

And to you, brethren and sisters, here at home, I wonder if you 
are measuring up to the standards of the young men and women you 
are sending us to the missionary field? Do you have in your thoughts 
always that God is our Father, that you are amenable to him for 
every act of your lives ? Do you know that we, as we stand, are great 
radio stations, sending off into the universe just what w'e are? What 
we think, what we say, what we do, is written in the great volumes 
of the future, and you will read it, you will hear again the things 
that you have said. The things that you have done you will know. 
The very thoughts of your hearts will be inscribed upon volumes that 
will live eternally. . 

Let us remember, brethren and sisters, our duty to God and 
these children of ours, who are his. They are the greatest heritage 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON

that God has conferred upon us. Let us be careful of them. Let us 
teach them in the right, so that when we as well as they stand in the 
presence of the great Judge and he shall say, "What is the judgment 
of this man?" and another shall say, "What is written on his heart?'' 
that written on our hearts and lives may be the great desire to serve 
God, to labor for his children to help him in the great work which he 
has established in the earth, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

And I want to bear testimony to you that your sons and daugh- 
ters are the finest objects in all the world. Those with whom I have 
the pleasure of laboring, I love almost as if they were my very own. 
Let us cherish them — not only those who are there but those who are 
here. Our neighbors' children are our children; because they are 
the children of God. Let us labor and save them and all mankind and 
enjoy the missionary spirit; for that is the spirit in which God ex- 
pects all his children who know his truth to labor. 

That we may so labor, that we may so live, that we may so help 
that we may redeem ourselves, our kindred, and help the Lord in 
this great work is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

A few weeks ago I attended the dedication of the temple at Card- 
ston, Alberta, Canada, and in speaking of the dedication of a temple, 
we Latter-day Saints naturally ask ourselves the question : Why do 
we build temples ? And why did ancient Israel build temples ? Did 
they erect sacred buildings for the same purpose that we build temples, 
or why was it that they, even when traveling in the wilderness, erected 
a tabernacle, which was dedicated to God as a temporary structure in 
which the children of Israel expected that God would be nearer to 
them than anywhere else on their camp ground? 

The prophets of old frequently sought God on the tops of moun- 
tains, and sometimes they would seek him in forests, or even in the 
caves of the earth. Christ himself, on a certain occasion, took three of 
his disciples with him to the top of a mountain where the glorious 
transfiguration took place. At other times Christ went to the top 
of the Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem, and there poured out his heart 
in prayer and devotion to God, his Father. Yet the people of God 
have been trained to believe that while the Lord can be found anywhere, 
and that we cannot hide in any place, be it ever so remote, where the 
presence of Deity cannot be felt, there is, nevertheless, something very 
important attached to the matter of erecting a house to the name of the 
Lord, even in the building and dedicating of a meetinghouse, a taber- 
nacle, and especially in the building and dedicating of a temple which 



126 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



is considered the holiest of all structures that we read of in the history 
of sacred architecture. 

THE TABERNACLE 

We find that the children of Israel, after they had crossed the Red 
Sea and were encamped in the wilderness of Sinai ( where thev spent 
40 years), erected a sacred structure in which they could commune 
with God. The Prophet Moses had spent 40 days with the Lord on 
Mount Sinai and God had, with his own finger, inscribed on two tab- 
lets of stone the ten commandments which Moses brought down from the 
mountain ; and, in order to have a safe place as a depository for these 
sacred tablets the "Ark of the Covenant" was made and the "Tabernacle 
erected. The Tabernacle was only a tent, 45 feet long by 15 feet wide, 
pitched in an enclosure which contained about one quarter of an acre 
of land, as we measure land in America. Inside of that enclosure stood 
the Tabernacle, facing east. The Tabernacle itself was divided into two 
parts, of which one part, called the "Holy Place," was 30 feet long and 
15 feet wide, while the other part, called the "Holy of Holies'" (or Sanc- 
tum Sanctorum) , was 15 feet in width, length and height — thus making 
a complete cube. This Tabernacle became known among the children 
of Israel as the "Tent of Jehovah ;" it was also called the "Sanctuary" 
and the "Tabernacle of the Congregation." In that part of the Taber- 
nacle called the "Holy of Holies" was placed the sacred box known 
as the Ark of the Covenant. It was only a small box about 4y 2 feet 
in length and about 2y 2 feet in width and height, but it was covered 
with gold. In this chest, made of shittim wood, the two tablets of stone 
were placed and the priests only had access to it. 

TEMPLE OF SOLOMON 

The Tabernacle was the abode of the Lord, so to speak, while the 
children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, and also for many years 
after they reached the promised land. But in due course of time, after 
the Canaanites had been subdued, and after the reign of the Judges and 
King Saul, King David, inspired of the Lord, became desirous of 
building a house unto God's holy name. The Lord at that time said 
that he had dwelt in a tent so far, but would accept of a house that 
might be erected to him, in which his presence might dwell. But David 
was not permitted to build the house, because of his transgression, and 
because he had been a man of blood and war. The Lord, however, 
directed that his son Solomon should build the house which in due 
course of time was done, and thus came into existence the Temple of 
Solomon. 

Solomon's temple was only a small building measuring about 
90 feet in length and 30 feet in width and height. Hence, it was not 
larger than many of our meeetinghouses. But the children of Israel 
were proud of their temple because of the very costly ornaments with 
which it was embellished. The temple was practically covered with 
gold — not simply with gold leaf, but with gold plate — as we understand 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



127 



it. and was therefore a very costly building when finished, so much so- 
that the enemies of Israel, such as Egyptians, Assyrians and Baby- 
lonians, were frequently tempted to take Jerusalem, that they might 
plunder the temple of its gold and silver, its precious stones and the 
precious golden vessels used for sacred ordinances in the building. 
In Solomon's temple, which stood upon Mount Moriah (one of the 
four hills upon which Jerusalem is built), the children of Israel wor- 
shipped about four-hundred years. Then the captivity came, when 
Nebuchadnezzar attacked Judah with his armies, took Jerusalem, de- 
stroyed the temple and carried away to Babylon the golden vessels and 
the costly ornaments which had been placed in the temple, some of 
which had been obtained from Tyre, Abyssinia, Egypt and other places. 

TEMPLE OF ZERUBBABEL 

But at the end of seventy years the children of Israel returned 
to their native land, by permission of King Cyrus. He told the chil- 
dren of Israel to go back to their land and there build a temple where 
they had formerly worshipped. So Israel, led by Zerubbabel and other 
valiant leaders, returned to the land of Israel and there built a new 
temple, which became known as the temple of Zerubbabel. But some 
of the older people who had seen the temple of Solomon, and now 
watched the erection of the new temple, wept because it was not so 
costly a building as the first temple was. It was a larger structure 
and contained more walls and more cubic feet by one-third than the 
temple of Solomon, but the people of Israel did not have the gold and 
silver and the precious stones to ornament it with. That is why the 
people wept, and not because the second temple was a smaller building 
than the first one. 

TEMPLE OF HEROD 

The people of Israel, after the return from captivity, enjoyed that 
second temple, known as the temple of Zerubbabel, for something like, 
five hundred years. In the meantime the children of Israel had been 
deprived of their national independence, had been conquered by the 
Greeks and afterwards by the Romans, and finally the Romans ap- 
pointed a certain man to be king of the Jews. He was a wicked man,, 
very wicked, indeed, according to history, but he conceived of the idea, 
in order to become popular with the Jews, that he would rebuild the 
Jewish temple, lie, therefore, pulled down some of the old walls, and 
erected them anew, better than before, and then finished them with lav- 
ish ornaments. We sometimes speak of this building as the third temple 
of the Israelites. In one sense it was only one temple, because the three 
successive buildings were erected upon the same site. Herod simply 
rebuilt, or re-constructed the former temple. It was this so-called 
Temple of Herod in which the Savior worshipped, and that is also the 
temple of which the Savior said that it would be destroyed, because of 
the wickedness of the people, and that not one stone should be left upon 
another of the building. Any visitor to Jerusalem today will find that 



128 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



the Savior's prediction has been fulfilled to the very letter. There is 
not one stone left upon another of the temple of Herod, nor of the 
temple of Zerubbabel, but there are remnants left of Solomon's work, 
certain portions pertaining to the original foundations still being in 
existence, and in the cavities under the foundation of the temple are the 
so-called Solomon's stables, where the great king is supposed to have 
kept his horses. Thus we find in Jerusalem today workmanship dating 
back to about 3000 years, while the temple of Herod, as you know, was 
destroyed by the Romans seventy years after the birth of the Savior. 

NEPHITE TEMPLES 

Next permit me to draw your attention to the Xephites who occupied 
the land of America. A certain statement made by Nephi and recorded 
in the Book of Mormon, has caused some criticism or discussion. The 
Nephites had been in America only a short time, and we estimate that 
there could not have been more than 300 souls of them altogether at 
the time that Nephi wrote the following : 

"And I, Nephi, did 1 build a temple; and I did construct it after the man- 
ner of the temple of Solomon, save it were not built of so many precious 
things; for they were not to be found upon the land; wherefore it could 
not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction 
was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was ex- 
ceeding fine." 

Many of you brethren who are comfortably fixed financially, 
could, single handed, build a temple like Solomon's temple with your 
own means. You might be obliged to follow the example of Nephi in not 
furnishing the building with so much silver and gold or so many pre- 
cious things as did Solomon, but I venture to say that it was quite pos- 
sible for a small number of Nephites to erect a temple as large as that 
erected by Solomon, omitting the costly ornamentations. 

It is also recorded in the Book of Mormon that the Savior, after 
his resurrection, appeared to the Nephites in "the temple in the Land 
Bountiful." We do not know how many more temples were erected 
by them. On my recent visit to South America, I saw a number of 
temple ruins, and I could not help thinking that perhaps I stood face 
to face with some of the walls and temple ruins which had been erected 
by the God-fearing Nephites over 2,000 years ago. Of course, I have 
no way of proving that these temples were erected by the Nephites, but 
such was my first thought when I saw the remnants of the temple of the 
sun in Cuzco, Peru, and other temple ruins elsewhere. 

TEMPLES ERECTED BY LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

The Latter-day Saints have erected eight temples since the organi- 
zation of the Church, all of which have been dedicated and used for holy 
ordinances. Besides these completed temples, three other temple sites 
have been dedicated, upon one of which a temple is in course of erection, 
at Mesa, Arizona.

TEMPLE SITE AT INDEPENDENCE 

The Church was not much more than a year old when the subject 
of temple building became popular among its members, as the Lord had 
commanded his people to erect such buildings. Almost immediately 
after the arrival of the first colony of Latter-day Saints in Missouri, 
a temple site was dedicated at Independence, Jackson county, August 
3, 1831, but nothing further has hitherto been done toward the erection 
of that temple, as the Saints were expelled from Jackson county by 
mobs, in 1833. The temple site is now in the hands of the so-called 
Hedrickites, but the Saints expect in the future to erect a magnificent 
house of the Lord in Independence. 

KIRTLAND TEMPLE 

On the 1st of June, 1833, the Lord directed the Saints to build 
a temple at Kirtland, Ohio, and on July 23, 1833, the corner stones 
were laid. In less than three years after that the temple was completed 
and on March 27, 1836, it was dedicated by Joseph Smith the Prophet. 
One week later, April 3, 1836, the Savior and other holy personages 
appeared in the temple and committed sacred keys of the Priesthood 
to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Among others, Elijah, the 
Prophet, appeared and delivered to the elders named, certain keys 
whereby the Saints since have been enabled to perform sacred ordinances 
for themselves and their friends and relatives beyond the veil. The 
Kirtland temple passed out of the hands of the Saints through per- 
secutions of apostates and mob element. It is a rock building 80 feet 
long and 60 feet wide ; the walls are 50 feet high and the top of the 
tower is 1 10 feet above the ground. This temple is situated on an ele- 
vation overlooking the surrounding country, about two and one-half 
miles from Willoughby and 18 miles from the center of Cleveland, 
Ohio. 

TEMPLE SITE IN FAR WEST, MISSOURI 

Ground was broken for a temple in Far West, Missouri, July 3, 
1837, and the corner stones were laid July 4, 1838. Nothing further 
was done until April 26, 1839, when the twelve apostles, in fulfilment 
of a revelation, held a secret meeting or conference on the temple site 
and re-commenced the building of the temple by rolling a large stone 
up to one of the corners. This temple, which would have been 110 feet 
long and 80 feet wide, according to plan, was never built, because 
the Saints were driven from Missouri, in 1839. The site, however, is 
now owned by the Church. 

NAUVOO TEMPLE 

Soon after the Saints had settled in Illinois, preparations were 
made for the erection of a temple and the corner stones of such a 
building were laid in Nauvoo, Hancock county, Illinois, April 6, 1841. 
At the time of the Prophet's martyrdom the walls were up to the win- 



130 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 

dows of the first story, but under the direction of President Brigham 
Young, the temple was so far completed that the attic story could be 
dedicated Nov. 30, 1845, and endowments were given in that part of 
the building during the winter of 1845-46. The whole building was 
privately dedicated by Joseph Young, April 30, 1846, and publicly 
dedicated by Orson Hyde, May 1, 1846. No endowment had been 
given in the Kirtland temple, but the ordinance of washing of feet was 
attended to in that building. Joseph the Prophet gave sacred endow- 
ments to certain leaders of the Church as early as May, 1842, or about 
four years prior to the completion of the Nauvoo temple. 

There was no baptismal font in the Kirtland temple, but such a font 
was built in the basement of the Nauvoo temple and baptism for the 
dead performed in it as early as November, 1841. The Nauvoo temple, 
which was 128 feet long from east to west and 88 feet wide, with a 
spire 165 feet high, was burned by an incendiary October 9, 1848, and 
the walls were blown down by a hurricane, May 27, 1850. There is 
now not one stone left upon another of that magnificent edifice which 
cost the Church nearly a million dollars. 

, ST. GEORGE TEMPLE 

Although a temple had been in course of erection in Salt Lake City 
since 1853, it was decided by the authorities of the Church to erect a 
temple in southern Utah, and the site for such a building was dedicated 
in St. George, Utah, Nov. 9, 1871, by George A. Smith, and the ground 
broken the same day. The mason work was commenced March 10, 
1873, the lower part of the building was dedicated Jan. 1, 1877, and the 
whole building was dedicated April 6, 1877, by Daniel H. Wells. This 
temple is 141 feet long and 93 feet wide. The walls, built of red sand- 
stone, measure 84 feet from the ground to the top of the parapets, and 
the tower is 135 feet high. Its erection represents an outlay of at 
least $500,000. 

LOGAN TEMPLE 

The temple site of Logan, Cache county, Utah, was dedicated May 
18, 1877, and the corner stones were laid Sept. 17, 1877. Seven years 
were spent in its erection and the building was dedicated May 17, 1884. 
The Logan temple, which occupies an elevation in the upper part of the 
city of Logan, is 171 feet long and 95 feet wide. The walls are 82 feet 
high and there are two towers, the one on the east end being 170 feet 
and the one on the west end 165 feet high. The cost of construction 
is estimated at about $800,000. 

MANTI TEMPLE 

The temple site at Manti, Sanpete county, Utah, was dedicated by 
President Brigham Young April 25, 1877, and the ground was broken 
five days later, April 30, 1877. The corner stones were laid April 14, 
1879, but prior to that date much work had been done and considerable 
means expended in preparing the ground, as the temple is built on the 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



131 



top of a hill, known since 1849, as Temple Hill, in the outskirts of the 
City of Manti. This temple, which is visible from nearly all parts of 
Sanpete Valley is, like the Logan temple, 171 feet long and 95 feet wide. 
The walls are about 85 feet high. The east tower is 179 feet and the 
west tower 169 feet high. The building, which was dedicated May 21, 
1888, including the preparations of the ground, cost about $1,000,000. 

SALT LAKE CITY TEMPLE 

The temple site in Salt Lake City was selected by President Brig- 
ham Young, July 28, 1847, four days after the arrival of President 
Brigham Young in the Great Salt Lake Valley, and dedicated Feb. 14, 
1853. The corner stones were laid April 6, 1853, the capstone placed 
in position April 6, 1892, and the building dedicated by President Wil- 
ford Woodruff, April 6, 1893. Hence, the erection of the Salt Lake 
temple took 40 years and the estimated cost is $4,000,000. The Salt 
Lake City temple is built of beautiful granite, quarried in the mouth 
of Little Cottonwood canyon, about 20 miles from Salt Lake City. 
It stands on the east half of the Temple Block and occupies a central 
position in Salt Lake City. This temple is 186 1 /2 feet long and 99 feet 
wide. It has three towers on the east and also three on the west end. 
The main tower, which is the central tower on the east end, is 225 feet 
high and is surmounted by a statue of the Angel Moroni. The Salt 
Lake temple is by far the largest and most costly temple building erected 
by the Latter-day Saints. 

HAWAIIAN TEMPLE 

On the occasion of a visit to the Hawaiian Islands of President 
Joseph F. Smith, Elder Reed Smoot, of the Council of the Twelve, and 
Bishop Charles W. Nibley, in the summer of 1915, the erection of 
a temple at Hawaii was discussed, and on the first of June, 1915, Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, in the presence of the two brethren named, 
selected and dedicated a spot at Laie, on the island of Oahu, for the 
erection of a temple. The matter was laid before the general confer- 
ence, held in Salt Lake City, Oct. 3, 1915, and it was then decided by 
unanimous vote to erect a temple in Hawaii, in the interest of the Poly- 
nesian Saints. Work on the building was begun early in 1916 and 
the temple dedicated by President Heber J. Grant, Nov. 27, 1919. The 
Hawaiian temple is situated on an eminence commanding an unob- 
structed view of the ocean. It is built in the shape of a Grecian cross 
and measures 102 feet from east to west and 78 feet from north to 
south. The central portion of the edifice, which has no towers, rises 
to a height of 50 feet and the temple grounds are most beautifully 
ornamented with all kinds of tropical vegetation. 

ALBERTA TEMPLE 

A temple site at Cardston, Alberta, Canada, was dedicated July 
27, 1913, by President Joseph F. Smith. Later the corner stone was 
laid, under the direction of Elder David O. McKay, of the Council of 



132 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Twelve. The temple, which is built in the shape of a Maltese cross, 
measures 165 feet from north to south and the same distance from east 
to west. The walls are three feet thick and the height of the building 
110 feet. Like the Hawaiian temple it has no towers. The sacred 
edifice was dedicated Aug. 26, 1923, by President Heber J. Grant, 
in the presence of many of the general authorities of the Church. This 
temple, known as the Alberta temple, occupies, like all other temples, 
of the Latter-day Saints, elevated ground, which overlooks much of the 
surrounding country, and has cost about $782,000. It is the first temple 
erected outside of territory belonging to the United States, and it is 
considered quite appropriate that a temple should be built in a British 
dominion, as the British Empire has contributed so many thousands 
of faithful converts to the great latter-day work. 

ARIZONA TEMPLE 

The site for a temple in Mesa, Arizona, was dedicated December 1, 
1921, by President Heber J. Grant and is now in course of construc- 
tion. The corner stone will probably be laid next month. 

Now, just a word or two in conclusion: The Latter-day Saints 
having erected eight temples in these last days, and knowing now for 
what purposes temples in our day are erected they should be energetic 
in attending to the sacred ordinances which have been revealed. It 
is true that the children of Israel built their temples different to ours, 
as the ordinance work in them was done by men bearing the Aaronic 
Priesthood, while the temples built by the Latter-day Saints are offi- 
ciated in by the Melchizedek Priesthood. Consequently, the internal 
arrangements of the temple of the Israelites were different to ours. 
The temple, erected in Kirtland, Ohio, was also different in the inner 
arrangements to those subsequently built, but commencing with the 
Nauvoo temple, and ending so far with the Canadian temple, the interior 
of all the temples are in most particulars the same, and used for holy 
ordinances. 

May God help us to be true and faithful in the discharge of our 
duties, regarding temple work, so that we indeed may become saviors on 
Mount Zion and do what the Lord wants us to do in the temples, while 
we are trying also to be faithful in all things which the Lord has com- 
manded us, 1 pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE S. TAYLOR 

(Former President of the New Zealand Mission.) 

After an absence of nearly three years from the midst of the 
Saints of Zion it is indeed a pleasure to have the privilege of once 
more associating with you and of listening to the inspiring talks 
which have been given by the leaders of this people. 

I will report that the work in New Zealand is progressing in a 
satisfactory manner. In relation to the elders and sisters who are 



ELDER GEORGE S. TAYLOR * 133 



laboring there, Brother Young has relieved me of ten minutes of my 
time by describing the elders and sisters of that mission. You who 
have boys or girls there have ocassion to be proud of them. Of all 
the things that have been spoken during this conference, my mind 
has been most impressed with the rem'arks of President Grant, made 
at the opening of this conference, wherein he urged upon the Later- 
day Saints the necessity of family and secret prayers. I would call 
to your attention the fact that it was the prayer offered by the boy 
Joseph Smith which opened this dispensation of the gospel, which 
brought again to the world the knowledge which they had lost, a knowl- 
edge of God our eternal Father and of his son Jesus Christ, that 
they are living, immortal beings. And it was the prayers of that same 
boy, the Prophet Joseph Smith, which gave unto us the revelations 
which are contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. You will find, 
my brethren and sisters, in studying these various revelations, that they 
were invariably given in answer to prayer. 

Your boys and girls who are laboring in the missionary fields 
are receiving knowlege that they know that Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of God ; they know that the leaders of this Church are inspired men, 
called of God to perform the labors of leading this' people and teach- 
ing them the principles of eternal life. 

I have been somewhat surprised, during my experience in that 
land, to find that quite a number of our boys have never been in 
the habit of attending meetings ; so much have they neglected the 
opportunities that have been offered them that they have never heard 
an apostle, or one of the Presidency of the Church, deliver a sermon. 
Have any of you sons and daughters in this condition? Tt is doubt- 
less true that many of you are living in remote villages, but question 
yourselves' have yon sons and daughters who have never heard one 
of the general authorities of the Church raise his voice and address 
the Latter-day Saints? If so, you are neglecting your opportunities; 
you are depriving your sons and your daughters of blessings that of 
right belong to them. 

During my labors in that land, I had the extreme pleasure of 
welcoming to the mission the first of the general authorities of the 
Church to visit that mission. The work of the Lord has been carried 
on there for some sixty-two years, and the Saints had prayed times 
without number that one or more of the general authorities of the 
Church might be sent, that they might have the pleasure and privilege 
of hearing their testimony, and we certainly rejoiced in the blessings 
that were brought to us when Elder David O. McKay of the Council 
of the Twelve, and President Hugh J. Cannon, paid a visit to that 
land. During the conference we have heard a number of references 
to certain inspired meetings that have been held in different parts 
of the earth. I can testify to you that during the visit of Elder McKay 
and President Cannon we had one of those inspired meetings. Those 
who had the privilege of attending that meeting will never forget the 



134 * CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



spirit which was poured out and the testimonies which were offered at 
that time. 

I have rejoiced in the labor of the ministry. I know that I am 
engaged in the work of God, that th ; s Church is the Church of Jesus 
Christ, and that' only throng* obedience to the laws and ordinances 
of the gospel, as taught by the Latter-day Saints we can hope for an 
entrance into and an exaltation in the kingdom of God. I testify 
of these things, for I know that they are true. I testify that God 
has heard and answered my prayers and the prayers of the elders 
laboring in the New Zealand mission, and I testify unto you that if 
you will seek him in earnestness and in faith, he will answer unto 
you the desires of your hearts. 

May we earnestly seek him is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Chiist. Amen. 



ELDER CARL E. PETERSON 

{Former President of the Danish Mission) 

It is now four years and a half since I had the privilege of attend- 
ing our general conference, and it is over four years since I left 
for my mission to preside over the Scandinavian mission. Norway 
and Denmark, four years ago, were called the Scandinavian mission. 
In 1920, it was decided by the authorities of the Church to make 
two missions out of the Scandinavian mission, naming one the Nor- 
wegian and the other the Danish mission. Copenhagen has always 
been the headquarters for the Scandinavian mission from the very 
first time, seventy years ago, when Apostle Erastns Snow came to 
Copenhagen to open the gospel door to the Scandinavian people. 
From that time, until the mission was divided, Copenhagen has 
been the headquarters, and in one sense we may call it yet the head- 
quarters, as far as Norway and Denmark are concerned, because the 
publications of the Church are still published in the Danish language, 
and both Norway and Denmark are supplied with the literature of 
the Church from Copenhagen, with the exception of a semi-monthly 
paper called Morgenstjernen which was published in Norway since 
it became an independent mission. However, in the first place, it 
was decided that the Scandinavian Star should be the periodical for the 
two missions, but for some reason permission was given to the Nor- 
wegian people to publish their own Star, in Christiania. Other- 
wise, Copenhagen is supplying the mission with all the other books. 

We had a wonderful time, a glorious time, a time of rejoicing 
over in those countries. This is not. my first experience in Norway, 
Sweden, and Denmark; because I have spent over thirteen years as 
a missionary in those countries, and hence, I am well acquainted with 
the conditions of the people, and their characteristics. The Scan- 
dinavian people are highly educated. They are progressive, indepen- 



ELDER CARL E. PETERSON 



135 



dent, and intellectual ; they have the best school system that can be 
found in the world ; in fact, Denmark stands right at the top of the 
ladder as far as education is concerned. And I say to you that yon 
cannot go from one end of Denmark to the other and find a normal 
boy or girl, eight years old. who cannot read and write. I say this 
because I know it is a fact. 

We have enjoyed freedom and liberty to preach the gospel in 
Denmark as you have right here in the valleys of the mountains. We 
are not ridiculed. We are respected wherever we go. If you appear 
as respectable men and women, you will be respected and honored, 
and in particular by what is termed the better class of people. The most 
highly educated people are the most tolerant. With them you can have 
interesting conversations, even from the king on his throne. He is 
willing to listen to you if you get the privilege of visiting him. It 
may be connected with a great deal of difficulty and peliminaries on 
the part of the American minister before you get the privilege, but 
if you get it, you will be received by him and he will enter into conver- 
sation with you relative to the religious, the social, and economic con- 
ditions prevailing here in the valleys of the mountains. He will go 
into details as to the resources of our glorious state. He seems to be 
familiar with conditions existing here. And he will carry on an in- 
teresting conversation, whether you desire to speak to him in Danish, 
French, German, or Italian or in the English language. He speaks 
perfectly the English language. So you do not need to be afraid if 
you go over there, some of you, perhaps thinking that you are 
scholars — you need not be afraid to employ the most complicated 
sentences and phrases that you may desire to employ in your conver- 
sation, indicating to him that you are highly educated and capable, 
because he will understand every phrase and word that you can utter 
to him in the English language and will reply to you in just as 
beautiful and perfect English as if he had resided in the United States 
all his life. And we find the same characteristic all through 
the whole country of Denmark. The people are highly educated, 
they are tolerant, they are willing to listen to you if you have anything 
to give them. They care not wdiether you represent the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or any otber church; they will 
listen to you just as well because you are a "Mormon," as we are 
called, as if you were a member of any other church ; it makes no 
difference. 

The question with the Danish people is this : Has this person who 
introduces himself as a special representative of a church or of a 
nation anything in particular to impart to us that we are not familiar 
with? If he has something new, something interesting, something 
educational, something poetical, something elevating the Danish 
people will listen to it with the greatest attention, and you will never 
be disturbed in any town or village, but you will be protected. In 
fact, the highest authorities asked me the question whether we ever 



136 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



had any trouble. I said, "No, never." "But," said they, " if trouble 
ever should occur, let us know and we will send you all the necessary 
protection you desire; because you have just as much right and 
privilege to proclaim the doctrines that you believe to be correci 
as any other church or denomination." 

O, there is so much to say regarding the Danish people ! And I 
speak this because I am not Danish. If I were, you would say that 
I was egotistic, but because I am not, I speak without restraint; be- 
cause I have found the Danish people, from the king on the throne to 
the most humble, to be endowed with these beautiful, admirable 
characteristics. And I say it to you who have ambitions to go to 
Denmark as representatives of the Church, and ask you the prepare 
yourselves, because you will go to a people who are highly educated 
and expect something from you when you come to them ; and if you 
desire pleasure and satisfaction and joy in the ministry in Denmark, 
you must prepare yourself ; for the time has come when the Danish 
people will never listen any more to illiteracy or ignorance. I say this 
to you from practical observation and experience. Whenever we 
have capable elders, people flock in great numbers to listen 
to them, and on the other hand when we are not favored with such 
representatives, the meetings are very small, and very few come, and 
they come only as a matter of duty. Hence, I say to you, "Let us 
prepare ourselves for the great work that lies before us, because the 
world is growing along intellectual lines and there are better people 
living today, yes, more intellectual people living in the world today, 
than ever before. There are more choice spirits coming to the world 
today than ever in the past, and there will be still more as the millen- 
nial dawn draws near at hand, because they will come here to enjoy the 
privileges of taking upon themselves bodies to be prepared for the 
great blessings in store for those who are permitted to enter into 
the glorious millennial reign of Jesus Christ when he shall come. 

Well, I must close. God bless you. I thank you for your atten- 
tion. I rejoice in having this privilege of attending this most en- 
thusiastic and interesting conference. God's Spirit has been poured 
out upon all the congregations that I have attended during this con- 
ference. I pray God's blessing upon President Grant, upon all the 
authorities of the Church, and the Latter-day Saints, at home and 
abroad, that the day may speedily come when righteousness shall pre- 
vail upon the earth and truth shall be acknowleged from one end of 
the earth to the other, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

( Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

The afternoon has been well spent. We have heard from the 
previous speakers much that has been very profitable and it is not 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



137 



my intention to keep this congregation more than a few minutes. 
Were I to give way to my feelings, I would rather not speak, but 
as President Grant has sent over six of us to address you this after- 
noon, I feel that I should not be doing my duty unless I spoke to 

y° u - i ': 1 1 H .Ml 

This conference has been one that will be long remembered. 
We have been fed with the bread of life. We have received the word 
of God from those who hold the Priesthood, after the order of his 
Son, and they have given us instructions concerning our spiritual 
upbuilding" and comfort, and concerning our temporal affairs. The 
scriptures have been opened to us; the experiences in the lives of our 
brethren have been given to us with profit and benefit, and I hope 
when we go home we shall do so determined to put into practice 
these instructions and take to our families the spirit of this great 
conference. Let me suggest that around our home fires in the even- 
ing, we tell our sons and daughters and others, our impressions of the 
conference, reciting the instructions and advice that we have received. 
It is very necessary that this be done, as not more than one out of every 
forty Latter-day Saints have heard the speakers during this conference. 

"Mormonism" is to me a modern marvel; and how did it come? 
It came from that overwhelming idea of the boy prophet, Joseph, 
to go into the woods and ask his Father, in faith believing, which 
church should he join, and in that simple prayer of a boy, and the 
visit of the Father and the Son who came in answer to that prayer, has 
brought about this wonderful work of which we are a part. The 
Lord chose to take an unlettered boy unlearned and unsophisticated 
in the things of, the world, but with a simple child-like faith 
to start his great work, and on that boy's prayer began the whole 
structure of "Mormonism." 

There is something unique about this great work. It was not split 
off from any sect or party like nearly all the sects of the day have been, 
but it came direct from our Father in heaven when the set time had come 
to establish his great work in the latter days, and the message of the gos- 
pel appealed to the honest in heart ; to those who were sweet in their lives 
and habits. Wherever the gosple went, they picked up these rugged, 
frugal, honest, God-fearing people, and under the influence of the Spirit 
of the Lord they accepted the gospel and upon them came the spirit 
of gathering. This gathering came to them as a part of the power 
and gift of this great work, and will come upon all those who accept 
the gospel in foreign lands. 

•Another part of this great miracle of "Mormonism" is to be 
seen right here in the valleys of the mountains, where men and 
women who previously held all shades of theories and ideas concerning 
religious matters, and many of them rooted deeply in the traditions 
of the world, on hearing the sound of the gospel, their minds were 
clarified ; they understood its principles ; they come here and mingle 
with one another until there has been welded here a solid body of 



138 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



people with the highest ideas of spirituality and religion that the world 
has yet seen. 

We should be thankful that we have been permitted to come on 
the earth in this dispensation, when this wonderful gospel, with all 
its gifts and powers and blessings, has been restored, and we have 
been permitted to partake of these blessings. Mighty men and pro- 
phets of old, men who have headed dispensations and whose works 
are partly recorded in the Scriptures, have longed for this time; and 
some have desired to live in this dispensation, when the Lord intended 
to gather together the works of all dispensations and establish his 
Church, never more to be thrown down nor given to another people. 

Let me ask you, as a bishop, to go home with determination to 
observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy before the Lord ; to pay 
your tithes and offerings in the time and the season thereof; to sit 
down alone with your conscience once a month and see what the Lord 
has given you, and tithe it there and then. Remember your sacrament 
meetings, and renew your determination to be at the table of the 
Lord to partake of the emblems of his body and blood in remembrance 
of his sufferings, and renew your covenants with him. Nothing 
should interfere with this duty and privilege, for it is a privilege 
of every Latter-day Saint to be present at the Lord's table to partake 
of the sacrament and remember of his death and suffering's. 

Let us continue that friendly, neighborly, helpful cooperation among 
the communities of the Latter-day Saints. Let us build up business 
on cooperative principles of mutual helpfulness and ownership. Let 
us get rid of some of our envy and pride and let us also get rid of 
the habit of spending in excess of our earnings. Let us avoid spec- 
ulation, and if we have spare means to invest, let it be done in well 
established and well developed businesses and institutions. Let us 
free ourselves from the bondage of debt. The Lord never intended 
his people to be in bondage to any community or to any person. We 
can only keep out of bondage by keeping out of debt. 

In the very nature of things we may expect panics. We may 
expect hard times. The chastening hand of the Lord will be felt 
throughout the world, but the man who is out of debt, who owns his 
home, who owns the land he cultivates, who is not borrowing, will not be 
seriously affected by panics. 

Above all, let us train our young people, around the family table, 
in the principles of the gospel and the obligation we owe to the Lord 
and to one another as Latter-day Saints, remembering our secret 
prayers, as well as our family prayers night and morning, for, after 
all, it rests upon the fathers and mothers of the children of Zion 
to train them in the fear and admonition of the Lord. 

Sometimes I think the world is ripening for destruction, but I 
do hope and pray the Lord will stay the avenging angels until the 
honest in heart throughout the world, particularly the House of 
Israel, have heard the gospel and have had the opportunity of gathering 
to Zion.

May the Lord bless us. May his spirit be with us. May this 
conference be one long to be remembered, for its deep spirituality 
and the influences that have come through associations with one 
another, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

An anthem, "Christ our Passover," solo by Miss Ellis Timpson, 
was sung by the choir. Benediction was pronounced by Willard C. 
Burton, of the Granite stake of Zion. 



CLOSING SESSION 

The final session of the Conference was held in the Tabernacle 
on Sunday afternoon, October 7, 1923, at 2 o'clock. President Heber 
J. Grant presided. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Prayer and Praise." 

Invocation by Elder Nephi L. Morris, of the Salt Lake stake of 
Zion. 

The choir sang, "The Pilgrim's Chorus." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

My Brethren and sisters: I feel my dependence upon the Lord, as 
I stand before this vast congregation of Latter-day Saints. I have 
thought, since the beginning of the conference, that if answer were 
needed to the world, the people of the world who do not understand, 
justifying the faith and works of the Latter-day Saints, these great 
assemblies of people, which have come together on this occasion would 
be sufficient. 

"if this be the work of men." 

Soon after the death and resurrection of the Redeemer of the 
world, when he had commissioned his disciples to preach the gospel 
to all creatures, and their ministry had fairly commenced, they were 
taken on one occasion and cast into prison. Then people came to 
the Jewish high priests and said to them : These men whom we cast 
into prison are preaching among the people, they are healing the sick 
and causing the blind of see, and working great miracles. So the 
disciples were cited to appear before their accusers and they took 
counsel that they might kill them. Then we are told here in Acts 
that, 

"There stood up cue in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of 
law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles 
forth a little space ; 

"And said unto them, Ye men of Tsrael, take heed to yourselves what ye 
intend to do as touching these men. 

"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; 
to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; who was 
slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to naught. 



140 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and 
drew away much people after him ; he also perished ; and all, even as many as 
obeyed him, were dispersed. 

"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for 
if this counsel or this work be of men, it will came to naught : 

"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it." 

WHY THE SPEAKER THOUGHT OF THIS QUOTATION. 

I have thought of that scripture, my brethren and sisters, during 
the proceedings of this conference, and particularly so because of two 
clippings which I hold in my hand, taken from recent publications, one 
of them from a journal which is published by one of our most im- 
portant religious denominations ; the other, from a daily newspaper. 
From the first of these clippings I read as follows : 

OPPOSING THE CHURCH 

"Only those who have had occasion to live for a time in a part of the country 
entirely dominated by 'Mormons' are able to estimate, with any degree of ac- 
curacy, the strength and danger of 'Mormon' influence in our Western states. 
Never have I heard Christ preached, or the necessity of a personal Savior. Never 
do I hear of missionaries going out to convert people to Christ. They talk only 
of converting them to 'Mormonism.' In Sunday schools and Church schools 
emphasis is placed upon the Book of Mormon rather than upon the Bible, 
and in one text they are explicitely told that the Book of Mormon is higher 
authority than the Bible." 

WHY MAKE RESPONSE? 

In the clipping from the daily paper, if it is correct — and I have 
no< doubt that it is — a man professing to be a teacher of righteousness, 
in a, public address recently delivered, referring particularly to the pro- 
ceedings at the memorial services recently held at the Hill Cumorah, 
declared that the "Mormon" Church was the most ignorant church in 
the world, and that the proceedings, upon this occasion, when the one- 
hundredth anniversary of the appearance of the Angel Moroni to 
Joseph Smith was commemorated, were all rot, rot, rot. When I 
read it I thought of this scripture which I have read from the Acts of 
the Apostles. To this congregation of Latter-day Saints I suppose 
it would appear unnecessary — in fact I have heard' the word ridiculous 
used — that attention be paid to such statements as these which I have 
just quoted, and in fact that is true, but it nevertheless does at times 
become necessary for the Church to make response to statements of 
this kind, for there are people, many of them good people, people who 
love the truth and desire it, who are misled and strongly prejudiced 
because of statements such as this that I have quoted being made by 
men in whom they have confidence. If those charges were true, if it 
were true that the Church taught doctrines which led men and women 
away from Christ, rather than to him, if it were true that the Church 
encouraged or in any degree endeavored to keep its members in a 
condition of ignorance, in this age of enlightenment and intelligence 
in which we live, these criticisms would be justified. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



141 



DOCTRINES BEST EVIDENCE 

But if on the other hand, they are not true, if they are not founded 
upon facts, persons making them assume very grave responsibility, 
for they either discuss questions upon which they are not informed, 
and in regard to which they are ignorant and thus convey improper 
impressions, or else they wilfully misrepresent the truth in order that 
they may prejudice their hearers. The doctrines of the Church are 
the best evidence of what the Church teaches. The Book of Mormon 
itself is the best evidence of what it is. The opinions of men may 
differ in regard to it, but when we take the book itself, when we care- 
fully study it, when we understand its contents, we there find the 
evidence of its worth, or otherwise. I know that abstract statements, 
either mine in, favor of the Book of Mormon, or yours in opposition 
to it, would not be sufficient to convince thoughtful minds, people who 
desire to know the truth of its contents, hence, we go to the Book of Mor- 
mon itself. I wonder, and I have often asked myself the question, why 
people professing to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, people 
whose mission is to bring others to faith in the divinity of his mission, 
to convert the world to the great truth that he is its Redeemer, I have 
wondered why men who place so much stress upon this should object 
when other testimony comes, when other corroborating evidence is 
produced which justifies their attitude and confirms the very thing 
that they are teaching; and yet that condition has always existed. 

Elder Roberts declared to us this morning, better than I can say it, 
the importance of this scriptural record, particularly to the people 
of these United States. It is important also, to the people of the world, 
for it is given to the world. It is of special importance to the 
scattered remnants of the house of Israel. It is of special importance 
to the Jew, for it comes as a message to him as well ; and the whole 
burden of the message which it brings is that great truth that Jesus 
of Nazareth, born of the virgin Man,', crucified upon Calvary, and 
risen from the dead, is the Redeemer of the world. The title page of 
the book itself, if you will turn to it, my brethren and sisters, estab- 
lishes this fact. This title page, by the way, was not written by Joseph 
Smith, it was inscribed upon the plates and translated by him as he 
found it. and it gives evidence to the world of the purpose in its 
preservation. "It is an abridgment of the record of the people of 
Nephi, and also of the Lamani f es. — Written to the Lamanites, who are 
a remnant of the house of Israel ; and also to Tew and Gentile. 

.An Abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which 
is a record of the people of Tared, who were scattered at the time the 
Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building 
a tower to get to heaven." The special purpose in the preservation 
of the plates, and the bringing forth of the record in this dispensation 
is declared to be: "To the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that 
Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all 
nations." That is the purpose of it. 



142 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



TESTIMONY FROM BOOK OF MORMON 

At a time long ago, when the truth was brought into question, 
the Prophet Isaiah said : "To the law and to the testimony : if they 
speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." 
In the mouths of two or three witnesses shall the truth be established. 
So I am just going to turn and read here, first from the Hook of 
Mosiah, the testimony which is borne in that book upon this important 
question : 

"For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the 
Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity, to all eternity, 
shall come down frcm heaven anions the children of men, and shall dwell in a 
tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, 
such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to 
receive their sight. * * * 

"And also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the 
transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning 
them, or who have ignorantly sinned. * * * 

"And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall lie no other name given nor 
any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, 
only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent." 

And yet intelligent men. through the publications which they send 
out to the world, declare that they have never heard Christ taught as 
a personal Redeemer by the "Mormon" people. 

ANOTHER WITNESS 

These words of Mosiah were uttered one hundred twenty-five 
years before Christ, before his birth into the world. Again another 
witness : A great concourse of people were garnered together upon 
this continent, discussing the words of the prophets who had declared 
that Christ, after his crucifixion at Jerusalem, should appear here, 
when they heard a voice as though it came from heaven declare the 
Only Begotten of the Father. Casting their eyes up towards heaven, 
they tell us that they saw a man descending and that he was clothed 
in a white robe. He came down, stood in their midst, stretched forth 
his hand, and said : 

"Behold. T am Jesus Christ whom the prophets testified shall come into the 
world. Behold, I am the light and the life of the world, and 1 have drunk out of 
that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father 
in taking upon me the sins of the world." 

Evidence again of the divinity of the mission of the Redeemer and 
his teachings in this book. 

Now turn over again, long after his death, four-hundred years 
had elapsed, when Mormon, writing here in the book which bears 
his name, gives this witness : " And these things doth the Spirit mani- 
fest unto me; therefore I write them unto you all." — addressed to us, 
the people who live here in the time when this record was to come 
forth : 

"And for t His cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye must all 
stand before the judgment seat of Christ, yea, every soul who belongs to the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



143 



whole human family of Adam ; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, 
whether they be good or evil ; , 

"And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall have 
among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have 
other witness besides him whom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, 
was the very Christ and the very God. 

"And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and 
prepare to stand before the judgment seat of Christ." 

"The Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ." 

My brethren and sisters, I might open this book at almost any 
chapter, almost any page, and read to you there the testimony of 
one prophet after another, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, 
six hundred years before Christ, until four hundred years after his 
coming, in which the whole burden of the appeal which they made 
to their people and the burden of the testimony that they bore, was that 
in the meridian of time the Redeemer should come, and that through 
him the bonds of death would! be broken, and the people of the world 
redeemed from the transgression of Adam. It is a wonderful thing 
that in the face of all of this, men can, in some way, associate as 
they do the Book of Mormon as a publication tending to lead people 
away from Christ and from Christianity, despite its contents. 

this is Christ's church. 

The Presiding Bishop called our attention, yesterday, to the fact 
that this is Christ's Church ; it bears his name. He opened, under 
the direction of the Father, this gospel dispensation. This Church 
was organized for the purpose that the world might know the Redeemer 
as he is, and be brought to repentance, redemption and everlasting 
life, through obedience to his gospel. Tt seems to me that this should 
set at rest the foolish statements made in this publication to which I 
have referred. I want the young men and women, if they are here, who 
are not familiar with the book, and I want the members of the Church 
who are not familiar with its contents, to know that there is no ne- 
cessity for alarm because of the unjustifiable things that people say 
about the Church, for as I said before, the Church must be judged 
by what it is, not by what people say of it. Those words of Isaiah, 
uttered more than two thousand six hundred years ago, are just as 
applicable to us today as they were applicable to the people to whom 
he spoke : "If they speak not according to the law and the testimony, 
it is because there is no light in them." 

AS TO IGNORANCE 

Now, my brethern and sisters, just a word in regard to the 
statement made by this pretended teacher of righteousness, that the 
"Mormon" Church is the most ignorant church in the world. I want 
to ask the people of the world this one question : Can they point 
to an instance in the history of the past where ignorance and achieve- 
ment and accomplishment have gone hand in hand? I am sure the 
answer would be, No. People do not advance in ignorance. People 



144 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



do not develop in ignorance. So far as I am aware, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the first religious body to declare 
that "the glory of God is intelligence," not ignorance; the first to 
declare that "men cannot be saved in ignorance." I do not mean 
to apply that to secular education, but it is only through the proper 
development of the intelligence of man, assisted by the gift of God, 
our Father, that men can come to understand his great purposes, the 
plan of human redemption which has existed from the beginning of 
time, and its application to us, who live in the dispensation of the 
fulness of times. I have thought of it as I have looked at these 
great congregations of people. Looking backward for one hundred 
years, does the accomplishment of the Church indicate the work of 
an ignorant people? It is not yet one hundred years since the Church 
came into existence. Its members at the time of its organization, were 
very few. It was in poverty, but thank the Lord, not in ignorance. From 
that small beginning, ask yourself the question : what has been its 
accomplishments? The people of the great congregation are here, and 
they are but a small representation of the whole, coming into these 
mountain valleys, to a place regarded as undesirable by all other 
people, not going to the Pacific Coast because of the gold that was 
there to lure people on, not to the great plains and fields of Oregon 
where it was evident that a country existed which was susceptible of 
a high degree of agricultural development, but stopping here in these 
valleys of the mountains, the Church gathered in its poverty. It 
gathered in from various nations, people in poverty, and from this 
spot reached out to the north and south, and the east and west, until 
towns and villages and hamlets sprang up. In every productive valley 
of the intermountain country, has intellectual development kept pace 
with the secular development which has occurred. We only need 
refer, and we do so with pride, to the educational status of the State 
of Utah today. There may be states which are slightly in advance, 
there may be states which have accomplished slightly more, but no other 
people under similiar circumstances have developed a system of education 
equal to that which has been developed by the people of these inter- 
mountain valleys, by the Latter-day Saints who came here in their 
poverty. I say it without fear of successful contradition. 

AS TO PATRIOTISM AND DEVOTION 

What does the record of their past history show, their record 
as devoted and patriotic citizens of the country in which they live? 
The great Mexican war — we would not regard it as a great war now, 
although in a sense it was at the time — came just when the Latter-day 
Saints were moving in their poverty with their families to seek a home 
here in the west. When the call came for men they gave them in the 
service of their country, a thing with which we are familiar, but 
which the world knows very little of. Those five hundred members of 
the Mormon Battalion accomplished a march which we are told is 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY IV. IVINS 145 



without precedent in the history of the world, the circumstances under 
which it was accomplished considered. 

The war of the Rebellion came, and the Latter-day Saints re- 
mained steadfast to the government, offered and gave their services. The 
war with the Philippines came, the "Mormon" pepole did their full 
share in bearing the burdens of that war. 

Then came the great World War. The government asked Utah 
for seven hundred forty-six men for the United States Army. She 
furnished two thousand, two hundred forty-four men. The govern- 
ment asked for one hundred twenty-six men to go into the marine 
service and the State furnished three hundred forty-six. Independent 
of this, Utah furnished one battery of artillery composed of one 
thousand five hundred men. The total number of men asked for was 
eight hundred seventy-two in all branches of the service, and the State 
furnished four thousand eight hundred thirty-one men. The Red 
Cross asked us for three hundred fifty thousand dollars, and we gave 
them five hundred twenty thousand dollars. The first Liberty Loan 
apportioned us six million, five hundred thousand dollars, and we 
took nine million, four hundred thousand dollars of that issue. The 
second Liberty Loan asked us to take ten million dollars and we took 
sixteen million, two hundred thousand dollars. The Young Men's 
Christian Association and other similar organizations asked us for 
one hundred thousand dollars, and we gave them one hundred five 
thousand dollars. The request was made that we furnish seventeen 
million one hundred thousand dollars, and we gave twenty-six million 
two hundred ninety-one thousand dollars. The third Liberty Loan 
came after this in which an equal proportion was given. This does 
not include the liberal contributions made by the auxiliary associations 
of the Church. It does not include the large amount of wheat which 
had been accumulated by the Relief Societies of the Church, the only 
incident of such a character that occurred in the war, or could occur 
in the world, for there was no other body that had so gathered together 
a large quantity of wheat that could be turned over in bulk in case 
of emergency as was done at that time. 

NOT THE WORKS OF IGNORANCE 

I quote these figures, my brethren and sisters, as a part of the 
evidence. The evidence, the law and the testimony are here to show 
that the works of the Latter-day Saints have not been the works of 
ignorant people. I myself have gone into a country where, for three 
hundred years there had existed what was called a high degree of 
civilization. I did not see a plow that was not made of wood and 
being pulled by oxen, with the yoke lashed to their horns. I did not 
see a modern wagon, but the old-fashioned carts and the old-fashioned 
plows, with which people plowed and bore their burdens in the valley 
of the Nile, thousands of years ago. Twenty years after the time that 
eight small "Mormon" colonies were established in the north of Mexico, 



146 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



they had accomplished more, looking to the advancement and develop- 
ment of that people in the introduction of modern methods of agri- 
culture, modern agricultural machinery, improved varieties of fruits 
and grains, than had been accomplished before since the day of the 
conquest; evidence sufficient of the intelligence, the integrity, and the 
industry of the Latter-day Saints. "By their fruits ye shall know them." 
That has always appealed to me as a definite and certain law. Ignorant 
people do, not accomplish the work of intellectuals, and vice versa. 

So I wonder what can be the mental process by which a man 
reaches the conclusion that the Latter-day Saints are the most ignor- 
ant people in the world. It is not a new thing; it has been going 
on since the beginning of time, since the organization of the Church, 
and I expect will continue to go on just the same; and that is another 
thing that the Hook of Mormon here tells us will occur, and another one 
of the evidences of the truth of this book; for it seems to provide for 
just about every criticism that can be made. Moroni, the last man to 
write in it, says : 

"The Lord hath commanded men, yea, even Jesus Christ. 

"And I said unto him : Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because 
of our weakness in writing ; for. Lord, thou hast made us mighty in word by 
faith, hut thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this 
people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast 
given them : 

"And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the 
awkwardness of our hands. * * * 

"And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, 
but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall 
take no advantage of your weakness." 

This has been exemplified many times in the history of the Church. 

This book, as has been testified before, is the very embodiment of 
the spirit of Americanism. We hear a lot about that in these days. 
In its simplicity it lays down those fundamental principles of democ- 
racy upon which every republican form of government must be based 
and founded. It teaches us that there should be no king to dictate upon 
this land. It teaches us that the will of the people, the voice of 
the people shall govern, and that minorities should submit to majorities. 
It teaches us also that the time may come when majorities will go 
wrong, "and when that time cometh," saith the Lord, "then my judg- 
ments shall hang over this people." 

FEET UPON SAFE GROUND 

Now my brethren and sisters, where differences of opinion exist, 
whether it be in regard to our temporal affairs or whether it be 
in regard to spiritual affairs, or faith in God, by which we hope to 
attain to eternal life in his presence, there must be some basic law to 
which we can refer and from which there can be no further appeal, 
which is the end of controversy ; otherwise I may assert and you may 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 147 



deny, and controversy would never cease. As it applies to our civil 
affairs, the temporalities and their control, that tribunal is the civil 
law, the law which we ourselves have made. As it applies to God 
and his purposes, the law is his written and spoken word. From it 
there can be no just appeal. So in civil affairs we honor and respect 
and uphold the civil law, and in things which pertain to the word 
of the Lord we adhere to his written word, as it is contained here in the 
Bible and in the Rook of Mormon. The Book of Mormon has been 
before the world now for nearly one hundred years. No one has 
ever pointed out an error in principle that is in it. Men may ridicule, 
they may scoff, but that does not constitute argument, nor evidence. 
They are the last arguments to which the vanquished always resort 
— ridicule, abuse, misrepresentation ; and I suppose they will be applied 
to us. 

So I feel that our feet are upon perfectly safe ground, that all 
that has been said in testimony of the divinity of the mission of Joseph 
Smith, and the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon, is true. I 
know it to be true, the opinions of men to the contrary notwithstanding. 
The time will come when men will know it to be true — just as the 
last words in the book tell us that it will. Let me read this last 
communication to conclude my remarks. These are the words of 
Moroni : 

A CALL TO COME TO CHRTST. 

"I exhort you to remember these things ; for the time speedily comcth that 
ye shall know that I lie not. for ye shall sec me at the bar of God ; and the Lord 
will say unto you : Did T not declare my words unto you, which were written 
by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of 
the dust? 

"I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, 
they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God ; and his word 
shall hiss forth from generation to generation. 

"And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is true. 

"And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay 
hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.* * 

"Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of 
all ungodliness ; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love 
God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, 
that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ ; and if by the grace of God ye are 
perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. 

"And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not 
his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the 
shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the 
remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot. 

"And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of 
God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth 
triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great 
Jehovah, the Eternal judge of both quick and dead. Amen." 

Solo by Louise Watson, "The words of our God endureth forever."

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There are five members of the First Council of Seventy that have 
not had the opportunity of speaking to us, and I had the names of 
some of our honored returned missionaries who have presided in some 
of the foreign missions, on my list. Time will not permit of our breth- 
ren speaking to us, as I am sure they would like to do, but we are going 
to stay here — those of us who are not so hungry that we are anxious 
to get away — until we hear from these brethren of the First Council 
of Seventy. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

( Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have been impressed with the testimonies that have been given 
during the sessions of this conference. I believe firmly not only in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ but in the destiny of the Government of the 
United States. I am impressed more and more with the truth that 
the advent of the Government of the United States in 1789 w r as the 
great fore-runner of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I remember reading of the sinking of a German submarine by 
an American boat, in 1918 ; and the sailors and soldiers of the German 
government were finding a watery grave. The American boat put 
to and ran up on one of the masts a signal with the words : "Wait, we 
are coming to save you." And, sure enough, the American sailors, in 
life-boats, put towards the spot where the German submarine had 
been hit, and, in a few moments, the German sailors were placed in 
the life-boats and brought safely to an American boat, given food, 
and were assured that their lives would be spared. In commenting 
on this incident, the President of the United States declared that the 
policy of the American army and the American navy should be to 
spare German lives wherever they could. 

I have often thought of that event in our history, because I believe 
it is a symbol of Americanism. I know it to be the spirit of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. It is the spirit of true Americanism. 

In reading recently the Constitution of the United States, I thought 
of the eloquent words of James Russell Lowell when he was at the 
court of France. Guizot, the French statesman, said to him : "How 
long will the Government of the United States endure?" And the 
reply of James Russell Lowell was :' "Just so long as the ideals of the 
founders of this government endure." This incident has been told 
in the remarkable letters of the great statesman Guizot, and it is 
something for us to remember. 

I believe that the English speaking race, represented by Great 
Britain and the United States, will be the race that will bring peace 
lo the world. The United States will work hand in hand with Great 
Britain, the nation that has stood for freedom and liberty — from the 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



149 



days of the Witenagemot, or the assembly of the wise men, of Alfred 
the Great, when that great 'king declared that the laws of England 
should be based upon the Ten Commandments. The Magna Charta, 
the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution of the 
United .States and its forerunner, the Declaration of Independence, all 
are the expressions of a liberty-loving race, which is intuitive. It is 
stamped in the very .soul of the English speaking race. From time of 
old to the present, the English people — the British and the Americans 
— have stood for the highest ideals of liberty and freedom and are stand- 
ing for them today. 

Chief Justice Marshall on one occasion declared that the reason 
the Americans understand liberty and freedom is because their laws 
must be the expression of the economical, social and intellectual ideals 
of the people. When the Latter-day Saints came to these valleys the 
very first law was an economic one. It created roads and bridges. 
And another law established the first university west of the Missouri 
river. It was a law that was an expression of the intellectual life 
of the people, and I believe with all my soul that the words of Chief 
Justice Marshall have been exemplified in the history of the "Mormon" 
people. Their laws have always been just; they have been expressions 
of the lives of the people who have tried to live right, who have aimed 
to live justly and up to the very highest ideals that a God-given 
religion could place in their hearts. I believe that the "Mormon" 
people, in a sense, were the forerunners of that great ideal which 
today our nation stands upon. The Constitution of the United 
States was not a league of friendship, but it was a document that 
bound the states together in one great union ; and though it took many 
years to work this idea out, and finally a great civil war to maintain 
it, it was the ideal of Washington, and of Hamilton, and Chief Justice 
Marshall and Abraham Lincoln. 

Following down that early period when the Church was organized 
and which grew in the wilderness, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, 
Orson Pratt, and the host of other Americans who had come from New 
England stood for that expression of liberty. The Constitution of the 
United States is the embodiment of the organic law of the land, which 
is the highest expression of our civic and political liberties, whereby 
we live under government and whereby we come to know equality and 
justice. 

The Latter-day Saints stand for Americanism in the true sense 
of the term. A great French economist declares that the five institu- 
tions of civilization are the home, industry, the state, the school, and 
religion as expressed in the church. 

I bear you my testimony this day that our history proves, that we 
as Latter-day Saints have not only taken a stand firmly for the Consti- 
tution and the Declaration of Independence but have given meaning to 
those great documents. The pioneer history of this state declares that 
we stand for the five institutions of civilization, because by them and 



150 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



through them we may go back to our God, for one of these institutions 
is religion, and our religion, as we understand it, and as we hold it 
sacredly in our souls, comes in its purity, in its dignity, in its power 
from God whom we worship. And so. we are Americans, and the 
words of Lowell will be true so long as America is Christian; so 
long as we live to the ideals of our fathers America will live and it 
will be preserved forever and ever. The Abby Genty, the great French 
lecturer and scholar of the time of the French revolution, when he was 
noticing the beauty and grandeur of the new American government, 
in contrast to* the government of France, declared that the new nation 
across the Atlantic would not only be the nation that will usher in the 
new political and civic liberty of all the world, but it will be the nation 
to re-establish the go,spel of peace and the laws of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

( Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

We have been instructed, admonished, and at times thrilled, by 
the exceptionally good talks we have heard, even from the beginning 
of this conference. Our thoughts have naturally turned, at this cen- 
tennial season, to the circumstances connected with the coming forth 
of the Book of Mormon. Those not of us have tried to account for the 
phenomena of "Mormonism" upon some theory other than the true one, 
just as they attempted to explain away the Savior and his works. The 
argument against the Savior has been briefly stated and answered thus : 

"Upon the theory that Christ was a mythical person, the result of the 
fancy and fairy stories of his disciples after his death, then we must con- 
clude that the leader of the greatest movement for the converting, purifying, 
inspiring and uplifting of the race which the world has ever known is the 
product of myth, fancy, overwrought imagination, and pious disposition. If 
this be true, then it is also true that error is better than truth, and the 
race moves upward under the beneficient influence of falsehood. But this 
absurd and untrue theory which forces such conclusions must be rejected." 

The same argument may be applied to the rise and growth of 
so-called "Mormonism," said by Professor George Trumbull Ladd, of 
Yale University, to be one of the most remarkable phenomena of the 
Nineteenth century. It has been peculiar in the way it has announced 
foundation principles, contrary to the belief held by the world. Let 
me illustrate: Judge Samuel Chase, a United States Circuit Judge, 
in passing the death sentence upon one John Fries, convicted for 
treason, at the beginning of the last century, used this admonition, 
which fairly expresses the Christian doctrine as Veld at that time, 
as to repentance after death. Said Judge Chase to the prisoner : 

"I suppose you are a Christian, and as such I address you. Be assured, 
my guilty and unhappy fellow citizen, that without serious repentance of all 
your sins, you cannot expect happiness in the world to come ; and to your 
repentance you must add faith and hope in the merits and mediation of Jesus 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



151 



Christ. These are the only terms on which pardon and forgiveness are promised 
to those who profess the Christian religion. Let me, therefore, again entreat 
you to apply every moment you have left in contrition, sorrow and repentance. 
Your day of life is almost spent and the night of death fast approaches. Look 
up to the Father of mercies and God of comfort. You have a great and immense 
work to perform and but little time in which you must finish it. There is 
no repentance in the grave, for after death comes judgment, and as you die 
so must you be judged. By repentance and faith you are the object of God's 
mercy; but, if you will not repent and have faith and dependence upon the 
merits of the death of Christ, but die a hardened and impenitent sinner, 
you will be the object of Gods justice and vengeance. If you will sincerely 
repent and believe God has pronounced his forgiveness, there is no crime 
too great for his mercy and pardon." 

This expresses the supposed Christian doctrine that "as the tree 
falls, so must it lie." Judge Chase afterwards became a Justice of the 
Supreme Court of the United States. Enemies sought his downfall, 
and he was impeached and tried before the United States Senate. 
At least two counts in the indictment against him grew out of the 
trial of the Fries case; but there was not one word of criticism as to 
this sectarian doctrine just quoted. I thought last evening, as we 
listened to the beautiful compilation of our scriptures by Brother 
Widtsoe and presented in the oratorio, what a striking contrast be- 
tween the old dogma of no repentance after death and our present 
conception of the Spirit of Elijah. 

They have sought to explain away so-called "Mormonism" upon 
various theories. Years ago we had to meet in discussion of the 
myth of the "Manuscript Found." To-day, we need pay no attention 
to that. For example, in the late popular history of the United States, 
issued from Washington, D. C, in eleven volumes by the American 
Educational League, with Doctors Willey & Rines as the learned 
editors, no attention is given to this old "Spaulding romance" except 
to consign it to the rubbish heap. As an illustration of the futility 
of the efforts of those who fight the Church, it must seem like the 
irony of fate to such men as Theodore Schrceder — a lawyer of this 
city of a score of years ago, who spent much time and money in 
developing the false theory that Sidney Rigdon was the author of the 
Book of Mormon, — that his writings should be cited as authority for 
the rejection of the Spaulding myth but his own theory not so much as 
mentioned by the United States history referred to. 

We heard this afternoon from the article read by President Ivins 
the statement that the Latter-day Saints place reliance in the Book of 
Mormon. Well, we have learned that it does throw light upon the 
Hebrew Scriptures. ■ For instance, in the Beatitudes : "Blessed are the 
poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The Book of 
Mormon version is : "Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." And again, "Blessed are they who 
do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." 
The Book of Mormon adds, "with the Holy Ghost." And so we 



152 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



might go on with several other examples. During the past month 
the Literary Digest presented four translations of the Beatitudes 
in parallel columns. It seemed to me that no additional light or beauty 
are thrown upon the earlier translations ; and yet through the Prophet 
joseph we have the significant version I have referred to. 

In connection with what President Grant said, in reference to 
spiritual manifestations at certain European conferences, it is easy 
for me to understand how that could be. If I may have a moment 
more, I would like to give a personal testimony of coming into the 
presence of the late President Joseph F. Smith, on one occasion at 
a quarterly conference held at Logan. I had just returned from a 
long itinerary and was as weary as it has ever been my experience 
to be — both in body and in mind. As a result of the influence of 
the Holy Spirit which was enjoyed by President Smith and his 
audience, at the close of that meeting I was as free from all sense 
of weariness as I had ever been. In a studied effort I could not detect 
the slightest indication of fatigue either in body or mind. My time 
is up. May the Lord bless us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

{Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, when I look out upon the faces of this 
vast congregation, I am deeply impressed with the power and the in- 
fluence that seems to be felt by all who are present. There must be 
something peculiar about the Latter-day Saints, for whenever they 
gather together there is a power and an influence that is felt by all 
who are present, that is peculiar to us. I have been led to reflect : what 
is it that is different from the gatherings of those who are not of 
our faith and the gatherings of a nature other than these religious 
conferences? And the answer has come to me: It is because the 
great multitude of people that congregate, that come together upon 
these occasions are men and women who have faith in God and have 
repented of sin, who have received a remission of those sins in the 
waters of baptism and after that they have received the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by the laying on of hands. It is then the presence of the Holy 
Ghost, the Spirit of God, that animates these general assemblies of 
the Latter-day Saints and characterizes them as different from all 
other gatherings of people throughout the entire world; for in no 
other church are there people who have been thus blessed and favored 
of the Lord, for they have not received the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Among the different things that were contained in the message 
of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith on that notable 
night of September 21, 1823, was the reference to the holy scriptures, 
wherein it was set forth that the day was nigh at hand when Elijah 
the Prophet would come and restore the keys of the turning of the 



ELDER RULON S: WELLS 



153 



hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers 
to their children. When we realize how completely this has been 
fulfilled, it adds to the numerous testimonies which we have received 
of this great work of the Lord. Surely the Prophet, at that early 
period of his life, could not have comprehended to any marked extent, 
the great work that was involved in those words. Temples have been 
erected and work has been done in those temples for millions of peo- 
ple. We build these places and we call them holy, erected to the name 
of the Lord and dedicated unto his service. 

The people who have been blessed by receiving the gift of the Holy 
Ghost are called Latter-day Saints. What do we mean by Saint? We 
mean a sanctified being, or a holy being. Faith in God, repentance 
from sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin and the re- 
ception of the Holy Ghost will make them worthy of the name by 
which the Lord permits them to be called. Do we have that name 
because we are sanctified beings? Oh, no; but because we have started 
out right and are in the process of sanctifying ourselves and preparing 
ourselves to dwell in the presence of God. A sanctified being, a holy 
being, is one whose sins have been remitted, one who has been made 
holy by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Wherever the Lord plants his feet it becomes a sacred and holy 
place. What was it that the Lord said to Moses at the time of his 
appearance in the burning bush: "Put off thy shoes from off thy 
feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." Only 
those who are holy are permitted to stand upon holy ground. Strangers 
Who come into our midst wonder why they may not go into the 
temples that we have erected. They marvel that the doors are closed 
against them. Many who have been in our temples before their dedi- 
cation have also wondered why they may not continue to go there. 
Strangers do not always understand it, but this is the reason : Because 
they have not been sanctified by having sealed upon them the gift of 
the Holy Ghost. This permission is given only to those who have 
received this marvelous gift, and many who have received the gift of 
the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, unless they have retained 
the remission of their sins by living right, are not permitted to stand 
upon that holy ground. Who then shall enter into the temple of the 
Lord? I find an answer to that question in holy writ, where a ques- 
tion is asked somewhat similar in its nature: 

"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand 
in his holy place ? 

"He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart ; who hath not lifted 
up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 

"He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness 
from the God of his salvation." 

Brethren and sisters, it becomes necessary, then, that we not 
only receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that we retain it by re- 
taining the remission of our sins. Let us then, be prepared and worthy 



154 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



to go into these sacred houses, and carry out our part as suggested in 
the message that was given to us through the Angel Moroni, when the 
Prophet Elijah should come and enable us to go into these houses 
and perform the labors, not only for the dead, but also for the living. 

God help us to be worthy, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

( Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, I have been deeply impressed with the 
remarks of my brethren during this conference. The impression was 
made at the beginning of the service in the remarks of President Heber 
J. Grant, and so on each day, each session has added to my pleasure and 
happiness in listening to the wonderful testimonies that have been borne. 
I was reminded this afternoon of the chivalry of the American people, 
of the American soldiers and the American sailors during the Spanish- 
American war, at the great naval battle in San Diego harbor, at the 
conquering of the Spanish navy, and the taking of many prisoners. 
During the very heat of that terrible naval engagement the Spanish 
ships, many of them, were set on fire and the sailors were seen cling- 
ing to the rigging and to the bows and bulwarks of the vessels, 
and jumping overboard to save them from being burned. The Ameri- 
can sailors began to shout for victory, but Admiral Schley issued the 
command that they should cease shouting, for could they not see their 
fellow men clinging to burning vessels and going down into the ocean 
to their death ! So the shouting and the hurrahing ceased. After 
the close of the war, thirteen thousand Spanish prisoners were 
found in the possession of the American forces-, and by order of that 
Christian gentleman, President William McKinley, those prisoners 
were taken to a place of safety and there fed during the winter, 
kept in good comfortable quarters, and in the following spring, 
placed in American vessels and conveyed home to their own country to 
the shores of Spain without cost to themselves or to the country from 
which they came. That was an ideal of President McKinley. I 
have always felt to honor him as a true Christian gentleman. He made 
a journey across the plains and through this western country, and had 
appointments to speak in different places in the West, Salt Lake among 
the rest, but while in California, his wife was taken severely ill, and he 
had to hurry home, and therefore his engagements were canceled. 1 
went to Ogden to see him as he passed through that city, and I heard 
him speak a few words from the rear platform of his car. I was still 
more impressed with the dignity, with the scholarship and with the 
tenderness of that great man, the President of the American Republic. 

Now as to the gospel : 

In fulfilment of the prediction of Malachi, as quoted to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith by the Angel Moroni, Elijah the Prophet appeared to 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 



155 



Joseph Smith in the Kirtland temple, and committed to him the keys 
of the restoration of the ordinances for the dead. Today we are wit- 
nesses that there are six temples now finished and dedicated in which 
ordinances for the dead are ministered. On the 26th day of July, two 
days after the pioneers landed in this country, it is said that President 
Brigham Young, the great pioneer of the west, placed his cane on the 
position on this block where the temple now stands and said : "On this 
spot we will build the temple of the Lord," and although he lived to 
lay the cornerstone and dedicate it at the beginning of the building, 
he did not live to see its completion, but he led in the dedication of the 
first temple that was completed in Utah. That was in 1875, if I remember 
rightly, the temple of St. George was dedicated, and he presided at 
the dedicatorial services. Then further on came the dedication of the 
Logan temple, under President Taylor, then the dedication of the Manti 
temple, under the President of the Twelve, Wilford Woodruff ; then 
came finally the fulfilment of that wonderful vision of President Wood- 
ruff's. Lie said in relating it, that some years before the Salt Lake temple 
was finished, he saw himself seated on the front steps of the temple. 
President Brigham Young came and said to him : "Brother Woodruff, 
take the keys and unlock the doors of the temple, and bid the 
people enter." President Woodruff in relating this at the dedica- 
torial services of the temple, said he was very much surprised that he 
should be commissioned to dedicate the Salt Lake temple, while Presi- 
dent Taylor was still living; but when the temple was finished, in 
1893, President Taylor had passed away to his eternal and great reward, 
and President Woodruff had been elected and ordained President of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, under the inspiration 
of the Lord Almighty. Then he said he could see why he was com- 
missioned to dedicate that holy house, years before its completion. 
President Woodruff dedicated two temples, one at Manti and the one 
in Salt Lake Cily. President Taylor dedicated the Logan temple ; and 
now recently our beloved President Heber J. Grant has led in the build- 
ing and the finishing and the dedication of two other temples, one on the 
Hawaiian islands, and one in Canada. I pray with all my heart that 
he may live to dedicate very many more. When I visit our temple here 
in Salt Lake, which I take the opportunity of doing occasionally, I 
rejoice to see the anxiety that seems to possess the people in prosecuting 
this work for the redemption of their dead kindred. This temple and, 
I believe, all the other temples are filled to their capacity in this glorious 
work of redemption for the dead. I am satisfied that this is but an- 
other great evidence of the truth of the gospel and of the divine organi- 
zation of the true Church of Christ under the inspiration of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith. These great events of building new temples and 
dedicating them, and the gathering of the people to these sacred build- 
ings to perform their duties and their obligations to the dead, are addi- 
tional evidences to me of the truth of "Mormonism." 

But beyond and far greater is the knowledge that I possess in 
my own heart, that the Lord has revealed to me in the inmost recesses 



156 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



of my soul, the truth of the everlasting gospel as proclaimed now 
by the Latter-day Saints. The divine mission of the Savior, the great 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, are facts brought to my mind as 
vividly and as earnestly and as truly as the thought and the knowledge 
of my own existence. I know today that God lives, I know that Jesus 
Christ is the Savior of the world ; I know that Joseph Smith was di- 
vinely inspired as a prophet of God. May the Lord increase this knowl- 
edge for us all, I pray, and make our testimonies bright and real and 
sure, that we may be encouraged to go on with the great work in which 
we are engaged, until the redeeming power of the gospel of Jesus Christ 
shall reach the uttermost parts of the earth, and every one of our 
Father's children shall have the privilege of receiving these great truths, 
and thus bring to pass their redemption, I pray, through Jesus Christ, 
our Lord. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret exceedingly to have had to limit the time of any of the 
brethren in these conferences. I am sure that every speaker, judging 
by myself, would have been pleased to occupy more time in talking 
to the Saints. When we stand up to speak and the Lord blesses us 
with the light and inspiration of his Spirit, it is rather a difficult 
matter not to want to talk and keep on talking. I confess freely, that 
it is very seldom when I am addressing the Latter-day Saints, that I 
do not have very many ideas come into my mind that I would like to 
express ; but 1 feel the necessity of not continuing my remarks, as a 
rule, longer than 1 have done in the past. I therefore regret that it is 
not possible to give the brethren the opportunity and the chance to 
more fully express themselves ; but I am sure that many of them who 
have been limited to ten minutes have done themselves proud, under 
the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, in testifying to us during 
the short time that was allotted them. 

Now to the law and testimony as we believe in it. 

BELIEF OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

"We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their 
members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such 
societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but 
we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men, on the 
right of property or life, to take from them this world's goods, or put them 
in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon 
them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw 
forrn, them their fellowship." 

"We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all 
wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the rights of property 
or character infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but, we 
believe that all men arc justified in defending themselves, their friends and 
property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



157 



of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made to 
the laws, and relief afforded." 

I spent considerable time while Brother Ivins w'as preaching, look- 
ing through a lot of old papers for a few words that I wanted to read 
to this congregation. It fell to my lot to be honored, by playing a 
game of golf with the President of the United States. It also fell to 
my lot, when a very noted attorney, Judge James A. Emery, came here 
to make a very important speech as an industrial expert, to be invited 
to play a game of golf with him. And after playing that game of golf, 
I had the privilege of hearing him deliver his speech at the Country 
Club. He expressed pleasure in coming back to Ultah and he an- 
nounced — I do not know that I can give his words — that the people 
of Utah stood like a great rock in the ocean against the waves of dis- 
content. 

A ROCK OF CERTAINTY. 

I just wish to read one little tribute from his address : 

"In renewing an old acquaintanceship comes a peculiar source of in- 
spiration. I have been impressed with the continuing evidence which the light 
of Utah has had in the development of the state. Tell me what a man thinks 
and I will tell you what he does. This community has stood like a rock of 
certainty and decision in the midst of radicalism and discontent. Utah has stood 
as one of the cornerstones of reliability in the American political structure." 

That is from one of the great lawyers of the United States. After 
his speech, 1 had the pleasure of riding to the Country Club in the 
automobile with him, and afterwards of having a little ride to en- 
joy some of the scenery. The gentleman owning and driving the 
automobile, was not a member of our Church, but in complimenting 
judge Emery upon his magnificent address, he said: "Credit is due 
to the 'Mormon' people for not defending those things that are con- 
trary to the fundamental laws, and the sustaining of the institutions of 
our country," or some words to that effect ; and the Judge said : "Why, 
everybody knows that." I might add : except some people here at 
home. 

We hear a great deal about the wonderful influence of the "Mor- 
mon" priesthood and the tyranny of it ; and this reminds me of a little in- 
cident in my own life. When I was a vice-president of the Chamber 
of Commerce and a certain gentleman was made the secretary, I sug- 
gested that we have that gentleman write a pamphlet upon the resources 
and attractions of Utah, inviting people to come here and make perma- 
nent homes — but of course we do not want anybody to come, so we 
are told! 

FALSE AND TRUE PROPAGANDA. 

And he wrote that pamphlet, and I suggested that after the cost of 
setting up the type had been returned and we had had our investment 
returned, that this man have an increase of salary because of the 



158 



CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



selling of the pamphlet. A few months later he thanked me for having 
made that motion, because he said that he was getting $20 or $25 per 
month from it and it was adding to his meager salary. I said : "It 
is contemptible for any man to receive thanks from his fellow-man 
in a favor that he did not extend. I did not nominate you, and suggest 
that you write that pamphlet because I wanted to increase your salary, 
although I did announce that it would increase it. I nominated you 
to write that pamphlet because I knew you would have to tell the truth 
in your writing, and that the truth printed in that pamphlet would brand 
the articles that you had written upon this city years ago as a United 
States official, as plain, simple lies. That is why I nominated you, sir. 
Among other things, you said that the "Mormon" Priesthood controlled 
the people in every city, in every home, and all over this Territory, 
and that they were getting rich by robbing the people, in the articles 
you wrote for eastern publication. In this pamphlet you say that in 
no other state or territory of the United States are such splen- 
did opportunities for settlers to be found as in Utah and that the 
city, community and territorial taxes are lower than in any other state 
or territory in the Union. What a pity that these robbers could not 
be exported to rob other people by reducing their taxes !" About that 
time he looked as if he would like to hit me instead of thanking 
me. I decided that I was quick enough to dodge if he should at- 
tempt to do so. 

AUTHORITY OF PRIESTHOOD. 

Now, with reference to the authority of the Priesthood of God 
and how it is to be exercised : The Prophet of the living God was im- 
prisoned in Liberty jail and there was a desire that he should be tried 
and executed ; but all the prison doors in all the world can not prevent 
the revelations of the mind and the will of God coming to those that 
are entitled to receive them ; and while in Liberty jail the Prophet 
Joseph Smith received one of the very greatest of all the great revela- 
tions from God that are contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. I 
read from Section 121 : 

"How long can rolling waters remain impure ? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from- pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the 
Latter-day Saints, 

"Behold, there are many called but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any 
degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves ; the Spirit 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



159 



of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or 
the authority of that man. 

"Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, 
to persecute the saints, and to fight against God. 

"We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a 1 ittle authority, as they suppose, they will 
immediately begin to exercise unrighteous diminion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen." 

INSPIRED WORDS. 

Now, I want to emphasize the balance of this revelation, given in 
a jail. With all the power of a State trying to take away the liberty 
of Joseph Smith, they could not prevent the communication of that 
prophet with the heavens, and he received the following inspired words 
that should never be forgotten by any bishop or any president of a 
stake, or any apostle, or any president of the Church as long as they 
hold office in this Church: 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priest- 
hood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, ,and 
by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou 
hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy 
confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood 
shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion," 

MORE PRICELESS THAN WEALTH. 

More priceless than all the wealth of all the world is to have the 
Holy Ghost as our constant companion. 

"and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and 
thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and with out compulsory means 
it shall flow unto thee for ever and ever." 

We are an ignorant people, are we? Why, Dr. Winship an- 
nounces that we have the best laws on education of any state in 
the United States, and yet the majority of the legislature come from 
the ignorant "Mormons." 

We are a vile people, are we ? Consider this : the governor of 
Arizona announced that if we had our just dues we would not have 
been robbed of between twenty-five hundred and three thousand per 
cent of some of the taxes in Arizona, namely : that we were entitled to 
twenty-five or thirty inmates in the state penitentiary and only had 
one. He also announced that we were being robbed because we did 
not have six or seven, in proportion to our population in the insane 
asylum.

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



When it comes to divorces — the crying evil of the age — we are not 
in it at all! 

When it comes to marrying, we can lead them every time. 

When it comes to fulfilling the first great commandment of God : 
to multiply and replenish the earth — we lead. Utah's best crop, and 
Canada's and Mexico's best crop, in every true, loyal, faithful Latter- 
day Saint family, is babies. 

Our death-rate is lower. Our birth-rate higher. 

BY THEIR FRUITS. 

"By their fruits ye shall know them," and we are at the defiance 
of the world in all the vital statistics that go^ to show that we are a 
Christian people, that we do acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior 
and Redeemer of the world, and are living up to his teachings. We are 
at the defiance of any honest man upon the face of the earth to point 
out that we do not lead in all those things; and the Savior said, "By 
their fruits ye shall know them." 

Speaking of the accomplishments in our Mexican colonies, that 
great president and warrior who ruled Mexico with an iron hand for 
so many years — Porfirio Dias, when he visited, just a short time before 
he was driven from his country, the fair in Chihuahua, when he came 
to the exhibits of industry and frugality; when he saw the products 
of our canning factories, our harness factories, the shoe factories; 
when he saw the exhibits from our academy there — as fine an academy 
as is in all Utah, barring only Logan, Ogden, Salt Lake, and Provo, 
our four principal cities — when he saw all the exhibits there, that 
warrior, whom nobody would expect to shed a tear, when he saw what 
this "ignorant" people had done in Mexico, wiped his eyes and said: 
"What could I not do with my beloved Mexico if I had more citizens 
like these 'Mormons?'" 

In Canada we have made a record second to no people. 

GOOD COLLEGE RECORDS. 

In every college of the United States where our boys have gone, 
in every university attended by them, they have made a record that 
is the equal to the best. We expended of the Church funds and the 
people's funds, last year, a million dollars because we are a lot of 
ignoramuses and want to keep the people in ignorance. "The Glory 
of God is intelligence." 

Let me read some more from the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

"Whatever principles of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise 
with us in the resurrection. 

"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through 
his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in 
the world to come. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of 
this world, upon which all blessings are predicated — ■ 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Latter-day Saints realize, know and comprehend that one of the 
greatest duties devolving upon them is to gain knowledge, and to study 
and get information out of good books. 

"If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, 
we seek after these things." 

God lives, Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
the true and the living God; and this work called "Mormonism" is 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, and is the plan of life and 
salvation; and all the disbelief of the world, all the opposition of all 
the world cannot stop it, God has established it and it wi.l go on and 
on until it has Milled its destiny! And may God help you and me 
and every soul that has a knowledge of the divinity of this work, to 
live the Gospel, that our acts may preach it, is my prayer and 1 ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Deseret News has been broadcasting all the remarks made 
here this morning and this afternoon. 

I desire to express my gratitude and thanks to all the Saints for 
the very remarkable and splendid order we have had during all our 
conference meetings. I believe it has been the very best of any con- 
ference I have ever attended. 

I am very grateful for the very large attendance. I am thankful 
for the inspiration of the Lord to all those who have spoken. 

I am grateful indeed that President Penrose, who will soon be 
92 years of age, has been able to be with us and lift up his voice in 
testimony of the divinity of this great work. 

We will now ask you to arise and President Penrose will offer the 
benediction. 

The choir sang "Inflammatus." solo by Miss Dolores Seal. 
Benediction was pronounced by President Charles W. Penrose. 
The conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by 
Professor B. Cecil Gates. Professor J. J. McClellan played the accom- 
paniments, interludes, etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. 
Kimball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Taber- 
nacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson ; and in 
the Assembly Hall by Frederick E. Barker. 

Edward H. Anderson, Clerk of the Conference.

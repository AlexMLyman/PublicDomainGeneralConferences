A THRILLING STORY 

of Gentury One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is certainly a very inspiring sight to look at this immense audience, 
with so many standing. I am grateful for the wonderful growth of the 
Church — 571,000 people in the stakes of Zion alone. 

I recall my first, trip to New York, after having been made an 
apostle, and the ridicule that I met from many people with whom I 
conversed. Then we had under the jurisdiction of the United States 
fewer than 200,000 Church members. There were 60,000,000 people 
in the country at that time, now there are 120,000,000, a 100 per cent 
increase in this great country of ours, and the Church has increased in 
numbers from less than 200,000 in the United States to 571,000 in the 
various stakes. Zion is growing and prospering at home and abroad, and 
I am grateful for it. 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER DIFFICULTIES 

As I remarked at the Relief Society Conference yesterday, I never 
think of the life and labors of the Prophet Joseph Smith but I am filled 
with wonderment at the remarkable things that he accomplished during 
the fourteen years from the time of the organization of the Church 
until his death. Without the help of God our Heavenly Father and the 
guidance of his Son Jesus Christ, I do not believe that any mortal man 
could have accomplished anything in comparison with what he did; in 
fact I know it could not have been done. 

It is marvelous what he accomplished, notwithstanding the mob- 
bings, drivings, the tarrings and featherings, the lawsuits, and the 
arrests — he was arrested more than forty times as I remember it — the 
incarcerating in jail, and everything with which he had to contend. 

REVELATIONS IN LIBERTY JAIL 

The enemies of the work of God, as you all know, imprisoned the 
Prophet in Liberty jail, where he received two very remarkable revela- 
tions. They are known as Sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, also a remarkable document which was published regarding 
the persecutions of the Saints (Section 123). The mob could not pre- 
vent the Prophet from receiving communications from God. To my 
mind, Section 121 is one of the greatest revelations that God has given 
to us through the Prophet Joseph. In Section 122 we read: 

The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall 
have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee. 

While the pure in heart, and the wise and the noble, and the virtuous, 
shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under 
thy hand. 

And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony 
of traitors. 

And the people of God have never been turned against the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, nor have they been turned against Brigham Young, nor 
John Taylor, nor Wilford Woodruff, nor Lorenzo Snow, nor Joseph F. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

Smith, nor your humble servant. I think I am absolutely safe in saying 
that 99 and a fraction per cent of the Latter-day Saints have sustained 
the men who in the providences of the Lord have stood at the head of 
this Church from the days of the Prophet until the present time. 

Section 122, in which the Lord speaks to the Prophet Joseph about 
his trials and tribulations, concludes by saying : 

If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou _ art in perils 
among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thoU art in 
perils by land or by sea : 

The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater 
than he? 

Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee ; 
for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy 
years shall not be numbered less ; therefore, fear not what man can do, 
but God shall be with you forever and ever. 

GOD WITH THE CHURCH 

God has been with the Church f rom the day of its organization, 
and will continue to be. 

I read from Section 121 : 

How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it upstream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from pouring down knowledge upon the heads of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon principles of righteousness. 

The powers of heaven have been handled in this Church from the 
days of the Prophet Joseph Smith until today upon the principles of 
righteousness. 

FRIENDLY COMPLIMENTS 

I received many letters when I was called to be an apostle of the 
Church, some of them from men not of our faith. I remember distinctly 
one that I received from a man who had known me from my young 
manhood. He was the general manager of one of the big insurance 
companies of the world. He said : 

Heber, I have known you from your youth. I know that you are 
fundamentally honest from the crown of your head to the soles of your 
feet. I have never had a very good opinion of the leaders of the "Mormon" 
people because I believed that they were a bright, shrewd lot, taking ad- 
vantage of the ignorance and religious enthusiasm of the people to become 
wealthy, but now that you are one of the fifteen men to stand at the head 
of the "Mormon" Church I apologize to the other fourteen. I know if 
there were anything crooked or anything shady, or anything wrong in 
the Church, you would give the whole thing away.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I think it was Josh Billings, who said : 

Never judge a man by his relatives, he cannot help them, they are 
crowded on to him, but judge him by the company he keeps, because he 
chooses his own. 

I rejoice in the statement made to me by David Wood the day after 
Anthony W. Ivins was made an apostle. He said : 

I am glad you are running your Church to suit me. If you had 
come into my offce yesterday and said, "Dave Wood, you have lived 
among us for twenty-five years, and you have been a friend to the Mormon 
people at home and abroad, in the United States and in foreign countries, 
and I have been sent down to your office to say to you, as you know the 
leading people of the Church from Canada on the north to Mexico on 
the south, that we are ready and willing to show our appreciation of your 
friendship by letting you name the best man in the Mormon Church to be 
an apostle," I would have hollered "Ivins" without batting an eye or 
taking a breath. 

Compliments of this kind are paid by honest, faithful men regarding 
the choice of individuals for positions of leadership in the Church. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE CALLED TO OFFICE 

I wish to bear witness here today that every man who is chosen 
to be one of the General Authorities, or to preside over a stake or a 
ward, or in the Improvement Associations, and every woman who is 
chosen to preside in the Primary Association, or in the Relief Society, 
and those chosen for the Sunday School work, we aim to get the 
very best that there is, and the offscourings of the earth can go on howling 
as long as they like and as loud as they will, it will not make any dif- 
ference. 

I again quote from Section 121 : 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, 
in any degree of unrighteousness, behold the heavens withdraw themselves ; 
the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the 
priesthood or the authority of that man. 

I bear witness to you here today, and to all the world, that there 
has never been any exercise of authority in this Church except by per- 
suasion and by long-suffering. 

Behold, ere he is aware, he is left to kick against the pricks, to per- 
secute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

I shall not read the balance of this wonderful revelation for the 
reason that I shall have the privilege of broadcasting to the world on 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



Sunday for the enormous (?) length of seven minutes, and it will take 
me just about that long to read the balance of this section and some 
others of truths that are contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH OBEDIENCE 

I am very thankful indeed for the revelation which says : 

There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations 
of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to 
that law upon which it is predicated. 

I can say that the blessings of the Lord have been poured out in 
rich abundance upon every man who has stood at the head of this 
Church, because they have all sought righteously for the inspiration of 
the Spirit of God to guide them in all they have undertaken to do. 

CHANGE IN SENTIMENT 

I rejoice in the wonderful change that has taken place since my 
first trip to New York. There was a feeling of animosity in the hearts 
of many people. Men would double up their fists and shake them at 
me saying if they had their way they would put the Mormons in this 
tabernacle and turn the guns of Fort Douglas upon them. 

I remember the spirit of animosity that existed in Phoenix, Arizona, 
the first time I was there, and I contrast it with my visit there just a 
few weeks ago, when I had the pleasure of being present at the or- 
ganization of the Phoenix Third Ward. There was not a member of 
the Church living in Phoenix, so far as I am aware, at the time of my 
first visit. At the time of my recent visit to that city we had two wards 
in Phoenix, and another was organized while I was there. I also had 
the pleasure of dedicating two meeting houses in the Maricopa Stake, 
and calling at the Temple and preaching for a few moments in that 
wonderful building, which cost us three-quarters of a million dollars. 
I also had the privilege of ordaining a couple of bishoprics while there. 

While in New York recently I had the privilege of inspecting a 
building that we have now leased for some years, a large twenty-story 
building with a chapel in it. It is a splendid place. As I contrast the 
miserable little building in which we rented some rooms, about twenty- 
foot frontage, the first time I was in New York, with the chapel in 
which we are now located in a magnificent building in that city, it makes 
my heart rejoice. 

I rejoice in the change that has come about in Washington — the 
beautiful structure that we have in that city now, in comparison with 
what we had the first time I was there. When Brother Reed Smoot 
first went to Washington I think he said that at the first meeting they 
held there, which was in his home, only five people were at the services. 
We now have in the capital of the nation one of the most flourishing 
branches in all the Church, and about 1,000 members. 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I call to mind that when I went to California for the first time I 
was assured by the few Latter-day Saints who were in Oakland and 
San Francisco that they believed the total membership of the Church in 
California would not quite reach a hundred. Today we have two stakes 
in Los Angeles, and we have decided to divide them, as there are too 
many members in each stake for one stake president to be able to take 
care of them. We have another stake of Zion in San Bernardino, one 
in San Francisco, one in Oakland, one in Sacramento, and another in 
Gridley, and, with the members of the California mission, I am con- 
vinced beyond a doubt that we have between forty and fifty thousand 
people in California belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

The first time I was in Rexburg, the total Church population north 
of the Oneida Stake, was only 1,300 people. Today, going north and 
west and up into Canada, I am sure we have a hundred thousand people 
in that territory who belong to the Church. 

RECORD IN SCOUTING 

I am very grateful indeed for the remarkable record that our young 
men have made in Boy Scouting. It fell to my lot to attend an annual 
gathering of the Boy Scouts in New York some time ago. In one of 
the meetings the president said: "We would like to hear from Mr. 
Grant, although it is time for lunch, for the reason that the Church 
over which he presides has made the most remarkable and splendid 
record in Scouting of any church or community, in proportion to its 
numbers, and I hope the people here will be willing to wait and listen 
to Mr. Grant for a half hour." 

I got up and said : "There is no need for me to say anything. Chart 
after chart has been exhibited here, showing our accomplishments. I 
would be almost ashamed to praise our boys as much as the speakers 
have done who have preceded me, and I therefore suggest that we go to 
lunch." 

I rejoiced in being present at the recent meeting of the executives of 
the Boy Scouts, and it was marvelous the fine compliments that were 
paid to our people and to the executives who are members of the Church 
who are being employed in the different sections, working for the Boy 
Scout movement, from New York to California. Our young men are 
making a splendid record ; we are becoming known, the young and old 
of this Church, as God-fearing men and women. 

When I was only a young man I rejoiced in the splendid tributes 
that were paid to us by the late Bishop Daniel Turtle. He went east 
and told the truth about us, that we were "a God-fearing, upright, con- 
scientious people, serving God." While he did not agree with us ; he 
admired our integrity, and said that truth and righteousness always 
prevailed amongst us. 

I am very thankful that the Book of Mormon has been printed in 
Braille, and that the blind will have the privilege of reading it. I am 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



convinced that that wonderful book, full of inspiration from Almighty 
God to the men who wrote it, will cause many a person to rejoice who 
has never been able to read the Book of Mormon heretofore. 

GENEALOGICAL AND TEMPLE WORK 

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with the Genealogical Society last 
night. I had understood that there was going to be a long KSL broad- 
cast connected with it, talking about dramatizing the 110th Section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, but that part of it lasted only a few 
minutes. The meeting was practically a short one, but I was very 
pleased with what I heard. I am delighted with the wonderful work 
that is being done in our temples in the accomplishments of our people 
in hunting up the records of their forefathers and performing the 
saving ordinances for them in the temples of God. 

I have never attended a temple dedication in my life but what 
there was a marvelous outpouring of the Spirit of God upon those who 
spoke there, and it has fallen to my lot to be at the dedication of the 
Logan temple, the Manti temple, the Canadian temple, the Hawaiian 
temple, and the Arizona temple, and the Lord was good to us on those 
occasions. They were the most outstanding and inspirational meetings 
that it has ever been my privilege to attend. 

.:• A SEMINARY IN WYOMING 

It fell to my lot only last Sunday to visit Wyoming. We have 
erected at Laramie, a very beautiful and fine structure as an institute, 
adjoining the University of Wyoming. Never before in my life have I 
been treated more kindly, and with more respect than upon that occasion. 
I rejoice in the compliment paid to us by the governor of the state, 
in that he traveled from Cheyenne, his headquarters, to Laramie, to be 
present, and he made a most complimentary speech with regard to our 
people. I never have heard any finer things said regarding professors 
in a school than the tributes paid by the president of the University 
of Wyoming to our young men who are teaching in the Wyoming 
University. He praised very highly the president of our branch at 
Laramie, Brother Albert G. Bowman. Brother Bowman has been there 
now, if I remember correctly, for twenty years, if not longer, and he 
and the other young men who are employed in that school have made 
a record for themselves and they are appreciated, and it was so declared. 
The president of the University said that not only were the young men, 
the professors who are teaching in the school, of the highest grade, but 
he paid compliments to all of our people who are attending the school. 

In the evening there was a reception in our institute building. 
It is very well adapted for the work that we expect to do there. Not- 
withstanding the inclemency of weather, the governor of the state and 
the president of the university, and other prominent people were present, 
and there was a spirit of fellowship and good-will existing there the 
equal of anything I have experienced in my life.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE WORTH OF SOULS 

I pray God to help me and you and every soul to live the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, to labor with all the zeal that we have. I am grateful, 
indeed, for this remarkable statement in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
in a revelation contained therein, in which Oliver Cowdery and David 
Whitmer were appointed to name the men who were to be members 
of the first quorum of the Twelve Apostles : 

And now Oliver Cowdery, I speak unto you, and also unto David 
Whitmer, by way of commandment ; for, behold, I command all men every- 
where to repent, and I speak unto you even as unto Paul, mine apostle, for 
you are called even with that same calling with which he was called. 

Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; 

For, behold, the Lord, your Redeemer, suffered death in the flesh ; 
wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and 
come unto him. 

And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men 
unto him, on conditions of repentance. 

And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall 
be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father ! 

And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have 
brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your 
joy if you should bring many souls unto me! 

Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation. 

A GOSPEL OF FORGIVENESS 

May God help each and every one of us to remember that the gospel 
of Jesus Christ is not only a gospel of conversion, but it is a gospel of 
forgiveness. We have it recorded that though a man's sins be as 
scarlet, if he will repent, they shall all be as white as snow. I rejoice 
in that remarkable revelation which says: 

I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is 
required to forgive all men. 

May the Lord help us one and all to grow in the light, and knowledge, 
and testimony, and love of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that our light 
may so shine that others seeing our good works may join the Church. 

TESTIMONY 

I desire upon this occasion, and upon all occasions, to bear witness 
in all solemnity and in all humility to the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and to the divine mission of each and every one of 
the men who have been chosen to succeed him, and above all I desire 
to say that I know that God lives, I know that Jesus is the Christ, the. 
Son of the living God, the Redeemer of the world. God help you 
and me and all to live the gospel is my humble prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of our Redeemer. Amen. ,. m 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

The Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "Redeemer of 
Israel," after which the Choir sang the anthem, "Grant us Peace" 
(Stephens). 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We owe a wonderful debt of gratitude to Brother Evan Stephens 
and we thank this choir — the Hyrum Stake Choir — for their beautiful 
rendition of some of his compositions. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I was born of goodly parents, across the street west from here, 
sixty-six years ago today, and am informed that there were two feet of 
snow on the level and drifted to the tops of the fences. Happy am I 
to be with you and to have you celebrate my birthday in General 
Conference. It affords me the opportunity to meet many dear friends 
and greet you under most favorable circumstances. 

MEMBERSHIP IN CHRIST'S CHURCH A PRIVILEGE 

During a very busy life it has been my joy to witness the constant 
development of the work of the Lord in this and in other lands. I 
am sure that the splendid report of the condition of the Church that 
we have listened to this morning and the address of our beloved President 
cause us to be grateful to the Lord that we have membership in the 
organization that He named for his beloved Son. To have fellowship 
in the Church of Jesus Christ that was organized under his direction 
for our earthly happiness and to prepare us for eternal life in the 
Celestial kingdom is indeed a glorious privilege 

THE BOOK OF MORMON IN BRAILLE 

Reference has been made this morning to the Book of Mormon 
that has been printed in Braille for the use of the blind. I regret that 
I did not bring a set here for you to see. It consists of seven volumes, 
each 12 inches long, 12 inches wide and 2-3 inches thick, nicely bound 
in green cloth and embossed in gold. A set will be presented to the 
larger libraries of the country making it available to most of the blind 
just as is the Holy Bible. It was printed by the American Printing 
House for the Blind, at Louisville, Kentucky, the same concern that 
prints Bibles for the American Bible Society. It was proof-read by a 
scholarly blind man, one of the two best Braille proof-readers in the 
United States, who was also employed to proof-read the Bible. 

ITS DISTRIBUTION AN IMPORTANT DUTY 

The Book of Mormon is a sacred record containing information 
that is found in no other book. The Lord has commanded us to divide 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with all his children the truths of the everlasting Gospel that have been 
revealed to prepare them for a place in the Celestial kingdom. Distrib- 
uting the Book of Mormon is a most important missionary duty. In the 
year 1827 Joseph Smith was living at Palmyra in New York and it was 
at the Hill Cumorah, not far from his home that an angel delivered 
into his custody a volume of plates having the appearance of gold. He 
was directed to translate their contents into English, which he did by 
the gift and power of God. It caused quite a commotion in the com- 
munity when it was reported that Joseph had received some golden 
records and had them in his possession. Attempts were made to take 
them from him. He and his father's family were harassed because 
of the report that they had something valuable in their possession. The 
Lord had informed Joseph before he was fifteen years of age that a 
great mission was to be given to him if he would live a righteous life. 
Later it became part of his duty to translate and publish to the world 
the Book of Mormon. When the people in the neighborhood learned 
that he was contracting with a local printer to publish the book they 
did everything possible to discourage it. They declared that the work 
was a fraud and determined to prevent its publication, and in order 
that the venture might be a financial failure they tried to make the distri- 
bution impossible by agreeing that they would not read the book 

A REMARKABLE PROPHECY 

Notwithstanding the threats that were made Joseph placed the 
manuscript containing this prophecy in the hands of the printer for 
publication (II Nephi, 30th chapter and 3rd verse) : 

And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews 
and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come 
forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the 
Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; 
and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed. 

And then shall the remnant .of our seed know concerning us, how that 
we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews. 

And the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them ; where- 
fore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also 
to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers. 

It is interesting to note that notwithstanding the animosity of the 
people and the threat not to purchase the book it did not deter the youthful 
prophet from publishing the prediction that had been made by Nephi, 
"There shall be many which shall believe the words which are written." 
Let us see if that promise of the Lord has been fulfilled. 

IN FULFILMENT OF THE LORD'S PROMISE 

The Book of Mormon was first published in English in 1830; in 
Danish in 1851; in Welsh in 1852; in German in 1852; in French in 
1852 ; in Italian in 1852 ; in Hawaiian in 1855 ; in the Deseret alphabet 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



15 



in 1869; in Swedish in 1878; in Spanish in 1886; in Maori in 1889; in 
Dutch in 1890; in Samoan in 1903; in Tahitian in 1904; in Turkish 
in 1906; in Japanese in 1909; Czecho-Slovakian in 1933 and in Braille 
in 1936. 

Now that the Book of Mormon has been published in Braille it is 
interesting to note that in 2nd Nephi, 27th Chapter and 29th verse the 
following occurs : "And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of 
the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out 
of darkness." 

While there are not many blind people in our own communities it 
is estimated that there are more than 125,000 in America. 

We were very grateful when the Presidency of the Church author- 
ized the Society for the Aid of the Sightless that has been operating a 
small Braille plant for many years, to arrange for the publication of an 
edition of the Book of Mormon in Braille. We knew that such action 
would enable those people who have been denied the sense of eyesight 
to exercise another sense that the Lord has magnified in them, "the 
power to read by touch," and they could read the important information 
recorded in the Book of Mormon. 

In addition to the 18 languages in which the Book of Mormon has 
already been printed it has also been translated and prepared for publi- 
cation in Hindustanee, in Greek, Hebrew, Bulgarian, Russian and 
Armenian. 

About eighty years after the Book of Mormon was published I 
went to Palmyra to purchase the old home of Joseph Smith where a 
part of the Book of Mormon was translated. I made an investigation 
and found that the people of that section had fulfilled their promise. I 
did not find one soul who had ever read the Book of Mormon. The only 
copy that I found among them was the printer's copy that had never 
been cut, and it was held as a curiosity by the banker there, Honorable 
Pliney T. Sexton, who was a very good friend of ours. 

AS A RESULT OF FAITH 

Think of the problem that presented itself to Joseph Smith. Money 
was being expended, borrowed money, in order that the book might be 
published. Martin Harris had mortgaged his farm to secure the neces- 
sary funds. It required faith of a high order to continue under such 
circumstances. The edition of five thousand was eventually delivered 
and paid for and the estimate now is that considerably more than a 
million copies have since been distributed among the nations of the 
earth. The demand for it increases as the days go by, and it fills my 
heart with joy to know that every man who will read it prayerfully, 
every man who will desire to know whether it be of God or not has the 
promise, not of Joseph Smith or any living human being, but the promise 
of our Heavenly Father that they shall know of a surety that it is of 
God. (Moroni 10:3-4-5) : 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, 
if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember 
how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the 
creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these 
things, and ponder it in your hearts. 

And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye 
would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things 
are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, 
having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. 

And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all 
things. 

A COMPANION VOLUME TO THE BIBLE 

It is surely pleasing to have this other volume of scripture 
prepared for the use of the blind to read as a companion to the Bible 
that for many years has been printed for them in Braille. These two 
books hand in hand teach us all where we came from, why we are here, 
where we may go, and they both contain the advice, the loving advice of 
our Heavenly Father intended to inspire us to do that which will enrich 
our lives here and prepare us for eternal happiness. 

OFFERING THE GOSPEL TO OTHERS 

It is a privilege to live in this day and age of the world. It is 
marvelous to be associated with the people who have, as you learned 
this morning, more than seventeen hundred missionaries in the world 
today, offering without money and without price the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ to those who need it but do not understand it. Our missionary 
effort at home is assuming large proportions, for many in the stakes 
of Zion are proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ. No other people 
in this world are making such an effort to share with the children of 
men the glorious truths of our Heavenly Father for the uplift of man- 
kind and for the preparation of those who desire to dwell upon this 
earth when it shall be the Celestial kingdom of our Lord. Grateful am 
I that after sixty-six years of experience in this world, after associating 
with men and women and teaching them the Gospel in this and many 
other lands, that my assurance of the divinity of this work is stronger 
today than ever before. 

BEARS TESTIMONY 

I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the Lord. And I know, as I know that I live, 
that the Church that bears the name of the Redeemer by his direction, 
is of divine origin, and that the authority to speak and act in the name 
of the Savior has been placed upon his children here and that we are 
made partakers of those blessings that are to prepare us for eternal 
life in the Celestial kingdom. Knowing that, and realizing the serious- 
ness of such a statement on this my birthday, I gratefully bear to you 
my testimony that I know that these things are true, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, it is a wonderful sight to see so many 
Latter-day Saints assembled in one body. It is impressive. I have 
rejoiced in the spirit of this meeting thus far. I think we have made 
an excellent start for a splendid conference. 

THE SAVIOR'S BIRTH AND MISSION FORETOLD 

The Savior has been referred to this morning. He was the great 
central figure in all the world of mankind, and prophets of ancient 
Israel predicted his birth in no unmistakable language. They looked 
forward to his day with keenest interest, knowing that he would be 
entrusted with the greatest mission that ever had been or ever would 
be given to mortal man. By the eye of faith, under the inspiration of 
the Almighty Father, they saw that he was destined to become the 
Savior of the world through the shedding of his precious blood. 

As ancient prophets anxiously looked forward to his day, so modern 
prophets look backward with equal interest to his day, and all, both 
prophets and saints, rejoice in contemplation of it. 

Some people in Christian communities, even ministers of the gospel, 
have denied the divinity of his birth, while on the other hand in several 
instances, writers have asserted that no such character as Jesus Christ, 
the Lord of the Holy Bible, ever existed. They could just as well have 
repudiated the entire Bible itself as to make such a ridiculous claim. 

WORDS OF SCRIPTURE SET TO MUSIC 

Brethren and sisters, permit me to read, by way of reminder, some 
of the scriptural passages mostly found in the book of Isaiah the prophet, 
relating to the Christ, which were set to music by George Frederick 
Handel and designated The Messiah, an oratorio. The words were 
undoubtedly inspired of the Lord, and we may well believe that the 
music was also given by inspiration. 

The oratorio is divided into five parts as follows: The Prophecy, 
the Fulfilment, the Passion, the Glorification, and the Resurrection. 

WORDS OF PROPHECY 

I will first read the words of prophecy concerning the Christ : 

Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God; speak ye com- 
fortably to Jerusalem ; and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished, 
that her iniquity is pardoned. 

The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way 
of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 

Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill made 
low, the crooked straight, and the rough places plain. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it 
together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. 

Thus saith the Lord of Hosts : Yet once a little while and I will 
shake the heavens, and the earth, the sea, and the dry land; and I will 
shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come. 

The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even 
the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; Behold, he shall 
come, saith the Lord of Hosts. 

But who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand when 
he appeareth? 

For he is like a refiner's fire. 

And he shall purify the sons of Levi, that they may offer unto the 
Lord an offering in righteousness. 

Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his 
name Emmanuel, God with us. 

For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the 
people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen 
upon thee, and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the 
brightness of thy rising. 

The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : and they 
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light 
shined. 

For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government 
shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful, 
Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 

THE FULFILMENT 

These were prophecies made in ancient times concerning the Savior, 
and now follows the fulfilment of these prophecies in brief : 

There were shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their 
flocks by night 

And lo ! the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of 
the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. 

And the angel said unto them, Fear not ; for, behold, I bring you good 
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which 
is Christ the Lord, 

And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly 
host praising God, and saying: 

Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will towards men. 

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: 
behold, thy king cometh unto thee. 

He is the righteous Savior, and he shall speak peace unto the heathen. 

Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf 
unstopped ; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the 
dumb shall sing. 

He shall feed his flock like a shepherd ; and he shall gather the lambs 
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that 
are with young. 

Come unto him, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and he shall 
give you rest. 

Take his yoke upon you, and learn of him; for he is meek and lowly 
of heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 

THE PASSION 

And now comes the Passion. Think of the solemnity of it. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 19 

He was despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows, and 
acquainted with grief. 

Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows ; he was 
wounded for our transgressions ; he was bruised for our iniquities ; the 
chastisement of our peace was upon him. 

****** 

Thy rebuke hath broken his heart ; he is full of heaviness. He looked 
for some to have pity on him, but there was no man; neither found he 
any to comfort him. 

Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto his sorrow. 

THE GLORIFICATION 

And now the Glorification : 

Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up ye everlasting 

doors ; and the King of glory shall come in. 

****** 

Why do the nations so furiously rage together? and why do the 
people imagine a vain thing? 

The kings of the earth rise up, and the rulers take counsel together 

against the Lord, and against his anointed. 

****** 

Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. 
The kingdom of this world is become the kingdom of our Lord, 
and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever. 

KING OP KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS, HALLELUJAH ! 

THE RESURRECTION 

And now finally the Resurrection: 

I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the 
latter day upon the earth : 

And though worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. 

For now is Christ risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them 
that sleep. 

Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by 
his blood, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and 
honor, and glory, and blessing. 

Blessing and honor, glory and power, be unto him that sitteth upon 
the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever. 

While these references from Holy Writ cover, broadly speaking, 
the life of Jesus Christ, there are many other scriptures that throw 
much light upon the great and enduring work he accomplished. 

OUR OBLIGATION TO THE REDEEMER 

In conclusion let me say that we should never forget the words of 
John, the beloved disciple, as recorded in chapter 3, verse 16, in St. 
John's gospel : 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting 
life. 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This passage of scripture emphasizes the tremendous obligation 
the children of men are under to the Redeemer who suffered for them a 
cruel and ignominious death. 

I testify to you for myself, in all solemnity, that I do know that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and was crucified upon 
Mt. Calvary for the sins of the world, and that Joseph Smith was a 
true prophet of God. 

I rejoice with all my heart and soul in this testimony, which I 
hope to have and to retain all the days of my life. 

I pray God's blessings upon you brethren and sisters, and upon 
the Presidency of the Church and all the General Authorities, and all 
the local authorities of the Church in the stakes of Zion, and the people 
of God generally. May his blessings and power and goodness be upon 
you I pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice, my brothers and sisters, in the splendid spirit that has been 
evidenced in this first meeting of this conference ; and am happy with the 
splendid report that has been presented of Church progress in 1935. It 
is stimulating to know of the very favorable conditions that prevail 
throughout the Church, and toward the Church by our fellowmen in 
this nation and in other places throughout the world. I realize that, 
after all, the progress that we make as a people depends in large measure 
upon our actions. I was interested in the expression of the President 
that "Zion is growing" and is spreading abroad. 

WHAT AND WHERE IS ZION 

What is Zion and where is Zion ? I would like to read to you a few 
things that President Brigham Young stated about that very thing. He 
said, "Where is Zion ? Where the organization of the church of God is. 
And may it dwell spiritually in every heart. And may we so live as to 
enjoy the spirit of Zion always." Further he said, "When we conclude to 
make a Zion we will make it ; and this work commences in the heart of 
each person." Again, "This is the land of Zion. West of us is a body of 
water that we call the Pacific, and to the east there is another large body 
of water which we call the Atlantic, and to the north is where they have 
tried to discover a northwest passage. These waters surround the land of 
Zion." Again, "What is Zion? In one sense Zion is the pure in heart. 
But there is a land that will ever be called Zion. It is North and South 
America." Finally, he states "Zion will extend eventually all over the 
earth. There will be no nook or corner upon the earth but what will be 
Zion. It will all be Zion." 

ZION WHERE VIRTUE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS PREVAIL 

Now, as I read these statements I conclude that Zion is a place where 
virtue and righteousness are practised, and where the love of the Lord 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



21 



prevails. Wherever the Latter-day Saints settle and practise the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel — unity, faith, righteousness, and diligence both in 
spiritual and in temporal affairs, — there is Zion ; where the organizations 
of the Church are established, and where the members of the Church take 
part therein. So that Zion, as has been expressed this morning, is grow- 
ing and spreading abroad throughout this nation and throughout other 
nations. It is our privilege and responsibility as Latter-day Saints, as 
parents, and as leaders in the stakes and wards and missions to encourage 
every member of the Church, whether young or old, to endeavor to live in 
such a way as to partake of the spirit of Zion, which is the spirit of the 
Gospel ; to give of our service to the advancing of the interests of the 
Church ; to qualify as men and women who are able to do things m a 
temporal way for the progress of the communities in which we live ; to 
take advantage of the opportunities that may be afforded us to grow 
temporally as well as spiritually and exercise a powerful influence for 
good among all of our f ellowmen. 

OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 

I am interested, as I am sure all of us are mutually, in the welfare 
of all members of the Church, both young and old. I realize that, under 
the conditions which have prevailed during the last four or five years, 
opportunities for the welfare and progress of our young people par- 
ticularly have been limited. Our young people are seeking oppor- 
tunities to work and to get forward in the field of life. Everything that 
can be done by all of us toward obtaining placements for our young 
people, and our older members also, should be done. Those who are able 
to furnish employment should strive to secure those who are upright, 
trustworthy, dependable and diligent. There is some improvement mani- 
fest in economic conditions at the present time, and it appears that there 
are greater opportunities coming for all young people who are out of em- 
ployment. But, if they will seek to qualify for life in the largest measure, 
it appears to me that there are going to be splendid opportunities for our 
young people to live their lives, to grow in capacity, and faith, and to give, 
not only of their service for their personal welfare and progress in a 
financial way, but also for the advancement of the work of the Lord. 

CARE IN PLANNING FUTURE 

They must realize that the land of Zion comprises this entire west- 
ern hemisphere ; and that the spirit of Zion, cherished in the heart of any 
Latter-day Saint, will help him, wherever opportunity may offer for 
bettering his economic condition, to carry on with the greatest peace and 
satisfaction. It is, of course, ordinarily a natural desire to reside in the 
community in which one is raised. It requires courage to go elsewhere 
to become established. Wisdom and foresight and careful investigation 
are needed in all such cases. They must be careful to resist the attitude 
of looking for "greener pastures" farther away, when actually there are 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



good opportunities at home. When desirable opportunities do offer, and 
when the proposed location affords established Church organization, their 
determination should be to affiliate with the Church organization ; and 
take active part in such service along with their employment. Such 
activity will enable them to resist all influences that are harmful to their 
real progress in life, and to become "builders of Zion." 

Now, it seems to me that in order to be prepared to take advantage 
of larger opportunities, both temporal and spiritual, our young people 
should carefully develop certain specific objectives: 

First, to widen their material horizons to include all localities where 
the organizations of the Church are established. To realize that in all 
this broad land, where the Church is functioning and where opportun- 
ities are offered them of suitable means of livelihood, there is no good 
reason why they should not establish themselves. To broaden their 
spiritual horizons so that they gain a genuine testimony of the Gospel, 
and, at the same time, respect the beliefs of others who have different 
creeds, or no creeds. Even if their occupations should take them to 
localities not provided with church facilities, they should take the spirit 
of Zion with them, and, as President Young states, "make a Zion." 

COOPERATION IN COMMUNITY WELFARE 

In connection with this matter, I think that there are opportunities 
in the communities of this state and other states of this intermountain 
country for economic improvement. It is evident that, particularly in 
this state, one of the requisites for growth in various settlements, is the 
conserving of all possible flood and waste waters. Another is the culti- 
vation of the spirit of true cooperation in the development of local enter- 
prises that will yield the maximum of financial returns and of employ- 
ment to the local people. This matter deserves the careful consideration 
and initiative of the leaders in all our communities. Such undertakings 
will help to provide further opportunities for the young people. 

PROPER HOME TRAINING AND CHURCH ACTIVITY 

The second objective that I think our young people should gain is 
proper home training, thorough Church teaching and spiritual activity. 
This is a challenge to all parents and Church officers. Thereby they will 
become established in the faith of the Gospel, and bring forth the works 
thereof, by living clean lives, by practising all the splendid virtues, such 
as straightforwardness, reliability, industry, initiative and kindliness, and 
by exemplary service in the Church wherever they may be. Such ex- 
amples prove to be a very powerful means of missionary work. 

LEARNING A TRADE OR PROFESSION 

The third objective for which, I think, every boy and girl should 
strive is to be sure to get a good secular education which will give them 
a proper foundation upon which to grow in knowledge and understand- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

ing. And that education should be coupled with sound religious train- 
ing that will give proper balance to their thoughts and actions, and 
develop a high standard of character and morals. Likewise, they should 
be able to apply that knowledge in a practical way in the affairs of life. 
Every one should learn how to do at least one thing well — that is to 
specialize in a trade, in agriculture, business or a profession. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF CHURCH OFFICERS 

I think also in a larger measure we as general officers of the Church, 
stake, ward, branch and mission officers, and members of the priesthood, 
should consider and inquire after the welfare of all the young people 
who are in our midst, and make systematic effort to encourage them to 
take part in the Church activities, as well as to aid them, where necessary, 
to secure employment for which they are particularly fitted. There is so 
much work that needs to be done for the advancement of the Church 
in every locality that every one who is willing can properly be assigned 
to do that which will be for his spiritual progress and the welfare of 
others ; and at the same time whereby he will not need to neglect either 
his secular affairs nor his family. Thus he will thereby develop that 
proper balance which promotes stability and peace and happiness. 

UNITY AND ACTIVITY BRING PROGRESS 

Now, wherever the Latter-day Saints may live, whether they be in 
the heart of what we call Zion, where the organization of the Church 
is most complete, or whether it be in other localities, where there are few 
in number, it appears to me that through the unity and helpfulness which 
the Gospel teaches, they can help one another to live better lives by ex- 
ample and by kindly influence, and thereby promote greater spiritual 
strength among all members, as well as to interest those who are not 
members of the Church. 

Another important factor in the welfare and safety of our young 
people everywhere who take part in Church affairs is that they are thereby 
safeguarded from evils, temptations and dangers to which many others 
succumb. Attendance at church services and giving service in church 
organizations brings one in contact with ward officers who are interested 
in the welfare of members. Thereby, young men and women can obtain 
wise counsel and be protected from despondency and rash actions. 

UPRIGHT LIVING PRODUCES CONFIDENCE 

Experience proves that the standards by which true Latter-day 
Saints live are powerful means in enabling them to secure positions of 
trust. Right living, high principles, faith and good works, loyalty, in- 
dustry and integrity, coupled with particular aptitude in any direction, are 
all greatly in demand in the world of affairs. I have recently had oc- 
casion to learn of many instances of young people who are recognized 
where they are employed,, because of their religion. And, because of 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



their habits and qualifications, which follow observance of principle, are 
valued as employees in the particular lines for which they are qualified. 
Intelligent employers today, who are engaged in all the various business 
affairs, desire and demand employes of good habits, alert minds, trust- 
worthiness, willingness, persistence, and energy. There are many in- 
stances where young people have been employed simply because they are 
known as Latter-day Saints. What a wonderful tribute that is to the 
faith which we have espoused ! How important it is that every one of us 
should measure up to these standards, and likewise encourage every other 
member of the Church to establish in his or her life those principles which 
will make them worthy of confidence everywhere. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the Gospel in which we are 
engaged. I realize that it is a means of growth in every way for every 
one of us; and that if we will live for it we shall be blessed in every 
respect. If we are active and diligent in the promotion of faith and 
righteousness we ourselves shall gain the benefit. I rejoice in the fact 
that this Gospel is divinely restored to us in these days ; that through it 
we can gain so many opportunities and blessings. 

May the Lord help us, every one, to be appreciative of these things 
and to live for them. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "Unfold, ye Portals," (Gounod), was sung by the 
Choir. 

Elder Franklin L. West, Commissioner of Education for the 
Church, offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

FIRST DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 o'clock p. m. 

The music for this session was furnished by the Hyrum Stake 
Choir, under the direction of W. H. Terry. 

The opening selection, a hymn, "Now Let Us Rejoice in the Day 
of -Salvation," was sung by the Choir and the congregation. 

Elder Fred G. Taylor, President of the New York Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

An anthem, "Invocation," (Moore), was sung by the Choir. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I crave at this time a portion of the Spirit 
of the Lord, that what I may say may be along the same lines, and that 
the same spirit may be manifest as in the first session of this conference.

TEACHINGS OF THE MASTER NECESSARY 

I have been worried somewhat over the conditions existing in the 
world today, and particularly our own country. I am quite sure that the 
same feeling is in the hearts of many of the leading men of this country, 
and I do not want the people here to think that what I say or even 
intimate is directed by any other thought than with a hope that condi- 
tions will right themselves, not only in our own country, but in the 
world at large. As I think of them I pray to my Heavenly Father every 
day of my life that the teachings of the Master may enter the hearts of 
the people of the world, and that through the spirit of the Master 
they can conceive and understand the direction in which the world is 
going, and that the nations of the world may call a halt and return to first 
principles. May they realize that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
make as a basis of the thought and actions of the nations of the world 
the words that the Master gave to the world while here upon the earth. 

THE CRIME OF INDIFFERENCE 

In this connection I want to call attention to just a short statement 
in a speech that was made by Chauncey M. Depew, and this is what he 
said upon the occasion I refer to : 

One of the great crimes which shorten life is indifference. As one loses 
interest in his church, in his political party, in his club, in his friends, in his 
acquaintances, he dries up, and the grave claims one whom no one wants 
to eliminate. The two most fatal phrases and the most common are : "What 
is the use?" and "Why should I?" And when we or anyone else, be it an 
individual, a state, a country, comes to that position, we are in danger. 

FAITH LACKING 

And yet sometimes I think how can it be otherwise, for you go into 
every country now, including our own and you find great lack of faith 
in the true and living God ; in fact a majority, I was going to say a great 
majority, of the people of our country have ceased offering supplications 
to our Heavenly Father. Very few attend services, and I was going to 
say the half that do go do so not particularly because they believe in the 
church, but because of their wife or associates. 

ILLITERACY IN AMERICA 

I picked up the American Scrap Book the other night, and I turned 
to page 107, and this is what I read — this in America : 

Dwelling within four hundred miles of our national capital are up- 
wards of four million men, women, and children, of pre-Revolutionary 
American stock, the great majority of whom cannot name the President 
of the United States, and never heard of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow 
Wilson, Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, General Pershing, or Charlie 
Chaplin, even. Nineteen in every one hundred Cumberland mountaineers 
are illiterate, equally ignorant of the railroad and the automobile. 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is what an observer says about them after making an exten- 
sive trip through the mountainous section of the country, and, my 
brethren and sisters, I do not know that it is exaggerated, but I do know 
that it is of sufficient worth for the American people to take some notice 
of it. 

THE FREE AGENCY OF MAN 

I received yesterday morning the Millennial Star of March 19th, and 
in it under the title of "Britain's Task" I read the following: 

But if God lives and we are his children why does he permit war? 
This question is frequently asked. Its answer is that God has given man 
his free agency; hence he may do as he likes — choose to serve God and 
follow his plan or permit himself to become subject to the power of evil 
that is, Satan, a spiritual being engaged in the work of leading men to their 
destruction. He it is who is the champion of war and all other agencies 
that bring hate, misery and suffering to men. But with God's help man, 
if he wills, may overcome Satan. Hence the problems of war and peace 
are made by man himself and must be solved by him with God's help or 
Satan's, depending on the influence he chooses to govern him. 

That is true. And when I look over this vast audience I cannot help 
but feel that there is a power with the people that are gathered in this 
holy house at this time which if it were manifested in our daily lives, not 
in any dictatorial manner, but in the spirit of the Master, conditions in 
this State would be better, and it would preach the Gospel as no words 
perhaps could. 

AMERICA, THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY 

I remember upon one occasion an address that was given by Presi- 
dent Herbert Hoover, and I think perhaps a number of you heard it. 
Upon that occasion he said this: 

My country owes me nothing. It gave me, as it gives every boy and 
girl, a chance. It gave me schooling, independence of action, opportunity 
for service, and honor. In no other land could a boy from a country 
village, without inheritance or influential friends, look forward with 
unbounded hope. My whole life has taught me what America means. 
I am indebted to my country beyond my human power to repay. It con- 
ferred upon me the mission to administer America's response to the appeal 
of afflicted nations during the war. It has called me into the cabinets 
of two Presidents. By these experiences I have observed the burdens 
and responsibilities of the greatest office in the world. That office 
touches the happiness of every home. It deals with the peace of nations. 
No man could think of it except in terms of solemn consecration. 

LOYALTY TO NATION AND CHURCH 

My brethren and sisters, that is true as to our country, and I do not 
believe that there is a people on the earth that is more loyal to her laws 
than the Mormons. We believe that the Constitution of the United 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



27 



States was an inspired instrument of God. We have so declared, and 
though persecution came we never thought for a moment of laying it to 
the fundamental laws, the principles contained in that great instrument. 

I do hope and pray that we shall always be loyal and true to our 
country, devoted and sincere to our Church and to our God. I testify 
to you, my brethren and sisters this day that I know that this is God's 
work. I know that the Presidency of the Church are men whom God 
through his wisdom has selected, if I may say it, as leaders of his Church 
at this time. I support them with all my heart. Knowing the Gospel to 
be true, as I do, the balance of my life, be it short or long, I want to devote 
to the advancement of God's church, and I think that men holding the 
priesthood, and the young men and the young women of the Church, 
are now showing to the world an example of loyalty to God's laws, and 
they are just as loyal to this nation of ours. 

May God's blessings be with us, direct us in what we say, and protect 
us wherever we go, and may we never forget him as the giver of life 
and all that is worth while in this world, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My brethren and sisters, I stand before you this afternoon with a 
good deal of trepidation and nervousness, and I trust that while I am here 
I may have your faith and prayers, that the time we are together may be 
spent to our mutual advantage. 

We are here as a representative body of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. We have come from all parts of the Church to 
listen to the instructions that fall from the lips of the presiding authorities 
of the Church in the hope that we may gain therefrom courage to carry 
us on and faith to buoy us up and strengthen us in the trials we have to 
face. We have desired comfort in the past, and we have always realized 
that hope and that faith ; and I pray that we may be so blessed and bene- 
fitted today, that when the conference shall have passed it may, like its 
predecessors, be said to be the best ever. 

We have a faith in God our Father and in Jesus Christ his Son 
That faith to me is very fundamental. If I could not have it I would feel 
at a loss as to what to do and how to work. With that faith there is an 
anchor, a stone firmly set that seems to support and sustain me in all the 
things I have to encounter. God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son 
are to me realities. I believe that they are, as we teach them to be, real 
personages, personages who have interest in us and in our welfare. That 
faith carries me on through all the trials I have to undergo. 

They have given us a system that has many wonderful features in 
it, and not the least perhaps of the wonderful principles that we call the 
Gospel is our belief in a future life and in the power that is vested in us 
to carry on through that future life with greater accomplishments, with 
greater attainments than we have been able to accomplish here. We 
believe that in the future life the organization and the association and 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the attachments that we form here will carry on. Were it not for that 
there would be many, many very sad occasions, but because of that faith 
these sad and trying conditions become the stepping stones to greater 
hopes. Whenever I see winter come I am glad because I know there 
will be a spring. Whenever I lie down at night I am glad of the oppor- 
tunity because I know there will be sunshine on the morrow. There is 
a faith and hope in every winter and in every night. There is a hope 
in every spring, because in that spring there is a planting, and we hope 
for a harvest in the fall. Likewise we hope and believe that the transition 
from this life to another is but a step in the greater progress, the eternal 
progress through all the ages that are to come. We believe that we were 
individual identities before we came here, that we go through this sphere 
as an educational process, and that we shall go on to another greater, 
more magnificent and more wonderful sphere, and that through all the 
eternities to come there will be no limit in the progress that our spirits 
may attain to. 

To me that is the most wonderful thing about the Gospel, it is one of 
the most fundamental things, and it becomes a possibility only when I 
place my faith in God the Father and Jesus Christ as his Son, as the 
personages that Joseph Smith taught us they are — real, virile, active per- 
sonalities who have a concern in our welfare and in the welfare of this 
world. I believe that they overrule the destinies of this world for the 
good and advancement of those who are placed in it. "The glory of God 
is intelligence," and because of that and the faith that we have in a future 
of progress, we lay the foundations here for great and grand educational 
institutions which help us to acquire an understanding of our condition. 
Intelligence to me is not merely the cramming of my mind full of learning 
that I get from books. Schools are not the only media of acquiring 
knowledge, intelligence does not, perhaps, necessarily come from scholas- 
tic education. To me intelligence is the power to meet conditions and 
circumstances and overrule them for our mutual benefit and blessing. 
Many men have lived and died who never had the advantages of our 
schools and colleges, but who most certainly were among our most intel- 
ligent and useful men. 

I believe that those intelligences and those spirits, as well as yours 
and mine, shall carry on through all future time, with greater realization 
and greater accomplishments. That faith is what carries me on. That 
faith is what enables me to face the changing circumstances of life with 
a hope and a faith that the ultimate will be beneficial to us. I believe that 
God so loves us that he will overrule the world's activities for our good. 
When I say our good I do not limit that to those of us who are gathered 
here, I do not limit it to those who have joined the Church, but I include 
all our race, even those who are very much opposed to us in our present 
circumstances and in our belief. 

I pray that God may bless us all, that he will overrule the destinies 
of this nation, and that he will overrule the destinies of other nations of 
the earth, so that out of the chaos that seems apparent now good will 
come. We do not know what those changes may mean. They certainly 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IV INS 



29 



are significant and have a meaning, and out of those changes will come 
advancement perhaps just such as we hope to obtain' individually through 
our experience here. The change will benefit and bless us even though 
the transitional period may be very trying. 

I do not feel like talking long this afternoon, but I wish to say this 
much, that this faith is what carries me on. If it does not just agree with 
your faith I trust that yours will be of as much service to you as mine 
is to me. But I believe that all of you who are here believe very much 
as I do, that we are here through the design of a loving, kind, and all- 
wise Father, that he has planned this whole thing out, and that it will 
work very much according to his plan and to our ultimate good and 
blessing. 

I pray that we may carry on in faith, in sincerity of purpose, and do 
our portion, each and all of us, to roll this work on, that it may eventually 
fill the measure for which it was established in the earth in this the last 
dispensation ; that the purposes that God had, when he visited the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and gave to him again the priesthood and the right to or- 
ganize the Church, may not be hindered in any way by anything that any 
of us may do, but on the contrary, every act that we perform may be a 
beneficial one, and that we may push this work along so that ultimately 
we may realize our hopes and aspirations. God bless you all. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I humbly pray that I may be aided by that good spirit which comes 
from on high. With you, my brethren and sisters, I believe that we are 
blessed with a religion that establishes our relationship to our Heavenly 
Father. 

A JUDGMENT TO COME 

Many thoughtful people believe that the appalling increase in crime 
is due, in part at least, to the fact that men are forgetting that they will 
be required to stand before the throne of God and give an account for 
the deeds done in the body. Young men rejoice in their youth but 
they should never forget that God will bring them into judgment for 
all the things they do that are contrary to his commandments. Old age 
does not make up for the deficiencies that are allowed to grow in the 
life of the youth. 

More thinking of the next world produces a restraining effect upon 
men whose inclinations urge them to sin. We should never cease to 
teach of a judgment to come, persuading men to work with a daily 
unceasing hope and an ambition to make their lives better. What a 
miserable state a man is in when the latter end of his days are the worst 
of his life. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ASSISTING IN BRINGING PEOPLE TO GOD 

Jesus said, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me." 
Through virtue of this lifting up, through virtue of the sacrifice the 
Lord Jesus made for sin and through the atonement he made to win our 
redemption, this matchless Teacher, by his word and spirit, draws us 
unto God. It should be our aim to bring not only ourselves but other 
people nearer to the Lord; each man has a part to play in these dark 
days of trouble and woe. 

The poet said: 

God give us men; the time demands 

Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and willing hands. 

Men whom the lust of office does not kill, 

Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; 

Men who possess opinions and a will ; 

Men who can stand before a demagogue 

And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking. 

Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog 

In public duty and in private thinking; 

For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds, 

Their large professions and their little deeds 

Mingle in selfish strife, Lo! Freedom weeps, 

Wrong rules the land and waiting Justice sleeps. 

Men with these qualities will cure the evils of the world — men, strong 
men. 

THE PRESENT A PART OF ETERNITY 

We love the Gospel because it teaches a continuing personality in 
the next life. We must not live for this life alone. And yet our present 
state is a part of eternity. 

John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States, when 
he was eighty years of age met a friend on a Boston street. "Good 
morning," said the friend, "and how is John Quincy Adams today?" 
"Thank you," was the ex-president's reply, "John Quincy Adams him- 
self is well, quite well, I thank you. But the house in which he lives 
at present is becoming dilapidated. It is tottering upon its foundation. 
Time and the seasons have nearly destroyed it. Its roof is pretty well 
worn out. Its walls are much shattered and it trembles with every 
wind. The old tenement is becoming almost uninhabitable and I think 
John Quincy Adams will have to move out of it soon; but he himself 
is quite well, quite well." 

The immortal spirit of man lives, as a continuing personality, for- 
ever and forever. This is the hope implanted in our hearts by the 
Gospel ; it is the destiny of mankind. God is the father of our spirits. 

CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT 

The thought of continual improvement is expressed in the following 
lines : 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



31 



Build thee more stately mansions, oh my soul, 

As the swift seasons roll 

Leave thy low-vaulted past. 

Let each new temple nobler than the last 

Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, 

Till thou at length art free, 

Leaving thine outgrown shell 

By life's unresting sea. 

It should be the ideal of Latter-day Saints to be at the close of 
each day one step nearer heaven. They should have in mind the building 
of more stately mansions, mansions of character, of patriotism, of thrift, 
of morality. We do not liye for ourselves. Every man can wield a 
tremendous influence for good, more than he thinks. 

Benjamin Franklin wrote his own epitaph. This is it : 

Like the cover of an old book, its contents torn out and stripped 
of its lettering and gilding, lies here food for worms. But the work shall 
not be lost, for it will, as he believes, appear once more in a new and 
more elegant edition, revised and corrected by the author. 

THE RESURRECTION OF THE JUST 

We believe in the glorious resurrection of the just. The Apostle 
Paul declares this heavenly truth : 

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also- 
which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 

For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which 
are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent 
them which are asleep. 

For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with 
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God : and the dead 
in Christ shall rise first: 

Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together 
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we 
ever be with the Lord. 

'Wherefore comfort one another with these words. (I Thess. 4:14-18.) 

This is an ideal, this is a stately mansion which we can visualize 
because we know the hope and the comfort the Gospel brings to our 
souls that our lives are going to continue in that eternal world where 
every power shall find sweet employ. A glorious resurrection, my 
brethren and sisters, is the chief gift among the unsearchable riches 
of Jesus Christ. 

God help us all to attain that, I humbly pray in the name of the 
Savior. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

• In the prayer that was offered this afternoon, mention was made 
of the temptations that come to us through the amusements and the 
entertainments that enter into the lives of men and women and cause 
them to disregard the commandments of the Lord. Those words brought 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to my mind this thought about the Sabbath day. This day which has 
been given to us as a day of worship, a day when we shall enter into 
the house of the Lord and there offer up our prayers and our sacraments, 
is at the present time more loosely regarded by members of the Church 
than at any other time in our history. I know that we can not go into 
very definite detail about some of the minor things and say, this is right 
and this is wrong on the Sabbath day. As soon as we get very technical 
we immediately become mixed up and we arrive at general conclusions 
that are in opposition to each other and to the word of the Lord. 

However, there should be some standard fixed by revelation and 
so encouraged by those in leadership that there would be no debate or 
argument as to whether certain things are right or whether they are 
wrong. In the days of Moses, when the law was given in the Ten Com- 
mandments, the Lord said we should "remember the Sabbath 1 day to 
keep it holy." Because some of the people did not regard the Sabbath 
day just as they should have done the Lord caused certain retributions 
to come upon them and they were severely punished. In our day many 
people feel that the punishment was too severe. Those who do not 
believe in the Lord will bring this severity up as an argument against 
our scripture and against God. 

In the days of the Puritans their law regarding the Sabbath was 
severe and very few things could be done on that day. If one whistled 
or 'one played music or any similar thing, there was some penalty at- 
tached. The very strictness of the laws governing the Sabbath in the 
past is now being used as an argument in favor of making the present 
observance so open and so loose that we can do almost anything. There- 
fore, on our Sabbath day we have practically everything being done. 
If a man or a girl is an athlete and they are in any way capable of reaching 
the higher levels in competition, it almost necessitates playing at least 
the finals upon the Sabbath day. If they are not willing to do this, they 
are just naturally eliminated from participation in things that are usually 
desired by young people. 

In our Church, in a way we have encouraged certain things on the 
Sabbath. Perhaps at times we have overdone our Fathers' and Sons' 
Outing on this day. 

Picture shows occur on the Sabbath day. Whether we should say 
we should or shouldn't attend is quite a debatable question among many 
people. The general argument is that if we go to our places of worship 
on the Sabbath day we are justified in going to picture shows or places 
of athletic amusements the rest of the day. 

When we get to looking at it from every angle we find we are 
losing out by using such arguments. The attitude that if we do a few 
things that are right on the Sabbath day it makes the others all right 
only confuses the question and hurts us. Such an attitude places no 
restriction on what we as a people shall do on the Sabbath provided 
we have been to meeting. 

Now, just this thought. Though we can not tell about all the details, 
there are enough landmarks, large landmarks, that we could at least hew 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



33 



to and hold to, and if we would do that, it would enable us to pass over 
some of the minor things that are now affecting us in our lives. It 
isn't a matter of conscience entirely as to what we shall do on the 
Sabbath day. It may be to the individual. He or she decides what they 
shall do. But the things that individuals do collectively does not neces- 
sarily reflect the conscience of the Church or its attitude in regard to right 
or wrong. 

We are given a revelation in the 59th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. There the Lord speaks of various commandments and 
then he reiterates that one commandment about worshipping the Lord 
on the Sabbath day and going to his house to partake of the sacrament 
and to offer up our prayers. 

To me it seems that attending the sacrament meeting is one thing 
that the Latter-day Saints should do if they shall in any way feel that 
they are worshipping God Almighty on the Sabbath day and are re- 
membering the day to keep it holy. This thing we can do, and there is 
no argument, there is no reason, there is no way of getting away 
from this commandment. In order to do one thing in the worship of 
God "with a broken heart and a contrite spirit" we ought to attend 
our sacrament meeting. 

In conclusion may I mention just this one thing. I hope I am 
understood in it. There are certain people who use some of the fine 
things we have in the Church for eliminating other things that we have 
in the Church. For example, we have wonderful Sunday Schools, — 
something we couldn't do without, the backbone of religious training 
and worship for our young people. But because of the sacrament being 
administered in our Sunday Schools there is a sentiment among our 
people that if they go to Sunday School that takes care of the sacrament 
and they feel no obligation to attend the sacrament meeting, which is 
presided over by the priesthood of the Lord and which the Lord has 
specified as one of the meetings his saints should attend. 

In the abundance of our auxiliary meetings on the Sabbath day, 
one after another, even in the cause of righteousness, we become tired 
and weary with the day's labor and at the end of the day we fail to 
worship the Lord in the meeting that he has specified as one way of 
honoring the Sabbath day and keeping it holy. 

May the Lord bless us and guide us and help us to live finer and 
better lives and to understand more clearly what we should do to worship 
him in spirit and in truth, I pray, in Jesus' name. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "O Say, What is 
Truth?" after which the Choir sang an anthem, "The King of Glory," 
(Parks). 

ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 

President of the Western States Mission 

I should like to express a word of appreciation to this marvelous 
musical organization. The rendition of the various numbers has 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



been beautiful. I extend my compliments to the director, organist, 
and members ; and likewise to those who have prepared the various 
numbers. 

The sight of this vast audience is indeed an inspiration, some- 
thing which we do not experience in the mission field. I bring you 
greetings from the Western States mission, a very delightful place. 
For the benefit of those who know not the territory of which it is 
composed, may I say that it includes the states of Colorado, New 
Mexico, Nebraska, the major part of Wyoming, the Black Hills of 
South Dakota, and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Unlike some of the other 
eastern missions, we have but three million people in our territory, 
but in area it covers a vast field. A tour of the mission, which 
contemplates visiting each of the various branches and districts, 
would represent approximately ten thousand miles of travel. We 
have eighty-three missionaries at the present time, and I am happy 
to bring word that they are all well, and each and every one doing 
his full duty. We feel very proud at the reception that is extended 
us by the people living in those various states. Very little prejudice 
is found, but the glad hand is extended and we feel greatly comforted 
at the progress that is being made. 

May I say that we are keeping in close touch with the labors and 
activities of our missionaries, and rejoice in the splendid record of 
last year, showing an average daily service in the ministry, of twelve 
and one-half hours every day for every one of our missionaries. Our 
baptisms for last year were very encouraging. In fact, from what I 
have learned, we had the largest number of baptisms ever recorded 
in any one year since that mission was organized. Our tithes show 
a substantial increase. The faith and devotion of the people are 
marvelous and beautiful. We have eleven full-term missionaries 
out in the mission field. There are several others who are getting 
ready, and we feel comforted in the fact that the parents in our mis- 
sion are able to provide this education for their boys and girls. We 
have had many unusual faith-promoting incidents. The sick, nigh 
unto death in many cases, have been marvelously healed. We have 
seen the casting out of devils on more than one occasion. The power 
of God has attended the ministry of the elders, who are doing their 
part to promote the glorious doctrines of Jesus Christ. As I think of 
this Church and its ideals and its accomplishments, it is nothing short 
of marvelous. To me, the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are one and the same, insep- 
arable, indivisible, working hand in hand together. The people of 
the world today, many of them, are crying out aloud as they did on 
the day of Pentecost, "Men and brethren, what shall we do to be 
saved ?" 

The Gospel affords a happy retreat. It is the place where men 
and women can be comforted and their souls can be built up, where 
they can receive the manifestations of God Almighty. I thank my 
Father in heaven for this knowledge, limited though it may be,

of the great truths as found in this Church. I know that God lives, 
and I know that Je'sus is the Christ. I know that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet, and may I say, I know that Heber J. Grant likewise is a 
prophet. 

There has never been a moment of time since this Church was 
organized, on April the 6th, 1830, that the power and the authority 
of the Presidency and the right to direct this great latter-day dispen- 
sation has not been with this Church. It has not been broken up. 
It has not been changed. It has been continuous. And it offers to 
the world today that same power, that same glory, and those beauti- 
ful privileges that were extended during the life of the Prophet. 

I want to tell you the people of the world are beginning to ap- 
preciate the fact that there is something to that Church called "Mor- 
mon;" in fact, the badge of Mormonism today is as the stamp of 
sterling upon silver. The word "Mormon" on our business cards is 
sufficient to give us entree into the highest circles of citizenship. 

Last Sunday, as has been reported by President Grant, there was 
dedicated at Laramie, Wyoming, a very wonderful and beautifully 
constructed building to be used for the education of the young people 
of the Church. The building was crowded, both morning and after- 
noon sessions. I was very much impressed with the remarks made 
by Dr. Crane, the President of the University. He made one state- 
ment that profoundly interested me. He said that he had been 
the president of that university for sixteen years, and during that 
time he had never had one Latter-day Saint boy or girl come before 
him for reprimand. There are three thousand students enrolled in 
that university, one hundred and twenty-five of whom are Latter-day 
Saints. We feel that with the completion of that building many 
more of our young people who are at the present time going to other 
places for education will remain in their own state. 

We have in our mission twenty-eight branches, and may I say 
that recently while in the southwestern part of Colorado, in one of 
these small branches in which we have fifty-five members enrolled, 
I was thrilled at the spirituality found. Of that number there are 
twenty-two male members over twelve years of age. Every one of 
them observes the Word of Wisdom. Not one of them uses profan- 
ity. Every one of them pays a tithe, — that is, those who are old 
enough and who earn money. Recently in making a survey for 
possible part-time missionary material in this small branch we found 
that of the twenty-one male members there were twelve who volun- 
teered to do missionary work, among them the president, his two 
counselors and the branch clerk, the presidency and secretary of 
the Mutual Improvement Association, the Sunday School super- 
intendent, one counselor and the secretary and two priests. The 
balance of the twenty-one were deacons. It is an indication that 
there is faith out in the mission fields. And when I go down there 
to visit these wonderful people I see instead of ten per cent or fifteen 
per cent, or twenty per cent of the population of that branch in at- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tendance, one hundred and fifty per cent. They bring in their 
neighbors and friends, and they glory in the opportunity of hearing 
the truths as explained by the servants of the Lord. 

I love my work, my brothers and sisters. My life has been spent 
for many years in the commercial field, but with it I have undertaken 
to be active in the Church. Never have I experienced any activity 
in my life comparable with this call that has come, to preach the Gos- 
pel and to bring souls unto repentance. It is glorious and beautiful. 
And I thank my Heavenly Father that I have thus been counted 
worthy. 

I want to say to the parents and the bishops of any of our mis- 
sionaries who may be here, that they send you their love. May I sug- 
gest to you bishops if you could occasionally write a letter to any of 
them, it would give them great comfort and joy. One of our elders 
who has been in the field nearly two years said, "I have had one letter 
from my bishop, and oh, how I prized it. If I could have had more 
I am sure I would have thought that he was more interested in my 
work." These elders and these lady missionaries, God bless them, 
are doing a marvelous and a wonderful work, and we are undertaking 
in our humble way to teach them true character and glorious ideals. 

Sister Daynes is doing a marvelous work with our Relief Society 
sisters. We have some six hundred women of the Church who are 
industriously undertaking to follow the ideals of the Relief Society 
work. When Sister Daynes goes into their midst she goes like an 
angel of peace, carrying her message of love and stimulation that 
builds faith and helps glorious motherhood. 

May God bless you all, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

It is never a commonplace task to speak in this historic house. I 
have spoken here before, but not as a missionary; perhaps my brief 
experience would not entitle me to speak as such now. Going away 
has given me a better appreciation of some things than I had before. 

During my brief absence I have seen thousands of people but I have 
never met any people who seemed quite so satisfied with their surround- 
ings, with their homes, with their religion, as you seem to be. 

I have always been interested in missionary work. My interest 
in the past has been focused largely upon the effect this work has upon 
young people. In common with you I have seen a great many young men, 
undeveloped and inexperienced, untouched with the refining influence 
of the truth, go on missions, and return with a new light shining in 
their eyes, radiating a new influence, with something working in their 
hearts which has brought about a marvelous transformation in their 
lives. Missionary experience makes a contribution to a boy's character, 
to his faith, to his development, that nothing else seems to make. The 
ingenuity of man never devised a plan for the development of young 



ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 



37 



men and women quite comparable to the missionary work of the Church. 
I doubt if the Church engages in any other activity that brings to it 
such a constant vitalization as the missionary work does. 

The Northern States Mission is made up of a section of the United 
States that is both rich and populous. The Church in its infancy was 
cradled in these states. The cradle was rocked so violently that only the 
hand of providence saved it. It is gratifying to know that the weary 
feet of our people never rested upon a spot that was not made greener 
thereby. 

One of the fundamental obligations resting upon this Church is to 
preach the Gospel to the world. This is indeed a high commission, a 
great and exalted calling, but the second obligation, that of living our 
religion, is still higher and greater. I recently heard a young missionary 
in one of the large cities of the East sketch in outline the organization 
of the Church, its plan for solving the social and economic problems 
that vex and distress the world. At the conclusion of the meeting a man 
said to me, "How does it work out? You must live in a marvelous 
community." That is the test to which the Church must be subjected. 
How does it work out? My brethren and sisters, if we have faith 
enough to live the plain principles of our religion, to practice what we 
have been taught all our days, we are destined to become the pride and 
glory of the earth. If we care for our poor a little better than othef 
churches do; if the youth of this Church enjoy greater opportunities, 
if they grow up untouched by sin, uncontaminated with the wickedness 
of the world ; if we are distinguished for our honesty, our sobriety, our 
industry ; if we do actually live a little longer ; if our lives are a little 
happier — then we have no need to fear ! No bigotry can defeat us, no 
malice can stay our progress, no hatred can destroy us. Philosophers, 
educators, statesmen, and thinkers will come from afar to see how we 
do it. This is the day of demonstration. 1700 missionaries may 
preach this Gospel loud and long, far and near, but they can never preach 
it with the convincing power that we can do by living it. We belong 
to a great Church. God help us to honor it, to declare its message to the 
world and to vindicate in our daily lives its advantages, I humbly pray 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

What a blessed thing it is to live in this beautiful world ! I won- 
der how well we appreciate the great privilege that is given to us in 
the span of human life. What an opportunity it affords to every one 
to accomplish something that will be for our eternal welfare ! God 
has ordained that we should have this earth-life experience. What a 
beautiful world he has made for us in which to dwell ! How grateful 
we ought to be ! When we contemplate the beauties of it and look 
out into the world, and especially at this time of the year, when the 
springtime is approaching and the buds begin to swell, and leaves

to unfold, how my heart thrills with the beauty of this natural world 
in which we live, and my heart goes out in gratitude to my Heavenly 
Father for the span of human life. He has been good to me and ex- 
tended the years of my life very greatly. 

My father used to say, when he had attained the ripe old age of 
seventy years, "Now I have attained the allotted age of man, three 
score years and ten, what years I may yet live are borrowed time." 
From that we might suppose, from a life insurance point of view, 
that it would be lopped off from somebody else's life. He lived 
some six or seven years after that allotted time. It has been my 
privilege to go nearly twelve years already beyond the allotted age 
of man, and I feel grateful, and I have the hope in my heart that I 
may devote the years that I may yet live in the service of God, in the 
building up of his kingdom here upon the earth, this beautiful earth, 
this beautiful world in which we live, and that I may be full of ad- 
miration and gratitude for the beautiful home which God has made 
for us. 

I am not blind to the fact that there are some things which 
greatly mar the beauty of the world in which we live, and that mar 
our happiness, not coming from God, however, but from those who 
inhabit this beautiful world. We read in the newspapers of the 
terrible crimes that are being committed, executions of judgment 
for heinous crimes. We read of the terrible things that are happen- 
ing all around us — murders, robberies and other offenses ; of wars, 
and rumors of wars. We read of the great nations on the verge of 
war. What is the reason, and why should these things be in this 
beautiful world? Why cannot the children of God dwell on it in 
peace and in harmony, and enjoy the great privileges and the great 
blessings which God gave to us when he made this world to become 
our habitation for the span of human life, during which period we 
are to be tried? 

The Lord purposes that we should be tried, and therefore it has 
become necessary in order to bring about the purposes of the Al- 
mighty that there shall be opposition to the will of God. God wills 
that we shall do right, that we shall live in peace and harmony to- 
gether. God wills that we shall live righteous lives, that we shall 
love him and keep his commandments. But the devil came also, and 
he was permitted to come, and he exercises an influence upon the 
children of God, and leads them away from God ; hence the confusion, 
hence the wickedness, hence the strife, the wars, and rumors of wars, 
and all the wickedness that we see round about us. Does the Lord 
will that, or does he not? What is the occasion of this life, and why 
are we subjected and placed in a position where we have to witness 
these things, and hear of them, and where we have to come under the 
temptations? Because the Lord deemed it necessary that there 
should be opposition in all things in order that we might be tried. • 

When he placed our first parents in the Garden of Eden he 
planted in the east of Eden a wonderful garden, with wonderful trees 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



39 



growing there, and he took the man that he had made out of the dust 
of the ground and placed him in this garden. He saw that it was 
not good for the man to be alone, and so he made a helpmate for him 
and placed them in this garden in which these wonderful trees had 
been planted, that would supply all their bodily requirements; all 
that they had to do was to stretch forth their hands and obtain the 
things that were needful for their welfare. In the midst of that 
garden God planted also two very marvelous trees, the Tree of 
Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life. They were 
somewhat different in their nature from other trees. I do not 
know just what fruit was being yielded upon those other trees. There 
may have been pear trees, apple trees, etc., but one thing we are 
quite sure about, there must have been a fig tree, as we read further 
in regard to the products of that tree. But the fruit of the Tree 
of Knowledge of Good and Evil was something different, not like 
the apple or the pear, it doesn't partake of that nature at all. 

Just as a pear is the fruit of a pear tree, or the peach or the apple 
is the fruit of the peach or the apple tree, so too is Knowledge of 
Good and Evil the fruit of the tree that bears that name. And Life, 
by which I mean eternal life, is the fruit of the Tree of Life. A tree is 
known by the fruit it bears, and "by their fruits ye shall know them." 
That is the nature of every plant that grows. 

And now then, this wonderful tree of Knowledge of Good and 
Evil. Why should there be opposition to the will of God? Because 
light has come into the world and with that light comes responsi- 
bility, the free agency of man, because we had to choose between 
good and evil, having partaken of the fruit of the tree that bears that 
name. How could Ave choose between good and evil if it were all 
good? Hence the necessity for opposition to the will of God, and 
the devil came also and lured them away from God, and they broke 
the law of heaven. 

What is the law of heaven? Obedience to the will of God, for 
"man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth 
forth from the mouth of God." Obedience, then, is the first law of 
heaven. Partaking of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good 
and Evil of course was forbidden, not because it was undesirable, not 
because there was anything in it of itself that was wicked, not by any 
manner of means. For how could we be saved unless we had that 
knowledge of good and evil? How could we choose between the 
two? Impossible. Therefore the opposition came and we must be 
proven as to whether we would do all things whatsoever the Lord 
God should command us to do. Obedience to the law of heaven is 
an essential condition of salvation, and an essential condition in 
heaven. 

I sometimes think of this world and compare it with what it was 
before the curse of the Almighty came upon it in the Garden of Eden, 
where everything was beautiful and everything was peace and tran- 
quility, the lion and the lamb lying down together, and all was 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



harmony. It must have been beautiful indeed. It is referred to in the 
scripture as "the garden of the Lord." Isaiah tells us : "For the 
Lord shall comfort Zion ; he will comfort all her waste places ; and he 
will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden 
of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, 
and the voice of melody." (Isa. 51 :3.) Surely then the Garden of 
Eden must have been beautiful, a little heaven on earth. It was 
Paradise. 

Adam and Eve violated the law of heaven by breaking God's 
commandment and hearkening to the devil, and therefore they were 
driven out of Eden. Shall the devil rule in heaven? Why did the 
Savior teach us to pray : "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in 
earth as it is in heaven"? Whom shall we obey? God or the devil. 
Whomsoever ye list to obey his servant ye are. Such then was the 
Garden of Eden. But on account of disobedience the Lord cursed 
the earth — not Adam and Eve — he cursed the earth for their sakes. 
No longer could they stretch forth their hands and get without effort 
the things that they needed. No, they must earn their living by the 
sweat of their brow. There were no thorns or thistles there at the 
beginning. Now Adam must earn a livelihood on this earth under 
the curse that was placed upon it, with thorns and thistles to contend 
with, and many other things that they had to contend with under the 
curse which God had put upon the earth for their sakes. 

Are we to regard this early episode in the history of our race as a 
calamity ? No ! indeed ! Was the fall of Adam in reality a mis- 
fortune? Again no, indeed ! For, as we read in the Book of Mormon, 
if Adam and Eve had not transgressed there would have been no 
progress but they would have remained forever in the same state in 
which they were then first created — in a perfect state of innocence, 
"having no joy, for they knew no misery, doing no good, for they 
knew no sin." Therefore to bring about the eternal purposes of God 
in the end of man it was found necessary that there should be opposi- 
tion. And furthermore there would have been no children and hence 
we would have been deprived of our golden opportunity of living 
upon this beautiful earth, this probationary period, the span of 
human life. But the Lord desires that our eyes shall be open, that 
we shall have knowledge of good and evil, and therefore we are ex- 
posed to them, and blessed are we if we will choose the good and 
reject the evil. We do not have to, do the wrong; we should do the 
right, and if we do the Lord is bound, under the covenant that he has 
made with us. If we shall do all things whatsoever the Lord our 
God shall command us, there shall be glory added upon our heads 
forever and ever. That is the promise ; it is God's covenant. We are 
a covenant people, and that covenant has been restored to the earth 
with the restoration of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord, 
and all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us are 
embodied in that glorious Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Obedience, then, to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



41 



entitle us to eternal glory, worlds without end. That is the promise. 
The Lord keeps his covenants. Men do not always keep their cove- 
nants. What a wonderful thing this covenant is that the Lord has 
made with us ! 

What is a covenant ? If you will look at your dictionary you will 
find that it is defined as an agreement between two persons or parties. 
Sometimes those agreements are made between nations, and then 
they are called treaties, and they are usually entered into by being 
signed by the executive heads of those nations or governments and 
then ratified by their legislative bodies. Such are the treaties that 
are made with the nations. They are intended to be solemn pledges 
whereby they bind themselves with one another to make good the 
agreements they enter into with each other. What a terrible shock 
it was during the World War to hear the ruler of one great nation 
refer to his solemn treaty as "a mere scrap of paper," but in these 
later days we are getting used to that, and these dictatorial rulers of 
many great and wonderful nations are treating their solemn treaties 
like mere scraps of paper; but they should not be so treated, they 
should be solemnly and truthfully and faithfully kept. Between in- 
dividuals we draw up an instrument and we sign it, and have it 
signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of witnesses, and then 
go before a notary public or a justice of the peace and make oath in 
order to make it binding, and in order that it may be still more so, 
laws are passed imposing penalties for breach of contract. These are 
in the nature of covenants which men make with their fellow men. 

What must we then think of a covenant where God himself 
is the party of the first part? Such a covenant God has made with 
every one of us. He has entered into an agreement with us. If you 
will do all things which the Lord your God shall command you; if 
you will do his will, you shall have glory added upon your heads for- 
ever and ever. That is the pledge, and God keeps his covenant and 
we should do the same. 

How do we enter into that covenant? Not by signing a written 
instrument. True. But in a most impressive manner and a most 
authoritative manner. The Lord commissions his servants, bestows 
upon them his priesthood and authorizes them to perform sacred or- 
dinances, the same as if he had signed it in person. They call atten- 
tion to the necessity of following the Lord Jesus Christ and obeying 
his Gospel, doing all things whatsoever the Lord shall command us. 
That is the contract, and we enter into it in a most solemn way. What 
is the formality of it, if not by writing with pen and ink? It is by 
baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. What a wonderful 
and impressive formality ! Could anything be more so ? In baptism 
by immersion we symbolize both death and life, for as the Apostle 
Paul explains : "We are buried with Christ by baptism into death 
and brought forth out of the watery grave in likeness of his glorious 
resurrection. This is also symbolized in the story of the Garden of 
Eden and the two marvelous trees that were planted in the midst of 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the garden — the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil concerning 
which God commanded "Thou shalt not eat of it, in the day that thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Therefore, for sin, death. The 
other tree — the Tree of Life — eternal life, God's greatest gift to 
man, which will come to those who do his will. Again as the Apostle 
Paul tells us : "For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is 
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Rom. 6:23.) All this 
is symbolized in the holy ordinance of "baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins," and this is valid only when performed by one 
who has been duly commissioned of Jesus Christ the Lord. After this 
it is ratified by "the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost" by one having authority, just as Peter declared on the day 
of Pentecost: "For the promise is unto you and to your children 
and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall 
call." This is the seal of the covenant by which it is ratified and 
those receiving it are confirmed members of his church. 

May the Lord help us to be true to the covenants we have made 
with him in the waters of baptism, and so to live that we may have 
those glorious blessings in this beautiful world, when it shall be re- 
newed and receive its paradisiacal glory, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish again to thank this wonderful choir for being here and for 
so thoroughly inspiring us with their music. 

An anthem, "The Heavens are Telling," (Haydn), was sung by 
the Choir. 

Elder Danford M. Bickmore, President of the Hyrum Stake, of- 
fered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday, April 5, 9 :30 a. m. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, April 5. 

As a prelude to the third session of the Conference a program 
of choral and organ music was rendered by the Tabernacle Chojr and 
Organ from 9 :30 to 10 :30 a. m., which program was broadcast by radio 
throughout the United States and Canada over the Columbia Broad- 
casting System's network, originating over Station KSL, Salt Lake 
City. 

As the time approached for commencing the broadcast every avail- 
able seat and space in the great Tabernacle auditorium and galleries 
was occupied, and in addition thousands of people assembled on the

President Heber J. Grant, the congregation and Choir sang the hymn, 
"O Ye Mountains High." 

Elder Arthur Winter offered the invocation. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

It is a privilege and also a great opportunity to stand here before 
you and look at this vast audience, this mighty horde which has come 
from a very small beginning. God has directed and has chosen the 
men who should lead and guide this work up to the present and to 
this very day. 

In the conditions in which we find ourselves situated it is very 
fortunate at least that we can look back and trace with an honorable 
hand the advancement of our people from the beginning of this 
Church. No other spot on the earth has such religious gatherings 
as this. In no other place- may we find such a united, wonderful 
people. No place on this footstool of God are there hearts raised 
in praise to their Heavenly Father for the mercies and the blessings 
they receive, equal to the fervor and sincerity which we have here 
today among us. 

It is a strange thing that having come in poverty and toil and in 
trial into these valleys, our fathers, even as did the Lord Jesus Christ, 
passed through a period of suffering, trial, tribulation and prepara- 



44 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



tion for the work which was to come to their children, even to us 
Even as Jesus Christ was forty days and forty nights in the wilder- 
ness without food, so did our fathers go many years in trial and 
anxiety to prepare that of which you and I are recipients and for 
which we stand ready to give our service, unto the work of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

You will recall that Moses, speaking to his people said : "And 
I have led you forty years in the wilderness ; your clothes are not 
waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot." 
Even so today we can see by this great assembly that the truths of 
the teachings of Christ and the masterful things which have been 
given to us by our fathers have not waxed old upon us. 

There came to me a day or two ago a message from New Zea- 
land, that land "way down under." I would like to read it to you be- 
cause a cablegram from that people is rather a unique thing, particu- 
larly because I received it a clay before it was sent. They are just 
beyond the 180th meridian and about 38 degrees south of the equator. 
This cablegram was sent from Dannevirke, New Zealand, and says : 

"Conference assembled at Tahoriti. Huge concourse, both 
Maori and European send greetings. Wonderful spirit. (Signed) 
New Zealand Saints." 

This is the spirit which actuates all the people of the Church 
of Jesus Christ the world over, the spirit which is breathed every- 
where by you. Your sons and your daughters have traveled the 
highways in all the principal cities of the world. They have acquired 
the culture, the art, and the refinement of all nations and all coun- 
tries, bringing back with them as they do to this great hive of hu- 
manity, which we have here today, their knowledge and their power. 

It is plain to see that we as a people, blessed as we are by our 
Heavenly Father, should be the people to lead out in all noble, praise- 
worthy enterprises. We should be the people who can and will con- 
quer depression. We should be by our faith and by our love and by 
our industry trained and taught to do those things that bring hap- 
piness and joy into the hearts of mankind. 

Just one thing more and I think my .ten minutes will be up. In 
a statement made by Herbert Kaufman he says : "The new era has 
cancelled the lie of vested right. Position and assured status can no 
longer be inherited. The millions have at last overtaken the thou- 
sands. The sons of service are standing shoulder to shoulder with 
the sons of privilege. The barrier is down, — this is the day of equal 
chance — when any man may have what he wills if he possesses the 
strength to reach it." 

God grant that we may possess that strength, that faith, to reach 
our own individual and collective ideals in the wonderful work in 
which we are engaged, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

CHURCH OF THE AIR BROADCAST 

At 10:50 a. m. Conference proceedings were interrupted to pre- 
pare for the Church of the Air broadcast which commenced promptly 
at 1 1 :00. This program, presented on the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 
tem's regularly scheduled Church of the Air series, was released by 
more than seventy important network stations throughout the United 
States and Canada and was carried by short wave to Europe and other 
countries. The radio announcer was Richard L. Evans. 

The program opened with the Choir and congregation joining in 
the singing of the hymn, "How Firm a Foundation."

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

HAPPINESS AND STRENGTH OF CHARACTER FOUND IN LOSING SELF FOR 
THE GOOD OF OTHERS 

All mankind desire happiness. Many also strive sincerely to make 
the most and best of themselves. Surprisingly few, however, realize 
that a sure guide to such achievement may be found in the following 
declaration by Jesus of Nazareth: "Whosoever will save his life shall 
lose it : And whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it." 

A SIGNIFICANT PRINCIPLE 

This significant passage contains a secret more worthy of possession 
than fame or dominion, something more valuable than all the wealth of 
the world, 

It is a principle the application of which promises to supplant 
discouragement and gloom with hope and gladness; to fill life with 
contentment and peace everlasting. This being true its acceptance would 
indeed be a boon today to this distracted, depression-ridden world. Why, 
then, do men and nations ignore a thing so precious ? 

Is the truth in the paradoxical statement, losing one's life to find 
it, so elusive that mankind cannot grasp it? Or is it so in conflict with 
the struggle for existence that men consider it impractical? 

Even so, the fact remains that He who is "The Way, the Truth 
and the Life" has herein set forth an immutable law, obedience to which 
will ameliorate those social and economic conditions in which "Man's 
inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn." 

Specifically stated, this law is, "We live our lives most completely 
when we strive to make the world better and. happier." The law of 
pure nature, survival of the fittest, is, self preservation at the sacrifice 
of all else; but in contrast to this the law of true spiritual life is, deny 
self for the good of others. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts as funda- 
mental this law of life. Faithful members thereof are convinced that 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



only in its application can true happiness be found or a truly great 
character be developed; and they believe with Emerson that "character 
is higher than intellect — a great soul will be fit to live as well as to 
think." To them, also, the safety and perpetuity of our nation depend 
upon the character-building, law-abiding individual. 

SERVICE TO OTHERS 

Therefore, in the heart of every true Latter-day Saint the voice 
of the Lord is ever whispering this recorded revelation : 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ;" 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days, and bring 
save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy in the kingdom 
of my Father!" 

With this end in view, 50,000 men and women, serving willingly 
without salary, offer every week to over 500,000 children and youth 
instruction and guidance in character-building and spiritual growth. 
In addition to this army of officers and teachers, 185,000 men ordained 
to the priesthood have accepted the obligation to devote their time and 
talents as far as possible to the scattering of sunshine, joy, and peace 
among their fellowmen. 

In all such efforts these men and women are but actuated by the 
high ideals of the prophet of the 19th century who, exemplifying the 
teachings of Christ said, "If my life is of no value to my friends, it's 
of no value to me." 

Never was there a time in the history of the world when the applica- 
tion of this principle was more needed. Therefore, let sincere men 
and women the world over unite in earnest effort to supplant feelings 
of selfishness, hatred, animosity, greed, by the law of service to others, 
and thereby promote the peace and happiness of mankind. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

FAITH, BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE OF THIS CHURCH CONCERNING 

JESUS CHRIST 

I wish to state the faith, the belief, and the knowledge of the Latter- 
day Saints regarding Jesus of Nazareth. 

CHRIST, THE CREATOR OF THE WORLD 

We accept literally the words of John concerning the Christ : "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word 
was God." The Christ has declared in our own day: "I was in the 
beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn." 

We also accept John's declaration that Jesus Christ was the Creator 
of the world, that "all things were made by him, and without him was 
not anything made that was made." 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



47 



We believe that in a great council in heaven held before the world 
was, Satan proposed one plan for creating and ruling the world and its 
progeny, and that Christ proposed another; that Satan's plan was re- 
jected, as taking away the agency of man, and Christ's was accepted as 
keeping man's agency. 

We believe that in obedience to the Plan, Christ created the world 
and all that in it is, first spiritually, then temporally, and that in this 
work of creation he acted as one of the Great Trinity of three distinct 
personages, the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. 

PERSONAL APPEARANCES TO MAN 

We believe that following this creation, the Lord from time to time 
showed himself to man, either in person or in vision, or dream, or by 
speech, beginning even with Adam, and later to Enoch, Noah, Abraham, 
Moses, Samuel, Daniel, and others on the Eastern hemisphere, and to 
many prophets on the Western continents; that on this hemisphere, in 
one of the most glorious theophanies of all time, the Lord showed him- 
self, before his birth, to the brother of Jared, the man of greatest faith 
to his time, saying: "Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall 
take upon me flesh and blood." "Behold, this body, which ye now 
behold, is the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be 
in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh." 

Christ's birth and atonement 

We believe that in the Meridian of Time, Mary the virgin gave 
birth to Jesus, the Only Begotten of the Father, in very deed and fact 
the Son of God; that Jesus was crucified upon the cross; that he was 
buried and lay in the tomb till the morning of the third day when he 
was verily resurrected from the dead — that is, his spirit and his body 
reunited and he rose from the tomb a perfect, glorified, living soul, that 
thus Christ atoned for Adam's fall from which man is so redeemed, and 
that all men will by reason of that atonement be resurrected — that is, the 
body and the spirit of every person born into the world will at some time 
after death, and in the due course of the Lord, be reunited, thus fulfilling 
Paul's saying : "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive." 

We believe that except for this atonement of Christ for the fall of 
Adam, man would, through all the eternities, have remained under the 
penalty of the mortal and spiritual death brought upon the human family 
by Adam. 

We thus believe Christ to be in the full, true, and most literal 
sense, the Creator of the world, one of the Godhead, the Only Begotten 
of the Father, the Son of God, the promised Messiah, the first fruits 
of the resurrection, the Redeemer of the world.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A GLORIOUS MANIFESTATION IN THIS DISPENSATION 

We believe that some eighteen hundred years after the Son's death 
and resurrection, the Father and the* Son, two glorified personages having 
human form, appeared to a boy fourteen years of age, even as the Lord 
came of old to the child Samuel in the Temple ; that the Father, pointing 
to the Son said : "This is my beloved Son. Hear him ;" and that the 
Son, responding to the lad's inquiry as to which of the many sectarian 
creeds were right, told the lad that none of them was right, and that 
he should join none of them. 

We believe that through the instrumentality of this same lad, Joseph 
Smith, grown to maturity, the Lord restored to earth the true Gospel 
and the priesthood of God which had been taken from the earth because 
of the transgressions of men. 

Hundreds of thousands of Latter-day Saints, living and dead, have 
proclaimed their absolute knowledge of the truth of every declaration 
I have made ; some of them have sealed their testimonies with a martyr's 
blood. To the testimony of the humblest of all these, I wish in humility 
to add my own. 

A vocal solo, "The Seer," was sung by Harold H. Bennett. 
PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF 
LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

In thinking seriously of the economic condition of the world, I am 
convinced without doubt, that a revelation in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, known as the Word of Wisdom, given by the Lord, the 
Creator of heaven and earth, to the Prophet Joseph Smith over one 
hundred years ago, would solve the economic problems not only of our 
country but of every other country, if it were obeyed by the people of 
the world. 

FOR OUR TEMPORAL SALVATION 

This Word of Wisdom teaches the Latter-day Saints to refrain from 
the use of tea, coffee, tobacco, and liquor, and part of it reads as follows : 

To be sent greeting: not by commandment or constraint, but by 
revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of 
God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days — ■ 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the 
last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this 
word of wisdom by revelation — 

And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel 
and marrow to their bones ; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



49 



And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass them by, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen. 

THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE MAINTAINED 

Another thing that is needed is to maintain the Constitution of our 
country, and I now have pleasure in reading a declaration by Joseph 
Smith regarding the Constitution: 

The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is 
founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner; it is, to all 
those who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades 
and refreshing waters of a great rock in a weary and thirsty land. It 
is like a great tree under whose branches men from every clime can be 
shielded from the burning rays of the sun. 

GOVERNMENTS AND LAWS IN GENERAL 

I read from a declaration of belief regarding governments and laws 
in general, adopted by unanimous vote of a general assembly of the 
Church over one hundred years ago : 

We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of 
man ; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, 
both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety 
of society. 

We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are 
framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free 
exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection 
of life. 

We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil 
government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another pro- 
scribed in its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, 
as citizens, denied. 

THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

The leading officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints have been accused of exercising unrighteous dominion, because 
of the priesthood they hold. Joseph Smith was sentenced by a court 
martial to be shot the following morning, and General Alexander W. 
Doniphan refused to carry out the order of his commanding general, 
and said that it was cold-blooded murder. This frightened the general 
in command of the mob, who were expelling our people from the State 
of Missouri ; so they imprisoned the prophet and others in Liberty 
jail, and while there he received from the Lord one of the most wonderful 
revelations ever given to our people, regarding the exercise of the Priest- 
hood, and I have pleasure in quoting part of it : 

We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, 
they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness, and by love unfeigned ; 

By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the 
soul without hypocrisy, and without guile- 
Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward 
him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy. 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords 
of death. 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity toward all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine 
of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter 
an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow 
unto thee forever and ever. 

QUOTES ARTICLES OF FAITH 

I quote the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth articles of faith of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints : 

We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to 
the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let 
them worship how, where, or what they may. 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, 
in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. 

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and 
in doing good to all men ; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition 
of Paul : We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many 
things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything 
virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these 
things. 

I close my remarks by bearing my testimony to the world that I know, 
as I know that I live, that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Re- 
deemer of the world, who came to the earth with a divinely appointed 
mission to die on the cross for the sins of mankind. And I bear my 
testimony that I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and 
the living God. 

A duet, "An Angel from on High," was sung by Ida M. Hepworth 
and Claudius Doty, the Choir and congregation joining in the chorus. 

As the concluding number on the Church of the Air broadcast the 
congregation sang the hymn "Doxology," an invitation having first been_ 
extended by the announcer to any of the radio audience who cared to 
do so to join in the singing of this hymn. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been inspired, as I am sure you all have been this morning, 
in the privilege we have enjoyed in these two broadcasts and the messages 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



51 



that have been delivered. I most earnestly desire that I may continue 
in the same good spirit. 

FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS NOT ALWAYS REALIZED 

I have been deeply impressed by reason of recent visits to some of 
the missions of the Church that we are making history fast. I am also 
impressed that we are often so close to great and important events we 
do not always realize their full significance. I have been further im- 
pressed that it is impossible for one generation to pass correct judgment 
upon men or measures, for one generation has often been wrong, has 
condemned the teachers of truth, whereas the generations that have 
followed afterwards have vindicated those who have been so condemned. 
I have discovered however in my study of the past that time is ever 
on the side of right and truth, and the judgment of time is always 
correct, for time dethrones error and falsehood, and time elevates to 
their right place truth and the teachers of truth. 

time's vindication of a courageous man 

Let me give you a few instances that have greatly impressed me. 
It was my privilege a few months ago to stand by a monument in Rich- 
mond, Missouri, erected by the State of Missouri to this distinguished 
gentleman to whom President Grant has referred — Colonel Alexander 
William Doniphan. It is true that an official of the State of Missouri, 
acting undoubtedly under the instruction of the Governor of that State, 
issued an order for the execution of the Mormon prophet, and it is also 
true that General Doniphan defied his superior officer and refused to 
execute the order, saying that it would be nothing short of cold-blooded 
murder, and that if anyone else undertook to execute that order he 
would be a witness against him in the courts of justice. 

I have searched the records and fail to find that General Doniphan 
was ever court-martialed for defying his superior. He espoused the 
cause of justice, and time has vindicated him, for the State of Missouri 
whom he defied has erected on the public square at Richmond a mag- 
nificent monument to General Doniphan, and upon it are written these 
words : 

Colonel Alexander William Doniphan was of immense stature, noble 
appearance, brilliant parts, fearless, of great moral courage, sanguine, 
faithful, just, poetic in temperament, a champion of the downtrodden, 
eloquent beyond description, and without doubt entitled to be classed 
among the great orators and lawyers that ever lived. 

Time vindicated him. 

time's judgment upon another 

What did it do to the man whom he opposed, who inspired this 
persecution and who ultimately signed the exterminating order that 
drove the entire membership of the Church in the State of Missouri 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



out of the State itself ? You will find a marker erected over the grave of 
Lilburn W. Boggs, the man who lifted his hand against the Prophet 
and who drove the Church from the State of Missouri. It is erected in 
the little village of Napa, California, on an ill-kept and almost forgotten 
grave. In a small cemetery near the town of Napa, some forty-three 
miles north of Oakland, lie the remains of the Governor of Missouri 
who declared that the Mormons would perish on the plains, and naught 
but their bleaching bones would remain. He also in his exterminating 
order said : "The Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be 
exterminated and driven from the State, if necessary, for the public 
good." And time has passed judgment upon him, has relegated him into 
an almost unknown grave, and no honor or glory is attached to his name. 

THE CASE OF STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS 

I visited Springfield on a recent trip through the Northern States 
mission with President Bryant S. Hinckley, and was reminded again 
of the action of two of Illinois' famous sons. One of them while a 
candidate for the presidency of the United States was asked what he 
would do with the Mormon problem — for it was just at that time that 
the runaway judges from Utah had circulated their falsehoods and 
had stirred up prejudice against our people, which ultimately brought 
Johnston's army to Utah — and Stephen A. Douglas, the little giant of 
Illinois, said that if he became President of the United States he would 
"apply the knife to this pestiferous cancer on the body politic and cut 
it out to the very roots, and sear it over with a red-hot iron." 

He was reminded, when his speech reached Salt Lake City, of a 
conversation he had with Joseph Smith when Douglas was an almost 
unknown country lawyer, in which the Prophet told him that the time 
would come when he (Douglas) would be a candidate for the presidency 
of the United States, and he warned him that if at that time he lifted 
his hand against Joseph Smith or his people he would feel the hand of 
Almighty God; and he was warned to beware lest the judgments be 
fulfilled upon his head. But he did not desist. He went on in his own 
self-laid course to defeat, failing utterly. Though his own party's candi- 
date for the presidency in the previous election had been eminently 
successful, Douglas was a miserable failure, and within a year died 
at the very prime of his life, a broken-hearted, disappointed man. 

I have failed to find in my search a conspicuous monument erected 
to Stephen A. Douglas. Time dealt with him. 

LINCOLN AND THE MORMON QUESTION 

His opponent was that wise, judicious, great patriot, Abraham 
Lincoln, who when asked "What would you do with this Mormon 
problem ?" is reported to have said : "When I find in the field a tough 
stump, instead of spending my time trying to remove it, I usually plow 
around it. That is what I will do with the Mormon problem. I will 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



53 



just plow around it." He went to victory, to honor, to fulfil his mission, 
and not only the State of Illinois, but the nation itself has erected to 
the great Lincoln the finest monument ever built to mortal man. 

TIME A FRIEND TO TRUTH, AN ENEMY TO FALSEHOOD 

If there were time sufficient I could tell you the story of others, 
not only from among those outside the Church, but those who apostatized 
and left it and lifted their hands against it. Not one of them has won 
honor and glory through his efforts, but time has leveled him to his 
proper place. I could tell you the story of countless thousands of humble 
men who lent their hands to the building of this, God's work, and have 
been lifted up beyond the plane on which they and their ancestors have 
traveled for generations, to a place of power and influence and intelli- 
gence and understanding that the generations before them never knew. 

This is true today as it was when uttered long ago, that the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ is a savor of life unto life to all those who sub- 
scribe to it, and death unto death to all those who oppose it. If, 
therefore, the testimony of Joseph Smith and the testimony of his suc- 
cessors had not been the truth, it would have been discovered before 
now, for time is moving more rapidly than ever before to pass its 
judgment upon men — for we live in the age of the greatest light and 
learning and knowledge the world has ever known, and error is detected 
much easier and more quickly than ever before. If these declarations 
that we make were not true, time would have dissolved this church, and 
it would have passed away before this day. Time is vindicating misun- 
derstood men ; time is vindicating their teachings and supporting them. 
And that the life and practices of the people who subscribe to these 
teachings are rising and shining in such a way that they attract the 
attention of the world elsewhere makes my heart rejoice. 

THE COURSE WE SHOULD FOLLOW 

My brothers and sisters, in the light of all this, what shall our 
course be from here on ? There is a time in the life of every man, and 
nation, when we stand at the crossroads. We are today, many of us, 
uncertain where to go and what to do. My plea to every Latter-day 
Saint is : If you do not know it, get a knowledge and testimony in your 
heart that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith 
is a prophet of the true and the living God. There is ample evidence 
to satisfy any honest investigator; no one needs to say it cannot be 
demonstrated nor discovered. And then I plead with you to have pa- 
tience with your problems whatever they are, economic or otherwise; 
be patient and be faithful, don't be swept off your feet by every wind 
of doctrine that would lead you hither and thither. Don't imagine that 
the schemes of men that hope and seek to solve the economic problems 
of the world are a substitute for that which God has given, for that 
which he has given this Church will stand when all the theories and 
schemes of men will fail. 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE PATH TO GLORY AND EXALTATION 

I know as I know that I live that God is still with this work ; that 
it is the truth ; that the light is in the ship ; that the pilot is not asleep. 
The dogs have barked, but the caravan, the Church of the living God, 
has gone forward in the past as it shall go in the future grandly on 
to its destiny. God help us to stay on the ship ; God help us to do our 
part and to keep from everything that would lead us from the main 
path, which if we continue to travel in shall bring us to glory and 
exaltation, and make the ends of the earth come to learn of your ways 
and walk in your paths, for time's testimony and judgment having been 
pronounced upon this Church approves it, applauds it, and it shall 
stand. God help us to stay with it, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Central States Mission 

I hope to be able to bring to you a brief report of some of the things 
that are occurring in the Central States mission. I am sure they will be 
interesting at least to the parents of the missionaries who are laboring 
there. 

We are in the center place of Zion — a land that was dedicated by the 
servants of the Lord for the gathering of his people and from which the 
word of the Lord should go forth to all the earth. However, in the 
process of time and because the people were not able to live up to their 
responsibilities, the Lord decreed that his word should go forth from 
some other place. Today it is going forth from this place. Nevertheless, 
in one sense, the word of the Lord is also going forth from the very 
center place of Zion in that literally millions of tracts and pamphlets 
are being sent from the Zion Printing Company to missions all over 
the world. 

The thought that I want to express, if I can, the Lord helping 
me, is this : That the great and marvelous work in which we are engaged, 
and which is characteristic of every mission of the Church and is not 
peculiar to any one mission, is the work of the Lord — and not of man. 
He indicated many years before he came in the flesh that in the latter 
days there should go forth a book, and that in that time he would perform 
a marvelous work and a wonder, because the wisdom of wise men should 
perish, and the understanding of prudent men should be hidden ; but 
the Lord himself should be exalted. 

I mention this because I have great comfort in the thought that 
even as great as our responsibility is in our mission, as in all the missions, 
we are not depending upon our own wisdom or our own strength to 
accomplish the work to which we have been called. I believe the parents 
of the missionaries will be comforted in the thought that their sons 
and daughters who have given themselves to the ministry of the Church 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



55 



go out under his inspiration and his protecting care. There are so many 
instances that indicate that God overrules all things for their blessing 
and benefit that might be related, but time will not permit. 

Here is an interesting experience: One of our missionaries, Elder 
Howard Wardle, broadcasting from a radio station in a small town in 
Arkansas, left his program after it was finished, picked up his grip 
and started for his next destination. Coming out on the main highway, 
he was invited by a gentleman passing by to ride in his automobile. 
As soon as he took his seat in the automobile, the man said: "I have 
just enjoyed a very interesting experience. I have a radio in my car 
and I have listened to a broadcast by a young Mormon elder. It was 
one of the finest and most delightful programs I have ever listened 
to." And the missionary replied, "Well, I am the one who did the 
broadcasting." 

You can imagine the pleasure they had in the conversation that 
ensued. The Lord does bring about some very unique things which 
indicate that his power and his blessing are over his people. 

May I say just a word about a remarkable incident "pertaining to 
the Book of Mormon. This, I think, is typical of many. 

Recently in one of our small Sunday Schools, a little boy whose 
mother was not a member of the Church came to enjoy the school. When 
he returned home he looked up into the face of his mother and asked : 
"Mother, who is Jesus Christ ?" His mother was astonished and thought 
to herself, "Is it possible that I have never told my little boy who Jesus 
Christ is?" 

She asked : "Where did you hear about him ?" 

"At the Mormon Sunday School," he replied. 

She decided she would go to the Sunday School. During the course 
of the exercises she heard something about the Book of Mormon. She 
asked the elders, "What is this book?" and they told her. 

"Do you allow people to read it ?" 

"Yes, indeed, we welcome them to read it. Would you like to 
borrow one?" 

"Oh, I would like to," she said. 

She took the book home, read it and came back with this testimony : 
"I have never been able to understand the Bible and, therefore, have 
never been particularly interested in religion, but after reading the Book 
of Mormon carefully and prayerfully, I find that I understand the 
Bible." 

I have heard that testimony offered, in many forms, many times 
by different people — and so, my brethren and sisters, I have this thought 
to suggest to you: Read the Book of Mormon. You will enjoy the 
Bible more if you do. Let your neighbors read the Book of Mormon, 
and they will love the word of God. 

May the Lord bless you. He is greatly blessing us in the Central 
States mission. We are grateful for his watchful and protecting care, 
and we bear our testimonies with gratitude that we know this Church 
is the true Church of God and that the men who preside over it are

his inspired servants and that we are, indeed, true messengers of his 
Church. 

God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I was playing golf with the son of the late Governor of the State 
of Missouri, Mr. Crittendon, and he gave me a pamphlet in which he 
marked the record of a certain battlefield near Kansas City, and he 
said to me: "Mr. Grant, it might interest you to know that you are 
playing on your own property; the title to this golf links is in the 
Presiding Bishop of the Mormon Church." 

TITLE BY ADVERSE POSSESSION 

I was in Kansas City at the time for the purpose of delivering 
a lecture before the Chamber of Commerce, and in my remarks I quoted 
the Articles of Faith of the Church, and I announced that I held the 
title — or at least the Presiding Bishop of the Mormon Church did — to 
a little more than one-half the entire city of Kansas City, but lo and 
behold, I could not get any of that property because there is a law to 
the effect that adverse possession gives title to the person having such 
possession. But they cannot get a good abstract, as the title traces back 
to the name of Edward Partridge, Presiding Bishop of the Mormon 
Church. 

Some day, perhaps, Uncle Sam, seeing that we paid our money 
for that land, may give us our money back, but I doubt it. 

The Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "God Moves in a 
Mysterious Way," after which the closing prayer was offered by Elder 
George F. Whitehead, President of the St. George Temple. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock p. m., 
Sunday, April 5. 

As was the case at the previous session, the Tabernacle auditorium 
and galleries were crowded to capacity, and thousands of people con- 
gregated in the Assembly Hall to the south of the Tabernacle, and on 
the Temple Block, where they listened to the Conference proceedings 
as they were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir, under the direction of J . Spencer Cornwall, 
conductor, furnished the music for this session. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 57 

The Choir and congregation joined in the singing of the hymn, 
"Come, Come, ye Saints." 

Elder David H. Cannon, President of the Hollywood Stake, of- 
fered the invocation. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have received the following telegrams: 

"Des Moines, Iowa. 
Saints here enjoyed perfect reception of wonderful message in 
broadcast. 

Mark Petersen." 

(A member of the Board of the Gene- 
logical Society of Utah.) 

"New York City. 
Stirring broadcast, unusual clarity, excellent quality. Congrega- 
tion listened in Manhattan Chapel. 

Roscoe A. Grover." 

An anthem, "The Lord is my Refuge," was sung by the Choir. 



PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that 
hope in the Lord. (Psalms 31:24.) 

A FAR-REACHING BROADCAST 

Before commenting upon the admonition expressed in this text, I 
desire to make brief reference to the Church-of-the-Air program ren- 
dered this morning. 

The first time that it was my privilege to stand on the brink of the 
Grand Canyon of the Colorado, I was overwhelmed with a sense that I 
was not comprehending the magnitude of that great gorge. I had learned 
that it was over a mile down to what appeared to be a little winding- 
stream, the mighty Colorado, and that the opposite wall was said to be 
13 miles away, but I could not comprehend the majesty and sublimity 
of that mighty chasm. I think I had a similar feeling this morning 
when I saw over 10,000 people participate in the Church of the Air. 
I tried to visualize the potential audience that listened to your congre- 
gational singing, for there were probably ten million people in that 
potential audience. I am sure I cannot comprehend the significance 
of that great service. One thing though is clearly defined in my mind, 
and that is this : That we have greater responsibility than ever to learn 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have greater tasks before 
us. The final work is not all done yet. You and I have the responsi- 
bility of taking advantage of these new and great opportunities to preach 
the Gospel, of making real new visions, and of bringing into the lives of 
Latter-day Saints and members of the world more blessed opportunities 
to know the way of truth. 

COURAGE GIVES STRENGTH 

We need courage to enter into those new realms ; we need courage 
to meet our present situations and conditions, and that is why I have 
chosen the text, "Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, 
all ye that hope in the Lord." 

In this promise are two principles that should be cherished by every 
truly religious man— faith and courage. What is implied in this text? 
We know with assurance that the Lord is keeping faith with his people ; 
therefore, let none despair, but take courage and their hope shall not be 
in vain. Faith in God, trust, confidence in our fellowmen, the courage 
of our convictions, will enable us eventually to achieve any righteous 
cause. Courage is that quality of the mind which meets danger or oppo- 
sition with calmness and firmness, which enables a man to face difficulties 
that lie in his pathway to righteous achievement. It is different from 
fortitude. Fortitude enables us to bear, endure ; fortitude is more of a 
feminine quality. Courage implies facing difficulties and overcoming 
them. He who is or should be the guide of our lives was the most 
courageous of all men. "In Jesus we find bravery at the best ; courage 
at its loftiest ; heroism at its climax." True heroism defends the right 
and faces disaster without cringing. In this regard the Savior was 
the personification of true courage and heroism. Illustrative of this 
I need only mention the cleansing of the temple ; or his fearlessly 
speaking the truth when his home folk turned him from Nazareth ; 
or when the five thousand in Capernaum was reduced to only twelve to 
whom he turned and said, "Will ye also go away?" Never once, how- 
ever, did the Master despair or turn from his destined course. This 
is the kind of courage we need in the world today 

A CRITICAL PERIOD 

During the last few years practically all the world has been passing 
through a critical period of depression. People in this intermountain 
region have been hit, in some respects, more severely than others. Mining, 
farming, and stock-raising are our principal industries. When the mines 
closed, many men were thrown out of employment. When the springs 
and rivers dried, products of farms shriveled and died. Price of cattle 
dropped below the cost of raising them. As a result many people are 
worried and disheartened. They have lost not only their farms or 
business interests, but their homes. Day by day men have vainly 
searched for honest work. After fruitless searching and inquiry, they 



PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 



59 



return home almost with bitterness in their hearts. Wives with a forti- 
tude sublime encourage their husbands even though it is more difficult 
for wives to struggle continually to keep up appearances, and to supply 
food and nourishment for their children. It is embarrassing to such 
men and women, accustomed to independence, comfortable living and 
even opulence, to accept help either from the government or the church. 
What, then, shall we do? 

A RETURN TO THE FARM ADVISED 

With resolute hearts, with courage to meet disaster with a smile, 
let us accept conditions as they are, rebuild, and with united effort regain 
financial and economic independence. A recent survey of the conditions 
in the Church indicates that 3,200 farms have been abandoned within 
the last few years. That means that thousands of people have been 
deprived of that source of income and sustenance. With promise of 
ample water for the coming year, let us go back to these farms, retill 
them, and at least produce sufficient for our own needs. I know what 
some of you are thinking — that you cannot make farms pay, that you 
left them because you got only 4c a gallon for your milk, 50c a hundred 
for your potatoes, 60c a hundred for your wheat, and so on to a discour- 
aging limit. 

Well we cannot go on this way always. Dr. Widtsoe expressed 
a profound truth last night in the Priesthood meeting when he said, 
"No country can prosper unless the men who till the soil succeed." I 
do not know of anything else that we can do. We haven't sufficient 
factories to employ people who are out of work, the mines are not running 
to capacity. We can go back and with help to buy a few cattle and 
some horses, we can retill our farms. Here in this intermountain country 
we have a great obligation. The eyes of the world are turned toward 
us, not only because of the message we have, but because there are scenic 
wonders here which attract men from far and near. When they drive 
past our farms and our houses, they should see the houses painted, 
the farms properly tilled and the weeds along the road cut. In this we 
have a bounden duty that travelers might see evidence of neatness, thrift 
and industry, fundamental principles of the Latter-day Saints. In these 
efforts toward rehabilitation all must cooperate. Let the amount of 
money that is being given as a dole apply on the purchase of a team, 
a cow, chickens or implements, and thus enable men and women 
to get back to a life of independence. Here is one field of endeavor 
in which I think our hearts need strengthening, and in which we can 
manifest that courage and quality of mind which will enable us to meet 
difficulties that are ahead. 

FAITHFULNESS TO DUTY 

Another way in which we can manifest true courage, and thus 
bring the blessing of God upon us, is in the faithful performance of 
duty. This is one of the best ways for a Latter-day Saint to keep his soul 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sweet. No matter where, let him perform his duty honestly, consci- 
entiously. 

Do your duty, that is best, 
Leave unto the Lord the rest. 

STEADYING THE ARK 

In so doing, let us not interfere with another who is doing something 
in a different place. It is a little dangerous for us to go out of our own 
sphere and try unauthoritatively to direct the efforts of a brother. You 
remember the case of Uzzah who stretched forth his hand to steady the 
ark. He seemed justified when the oxen stumbled in putting forth his 
hand to steady that symbol of the covenant. We today think his punish- 
ment was very severe. Be that as it may, the incident conveys a lesson 
of life. Let us look around us and see how quickly men who attempt 
unauthoritatively to steady the ark die spiritually. Their souls become 
embittered, their minds distorted, their judgment faulty, and their spirit 
depressed. Such is the pitiable condition of men who, neglecting their 
own responsibilities, spend their time in finding fault with others. The 
truly courageous heart will say: 

Let me but do my work from day to day, 
In field or forest, at the desk or loom ; 
In roaring market place or tranquil room ; 
Let me but find it in my heart to say. 
When vagrant wishes beckon me astray, 
"This is my work ; my blessing, not my doom. 
Of all who live, I am the one by whom 
This work can best be done in the right way." 
Then shall I see it not too great nor small, 
To suit my spirit and to prove my powers ; 
Then shall I cheerful greet the laboring hours, 
And cheerful turn when the long shadows fall 
At eventide, to play and love and rest, 
Because I know for me my work is best. 

I am referring to the work in the Church, not one member of which 
who hasn't something to do even though it be only to attend to his 
quorum, auxiliary, and sacrament meetings. Whatever the duty let us 
do it faithfully and well. 

MAINTAINING IDEALS 

Courage to maintain our ideals is another field in which we can 
manifest courage, and merit the approval of God in whom we trust. 
These are times when men should keep their heads, and not be swept 
from their moorings by every will-o'-the-wisp theory that is offered as 
a panacea of our present ills. The times call for courageous youth 
to hold aloft the moral standard. In that field we can find the truest 
moral courage. It is said that heroism is concentrated courage. Well 
our greatest heroes are not always found on the battle field. I think we 
find them also among our youth. Young men and young women who, 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



61 



when put in social groups, will stand up fearlessly and denounce those 
things which we know sap the character, the very life energy of youth. 
"Never was there a time in the history of the world," says Mark Hop- 
kins, "when moral heroes were more needed. The world waits for such. 
The providence of God has commanded science to labor and prepare the 
way for such. For them she is laying her iron tracks, and stretching her 
wires, and bridging the oceans. But where are they ? Who shall breathe 
into our civil and political relations the breath of a higher life ?" "The 
most important thing in the world," says a great scientist, "is not the 
discovery of Galileo, Faraday, and others, but a belief in the reality of 
moral and spiritual values." I appeal to youth to be courageous in 
maintaining the moral and spiritual values of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
After all, "What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and 
lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?" 

COURAGE IN FACING DIFFICULTIES 

With faith in an over-ruling power, in the personal, intimate pro- 
tection of our Father — and we like to consider him such, a loving 
Father — let us face our difficulties with courage. 

We are not here to play, to dream, to drift, 
We have hard work to do, and loads to lift, 
Shun not the struggle; face it. 
'Tis God's gift. 

Say not the days are evil — who's to blame? 
And fold the hands and acquiesce — 
O shame ! 

Stand up, speak out, and bravely, in God's name ! 
Be Strong! 

It matters not how deep entrenched the wrong, 
How hard the battle goes, the day, how long. 
Faint not, fight on ! Tomorrow 
Comes the song. 

Brethren and sisters, "be of good courage, and he will strengthen 
your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord." God give us power so to do, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, I stand before you again, requesting that 
while I am before you I may have your faith and your prayers in my 
behalf, that I may be able to say something which shall be encouraging 
and comforting. 

I hope the choir will pardon me if I again tell them how much I have 
enjoyed their music ; likewise the wonderful choir from Hyrum yesterday.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AN IMPORTANT LESSON EXEMPLIFIED 

It seems to me I see improvement from time to time in the work 
of our own choir. I think I have never heard a better chorus, to my 
untrained ear, than they gave us this morning in : "Say Watchman, What 
of the Night?" 

I look at the choir as the Tabernacle Choir mission, and I enjoy 
meeting with them on these occasions semi-annually. The concerts which 
they give Sunday mornings, the broadcasts, are a real lesson to the 
whole Church, a lesson in precision, in punctuality, in devotion, a lesson 
in achievement. With them there can be no such false doctrine as, 
"Well, this isn't so very good, but it will do." 

The only way in which any of us can live in accordance with the 
commandments of the Lord and do our duty as it should be done is this : 
Every task that comes to us, no matter how little or how great it may 
seem to be, calls for — demands — the best effort which it is possible for 
us to exert. Every one, no matter who he may be, who works on the 
theory that there are some things in life that are not worth his best 
effort, and who accordingly slights his work, will never be truly suc- 
cessful. So this choir gives to us a great lesson — to the Church, and to 
every other mission of the Church. 

Christ's message a spiritual one 

Today is the conventional anniversary of the day on which the 
Savior, beginning the last week of his mortal life, entered Jerusalem and 
was proclaimed king of the Jews. This is Palm Sunday. 

When the Savior came in through the gates of Jerusalem and moved 
on, on the lowly ass, to the temple, people looked to him and expected 
from him an announcement that he was the promised king for whom 
the Jews were looking. They expected him to proclaim himself a 
political power. I assume they did not know that more than three years 
before this time Satan himself had taken Christ upon the high mountain 
and had offered to him the kingdoms of the world if he would bow 
down and worship Satan, and that the Savior pushed this crown aside. 
The Jews, groaning under oppression, smarting under political suppres- 
sion, thought that he came to give them a political life. 

But such was not his mission. And as the week wore away and 
he finished his earthly mission, there came unto the multitudes of Jeru- 
salem a feeling that they had been disappointed, perhaps misled. The 
Savior's entire mission — read it, brothers and sisters, with care — was 
devoted to the spiritual side of life and to the relieving of human 
suffering, physical and mental. Only on three occasions did the Savior 
ever furnish food : once to the multitude of five thousand ; a very short 
time thereafter to the multitude of four thousand ; and lastly, after his 
resurrection he fed the Apostles on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. 
His message, my brothers and sisters, is a spiritual message. It is a 
message for the relief of human suffering, for the comfort, the consola- 
tion, and the exaltation of the human soul. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 63 



COMFORT IN DISTRESS THROUGH SPIRITUAL ENRICHMENT 

And that message, as Isaiah said, is so simple that "the wayfaring 
men, though fools, shall not err therein." It is so simple, so easy to 
understand, that the poorest of us may have a complete comprehension 
of all that is necessary for our spiritual welfare. 

It is in this message, and from the Savior himself, that we are to 
get comfort and consolation in these times of stress. If we who are 
spiritually poor were given of the abundance of life, we still, in these 
times, should be dissatisfied, because greed would still gnaw at our 
hearts. We should still be seeking after the things of the world. We 
should still be ambitious and thirsting for power; and wherever those 
base qualities enter into the minds and the hearts of men, they bring 
grief and sorrow. They do not ennoble ; they do not bring satisfaction 
and contentment; nor do they bring to us joy. 

SEEK AFTER THE ERRING ONES 

There are among us, my brothers and sisters, men and women 
who have become discouraged, men and women who are straying 
away from the paths of truth. They need your help and mine. 
We may not simply sit idle and say: "Here are the principles, 
take them or leave them." It is the duty of each and every one of us, 
wherever we find the brother or the sister wandering aside from the 
straight and the narrow road, to go to that brother and that sister, and in 
humility, unselfishness, and righteousness try to bring him or her back 
into the fold. 

There are a number of heresies which today are abroad in the land. 
Mind they do not mislead you. When I say heresies, I am speaking of 
heresies in the matter of the Church, its doctrine and its government. 
Where you find brothers and sisters not understanding the true order, 
seek kindly and in a brotherly way to explain it to them and bring 
them back into the right path. If they are falsifying, teach them the 
error of their falsehood. Try to make them see that falsehood comes 
from the evil one. 

FALSEHOOD AND DECEPTION FROM THE EVIL ONE 

The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph, in connection with the 
revelation given after the loss of the manuscript by Martin Harris, 
principles regarding falsehoods and falsifying which are applicable at all 
times. 

I am reading from Section 10 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that 
ye may destroy; behold, this is no harm. . . . 

You see, he is giving us the representations which Satan makes to 
the people 

And thus he flattereth them, 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



(that is Satan) 

. . . and telleth them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch 
a man in a lie, that they may destroy him. 

And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along until he draggeth 
their souls down to hell ; and thus he causeth them to catch themselves 
in their own snare. 

And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to 
destroy the souls of men. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto him that lieth to deceive 
because he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt 
from the justice of God. 

LAWS OF THE LAND SHOULD BE OBEYED 

Another heresy that is among the people has to do with obedience 
to the law of the land. And I read from Section 58 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants: 

Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws 
of God hath no need to break the laws of the land. 

Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose 
right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet. 

DAILY REVELATIONS NOT NECESSARY 

Another heresy to which I wish to refer. Some of us sometimes 
appear to look for daily revelations to teach us how and what to do. 
This was so in the early days of the Church. When the Lord placed 
man upon the earth he set up certain general laws, fundamental prin- 
ciples, and then permitted man to develop himself within those laws 
and those principles. If he undertook to tell us each time what we were 
to do in every detail — and the saints of the early days of the Church 
thought, as I have stated, that he should do so, and the Lord reproved 
them for it — two things would happen. In the first place we would 
virtually destroy the free agency of man, the foundation stone upon 
which all of our existence is built. And in the second place we should 
be under great condemnation if the Lord had to reveal to us his will 
and then we failed to follow it. 

Quoting again from Section 58, the Lord said : 

For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things ; for 
he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise 
servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. 

Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and 
do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteous- 
ness ; 

For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. 
And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth 
a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, 
the same is damned. 

Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless 
that obeys not my commandments? 

Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled ? 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



65 



I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the 
blessing. 

Then they say in their hearts : This is not the work of the Lord, for 
his promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward 
lurketh beneath; and not from above. 

"love thy neighbor" 

It is the duty of each Latter-day Saint living his religion and 
observing the laws of the Lord, living the principles of the Gospel, to try 
to lead back into the ways of righteousness and life those who for the 
moment have permitted the light to burn low, so low that they stumble 
in the way, not seeing the pitfalls that are ahead of them. 

We may not, my brothers and sisters, think that merely by our- 
selves living we are doing our full duty. We must go beyond this. We 
must help our brother. "Love thy neighbor as thyself," the Lord said 
was one of the great commandments. 

May the Lord give us his blessing, enable us to understand his will, 
enable us to live as we should live, strengthen our testimony, give us 
the spirit of forgiveness, the spirit of truth, that we may not only save 
ourselves but help to save others, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the 
Man who Communed with Jehovah," after which the Choir sang an 
anthem, "Like a Choir of Mighty Angels." 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I wish to take for my text this afternoon, the words of the prophet 
Isaiah, wherein he says : 

For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth 
the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord will cause 
righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. 

The ancient prophet of Israel was undoubtedly looking toward the 
future of his own people when he uttered these words; he was also 
noting the righteousness of all nations of the future as they looked 
to God for wisdom and divine direction. His words may be well 
listened to today by the people of our own nation, for the Lord will yet 
cause righteousness to spring forth in this our land. 

The government of the United States has passed through many 
crises since the adoption of the Constitution in 1787. The one hundred 
and forty-seven years of our national existence have witnessed times 
of serious political struggles; periods of social and economic strife 
and unrest. The World War left the nations of the world with intricate 
problems. The largest armies of all history had marched to battle, and 
nations were put to the test of preserving their integrity. Kings and 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



emperors were dethroned; governments were overthrown, and political 
life came to be anything but the thoughtful study of the science of 
government. In our own country particularly, laws have been enacted 
by state legislatures and Congress that have little bearing on the economic 
and social questions of the day, and as a result, we are lost in a veritable 
chaos of laws that are never enforced, and which have helped to bring 
about a disregard for law and order. 

The present hour witnesses a crisis, the like of which we have 
never known before in our history. The fine morale of the nation has 
been broken, and this has brought about a condition of bitterness and 
hate, for people have lost their regard for the power of government and 
for the sanctity of the law. Envy and jealousy, and hate of neighbor 
for neighbor have crowded out our nobler altruistic feelings. Groups 
of men, unmindful of human rights, are clamoring for changes in our 
government. Our resources are being wasted. The looting of the 
public wealth has become a recognized industry, and the men who prac- 
tice it are as highly trained as men in the skilled employments and 
professions. The sorrowful thing is that these men are entrenched 
behind the walls of political trickery. One of the greatest plagues 
today is the disregard for authority and law in government, and there 
is growing up in our social world an aversion toward hard work. Can 
it be that modern thought is discarding the influence of Providence in 
the affairs of men? The truth that government is instituted by the 
hand of God was uppermost in the minds of our forebears when the 
Constitution was formulated ; this thought inspired the very lives of 
Washington and Lincoln; and Jesus Christ our Lord taught us that 
governments without the spirit of humble faith in the Master, cannot 
live. 

The Declaration of Independence expresses the power of the Creator 
in three different places, and in words that speak of the divine in man. 
It says : 

We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created 
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable 
rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

This document and the -Constitution of our country in their very 
spirit recognize the divine truth that government should be the expression 
of all that is noblest and true in the life of man. In the settlements 
of the frontiers of America, groups of religious men carried the spirit 
of religion into ■ the unconquered lands, and the very fabric of our 
government was made up of many beliefs in the ways of providence. 
America for this reason has a rich background of the ideals of human 
liberty. All through our history the people have held to the belief 
in the divine guidance of the Master. Yet when we weigh the influence 
of social conditions today, we may well fear that we are slowly discarding 
our faith in the directive hand of an all-wise providence. Can there 
be any nobler truth than that the Lord does rule in the affairs of men? 
Is his power not seen in the onward march of civilization? Yet are we 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



67 



coming to the destructive belief that man and not God must ultimately 
rule in the affairs of man. Is the wisdom of man the only power that will 
solve our problems ? At times, such a thought was prevalent in the days 
of ancient Israel, but the Lord through his prophets guided Israel, and 
we have Isaiah saying: 

For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth 
the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord will cause 
righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. 

The question, then: "Whither are we going?" is a reasonable one. 

Many of the panaceas that we hear of on every hand will not 
solve our problems. Would that we might have some of the old time 
religious strength back again! The old Puritan idealism of our pioneer 
parents was hard and stern at times, but those men and women of early 
days knew that they must not waste their vital, energies on profitless 
adventures. They were men of self-discipline, and they taught their 
children to hold themselves aloof from the moral degenerations that 
would sap the strength of life. 

The youth of today have a magnificent vitality, but Dr. Glen Frank 
has pointed out that "if there is a central weakness at the heart of this 
vitality, it is that youth is blind to the necessity of conserving its vital 
energies." What the youth of America needs is the husbanding of 
vital energies by the cultivation of clean habits, which alone "make 
intelligence and intensity of application possible and productive." All 
this is another way of saying that "education rightly conceived contributes 
to a religion of maturity. While it is vital that we keep Church and 
State apart, a divorce between education and religion will be fatal to 
our national life." 

We all must discover the beauties of the inner light, which is the 
divine gift of God to man. It is the divine spirit that really makes life 
fine and noble. Our government can only live as it produces good 
citizens who know that the Golden Rule is still golden, and that the 
Sermon on the Mount and the Ten Commandments are still the guiding 
forces of morality both for the individual and for society. Robert 
Louis Stevenson uses an expression in one of his essays that has a 
forceful meaning. He says that we must put into our thinking more of 
what he calls the "purple." To solve our problems, we must have that 
fine discernment of issues that give us simplicity instead of confusion. 
What care we if that solution comes by way of the street or the school. 
"Wisdom is justified of all of her children." The home, the church, 
and the state must teach the greater sacrifice and the higher laws. So 
let the search for truth go on, but let brotherly righteousness have its 
day among us as we search for truth. 

Every reform must be vested with sacredness, and a nation that is 
great is not incompatible with righteousness. The spirit of progress 
and nationality must be related to the divine purposes. There is a call 
of God to the nations as well as there is to men. The nation which 
has the bravest, the most trustworthy, the most thoroughly developed 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



conscience will have the right of way in the onward march of civilization. 
"Open ye the gates," runs a joyous prophecy, "that the righteous nation 
which keepeth the truth may enter in." How majestically true is one 
of our teachings as we have it from the prophet Joseph Smith, when 
he wrote: 

We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit 
of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation 
to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and 
safety of society. 

The tendency to rule God out of the affairs of life is a tragic thing. 
Why should he not make his habitation wherever men build their homes, 
and do their work, and fight their battles? The American people in the 
beginning stood committed to a serious business, and that was to establish 
a free government among all its citizenry. This ideal had deep meaning. 
It was the greatest experiment in government in all history, and the 
basis of it was the Constitution of the United States. It made of our 
nation the keeper and exponent of the great ideas and ideals of the 
world. Thus America has contributed mightily to the spiritual forces 
of the world, and it has given a new conception to all peoples of Christ 
and his mission. It has said to every man and woman: "You are a 
child of God. Enter. We will do our best. There shall be no king. 
There shall be no subject. There shall be no master. There shall be 
no slave." This is one of the gifts of the Father of us all. It is not 
gold, nor silver, nor fame which makes success. "It is truth, honor, 
and justice. It is faith, hope, and love." "It is," as an old French 
writer once said, "on the virtues of mankind and the freedom of man- 
kind that the future of mankind is to be builded." 

What we need today is a group of high-souled men, men of vision 
and high morals, to put our nation in order, and to bring back that 
old-fashioned conscience of the nation, which recognizes the fact that 
the highest laws are the laws of God. Every man should put himself 
clearly and openly into some relationship of responsibility, for we are 
today beset with the mob spirit, which always acts apart from the 
organization of government. This is why the mob spirit is wrong. We 
should honor our past in the present; our dead in the living. What I 
want to hold up before us all is the conscience of our nation and govern- 
ment. Moral integrity, moral purposes, moral restraint are the neces- 
sities of the hour. If these things can be brought about, the nations 
of the world will have this to say of us: "Surely this great nation 
is a wise and understanding people." Ideals must be established in the 
minds of the rising generation. While we realize that the age in which 
we live is new, the youth will never find anything more true and noble 
than the spirit of pioneer America, when the first impulse was the joy 
of enterprise, initiative, and newly awakened powers. Honesty of pur- 
pose must be re-established; honesty of endeavor, honesty of word, 
honesty in our relationship with our fellow-men. "Look unto the rock, 
whence ye are hewn," wrote Isaiah of old ; and Solomon in his wisdom 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



69 



said: "Remove not the ancient land-mark, which thy fathers have set." 

We must hark back to the finer fundamentals of life, we must make 
every law and principle of right effective in our very lives. The end 
of the State is not to live, but to live nobly, and this can only be done 
as we realize the truth of truths, that the teachings of the Master must 
become the guiding stars of our lives. "For as the earth bringeth forth 
her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring 
forth ; so the Lord will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth 
before all the nations." 

I pray that we American people may see anew the importance of 
justice and truth, and that we may rise above the ignorance and degraded 
politics of the present, and come into the light of the new day; andi 
dedicate our lives to more glorious purposes : to the will of the Master, 
to the purposes of our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, a feeling akin to awe comes today as never 
before in the history of the world to any person who occupies this 
position. He speaks to thousands of his fellowmen, facing them; he 
speaks to thousands who listen in on the radio ; he speaks into space, for 
the radio waves never die — they enter the remotest corner of the uni- 
verse — they speak to eternity. That is a solemn thought. 

IN FULFILMENT OF ANCIENT PROPHECY 

I suppose we all had that thought this forenoon when we were 
listening to the wonderful broadcast of the Presidency to all the world. 
With the coming of television, with the possession of radio, it seems 
that the fulfilment of the prophecy of old is near at hand: "There 
is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not be penetrated." 

I enjoyed the message of our President yesterday, a message of 
gratitude because of the growth of the Church. Zion is growing, he 
said, and we all rejoice. It is not a selfish joy, for while we rejoice 
that we are spreading abroad and succeeding, we rejoice more that be- 
cause of that spreading we shall be able to serve better our fellowman. 
This great Latter-day cause is not for us alone. Our mission is to all 
the world. And every gain that we make must be used for the benefit 
of our fellowman. 

A COURAGEOUS EXPERIMENT 

May I for a few moments direct your minds to some thoughts of 
mine in connection with the work that I have been doing the last few 
months? I have been engaged in a direct, positive experiment to solve 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



some of the social and economic ills that have been talked about today 
and yesterday in this conference. I have had the privilege of teaching 
Mormonism, the principles, practice, and history of it, to university 
classes for university credit — as if the subject were one of the recognized 
university subjects. It has been a rare opportunity. Four other churches 
have had the same privilege. It is a courageous experiment undertaken 
by the University of Southern California. The reason for undertaking 
this experiment is simple enough. Thinking men have come to the 
conclusion that there is only one way out of our difficulties in this 
country and throughout the world. No plan made by congress or by 
private individuals for economic and social recovery will succeed except 
upon the basis of the acceptance of religion. By the acceptance and 
practice of spiritual truth alone shall we find our way back to economic 
stability and social happiness. 

TEACHING RELIGION IN THE SCHOOLS 

We have attempted at the University of Southern California this 
winter to teach religion, living religion, followed by large groups of living 
people, to those who have cared to listen, in the hope that thereby they 
might be made better citizens than they otherwise could be and that they 
would go out to contribute to the solution of our national and inter- 
national difficulties. Our nation, as we know, is today a school-made 
nation. The schools are making our citizens. The school has made most 
of us who are here today. The schools are training our children for 
life's activities ; and as the schools teach, as the schools direct the thinking 
of our young people, so our nation will become, indeed has become. 

It is a curious fact that a child, an American child, may go through 
the elementary schools, compelled to do so by the law, may go through 
high school, may go through the state college and university and never 
hear the name of God mentioned nor take any subject of study telling 
him how he shall conduct himself in life. Character — we all admit the 
importance of it — is practically forgotten in the curriculum of the schools 
of the United States. Thinkers talk about it, there is much said about it 
on the public platform, but little is done about it. 

THE PLACE OF CHARACTER IN EDUCATION 

It is for that reason that the university with which I have been 
associated the last few months has had the courage to say, "We will 
raise religion to academic dignity. We will give it a place in the sun, 
in the educational sun, that thereby we may help change the thinking 
and improve the conscience, as Professor Young has just said, of the 
people of this great country. It has been said that there is no substitute 
for character. Character is the thing that makes us do certain things. 
Our conduct depends upon our character. Nevertheless, one great 
university president, the president of one of the great universities of 
America, said at a public meeting in my hearing, and later published the 
statement in pamphlet form, that the purpose of a university is to train 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 71 

men and women mentally and that character must be a by-product of 
education. We Latter-day Saints take just the opposite view, that the 
direct purpose of all life, of every life activity, of our schools in par- 
ticular, of all training and teaching institutions, must be the formation 
and development of a proper character. We do not accept the doctrine 
that character is a by-product of education. That doctrine, intolerable 
to Latter-day Saint understanding, has much to do with the social and 
economic chaos in which we find ourselves in this country at the present 
time. 

GOD AND MAN WHAT THEY ARE 

That is not all. Character may be built on ethics, on simple laws 
of human conduct to avoid offending our neighbor. We believe that an 
acceptable character must include, as Professor Young has stated, belief 
in the living God, a God of whose race we are. Here, again, we find a 
difficulty to be considered, at least by Latter-day Saints. I heard the 
leader of one of the greatest divinity schools in America, the trainer for 
a generation of time of the ministers of churches in America, say in 
so many words that man is but the product of cosmic forces, unknown 
forces, and that the word God is but a name for those cosmic forces, and 
nothing more. To Latter-day Saints God is a personage, the greatest 
intelligence in the universe, our spiritual Father. We are of his kind 
and we may approach nearer and nearer his likeness, if with all our 
might we live righteously throughout our eternal life. 

THE KIND OF CONCEPTS NEEDED TODAY 

We need to teach the youth of our Church and of the world the 
reality of the living God. Not only that, but that God lives in the unseen 
world, and that the unseen world is real. Into that unseen world we 
shall go some day, and there we shall find those who have gone before 
us. In course of time there will be a resurrection of the body, a reunion 
of the spirit and the body. There will come a judgment based upon our 
deeds. These are real concepts that America needs to understand and 
to accept and must understand and accept before peace can be fully 
restored in our economic and social life. The whole program of life 
is governed by law, according to a great plan in the mind of the Creator. 
He governs and directs all that happens on this earth. We can not 
defeat the purposes of the Almighty, though we may delay them through 
our stubbornness. A plan for human salvation has been laid out, and 
somehow the Lord through his power will see to it that his purposes 
fail not. "The God of Israel, he slumbers not nor sleeps." 

We need today to have the conception of God and the things of 
God that were given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery one hundred 
years ago last Friday, — I need not take the time to read it, but do ask 
you to read in Section 1 10 of the Doctrine and Covenants the description 
of God as given in poor human words by Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery. They tried to describe the glory of the personage who stood 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



before them — not a cosmic force, but a living being — who spoke to 
them with a voice like thunder. After he had gone others came, beings 
of the unseen world who had been upon this earth, who had lived here, 
who had gone into the spirit world and now were commissioned to come 
back to perform certain important tasks. They unrolled, as it were, 
the plan and purpose of human existence. 

That is the type of faith, with its applications to human conduct, 
that we try to teach to these special classes, in living religions, so far as 
I am able, at the University of Southern California. I think my 
colleagues serving other churches are doing the same as best they can. 
Our country needs that kind of instruction. 

OUR CHARACTER-TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS 

I trust that we Latter-day Saints are making good use of our Sunday 
Schools, Primaries, Mutual Improvement Associations, seminaries and 
institutes, since our public schools are not yet ready to give us the char- 
acter training that we need. Dare we, fathers and mothers, withhold 
such training from our children? And dare you, young people who 
are assembled here this afternoon, dare you avoid and deny yourselves 
the kind of training which in the end will determine your true success? 

God be with us, bless us in our attempts to bring righteousness into 
our lives and to serve God as he would desire us to serve him, I pray 
in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I trust that I may be permitted also to express my appreciation 
and gratitude for the services held here this morning. 

BEYOND COMPREHENSION 

I have been thinking of a remark made by an ancient prophet when 
he considered the great works of the Lord. He said : "Such knowledge 
is too wonderful for me; it is high. I cannot attain unto it." The 
broadcast we heard this morning is too wonderful for me. I do not 
comprehend it. Forty years ago I heard one of the members of the 
Council of the Twelve say the time would come when men would be 
able to converse from city to city without the aid of telephone wires. I 
believed him, but I looked upon that as something that was going to 
come in some future time, that I would not live to see. But I have seen 
it ; it is marvelous. I do not comprehend it, you do not, but thd virtue 
in it, the power and the force that may be used in the preaching of the 
Gospel and bringing to pass the purposes of the Lord are wonderful 
and also beyond our comprehension. 

The Lord declared that he would cut short his work in righteousness, 
and I can understand how that can be brought about. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 73 



I want to thank this choir for their integrity and faithfulness, their 
devotion to this cause. 

AN EVENT OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE 

And now I would like to enlarge somewhat upon a statement made 
by Elder Widtsoe, but mentioned by him incidentally. We witnessed 
this morning a demonstration as wonderful as anything we have ever 
seen. One hundred years ago last Friday there occurred another most 
wonderful event, the effects of which are being felt in every nation upon 
the face of the earth today. It was not a broadcast, no one knew of it 
except two men who stood, as we have heard, before the pulpit in the 
House of the Lord in the presence of the Son of God as he spoke ! to 
them. I am going to read one or two verses that he declared unto them 
on that occasion. 

For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; 
and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house. 

Yea, I will appear unto my servants, and speak unto them with mine 
own voice, if my people will keep my commandments, and do not pollute 
this holy house. 

Yea, the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly 
rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and the 
endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. 

And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this 
is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the 
heads of my people. Even so. Amen. (Doctrine and Covenants, 
110:7-10.) 

That which took place on the third day of April in the year 1836 
has spread forth to all lands. Thousands and tens of thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands have been blessed because of what took place 
upon that occasion. Not only the thousands in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, but thousands upon thousands who are not 
members of the Church have partaken of the blessings which came at that 
time and which have spread forth throughout the earth. And while they 
may not know it, they have been influenced, and have many of them 
performed a wonderful work because of the things that took place, and 
because of the fulfilment of this prediction made by the Son of God. 

KEYS OF GATHERING BESTOWED 

After this vision closed, we are informed that there was another 
vision. 

* * * the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared 
before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from 
the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the 
land of the north. (Id. 110:11.) 



Through the bestowal of those keys which were held by Moses and 
which were essential to the salvation of men and the success of the work 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Lord in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times in which we live, 
you people, who are here assembled, have been gathered. The word 
of the Lord has been carried to the nations, many of the honest have 
been gathered out and have come with their songs of everlasting joy 
to the House of the Lord and to Zion, to learn of his ways ; and that, 
if you please, through the restoration of the Gospel and the restoration 
of the keys held by the ancient prophet who held the keys of the Gath- 
ering of Israel. 

ELIAS AND HIS MISSION 

Then when this vision closed, another vision burst upon them : 

After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the 
gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after 
us should be blessed. (Id. 110:12.) 

This Elias was a prophet who lived in the days of Abraham and 
who held the keys of that dispensation. He came and bestowed the 
gifts and the blessings that were pronounced upon Abraham's head, and 
his posterity after him, and all that pertained to that dispensation, for 
in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times in which we live, all dispen- 
sations had to be revealed, all keys had to be restored, and hence the 
prophets of old, having the keys of dispensations had to come declaring 
their honors, their authority, the power of their priesthood. 

IN FULFILMENT OF PREDICTION 

Then came another glorious manifestation in fulfilment of the 
prediction made by the prophet Malachi some four hundred years before 
the birth of Christ. We read again: 

.... Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting 

death, stood before us, and said : 

Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth 

of Malachi — testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent before the great 

and dreadful day of the Lord come- 
To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children 

to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse — ■ 

Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your 

hands ; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the 

Lord is near, even at the doors. (Doctrine and Covenants 110:13-16.) 

Since the bestowal of these keys the work of salvation for the dead 
has been proclaimed, has taken hold of the hearts of the children of 
men, I say, both in the Church and out of it. There are thousands who 
are working in the gathering of the records of the dead, and why they 
do it they do not know. 

I asked one man in the city of Salem, Massachusetts, in the year 
1902 why he was gathering the records of the dead. He was undertaking 
a marvelous work. He said to me : "I do not know, but I got started 
and I cannot quit." I know why. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



JEWISH TRADITION REGARDING THE PASCHAL SEASON 

I want to call your attention to an incident which I think is of 
some importance. I am going to read to you a statement from Alfred 
Edersheim in his work "The Temple." Speaking of "The Paschal 
Feast and the Lord's Supper," he says : 

Jewish tradition has this curious conceit: that the most important 
events in Israel's history were connected with the Paschal season. Thus 
it is said to have been on the present Paschal night that, after his sacrifice, 
the "horror of darkness" fell upon Abraham when God revealed to him 
the future of his race. Similarly, it is supposed to have been at Passover 
time that the patriarch entertained his heavenly guests, that Sodom 
was destroyed and Lot escaped, and that the walls of Jericho fell before 
the Lord. More than that — the "cake of barley bread" seen in the dream 
which led to the destruction of Midian's hosts, had been prepared from 
the Omer, presented on the second day of the feast of unleavened bread ; 
just as at a later period alike the captains of Sennacherib and the king 
of Assyria, who tarried at Nob, were overtaken by the hand of God at the 
Passover season. It was at the Paschal time also that the mysterious 
handwriting appeared on the wall to declare Babylon's doom, and again 
at the Passover that Esther and the Jews fasted, and that wicked Haman 
perished. 

Now here is something of great significance : 

And so also in the last days it would be the Paschal night when the 
final judgment should come upon "Edom," and the glorious deliverance 
of Israel take place. Hence to this day, in every Jewish home, at a certain 
part of the Paschal service — the door is opened to admit Elijah the prophet 
as forerunner of the Messiah, while appropriate passages are at the same 
time read which foretell the destruction of all heathen nations. It is a 
remarkable coincidence that, in instituting his own Supper, the Lord Jesus 
connected the symbol, not of judgment, but of his dying love, with his 
"third cup." 

THE COMING OF ELIJAH 

It was, I am informed, on the third day of April, 1836, that the 
Jews, in their homes at the Paschal feast, opened their doors for Elijah 
to enter. On that very day Elijah did enter — not in the home of the 
Jews to partake of the Passover with them, but he appeared in the 
House of the Lord, erected to his name and received by the Lord in 
Kirtland, and there bestowed his keys to bring to pass the very things 
for which these Jews, assembled in their homes, were seeking. 

THE COMING OF THE LORD IS NEAR 

The day of the coming of the Lord is near. I do not know when. 
I am not looking, however, upon the coming of the Son of Man as I 
looked once upon the day when men would speak from city to city and 
throughout the land without the aid of wires, and would be heard, as 
something that may come in some far distant time, because I sincerely 
believe it will come in the very, day when some of us who are here today 
will be living upon the face of the earth. That day is close at hand. 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It behooves us as Latter-day Saints to set our houses in order, to keep 
the commandments of God, to turn from evil to righteousness if it is 
necessary, and serve the Lord in humility and faith and prayer. 

So I pray that we may do in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

THE PASSING OF JOHN W. HART 

Word has come to me that this morning at about 5 o'clock Presi- 
dent John W. Hart of the Rigby Stake of Zion, and for many years 
a member of the Auditing Committee of the Church, passed away due 
to a heart attack. 

Brother Hart was true, faithful and diligent from his youth to the 
time of his death. He was a pioneer in Idaho in early days when 
there was little but sagebrush to be seen as far as the eye could reach. 
He lived to erect one of our largest and finest stake houses, and was 
faithful to every duty and responsibility that rested upon him. 

When the fearful hardships of the depression came and the bank 
of which he was the president failed, he gave practically everything 
he had that the depositors should lose nothing. He was a God-fearing, 
faithful, true man. 

I want to endorse all the good things that have been said about the 
singing during this conference. 

The Choir sang The Hallelujah Chorus, from the "Messiah" (Han- 
del). 

Elder Archie R. Boyack, President of the Big Horn Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 :00 o'clock Monday morning, April 6. 



THIRD DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Monday morning, April 6, at 10 o'clock. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direction of Sister 
Charlotte O. Sackett, furnished the music for this session of the Con- 
ference. 

President Grant opened the meeting by announcing that the Choir 
and congregation would join in singing the hymn, "How Firm a Foun- 
dation." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Heber C. Williams, President of the North Sevier Stake. 
The Choir sang, "The Lord is My Shepherd." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



77 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Notwithstanding the anxiety I felt in having to address this large 
congregation, I am very happy today ; happy in my religion, having an 
absolute assurance of its truth, without any harassing doubts or fears. 
For this assurance and testimony, I am grateful beyond my power to 
express. 

"doers of the word, not hearers only" 

I should like, if possible, to say something on this occasion, in a very 
brief talk, that would stimulate faith and religious activity to some de- 
gree in the lives of the Latter-day Saints. As a people we are well taught 
in matters pertaining to our religion. What we most need is to be im- 
pressed with the necessity of doing as well as we know, of being "doers 
of the word, not hearers only, deceiving ourselves." If we were to do 
as well as we know, our salvation would be secure. I desire particularly 
at this time to emphasize the importance of observing the law of tithing, 
and the generous giving of fast offerings, as a potent factor in the scheme 
of man's salvation, and in support of the Church, and the work it is 
designed to accomplish. There is today an emergency in the land, a wide 
spread financial depression ; and the Church feels it keenly. Many of its 
members are without employment or other means of support and are 
dependent upon the Government, the Church, or other charitable insti- 
tutions for a subsistence for themselves and their families. The Church 
Authorities are concerned over this unfortunate condition. They would 
like to care for the faithful members who are in need of financial as- 
sistance ; but how this may be accomplished is a question which is giving 
them no little anxiety. 

The Lord has made provision in his Church to meet every emer- 
gency that might arise, provided, the members will do their part. If all 
the members had paid their fast offerings and their tithes in full since 
becoming members of the Church, there would have been sufficient means 
in the storehouse of the Lord to meet this oppressive emergency. 

AN EXAMPLE OF LOYALTY AND FAITHFULNESS 

■ There was a serious emergency, of a financial character, existing in 
the Church when Lorenzo Snow came to be its president. The proper- 
ties and moneys of the Church had been escheated and taken over by the 
United States Government, making it necessary for the Church to bor- 
row large sums of money, and later to bond the Church for means with 
which to carry on its current work. In due time these obligations had 
to be met. President Snow, acting under the inspiration of the Lord, 
and of his high calling, took with him certain members of the First 
Presidency and of the Twelve and, by team, went to St. George, and from 
there traveled north through Utah and into Idaho, holding meetings in 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the settlements on the way, appealing to the Saints to come to the relief 
of the Church in its time of financial distress by the faithful payment of 
their tithes and offerings. The people responded to the appeal to that 
extent that the bonds and other indebtedness of the Church were soon 
paid off and the Church was once more free from debt. 

OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO THE LORD 

If all the Saints of today were to pay a just and full tithe of their 
increase, and be liberal in the payment of their fast offerings, which we 
plead with them to do, the Church would be able to care for its needy 
members, that none would have to suffer. 

The Saints living in the days of President Snow set a good example 
of loyalty to Church authority and of obedience to the law of tithing. 
We should be as loyal and as faithful as were our forebears. Such faith- 
fulness makes for individual salvation and the welfare and progress of 
the work of the Lord. 

The Lord expects every member of his Church to do and to give for 
the carrying on of his work, according to the individual's ability and his 
means. Those who neglect to do their part will meet with serious dis- 
appointment in the end. 

A record of what tithing we have paid is kept in heaven, also of 
what we should have paid. The difference represents our indebtedness 
to the Lord. We should make the ledger to balance before finishing 
this life's labors. 

WORKING FOR THE LORD 

There are in the Church many business men and men of professions 
who have become spiritually inactive, their entire time being devoted to 
their business or profession. They could pay their tithing and by so 
doing be rendering valuable aid to every division of the work for which 
tithing is used. 

The Lord needs us in his work, and he needs our tithes and offer- 
ings ; and we need him every hour. 

The Lord had a job for me 

But I had so much to do 

I said, You get somebody else 

Or wait till I get through. 

I don't know how the Lord came out, 

No doubt he got along 

But I felt rather sneaking like, 

1 knew I'd done God wrong. 

One day I needed the Lord — 
Needed him right away; 
But he never answered me at all, 
And I could hear him saying 
Down in my accusing heart, 
Child, I've too much to do. 
You get somebody else, 
Or wait till I get through. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

Now when the Lord has a job for me, 

I never try to shirk, 

I drop what I have in hand, 

And do the Lord's good work. 

And my affairs may run along 

Or wait till I get through. 

Nobody else can do the work 

God has laid out for you. 

WE ARE HERE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE 

A story is told of a young man who was very desirous of getting an 
education. His parents were unable to send him to college, so he walked 
to the college city, and, after diligent inquiry, succeeded in finding a 
place where by chopping wood he could pay his board and lodgings. 
Later one of the college professors gave him a job cutting wood to pay 
for his tuition. Others, learning of his success as a wood chopper, em- 
ployed him to chop wood for them. He soon found that he had no time 
to go to college, and he became content with his success as a wood chopper. 
This represents a condition which obtains with many of us. 

We came to earth for a specific purpose — that of working out our 
own salvation, or in other words to prepare for the life which is to come, 
which is everlasting. Some of us seem to have forgotten the purpose 
we had in view, and to have become content with our search for the 
wealth and fame this life affords, — in other words, content with "chop- 
ping wood." 

FOR THE SALVATION OF MEN 

One might ask : Why all the activity we see .in the Church, in the 
ministry abroad, in the ministry at home, in the stakes and wards, in 
the priesthood quorums and auxiliary associations, in genealogy and 
temple work, in Church school and seminary work, etc. ? The answer 
might be briefly given thus: The salvation of man depends upon it. 
It is the work and glory of God to accomplish the salvation of his 
children, by the plan of the Gospel which he has revealed. The 
religious activities seen in the Church and in which we are engaged 
are for the purpose, and are assisting the Lord in the noblest work, 
the most important service in which man may be engaged. If we 
be not called officially into the service, there are many things we 
can do of our own volition which will contribute to our own happiness 
and salvation and to the happiness and salvation of others. Napoleon 
Hill says : "Render some useful service each day, for which you do not 
expect any pay. This will bring you happiness such as people who work 
for pay only, never enjoy." 

A FULNESS OF JOY 

In II Nephi 2 :25 we read, "Adam fell that men might be ; and men 
are that they might have joy." To receive a fulness of joy here and here- 
after, as intended of the Lord, we must live the righteous Christ-like life ; 



80

and render effectual service to God and to our fellow men. The righteous 
life inspires love of God and of fellow men and opens the avenue of com- 
munication and help from the Lord, which is so necessary to success 
in effectual service. 

HAPPINESS THROUGH OBEDIENCE TO GOD'S WORD 

Another potent means of assisting the Church and the work of the 
Lord, and which is conducive to individual happiness and salvation, is to 
obey the word of the Lord wherein he has expressed his will by direct 
revelation, that we abstain from the excessive use of meat, and from the 
use of tea, coffee, tobacco and all intoxicating drinks. If the Latter-day 
Saints were to strictly observe this one revelation, as interpreted by the 
Church authorities, they would be a healthier, happier, and a more pros- 
perous people than they are today. They would have more money with 
which to pay their debts, and for tithes and offerings. The money paid 
for tea, coffee, tobacco and liquors goes, for the most part, out of the 
country I understand; and it means a tremendous drain which is felt 
directly or indirectly by a large percentage of the people. From every 
viewpoint it is unprofitable to violate the Word of Wisdom or any other 
word of the Lord. "Obedience is better than sacrifice ; to hearken than 
the fat of rams." 

I have tried in a brief way to emphasize the importance of paying 
an honest tithing and of being liberal in the giving of our offerings ; also, 
of rendering acceptable service to God and to our fellowmen. It is im- 
portant, also that we keep all the commandments of the Lord, and faith- 
fully do his will in all things. May the Lord help us so to do. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

Yesterday we listened to the members of the Presidency of the 
Church preaching, over a great broadcast, the Gospel of Jesus Christ to 
the children of men. The extent to which their words reached I am not 
prepared to say, but as far as the broadcasting system carried, those who 
were able to listen heard the Gospel message. To me it was a wonderful 
thing and I am sure that all those who are here attending this conference 
must have been convinced that the Lord is continuing to build construc- 
tively in the earth and that his Church is making progress and is grow- 
ing rapidly. 

I think that not before have the songs of Zion been sung by the entire 
congregation from this building over the broadcasting system of the 
nation. This Tabernacle is naturally made for such an event. I almost 
wish that I could have heard the rendition from some far distant point, 
for the thousands of voices must have gone over the air with fine effect. 

When Brigham Young, under the direction of the Lord, planned this 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



81 



building, I am sure he thought little about such a feature as we have just 
witnessed. It is doubtful if he could see at that time what might and 
would happen, how the word of the Lord could be preached from these 
mountains to all parts of the world. 

I wonder if those men who so carefully laid the great Gospel plan 
in foreign lands had a vision of such things in the beginning of their 
work. My mind recalls an experience that we are told President Wilf ord 
Woodruff had when he was in England, preaching the Gospel, building 
up the Church, and gathering members to this country. He listened con- 
stantly to the Spirit of the Lord. A great missionary was he, as we all 
know from reading his history. One day he felt impressed to go south, 
and it is said that he boarded a conveyance and rode south eighty miles, 
when he felt impressed to stop. He got off the conveyance and began 
to work in that vicinity, and as a result he gathered some eight hundred 
members of the Church in that part of England. Practically all of them 
came to Zion. 

Thus were his labors and the labors of others of the early mission- 
aries mightily blessed. Through their preaching they reaped a rich har- 
vest of souls. Today the elders in the field are giving just as faithful 
service and bearing just as fervent testimonies, but new methods are 
employed and new agencies are introduced to carry the Gospel to the 
nations. 

The Lord can do his work only as men and women will apply them- 
selves ; he does it through his servants in the earth ; he directs his work 
through all the members of the Church who are willing to serve. If 
President Wilford Woodruff had not been listening, if his mind had not 
been in tune with the Lord, he never would have heard the whisper that 
came to him to go south to a certain place where he was told to get! off 
the stage and begin his work. His heart was in tune with God. 

Brigham Young's heart was in tune with God when he built this 
building and laid plans for one of the greatest things the world has ever 
seen. 

We read in the scriptures about the prophets of old who spoke of- 
the Gospel being preached from the mountain-tops, that the word of the 
Lord would go forth from there. How fully that prediction may yet be 
fulfilled ! No one can realize yet what may come as a result of it, how 
far-reaching it may be. A few years ago no one heard of the great 
broadcasting system that we have now among us. It was not even 
dreamed of. Yet how simple and easy it appears to be. 

The President of the Church, the Prophet of the Lord, the leader 
of Latter-day Israel and those who are associated with him, can now 
send the Gospel out over the world, telling it to the people, telling men 
and women of the beauty of it, of the great plan of our Father which 
was instituted for the purpose of reaching the hearts of the children of 
men. I do not know how others feel, but to me this experience was the 
greatest I have ever had — to hear the singing and the preaching, and to 
know that it was going, perhaps, to the farther ends of the earth. 

I was greatly impressed by that fine address by President Grant in 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the first session of this conference. It indicated the progress being made 
by the Church — a progress which has been marked from the beginning, 
so far as I am able to observe from reading and from personally witness- 
ing events. 

There has always been the call of the President, the preaching of the 
Gospel, the voice of the Lord unto the children of men. The Lord pleads 
with men, does everything under the shining sun to get men to believe. 
He calls men to preach the words that he gave while he was in the earth. 
He said upon one occasion : "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent 
me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." That was the word of the 
Lord, given by him as it came from his Father. He also said : 

Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will 
liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock : 

And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock. 

And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them 
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the 
sand : 

And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it. 

The Savior laid the plan of life and salvation in the earth. He taught 
it unto the children of men, and he gave his life for it. He revealed it 
anew in your day and mine ; he came unto the Prophet Joseph! Smith, 
and spoke unto him as one man speaks unto another. God our Eternal 
Father introduced the Son, and he laid the foundation upon which the 
children of men may build, upon which they may know whether this is the 
work of God or the work of men. He has given his word by prophets 
from then until now ; and especially during the past hundred years, has 
the Lord specifically spoken to men. What a marvelous thing is the 
history of this Church. 

There is no other such gathering in the earth as this assembly, there 
is no such relationship among men and women, as exists among Latter- 
day Saints, no such an organization far or near. And now, through 
the providence of God our Father, thousands of people who are not able 
to come here may hear the voices of the servants of the living God, and 
may know the powerful message that comes from those who are endowed 
from on high to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the people of God 
in the earth. 

When we think of the example that has been set by the leadership 
of this Church, the plan of government that has existed from the begin- 
ning, we cannot but appreciate the hand of the Lord in these things. The 
foundation that was laid by the Prophet and his associates has led 
thousands of others to build upon that same foundation. They are not 
swerved from their path; they know the voice of the risen Redeemer, 
and they obey it. 

The establishment of the people in these mountains, the organiza- 
tions of the Church in the stakes and wards, presided over by men of 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



83 



God, constitute the Church that our Eternal Father had in mind when his 
Son preached that it should be built upon a rock. These men are not 
swerved when the winds of adversity blow ; they know how to weather 
the storm. We find them always solidly and squarely established in the 
revelations of God our Father ; while, on the other hand, those who yield 
to temptation, who will not keep the commandments of God, are shaken 
as a reed in water, and many fall, because their foundation is not secure. 

This conference will be a great epoch in the history of this Church. 
The great anniversary today of the organization of the Church, the ex- 
periences of yesterday, and the inspirational sessions on Saturday add 
another great chapter to the program of God our Father by which men 
and women may know that those who are appointed to direct his affairs 
on the earth are at the helm, that they are watching over the flock, that 
they are constantly building and keeping in harmony and in tune with 
the work that has been established by our Father through the Prophet 
Joseph, who is a prophet of the living God, and was, and always will be. 
Those who have succeeded him were and are likewise prophets of God. 

May we remember the words we hear and carry them back to our 
people, I pray in Jesus' name, Amen. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I hope the Lord will give me words to express what is in my heart 
to say to you this morning. I desire to call your attention to the parable 
of the Master called the "Lost Sheep," which is recorded in the 15th 
Chapter of Luke. The chapter commences with the following words: 

Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. 
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth 
sinners, and eateth with them. 

And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 

What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, 
doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that 
which is lost, until he find it? 

And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neigh- 
bors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which 
was lost. 

I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner 
that repenteth. 

The sinners, and the publicans who were largely the officials of 
the Roman government and mostly tax gatherers, did not live up to the 
strict interpretation of the doctrines of the Pharisees. In my opinion, 
the Master in giving this parable to the scribes and Pharisees intended 
to impress them with the necessity of looking after their lost sheep, 
the publicans and sinners. 

The use of parables was common among Jewish teachers. Jesus 
was but following the custom of the time in using a descriptive allegory 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



founded on a real scene or event such as occurs in nature and human 
life, with a moral or religious application. The Master's parables were 
simple and effective. He talked in the language of the people. When 
in wheat fields he spoke of wheat and tares and the mustard seed. When 
on the shores of the sea of Galilee, he spoke of fish. When in Judea 
he spoke of sheep. 

A flock of sheep usually numbered one hundred. The shepherd 
is portrayed as leaving the ninety and nine, safely in the fold, while he 
went in search of the one that had strayed. He rejoiced in finding it. 
When he returned home, he called together his friends and neighbors, 
and asked them to rejoice with him, for he had found his sheep which 
was lost. 

The Master discloses the real purpose of this parable when he said : 
"And I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner 
that repenteth." He brings to our attention the duty of servants of 
the Master in all ages. The Master deemed it of great importance to go 
after those who had strayed from the fold of Christ. There is need for 
the application of this parable in our day. 

One of the objectives of the Church is to perfect the lives of those 
who have accepted the truth. This is a great responsibility. There are 
among us in every ward and stake in the Church, members who have 
become indifferent to the teachings of the Gospel and who for one reason 
or another absent themselves from quorum and sacrament meetings. 
Recently I examined the records of the Church and was alarmed to 
find that these missing sheep had increased by 5000 last year. It is our 
duty to do everything possible to bring them back into active participation 
in the Church. We are our "brother's keeper" and should feel keenly 
this trust. These neglectful members should be visited and labored 
with, with all diligence and with patience. They should be encouraged 
and again brought to see and understand the beauties of the Gospel and 
the benefits of active Church membership. 

I recently heard of an individual who was indignant when asked 
some questions about his salvation. He had not objected to the brakeman 
on the train asking where he was going. He felt the brakeman inquired 
of him in order to save him from a possible mistake. The man who 
asked about his salvation had the same motive, only the case was a great 
deal more serious. Yes, some you will visit will not take kindly at 
first to your interest in them, but if labored with perseveringly and in all 
meekness, they will later call you blessed. 

A mother of several boys had difficulty in getting her boys to keep 
neat and tidy and she had to give them personal inspection before they 
left for school. She realized that they had neglected to look at them- 
selves in the mirror. She hung a beautiful mirror in the front hall, 
where they could not help but note their appearance. She now has no 
need to inspect them, for the glass tells them how they look. For after 
all, the mother added sagely, "I think one of the principal steps toward 
reforming people is to get them to look at themselves." With tact and 
understanding, can we help these indifferent members to see themselves 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



85 



as others see them and through our earnest efforts and kindliness bring 
them back into service in the Church? 

Are we as officers of the priesthood quorums of the Church doing 
our full duty in encouraging neglectful members to attend their meetings ? 
Are ward teachers taking their responsibility seriously and with kindness 
and tact endeavoring to bring disinterested members back to activity 
in the Church? As Bishops who preside over the Aaronic Priesthood 
of the wards, are you watching so carefully over your flock that none 
in the future will be lost or go astray ? Are you making a conscientious 
effort to bring back those men and boys holding an office in the Aaronic 
Priesthood, who because of indifference, lack of home training or the 
allurements of the world, have drifted away? It is our duty to labor 
with them persistently and bring them back into the fold. Are the 
auxiliary officers of the Church giving attention to those who should be 
enrolled as members of their organizations? As individuals, are we 
taking a brotherly, sisterly or neighborly interest in those about us who 
do not enjoy the full benefits and blessings which the Church extends 
to its active and faithful members? 

Are these members grateful for your interest in them? Let me 
cite to you some cases which have come to my personal attention. To 
my office came a man, who for twenty years had done nothing in the 
Church. Through the missionary work of the Bishop of that ward, 
this man was brought back to service in the Church. He realized the 
many years he had lost. As he stood outside the Logan Temple, with 
his wife and children, having had them sealed to him that day, he said, 
his heart full to overflowing: "I wish my Bishop had given a little 
attention to me when I was a lad." 

I was deeply impressed with the story of a man in one of the stakes 
of Zion at a stake conference. He stated that through the insistence 
of the members of his quorum, he was urged to attend his meetings. At 
first he was reluctant. Then, since they wanted him to come so much, 
he decided to please them. He became interested and active, and now 
has a renewal of his testimony of the Gospel. He has taken his wife and 
children to the temple. His heart is filled with gratitude because the 
members of his quorum had interested themselves in him and labored 
with him and brought him back into church activity. There were tears 
in his eyes as he told of his joy. 

The Master said there was great rejoicing over one who repenteth. 
There are three who rejoice, when, figuratively speaking, a sheep which 
has strayed is brought back to the fold : the individual who has strayed 
away, he who is responsible for his reclamation and "likewise there 
shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth." 

In this day, hear the word of the Lord regarding the worth of 
souls, and the joy of bringing souls unto him ; as recorded in the 18th 
Section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and which was men- 
tioned by President Grant in his opening address : 

Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; 

For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and 
come unto him. 

And he hath risen from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on conditions of repentance. 

And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth! 

Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall 
be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! 

And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if 
you should bring many souls unto me! 

I sincerely plead with you to give this matter of the indifferent 
members of the Church serious reflection and attention. Whether it be 
friend, neighbor or relative, by long-suffering, meekness and patience, 
win their respect and love and help them to again see the beauties of 
the Gospel. Bring them back into the fold that they might again enjoy 
the blessings of the Gospel and be numbered actively with the Church 
of Christ. 

To those of you who are within the sound of my voice who may have 
become indifferent to the teachings of the Church, I urge you to take 
inventory of yourselves this day. Consider where your course in life 
is taking you. Is it bringing you happiness and contentment and peace 
of soul such as does the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or is it bringing you 
only passing pleasures? Are your hearts set upon the things of this 
world, the money, position, good times which it brings, or upon the 
Kingdom of Heaven with its rich treasures? 

I personally know the joy and satisfaction which conies in this 
missionary labor; the joy of seeing friend and relative become active 
and useful in the Church, after years of indifference, and I rejoice with 
them in their blessings. My testimony is that in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is found the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God. I know that the Gospel is the plan of life and salva- 
tion unto all who accept it and are faithful and obedient. May we live 
the Gospel and may we ever be diligent in teaching it, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Choir and the congregation joined in the singing of the hymn, 
"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." 

"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief," was sung by the Choir, solo 
by Emma Lucy Gates Bowen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It may be of interest to those who do not already know it that this 
song of fourteen verses, by Montgomery, was sung in Carthage Jail by 
John Taylor ; after he had finished singing it he was asked to sing it 
again. He replied that he did not feel like singing, he was oppressed 



ELDER REIN HOLD ST OOF 



87 



with a sense of coming disaster; but at Hyrum's request he sang the 
hymn again. 

Soon after he was through singing it the second time, the shooting 
started that ended in the death of the Prophet and the Patriarch, and 
the wounding of President Taylor. 

ELDER REINHOLD STOOF 

Former President of the South American Mission 

My brethren and sisters, you will kindly excuse the poor English of 
a foreigner. Members and friends of the far countries under the South- 
ern Cross in Argentine and Brazil extend to you their heartiest greetings. 
They rejoice in the light that went out from Zion and came to them ; 
and you in Zion can be proud of your faithful members in the far south- 
ern countries. There has not been a missionary in South America who 
has not appreciated the interesting pioneer labor among the Latin-Ameri- 
can people in Argentine and among the Brazilian colonies of German 
blood. 

Several missionaries who have labored in South America have told 
me that if circumstances would allow the Church to establish a mission in 
Italy or Spain they would gladly go there and preach the Gospel to the 
fine people of those countries. 

Argentine, like the United States, is a melting-pot for the nations. 
The majority of those who emigrated into South America are from the 
southern countries of Europe — Italy and Spain — so that the character 
of the Argentines is that of a real Latin people. The majority of our 
members in Argentine are Italians and Spaniards. We have a few Ger- 
mans also there. 

Our experiences with the Latin- American people with regard to 
teaching the Gospel are very encouraging. There may be some who 
think that the ideal field of labor in which to find the scattered blood of 
Israel is the northern countries. For them it may be a consolation to know 
that a few centuries after Christ's birth tribes from the north invaded 
Spain and Italy, and it may be that their remnants are the ones who 
today follow the voice of the Good Shepherd. The fact remains that a 
great harvest will be brought in in Argentine among the Latin-American 
people. I have no doubt in my mind about that. 

I am very glad that the leading brethren of the Church have sent to 
South America two very fine men to preside over the two missions there ; 
and I am sure that they will spread the Gospel in a most wonderful way 
in those countries. 

It was my good fortune to be blessed and sustained by the help of 
very faithful and capable missionaries, and this same blessing will be 
enjoyed by my two successors in South America. The people in South 
America are surely a wonderful people. The example of the missionaries 
has exerted a wonderful influence in the conversion of people to the 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Gospel. We had several friends who could neither read nor write ; they 
could not prove the truthfulness of our message by studying the scrip- 
tures as they could not read them, but the example of the missionaries 
gave them conviction, and above all, these people lived the Gospel before 
their baptism. 

Weeks and months before their baptism they kept the Word of 
Wisdom, they even paid their tithing honestly without being urged to do 
so, and by living the Gospel they received a strong testimony, were con- 
verted and were baptized, and are some of our most wonderful members 
in the Argentine. 

It is my opinion that because of the integrity and faithfulness of 
those members, the Lord has blessed them with many manifestations. 

I testify unto you that I have never seen in my life before the power 
of the priesthood manifested in such a marvelous way as in South Amer- 
ica. I testify unto you that I witnessed the gift of interpretation of ton- 
gues, and the gift of healing the sick in cases where doctors could not 
help them. I can testify that the eyesight was restored to a blind young 
Portuguese. I have a written statement in my possession in which that 
young Portuguese said : "I was willing to throw myself before the wheels 
of a wagon in the street to be killed, the doctors could not give me any 
hope." But the power of the priesthood restored his sight. 

I never shall forget that evening when we were called to the home of 
an Italian family whose daughter was very sick ; that family had fasted 
and prayed an entire day, following the advice of a good Italian member 
of the Church. It was a strange sickness that had overcome the daughter. 
She slept for four days and could not eat nor speak, and then, after a day 
of fasting and prayer, the parents called the elders to administer to her. 
When we entered the room the daughter opened her lips for the first time 
for days, her eyes being closed, and she said in a low but distinct voice : 
"A supreme being has entered." 

The young elder, a very ambitious, fine Idaho boy, was called to 
anoint her, and he was so much astounded when he heard those words 
that he forgot the name of the young lady and it had to be repeated to 
him. We pronounced a blessing upon the head of that girl and rebuked 
the power of the Destroyer. We spoke comfort to her parents, and 
according to the promise given by the servants of the Lord through the 
power of the priesthood, her full health was restored. She did not 
remember anything that had happened to her. I do not know what her 
spiritual eyes had beheld, what supreme being had entered with us,- — 
no missionary is a supreme being, we know that, but we cannot say who 
was at our side. We have no doubt that a heavenly being was there to 
give strength and testimony to the parents. The power of the Lord is 
upon the earth, the power of the priesthood is here, and that power calls 
to its aid even heavenly beings when necessary. 

I am thankful for the testimony that I have received, and that others 
have seen the power of the priesthood manifest in such a marvelous way, 
and I am glad that these blessings have been given unto those wonderful 
people in Argentine and Brazil. They are faithful and strong. 



ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM

I remember one fine missionary, a very capable young man, who was 
about to leave his mission field because of the lack of finances, but it was 
not necessary for him to leave, a little Italian couple took care of every- 
thing. They gave him shelter, they gave him to eat, and provided every- 
thing for him. Later this same faithfulness was manifested in their con- 
tribution of a house and lot in Buenos Aires to the Church for use as 
a chapel. This is one of the evidences of the faithfulness of those people. 
The servants of the Lord can preach without hindrance in those countries 
of South America. The cry of Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, rings 
throughout the wonderful nation of Argentine. Those people love free- 
dom, they grant freedom to everyone, and so it is in all the republics 
of South America. In my opinion it is a wonderful field of labor for the 
people. 

A great harvest is waiting for the Church in South America. I have 
no doubt in my mind regarding that. The Lord gives me that testimony. 
God bless those far countries in the south — the home country of my 
children. God bless my South America, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I pray for divine help while I shall stand before you. 

I am glad to bring to you greetings from the East Central States 
mission. I can honestly say in reporting our mission to you that 
what this good brother has just said about South America has been 
repeated many times during the past winter among the young mis- 
sionaries who are laboring in our mission field. God has manifested 
his power, and many are the blessings that have come to our good 
people through the priesthood and the faith of the elders and the 
members of the Church 

We are living in an unusual day ; in a day when the Lord is 
making evident his power. In the mission where I live, we are at the 
present time experiencing unusual conditions, particularly in regard 
to the great floods that have come from the Ohio river and many of 
the other rivers that empty into this great stream. Because of the 
high waters of the Ohio the streams that enter into it back up, and as 
a result great areas of land are flooded. It is interesting, I am sure, 
to know that river boats have gone up the streets of Cincinnati, that 
in man)' places the water was six and eight feet above normal condi- 
tions, — I mean that over the main highways in some parts of that 
country there was that depth of water. However, I do not know of 
any serious handicap to any of our members except the loss, possibly, 
of some of their property. I recall that the day we left to come here 
one of the elders said, "I am mailing you this letter by way of row- 
boat from the second story of the building. We have been in here 
for three days."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I have been greatly impressed by these conditions and I would 
like you people to read the sixty-first section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants and make your own deductions as to the curse that was 
placed upon the waters. Not only have we been troubled with 
waters but we have had tornadoes. And as we came here we passed 
through a great dust storm. It seems to me that we are living in an 
unusual day. 

I would like to tell you something in regard to this wonderful 
experience that we had yesterday. Immediately upon receipt of in- 
formation about this broadcast we sent word to every branch, to 
every elder in our mission, suggesting to them that they provide some 
way so all could listen in. Saturday there came to me a letter that 
had been forwarded from a little town in the hills of Tennessee, tell- 
ing me that they had borrowed a radio to install in their little church, 
which is about twenty-four by thirty-two feet in size, and they 
planned to gather there that day so they could listen to the prophets 
of the Lord when they spoke. 

We are making a great number of friends in unusual ways. I 
would like to refer to one case, emphasizing what has been said in 
regard to the spirit and power that is manifest by our beloved presi- 
dent. President Grant with Brother George Albert Smith visited 
Louisville a short time ago, and while there they visited that modern 
institution, the American Printing House for the Blind, where the 
Book of Mormon was printed in Braille. I visted this same place 
about the second or third day after they had been there, and I was 
pleased at the influence, the most favorable impression that had been 
left with those people during the visit of President Grant and Brother 
Smith. There is something about these brethren that no matter 
where they go they leave their impression and they leave something 
that is outstanding and unusual. 

I would like to express to you my testimony in regard to the 
Book of Mormon. It is one of the most wonderful books that we have 
in the world today. If I were bold enough I might say to you that I 
think many of us are not reading it just as often as we should. I know 
it is taught in our Sunday Schools and Seminary classes and in other 
such ways ; but I am thinking of that busy mother and that hurried 
father in their labors. I fear that they do not read the Book of Mor- 
mon as often as they should do. My testimony to you is this, that 
it is divine and it comes from God, that it is one of the greatest wit- 
nesses that we have of the divinity of this work and of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. If you want to know where we came from, why we 
are here, and where we are going, no book that I know of will tell 
you in such plainness as does the Book of Mormon. We should read 
it more often. I am sure that the promise which is given in it will be 
fulfilled, namely, that those who ask God with a prayerful heart if 
the things therein written are true, he will manifest the truth of it 
unto them. It has been made manifest to a number of people in our 
mission during the past winter. 



ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 



91 



Oh, I could tell you testimonies that have come to us this winter 
of young people and older ones who have had that promise fulfilled 
to them, and their hearts have swelled with joy because of the testi- 
mony of the Book of Mormon that has come to them. 

I pray that the Lord will bless you, and that we will live the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

I bear testimony to you that the lives of our young men and 
women are teaching the Gospel just as much as their words. When 
someone was talking the other day about living this Gospel, I thought 
of five different places where the missionaries were living this winter. 
There will be from one to several members of the families baptized 
because of the lives, because of the actions, because of the teachings 
of these young missionaries in the homes where they have been liv- 
ing. We suggest to them not to live in a boarding-house, but to find 
lodging with some family of prominence. They are living in the homes 
of judges, of postmasters, and of dentists. We are encouraging them 
to go into such places, because in so doing they have a most won- 
derful opportunity of preaching the Gospel ; and by their lives and by 
their actions they are doing it. 

The Lord is blessing us. We need your prayers. We need your 
support. We need your blessings. And may the Lord magnify us 
in our work in the eyes of the people of the world, that we may bring 
souls to Christ, that we may fulfil the responsibility that is given 
to us to preach the Gospel in all the world. 

May the Lord help us to do this I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 

President of North Central States Mission 

The music of this conference has been an inspiration to all. The 
work of our great Tabernacle Choir, the Hyrum Stake Choir Saturday, 
and the Singing Mothers today have all been a blessing to us. 

We often find ourselves in the position of children, seeing about 
us the many activities and movements of life, but failing to recognize 
the full significance of such forces and movements. During this con- 
ference I have been struggling to comprehend the value and power of 
this great cause as it affects us and the people of the world. 

For generations people have taken an interest in keeping close to 
certain anniversaries. In private life we commemorate births, marriages 
and other important dates. In public and social life we have our Fourth 
of July, Armistice Day, Memorial Day and many others of general 
and local interest. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints remembers proudly 
a number of events which cluster around this season of the year. It 
was in the spring of 1820, one hundred sixteen years ago, that the first 
vision of this dispensation occurred. On May 15, 1829, one hundred 
seven years ago, the Prophet, John the Baptist, appeared in answer to 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prayer and restored the Aaronic Priesthood. It was but a short time 
following this that the personal associates of the Master himself, Peter, 
James and John, appeared and restored the Melchizedek priesthood. 
It was on March 27, 1836, that the Kirtland Temple was dedicated, and 
a week later, on April 3, when those great experiences recorded in Section 
110 of the Doctrine and Covenants occurred, when the Savior himself, 
together with Moses, Elias and Elijah, appeared to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and his associate, Oliver Cowdery, and left their particular au- 
thority and blessings. 

On March 17, 1842, the great woman's organization of the Church 
came into being. It was at this time that the Prophet of this dispensation 
turned the key for women in all the world. 

One hundred and six years ago today, April 6, 1830, under humble 
conditions in Western New York this Church was officially organized. 
Add to these more recent events the birth of our Savior and his resur- 
rection some nineteen hundred years ago and we have a collection of sig- 
nificant anniversaries associated with this season of the year that are 
most challenging, thought provoking, and fundamental. 

As missionaries in the world, our responsibility is largely one of 
teaching the significance of these events, for therein is contained the 
message and authority of the Gospel. The missionaries of the North 
Central States mission are attempting to do this. They have the testi- 
mony, the energy and desire to do it well. We are proud of them and 
of their parents, priesthood quorums, and others who sustain them. 

Our reports for 1935 indicate an improvement in every item upon 
which reports are made. The spirit which permeates all this work is 
difficult to read into the reports but we feel it, rejoice in it, and know 
that it is of a divine source. Literally thousands of people have heard 
the Gospel message. Friends are being raised up, and many are seeking 
us out on their own initiative. The lump is gradually being leavened. 
The missionaries of our mission are indeed proud to be entrusted with 
responsibilities in connection with this mighty work. 

The Saints, as members of the mission, are also increasing in devo- 
tion and energy. They are growing in power to live and appreciate 
the Gospel. Their activities have increased and broadened. They, with 
you, are trying to be worthy of this Church and its blessings. 

We have discovered that the truth, in being taught, must be re- 
flected through the teacher. We must teach the Gospel in terms of every 
day life and in the language of the people. If this were not true the 
mere distribution of our literature would be sufficient. Testimony, with 
the warmth of soul that comes from one who lives the truth, is a mighty 
force. The missionaries never cease to attract attention because of their 
clean, wholesome, radiant lives. The truths of the Gospel shine through 
them and their experiences. Perhaps a personal incident will illustrate 
this: 

Upon one occasion I was bearing my testimony to the truthfulness 
of the Gospel. The man to whom I spoke said, "I don't believe a word 
of it." I asked him if he had ever experienced the effect of an anaesthetic. 



ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 



93 



"Yes," he replied and then described his feelings to me. At the con- 
clusion of his description I gave back to him his own answer to my testi- 
mony by saying, "I don't believe a word of it." This rather startled 
him but at the same time presented the point of view that each of us 
was speaking out of our own personal experience. Since I had had 
no anaesthetic experience I could not appreciate and understand his, and 
was perhaps just as much justified in denouncing it as he was in refusing 
to give credence to my testimony which had arisen out of my personal 
experiences, the likeness of which he had never felt. The incident led 
to an open door and an invitation to discuss at some length the principles 
of religion. 

The past winter in our section of the country has been the most se- 
vere in history. Under such conditions we have found it necessary to de- 
velop new and varied ways of doing our work. We have been forced 
to substitute a variety of methods for those usually employed. The 
missionaries have been equal to the emergency, however, and have made 
real contributions to the service even under these trying conditions. 

The headquarters of our mission is located in Minneapolis, a Chris- 
tian community with many churches and many wonderful people. Many 
of these people being of Scandinavian descent, we feel that there is 
much of the blood of. Israel there which should respond to the Gospel. 
We have been interested in several very distinctive contributions to 
Christian conduct and leadership that come out of our community life. 
You may be interested to know that a large retail store which' employs 
some three thousand workers will not advertise in a Sunday newspaper, 
nor illuminate its windows on Sunday to display its wares ; nor require 
labor of its workmen except in the very minimum service of guarding 
and protecting the property. A popular newspaper with a circulation of 
more than 115,000 copies daily refuses to carry any kind of advertising 
which relates to liquor or strong drink. The thing that has interested 
us in these cases is the fact that the public in the main admire the prac- 
tices referred to and reward them with a good business and a growing 
sentiment of approval. 

We are grateful for the visit of Elder George Albert Smith in our 
mission since it was my privilege last to report. He left his faith, love 
and testimony there in full measure. He did us much good as he mingled 
with the missionaries and the local members of the Church. Many friends 
came to our meetings to hear him and went away rejoicing in their 
privilege and opportunity. 

We are looking forward to another visit from the General Au- 
thorities of the Church this season. 

It is a joy to bring to you parents the love and greetings of your 
missionaries. It is in like manner a privileged opportunity to bring a 
pledge of loyalty, support, and allegiance to President Grant and the 
General Authorities of the Church who have sent us out into the service. 

We of the North Central States mission are grateful for your 
confidence and trust. We desire most earnestly that the Lord will assist 
us to the extent that we may properly honor and respond to it, and that 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our work and responsibility may be met with, "an eye single to the glory 
of God." Personally I am very grateful for the Gospel, my heritage, 
and my family, and the missionaries with their cooperation and service 
in this work of the Lord. 

In all sincerity and humility I desire to add my testimony to those 
borne before me in this conference and I do it in the name of Jesus 
our Redeemer. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am grateful, beyond my power to say, for the privilege of labor- 
ing in the ministry of God, associating myself with fine young men and 
women who are doing their utmost to deliver the message that has been 
vouchsafed to them. 

I believe that one of the delightful things of mission life is to 
see the development and growth that takes place in the minds and 
hearts of these young men and women. They appreciate beyond measure 
the help they are receiving from their parents and their friends in 
maintaining them during their stay in the mission fields. They are 
meeting with success and are enjoying at the present time health and 
strength, for which we are very thankful. We have eighty-four mis- 
sionaries, — sixty elders and twenty-four young women. We have 
some from the Central States mission, some from California, some from 
Arizona, some from Alberta, and the rest are from Utah and from 
Idaho. 

I believe that the greatest way in which to present this message 
of truth is through the power of example. I should like to take this 
opportunity of saying just exactly what it means to live upright and 
good lives. You and I very frequently are invited to banquets and 
balls, not only in the regularly organized stakes of Zion, but also in the 
mission fields. About six weeks ago arrangements were made by one 
of our very fine young women to hold one of these banquets and 
balls, and in making the arrangements with the hotel management in 
whose hotel this affair was to be held, she said, "It will not be necessary 
for you to serve tea or coffee. The one hundred and sixty-five young 
men and women who will gather here tonight do not drink tea or 
coffee." It was then suggested that he arrange the card tables and 
cigarette trays in one of the adjacent rooms so that at intervals these 
young people could go in and spend a little time in recreation, — that kind 
of recreation. This fine, upstanding young woman said, "These hundred 
and sixty-five young men and women do not smoke cigarettes nor do they 
play cards, nor do they drink wine or liquor or beer ; so it will not be 
necessary to make preparations along this line. However," she said, "It 
might be well for you to order one hundred and sixty-five bottles of 
milk" — which was done. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 95 

The power of example — I am beginning to feel that the strength 
of this mighty Church is certainly based upon the power of example. 

I clipped out of one of our magazines the other day this fine, brief 
statement written not so long ago by our beloved President Grant; in 
its brevity there is such a volume of truth so fine and splendid that I 
believe it would be good in referring to it to read it. "Let us get faith 
as a people. Let us so order our lives that we are entitled to an increase 
of that faith. I am thankful that I know of no man or woman who 
ever joined this church and attended his or her sacrament meetings, 
partaking of the sacrament in remembrance of the suffering of our 
Savior and his death, who was honest in the payment of his or her 
tithing, who divided with the Lord as perfectly as he would ask the 
Lord to divide with him if he were making up an account, who has 
kept the Word of Wisdom, I have never known such a person to lose 
his or her faith." I believe that the fundamentals of this great Church 
are based upon those very principles. In order for you and me to carry 
that power with us in our ministry it seems to me that we must comply 
with these fundamentals of truth. In order to understand perfectly this 
work it is necessary that we be clean in habit and in thought, to have 
the light of truth we must live the truth. 

I am glad to report to you that so far as my knowledge is con- 
cerned, these young men and women are preaching this Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ by the power of example, which I am convinced is 
the way in which the Spirit of God can operate upon their minds and 
upon their hearts so that people will naturally gravitate to them because 
of the quality of truth that they are carrying in their example. 

Recently it was said by Brother Stephen L. Richards, "No man 
can be respectful of Deity and have in his heart an improper attitude 
towards the creations of Deity. The man who properly understands his 
relationship to God and the endowments which he has received from the 
Creator will be filled with reverence and thanksgiving." How true is 
this philosophy ! 

We are told, my dear brethren and sisters, that the power of 
truth in its highest, purest and most exalted phases stands squarely upon 
four basic lines of thought : First, the love for truth ; secondly, the 
search for truth ; thirdly, faith in truth ; and fourthly, the work for truth. 

Here is a combination of facts that brings you and me, when we 
study these truths, into transforming fellowship with God, our eternal 
Father. They provide for finer interpretations upon the different phases 
of this great latter-day work. It is said, "The path of truth, higher 
living, truer development in every phase of life, is never shut from the 
individual until he closes it himself. Let man feel this, believe it, and 
make this fact a real and living factor in his life and there are no limits 
to his progress. He has but to live his best at all times and rest calm 
and untroubled no matter what results come from his efforts. 

"No rule for higher living will help a man in the slightest till he 
reach out and appropriate it for himself, until 'he make it practical in 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his daily life. The man who is seeking ever to do his best is the man 
who is keen, active, wide awake, and aggressive." 

As long as you and I are ever striving to do our best in living the 
great truths of the Gospel we are entitled always to the light of truth. 

In conclusion I wish to leave with you my humble testimony con- 
cerning the divinity of this work. I know that God lives. I know that 
Joseph Smith was the instrumentality through which God operated in 
bringing to pass the saving graces of the Gospel of our Lord and Master, 
Jesus Christ. I pray that He will keep us firm and steadfast in the faith, 
and that our power of example will be beyond reproach, I humbly ask 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "Nazareth," (Gounod), was sung by the Choir (The 
Relief Society Singing Mothers). 

Elder Joseph Anderson, the Clerk of the Conference, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened Monday after- 
noon, April 6, at 2 o'clock. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers furnished the music for this 
meeting. 

Elder J. Percy Goddard, President of the Liberty Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

"All Hail to Thee" (Pilgrim's Chorus — Wagner), was sung by 
the Choir. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The following are but a few of the many expressions of the great 
Master and Teacher himself on the subject of prayer : 

"watch and pray" 

Pray for them which despitefully use you. (Matt. 5:44.) 

Watch ye and pray. . . . The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is 
weak. (Mark 14:38.) 

Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is. 
(Mark 13:33.) 

Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted 
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand 
before the Son of Man. (Luke 21 :36.) 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



97 



Why sleep ye? Rise and pray. (Luke 22:46.) 

Pray that ye enter not into temptation. (Luke 22:40.) 

The whole of the New Testament and of course therefore all the 
teachings of our Lord are filled with instructions and admonitions to 
pray. There are some among the rich, as among all other classes in our 
nation, who ridicule religion. One wise man (Roger W. Babson) has 
said that these men of wealth of the United States who ridicule religion 
are indebted for all that they possess to the family prayers which were 
once held daily in the homes of their fathers. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S EXPERIENCE 

On this subject, Joseph Smith the Prophet in his writings says: 

Having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled and 
began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. ... I saw a pillar of light 
exactly over my head. 

The Prophet continues : 

I had beheld a vision. I have thought since that I felt much like 
Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa and related the 
account of his vision when he saw a light and heard a voice ; . . . some 
said he was dishonest, others said he was mad ; ... he was ridiculed and 
reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen 
a vision, . . . and all the persecution under heaven could not make it 
otherwise ; he . . . would know to his latest breath that he had both 
seen a light and heard a voice. . . 

So it was with me. I had actually seen a light. ... I had found the 
testimony of James to be true — that a man who lacked wisdom might ask 
of God, and obtain, and not be upbraided. (Pearl of Great Price, pp. 
48-50; James 1 :S.) 

TRANSFORMED BY DIVINE LIGHT 

Paul saw a light, Paul heard a voice. That light which burned into 
his soul was the something outside of himself which he needed, for 
that divine light changed him from a man of hate to a man of love, 
from the man who, when the Christians were put to death, gave his 
voice against them, into that scholarly and powerful defender of the 
Christian' faith around whose teachings much of our New Testament 
has been built. It was that light from heaven, that inspiration from 
the Almighty which transformed this wicked persecutor of the saints, 
Saul of Tarsus, into Paul the great and scholarly apostle. 

And so, too, Joseph Smith the Prophet saw a light, he heard a 
voice. This light, this voice, this inspiration transformed him from 
a youth filled with doubts and uncertainties into a mighty prophet. Under 
the inspiration of the Spirit he saw clearly and he defined definitely, in 
the revelations which have come to us through him, those rules for 
Christian living of which the world today is in such desperate need. 

INSPIRING THE SOULS OF MEN 



What can I do? What can you do? What can the people of the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



nations and of the world do to bring into the souls of men this much 
needed light, this inspiration which will bring about remarkable and 
desirable transformations in the form of love, unselfishness, success, 
peace on earth good will toward men? 

Praying, having faith in our Lord, struggling to live in accordance 
with his teachings, his ideals and his example will, I am sure, in no 
small degree bring about these greatly desired results. Honest, earnest, 
prayerful appeals will bring that inspiration, that divine light which 
transforms human lives from those which are filled with misgivings 
and mistrust into lives of faith in fellowmen, faith in self and faith 
in divine providence. Living the Christian's life of prayer in a thorough- 
ly honest and conscientious way will, I verily believe, change the nations 
and the people of the world everywhere from conditions of hate, con- 
ditions of greed and conditions of mistrust into conditions of faith, 
conditions of affection and confidence, of joy, happiness, peace and 
success. 

In this trying hour I appeal to you Latter-day Saints, if you are 
not doing so already, to call your families together with daily regularity 
and with them go upon your knees and appeal for help and guidance, 
for that light, that voice, that inspiration which all of our families and 
all other people everywhere need so much in this time of trial and 
temptation. 

REMEMBER THE ALMIGHTY 

Abraham Lincoln said our nation has had a growth and a develop- 
ment the like of which no other nation has ever known, but, said he, 
during our great Civil War, the trouble with us is "We have forgotten 
God." I appeal to you to remember the Almighty. Let us remember 
him who in all the history of our nation has been our strong, our loyal 
and our devoted Friend. By his power we the people of the United 
States are able to live today in this land of freedom and liberty under 
the sacred folds of the only flag in all the world that has never known 
defeat. Remember the motto of our nation, "In God we trust." Let 
us pray to him in secret, make of him a confidential friend, tell him our 
shortcomings, our imperfections and our weaknesses ; appeal for these 
to be forgiven and then pray, in faith believing, for strength and courage 
and power to resist evil. Let us appeal not for burdens that are light 
but for strength to lift those loads, however heavy, which may be placed 
upon us. 

In this hour of stress, of temptation and of depression, in these 
days when war clouds are threatening everywhere, let us pray that men's 
hearts may be purged of selfishness and greed and that the light of 
heaven which brings the spirit of sacrifice and unselfishness may shine 
with glowing effect into the souls of men everywhere 

I appeal to you who compose the vast multitude assembled in this 
historic Tabernacle and to all who are listening in not only to remember 
the Lord by going upon your knees in secret and in your family prayers 
but I appeal to you also to go with regularity to your places of worship 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



99 



and there with prayerful hearts come into closest possible communion 
with our Heavenly Father and thus deserve and receive from him an 
answer to your honest, heartfelt appeals whatever blessings are necessary 
to fill your hearts and lives with joy, contentment, peace and success. 

THE SABBATH A DAY OF PRAYER 

We should bear in mind always that the Sabbath is a day of prayer. 
It is a day of worship. We do not go to our places of worship for the 
purpose of acquiring scholarship ; we do not go there to learn history 
or mathematics or science. The purpose of our going to our sacrament 
meetings is to worship. We cannot get faith by logic any more than 
we can get learning by simply longing for it. Partaking worthily 
of the' Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is an important and funda- 
mental part of that worship, and it is this intense and genuine wor- 
ship, this prayerful spirit that will bring that light and inspiration 
of which I have spoken, that light and inspiration which we all so much 
need and which so many of us, I am sorry to say, do not deserve. 

A FORTIFICATION AGAINST EVIL 

It is said that the temptations of today are greater than those of 
any previous time. It is generally conceded that our young folks are 
surrounded with conditions more alluring than those of any previous 
period. If we have not taught our children to pray as a means of helping 
to fortify them against the evils with which they are surrounded, then 
in the language of the Savior let me exclaim, "Why sleep ye? Rise and 
pray that ye enter not into temptation." (Luke 22:46.) Remember, as 
the Master says, the flesh is weak and therefore we need, indeed we must 
have the help of Heaven if we are going to be able to resist the tempta- 
tions of today. 

If we have not taught our young people to pray and thus to come 
into close communion with the light and inspiration of Heaven, I am 
sure that a little careful reflection will convince us that such neglect 
has been and is a serious mistake. The revelation itself says clearly : 
"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer and there offer up thy sacraments 
upon my holy day." (D. and C. 59 :9.) 

THE MIRACULOUS EFFECT OF PRAYER 

Let me renew and repeat my appeal that we all pray, and pray 
always, in our homes, in secret and in our places of worship so that 
we may not enter into temptation. And let us remember that after 
we have resolved to pray earnestly and faithfully, after we have had 
awakened in our souls faith in Divine Providence and a burning testi- 
mony of the divinity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, after we have 
decided to accept the teachings of the Son of God and after we have 
successfully undertaken to live in accordance with these teachings, to 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pray, to worship our Lord and Master, to do our best to do his will, we 
will then necessarily have the singular consciousness of knowing that 
we are not exactly the same persons we were before. The effect of the 
Gospel upon hearts and lives is miraculous. The effect of the light of 
Heaven which comes as a result of faithful, effective appeals is remark- 
able, it is wonderful. 

THE GREATEST WORK IN THE WORLD 

George R. Wendling has said that the most wonderful work in the 
world is not to take iron and steel and brass and with these make a 
locomotive; that the most wonderful work in the world is not to take 
gold and diamonds and cog-wheels and with these make a watch ; nor 
is the most wonderful work in the world to take canvas and colors and 
brush and with these paint an Angelus ; nor even yet is the most wonder- 
ful work in the world to take pen and parchment and write an Iliad or 
a Hamlet. No, indeed, says he, infinitely more wonderful and infinitely 
greater than any one or all of these combined is that something which 
is accomplished by living in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel 
of the Master. The prayerful, devoted, honest, sincere, unselfish Chris- 
tian life has such remarkable power that it can take an ignoble, cruel, 
impure and dishonest human being and transform that cruel, ignoble, 
impure and dishonest person into an upright, gentle, pure, honest and 
dependable human soul. "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall 
be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as 
wool." (Isaiah 1 :18.) Such transformations show the glory, the grand- 
eur, the power and the mystery of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is 
this rebirth, it is this rebuilding, it is this reconstruction of lost and 
broken souls into upright and glorious men and women that is infinitely 
greater than anything else which this age of mechanical miracles can do. 
In the presence of accomplishments thus marvelous, we bow humbly 
before the mastery of our Lord. His Gospel is most wonderful. We 
who have felt its touch and inspiration can say boldly in the language 
of the Bible, "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ : for it is 
the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth." (Romans 
1:16.) 

OUR MOST IMPORTANT WORK 

In conclusion : Let us never forget that the outstanding commission 
that is yours and mine as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, the outstanding work to be done by those who have 
been endowed with authority to speak in the name of the Master is to 
carry the Gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. Let us 
never forget that this "Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all 
the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come." 
(Matt. 24:14.) In this our most important work and duty may we not 
fail, but humbly, with the aid and blessing of our Heavenly Father, 
go forward to outstanding success, I humbly pray.

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

To be eligible to occupy this position with no certainty that you 
will be called to speak is an ordeal that keeps one in a state of anxiety. 
In this, I see in a measure a likeness to the second coming of our Lord, 
for he tells us that when he comes he will come as a thief in the night 
and no man will know the day or the hour thereof. We have the 
further warning that those who are prepared will find that day to be 
a day of rejoicing, while those who have not been obedient to his laws 
will be overtaken with sorrow. 

I rejoice in having the privilege of raising my voice with my breth- 
ren during this conference. We are living in a wonderful time, an 
age of many marvels. Today we hardly dare think of what tomorrow 
might bring. It appears to me that with man increasing his powers 
there is less concern for God, for the world is troubled, and contention 
and selfishness are found on every hand. True, friends are being 
raised up to assist us in the great work in which we have been called to 
labor, yet there are those who profess to be priests of the Most High, 
who are not content to teach the doctrines of the Church they represent, 
but resort to spreading untruths about the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. For example, I recently read an article which was 
written by one who certainly knows he is stating untruths. 

I refer to this article as a reminder to us that in accepting the 
priesthood we assume a responsibility which carries an obligation to 
God and our Lord and Savior and our fellows who are the children 
of God. The time allotted to me will only permit of a brief statement 
concerning some of the falsehoods that I have culled from this article : 

First. "As a religion, Mormonism has the minimum of worship." 
With our sacrament meetings, Sunday Schools, our priesthood quorum 
meetings, and the meetings of the auxiliaries, I answer, in what other 
church can you find such devotion ? 

Second. "It has no service of sacrifice." What is sacrifice? From 
Adam to the coming of our Lord its purpose was to keep the children of 
God reminded of the great sacrifice in which the Lamb of God should 
be slain and offered as an atonement for the transgression of Adam. 

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us : 

Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with 

the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of 

sincerity and truth. (I Cor. S :7, 8) 

Third. "It has lost completely the original and Christian idea of 
priesthood, etc." I answer : What was the original idea of priesthood 
as outlined in the New Testament? The Bible clearly describes the 
Church as having apostles, prophets, seventies, elders, bishops, priests, 
teachers, deacons, and evangelists. In what church today are such offi- 
cers found ? The Church record shows that approximately 86% of those 
who hold the priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Saints are actively engaged in church work, or willing to labor. The 
only reward looked for is the promised blessings of our Father and our 
God. Is not such service a sacrifice as described by Paul the Apostle 
of old? 

Fourth. "There is no clergy class." I find no mention in the Bible 
of "a clergy class," nor do I find mention of a priesthood class such 
as constitute the clergy of today. I ask, has new revelation been given 
providing for this change? 

Fifth. "The speakers at their meetings are farmers, etc." From 
the Bible we learn that the officers of the primitive church were fisher- 
men, tax gatherers, clerks, etc. John, the apostle chosen by our Lord, 
records this statement made by our Lord : 

I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman. 
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every 
branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. 

****** 

Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cajniot bear fruit of itself, 
except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 

Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall 
ye be my disciples. 

This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved 

you. 

Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, 
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain : 
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it 
you. (John 15:1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16.) 

There is ample evidence that these "farmers, etc.," who have in this 
day been ordained apostles, etc., are recipients of this promise. 

For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which 
is in him? even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of 
God. (I Cor. 2:11.) 

But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit 
searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. (I Cor. 2:10) 

Sixth. "These 'farmers, etc' are incapable of discussing religion 
on anything like the plane of the average Protestant minister." Strange, 
is it not, that this professional schooled clergy class have never to our 
knowledge converted even one of these men whom we send out as 
missionaries, like those sent out by the Savior, although in some cases 
lacking in schooling. Why? Because they go out into the world having 
been commissioned with authority from him, and his Spirit goes before 
them, and the power of the Holy Ghost is upon them, as of old. 

Our critic speaks of the "supposed" doctrines revealed to Joseph 
Smith. If he will read them with an honest intent, he will find every 
one to harmonize with the Bible, and I am certain that he cannot make 
a similar claim for the church he represents. 

Seventh. "The Mormon respect for the Bible is not so great as that 
of the average Protestant church, etc." That statement has been an- 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



103 



swered during this conference. I add, Protestantism testifies that we 
adhere to the teachings of the Bible more nearly than any other church. 

We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling blcck, and unto 
the Greeks foolishness ; 

But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the 
power of God, and the wisdom of God. 

Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness 
of God is stronger than men. 

For ye see ycur calling, brethren, how that not many wise men 
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 

But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound 
the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound 
the things which are mighty: 

And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath 
God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things 
that are : 

That no flesh should glory in his presence. 

But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us 
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption : 

That, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in 
the Lord. ( 1 Cor. 1 :23-31.) 

Ye are bought with a price; be not ye servants of men; 

Brethren, let everv man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. 
(I Cor. 7:23, 24.) 

Our accuser either is not acquainted with the Book of Mormon 
or is not honest in his criticism of our belief in the Book of Mormon. 
Prescott says : 

The Jewish and Christian schemes were strangely mingled together 
during the conquest of Mexico by Cortez and the brains of the good fathers 
were still further bewildered by the mixture of heathenish abominations 
which were so closely intertwined with the most orthodox observances. 
In their perplexity, they looked on the whole as the delusion of the 
devil, who counterfeited the rites of Christianity and the traditions of the 
chosen people, that he might allure his wretched victims to destruction. 

If our critic will read the Book of Mormon, and refer to fragments 
of records which were preserved from the destructive fires of his fellow 
clergymen centuries ago, he will find justification for the disturbed con- 
dition of mind of his ancient fellows. 

In his reference to "Rational Theology" he uses the tricks resorted 
to by some college trained clergymen. He has taken statements from 
several paragraphs and made them serve his purpose, ignoring the ex- 
planatory matter and the vital part of the complete quotation. I wish I 
had time to read it all. 

We believe, as the Bible teaches, that our Lord atoned for the 
transgression of Adam, which was necessary that we might follow, as 
mortal beings, children of the living God, and that through baptism 
and obedience to the laws of God we should be saved in one of the 
three degrees of glory, and that each person should answer for his own 
sins, and not for Adam's transgression. We believe that baptism must 
be done, by immersion, by one having authority, which is likened to a 
burial and a washing, and that sprinkling does not meet the requirement 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the law. We believe that little children are without sin, therefore 
need not be baptized. We agree that mixed marriages are not desirable, 
and believe that all marriages that are not performed for time and all 
eternity by one having authority, are null and void after death. 

As to "Sins, etc." We shall earn our degree of glory through 
obedience to the laws of God. Any act contrary to law is sin, and dis- 
pleasing to the Lord, and for such each individual will be called to 
answer before the judgment seat of God. The sacrifice of our Lord 
brought about redemption from death to each of the children of God, 
each in his time, according to his obedience to the divine laws. To 
this end we baptize for the dead as of old. 

We believe that the words of First Corinthians 15 :29 are true and 
set forth the plan of our Lord. Our accuser must also believe or admit 
that the laws have been changed, and if the Bible contains all of the 
word of the Lord, then this change is man-made and without authority. 
From the beginning of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
members have continually sought for records of their dead, and have 
performed ordinances in the temples as of old, and as the Church has 
grown, so an interest in genealogy has increased among all people, and 
now nations are aiding in the work; wherefore 

Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no 
power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God. 

Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of 
God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. (Romans 
13:1, 2.) 

God grant that we shall feel the responsibility that rests upon us to 
the extent that we will continue to labor in faith, humbly and diligently 
seeking to know the will of the Father and abide in the law, so that 
when he comes we shall be numbered with those chosen to meet him, 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

I can sympathize with the statement made by Bishop David A. 
Smith. To sit here expecting to be called at any time during three 
days and then perhaps not to lie called, or to be called, I think is 
one of the most trying experiences I have ever gone through in ray 
life. 

Nevertheless, I am very pleased to be here with you this after- 
noon. I have enjoyed to the fullest the Conference and expect to re- 
turn to my field of labor strengthened in my faith and testimony 
to represent you in the mission field in Mexico. 

It is with pleasure that I report to you that the mission is grow- 
ing. We have, I believe, the finest group of missionaries that there 
has ever been in the Mexican mission. I am sure that the growth 



ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 



105 



in number during the past year is equaled in the quality of the mis- 
sionaries. I believe that the Church has never before sent such a 
uniform, fine group, with so few, practically no problem cases. The 
mission field has ceased to be what it perhaps once was, a reform 
school. We are now sending them out, I am happy to report, to 
preach the Gospel, to teach the truths of the restored Gospel to the 
world. And they are doing that very thing. 

We have been happy during the past year to have a one hundred 
per cent increase in the number of our missionaries. We wish to 
thank you parents in Zion and you bishops of wards and presidents of 
stakes for this hearty cooperation. We beg of you that you continue 
your cooperation in sending forth missionaries. If the one hundred 
per cent increase that we have enjoyed in the Mexican mission could 
be extended to a thousand per cent increase we would still have 
room to place the missionaries to good advantage. 

Our mission is a mission of self-sacrifice, one of unselfish service, 
a service of love. There is a request that I should like to make to 
those of you who are sending your boys and girls into the mission 
field, and that is, that before they are called you imbue them with 
that spirit, give to them that motive of going forth into the mission 
field, a motive of service, of taking that which is of utmost value to 
people and giving it to them that they, in turn, may enter the realm 
of service and through that service of sacrifice and unselfishness gain 
blessings for themselves. We find that too often, even today, our 
missionaries come into the field with the idea of personal achieve- 
ment, with the idea of personal benefit, with the idea of gaining 
experience which will better fit them for future life. And while of 
course this is one of the greatest benefits of missionary work, we take 
it that even that benefit will be greater if the motive is correct, being 
that of unselfishly serving our fellowmen, of carrying to them this 
Gospel, which is of the utmost value, of helping to make the. world 
a better place in which to live, of verily representing the spirit of 
this Conference which, I take it, is the spirit of our Church, a spirit 
exemplified in the talk made by President McKay, that "He who 
shall find his life shall lose it, yet he who may lose his life for my 
sake shall find it eternally." 

I find, my brothers and sisters, that the conditions in the world 
today, are indeed nothing more nor less, in my opinion, than the 
working out of the plans of our Heavenly Father, who will overrule 
all things in the interest of his work and mark out the ways by which 
people may be brought to an attitude and a state of mind in which 
they will accept the Gospel principles. I think this is true univer- 
sally. The calamities that are befalling our nation, as well as other 
nations, the political turmoil, the breaking down of some of the 
powers that have held people. in slavery, — at least spiritual slavery, — 
for so many years, — all of these things, I take it, are merely placing 
people in a position in which they may accept of the principles of the 
Gospel upon hearing it. 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



My great concern is whether or not I, and those laboring with 
me in our specific field of labor, shall be able to keep up our end 
of the bargain and discharge our responsibility of presenting the 
Gospel to the people as soon as the Lord brings them to an accept- 
able point of view. I beseech of you, each and every one, to so live 
your religion that your light may so shine that men seeing your good 
works may come to glorify our Father which is in heaven. I be- 
seech of you further cooperation in sending your boys and girls into 
the mission field to carry this message to the people who, according 
to my belief, are now coming to the mental and spiritual state in 
which they may accept these saving principles. 

I bear you my testimony that I know that God lives. I know 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that the Gospel 
which he brought to the earth has been restored. I testify to you that 
our Church today is guided by men who are blessed with the power 
of revelation, the power to represent our Heavenly Father here upon 
the earth, and that through them we do receive his mind and will, 
which is just as binding upon us as though we were to receive it from 
him direct. Therefore let us be united in sustaining our present 
authorities and working with them to the accomplishment of the 
Lord's purposes. 

May the Lord bless us to this end, I pray in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Guide Us, O Thou 
Great Jehovah," after which the Choir sang an anthem, "O Divine 
Redeemer." (Soloists Margaret Stewart Hewlett and Annette Richard- 
son Dinwoodey, William Hardiman, violinist).

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

It is related that an infidel once said to the great Pascal, who was a 
devout Christian, "If you will prove your religion to me I will try it." 

Pascal replied, "If you will try the religion, it will prove itself." 

I have the same feeling today with respect to our own religion. 
I have been inspired by the things that have been said and my soul has 
also been lifted up because of the wonderful and inspirational music 
to which we have listened. Under the inspiration of the Lord, I would 
like to tell you how much there is in our religion, when properly tried, 
which will prove itself. 

Two weeks ago yesterday I was in Boston. A minister attended 
our services and told us at the close that he had been studying, he 
and other members of a committee, for many months, the best there is 
in the religions of the world, and they had selected twenty-two leading 
Articles of Faith from various churches for what they believe to be a 
new religion or a new church they are about to found, and that of those 
twenty-two they had selected nine of the Articles of Faith of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I wish they had selected the rest 
of our Articles of Faith and would really accept the truths stated therein. 

Would you be better physically? Try the laws of the Lord with 
respect to health. I never heard any one say that they didn't work well. 
Would you love your neighbor and treat your fellow men properly? 
Follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Not long ago a man was speaking to me with reference to the 
acquiring of wealth. He referred to it as one of the great curses of the 
world. 

I said, "If you would follow the teachings of our church as laid 
down in the Holy Scriptures, there would be no curse." 
He asked me for a specific reference. 

The second chapter of Jacob, the eighteenth and nineteenth verses, 
to which I referred him, explain the true motive back of the acquiring 
of wealth : 

But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God ; and 
after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches if you seek 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



them, and ye will seek them for the intent to do good, to clothe the naked 
and to feed the hungry and to liberate the captive and administer relief 
to the sick and the afflicted. 

Can the acquiring of wealth be a curse when that is the motive 
back of it? The answer is apparent. It is the motive back of the 
acquiring of wealth, it is the love of money that is the curse, not the 
acquiring of it for a righteous purpose. Would you seek to know the 
laws of toleration, of equality? Read the thirtieth chapter of Alma. 

And so we might go on through. If the world would accept, if the 
world could truly understand and follow the admonition of the teachings 
of the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Bible, 
then would the solutions of the world's problems appear. The religion 
is itself its greatest witness. To try it, to know it, to understand it is 
to have it commended to every thoughtful man and woman. The Book 
of Mormon and all other inspired writings of the Lord, have within 
them inherently that which appeals to the best there is in mankind. 

When true religion is translated into life, I think it is not boasting 
to say that it is the greatest influence for good in all the world. Just 
a few illustrations : 

I wonder if I may just read one or two sentences from a letter that 
I received the other day? We have only one group of missionaries 
in the Eastern States mission that has engaged in athletic activities 
during the last winter. That was only supplemental to their missionary 
work. This letter came to the office the other day entirely unsolicited. 
Let me read just a verse or two from it. This man says : 

Undoubtedly you will appreciate this unsolicited commendation of 
one of your groups in the mission field. 

Later on he says : 

These wholly Christian-like young men set up a standard of athletic 
competition that can never be excelled in these wonderful United States. 
During their too brief stay with us here in the anthracite coal mining 
region there seemed to be almost a halo of American sportsmanship 
surrounding the very beings of these young men. Nothing that I can 
here say would better express my inner thoughts concerning all of them 
than to tell you that I shall continue to boast of their friendship and 
its value to me as one of the priceless possessions of my life. 

They probably will be more surprised to learn of this letter than 
you at the Eastern States mission were to receive it. 

Four or five of our young men have been touring a part of our 
mission lately. In addition to being splendid singers they are fine speak- 
ers. In Massachusetts, two weeks ago, they had thirty-nine appoint- 
ments before business clubs, before ladies' clubs, before Young Men's 
Christian Associations, before newspaper boards and other organizations. 
Wherever they have gone we have received from men, who attended 
and listened to their message, words of commendation. 

A few Sundays ago in a conference a fine lady came up at the close 
of the meeting and expressed great appreciation of the services. 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



111 



Some one asked her what part of the meeting she enjoyed best. 

She said, "Not the main speaker" — ! (I was he). 

(Laughter.) 

"I have," said she, "enjoyed the spirit of these young men and 
women who have spoken here today. As I saw them, as I heard them, 
I said, 'Can it be that the religion of which I have heard so much evil, 
can it be that it has produced these boys and girls ? I would have my son 
doing the work they are doing if he would. If this is Mormonism we 
want it in our homes." 

I could only say to her, as I say to you in conclusion, "Can water 
rise above its source?" "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of 
thistles?" The Gospel of Christ, in which we so devoutly believe, is 
responsible for the lives of our people. 

These young men and women who are in the Eastern States mission 
and who are in every other mission of the Church come from Mormon 
homes. Back of every one of them is a Mormon mother, as back of 
George Washington was a Mary Ball Washington and as back of Abra- 
ham Lincoln there was a Nancy Hanks Lincoln. So back of every 
Mormon missionary is a Mormon mother, a Mormon home, a Mormon 
father, and the Mormon religion. 

Try this religion. It will prove itself. God help us to put it to 
the test. I say to you parents, you have sent some good boys and girls 
out into the mission field. Not every one is perfect, but in the main 
there are no better boys and girls in all the world. God is with them and 
they are taking their message to the world. 

I pray that God will help us to continue to know the truth. I 
know it and bear solemn testimony to you today of its truthfulness, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

If this were not such a difficult task I would be indeed happy to 
report to you the Canadian mission. I can say truthfully that after 
being out of these valleys of the mountains for some time I am happy 
to be back in them. Their friendliness appeals to me, as does the spirit 
of this great Conference. 

I am happy to bring you greetings from the Saints and missionaries 
of the Canadian mission, and to tell you that they are all well and happy. 
I know how those Saints would enjoy what you are enjoying today. As 
our broadcast went to them Sunday it would be the first time that many 
of them had heard our president and his counselors, and they were 
prepared to receive those messages. 

For some of you who may not know, may I say that the Canadian 
mission covers the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick, in Canada, and Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the United States. It is a beautiful country. There are no more 
beautiful cities, I think, any place, than the city of Toronto, our head- 
quarters. The fertile valleys of Ontario are beautiful. I think there 
are no more fruitful areas on the American continent than we find there. 
We go from there, however, out to frontier sections in Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick and northern Maine, where we find people still using 
ox teams in the lumber camps and on the farms. 

I have been especially impressed with the culture and refinement 
of the Canadian people. The boys and girls who come to the Canadian 
mission are likewise impressed with the refinement of those people who 
have seemed to bring with them the culture and refinement of the Old 
World. They are more like the people of Europe, I believe, than they 
are like our own people. They are in the center of great educational 
institutions, and their schools are wonderfully fine. I have been espe- 
cially impressed with two outstanding things among those people : one 
is that in ten months in Canada I have never heard swearing. I thought 
it was possibly because I had not been where people swear, but I have 
children in school, both in high school and in the grades, and they, too, 
tell me they do not hear young people swear. The other outstanding 
thing is the strict observance of the Sabbath day. In the city of Toronto, 
with eight hundred and fifty thousand people, there are no amusements 
open on Sunday, no athletic games, and the people seem not to feel 
that they are deprived of any of their rights, but they are happy in the 
observance of the Sabbath day. 

Yet, among this fine people, with this culture and refinement, we 
find one difficulty in our missionary work, and that is the difficulty of 
an audience. We really should present our calling card or have a formal 
introduction before we can be invited into their homes. Many of the 
people through that area belong to churches that deny their people the 
right to read and converse on religious subjects. Many others belong 
to that group of "saved" people who have entrusted their salvation to 
their minister and feel that they can go happily along without responsi- 
bility. 

It reminds me of the prediction the Apostle Paul made in his 
epistle to Timothy when he said, "The time will come when they will 
not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap 
unto themselves teachers having itching ears ; and they shall turn away 
their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables." And it 
seems that that has become the truth in many places. We know that it 
is a truth that a closed shutter lets in no light. It makes no difference 
whether that shutter is closed because the light is too strong to bear or 
whether there is no light there to bear. If we get the truth before 
people, their mental shutters must be opened wide. It is one of the 
problems of the missionaries throughout that district to get people to 
listen to them. They are trying, through their own personalities and in 
other ways to get the mental shutters open — to get an audience. 

The missionaries feel their responsibility, and although we have had 
a long, -cold winter, they have found many means of presenting the 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



113 



Gospel to the people, so that we have found an increase in missionary 
activity in practically every department, and we have also found an 
increase in happiness because of the work done. I think our missionaries 
fully sense that when the Master said, "Ye are the salt of the world" and 
"Ye are the light of the world," he meant that for them also, and that 
they are to spread the savor of Christianity and so live that their lives 
will bring people to a knowledge of God. 

I think it is Fosdick who said of those verses that Jesus was saying 
to his disciples, "You are more than mere individuals ; you are represent- 
ing Me in the world ; you stand for My honor and My success in the 
world." 

It is an interesting thing to note that every man has a power to stand 
for something more than himself. It is an interesting thing that Latter- 
day Saints, wherever they go in the world, seem to stand for something, 
more than themselves. It is interesting, I think, for us as Latter-day 
Saints to occasionally check on ourselves, ask ourselves, what do we 
stand for in the community where we live. Among the people that we 
associate with, what human interests or what turn of character do we 
represent? It is a beautiful thing to have the satisfaction of feeling 
that we do represent the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
We feel happy to have people know that our actions are determined 
by the principles of the Gospel. 

In 2nd Nephi, the twenty-eighth chapter and thirtieth verse, we 
read: 

For behold, thus saith the Lord God : I will give unto the children of 
men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, 
and blessed arc those who hearken unto my precepts and lend an ear to 
my counsel, fcr they shall learn wisdom. For unto him that receiveth 
I will give more, and from them that shall say, We have enough, from 
them shall be taken even that which they have. 

Truly it is in the power of every Latter-day Saint to accomplish 
what the Lord has said, and if we will accept what he has given us he 
will add unto us ; but if we say we have enough, then there will be taken 
from us even that which we have. 

Many people marvel at the happiness of the missionary and many 
question his truthfulness when he says, "It is the happiest time of my 
life." But they seem not to understand that some one who has analyzed 
the Master's life, truly said, "The source of the Master's joy was 
beyond the power of men and circumstances." Nothing that men or 
circumstances could do could rob him of his joy. We remember also 
that he said to his disciples, "My joy I give unto you, and your joy 
no man taketh from you." 

It is the missionary, then, who has this joy that is not at the mercy 
of men or circumstances, who can be happy though he labor all the day 
long and receive no welcome from those he approaches, because no 
man has power to take his joy from him. May God grant unto all 
missionaries this joy.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Now in conclusion may I say to the parents that we are happy to 
have your sons and daughters there with us. Sister Rich and I are 
doing our best to guard their health and keep them happy. We appreciate 
them, and we appreciate the missionary work that you are doing in the 
fine letters of encouragement and happiness that you write to them. 

May the Lord bless you and them and us, to carry to a successful 
conclusion this work we have begun, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

President of the California Mission 

My brothers and sisters : I thought that I had fixed matters so 
that I would not be called upon to speak at this conference, but it seems 
I am not a good fixer. 

I am thrilled to be here and to have felt the spirit that has been in 
each of the sessions of this conference. I come from sunny California. 
1 bring you the greetings first of Alonzo A. Hinckley, one of God's 
noblemen, who is sojourning there for a time in an endeavor to regain 
his health. Since his arrival there he has gained three pounds in weight, 
but he is yet a very sick man 

I bring you the greetings of the missionaries, one hundred and 
twenty-three of them, — clean, noble, devout workers in this great cause. 
Recently the president of one of the districts said to me, "President 
Smith, Elder so-and-so is district president timber. He is laboring in 
this portion of the field. You can't move him to any other district 
because of the asthma which he has, and his mission will be finished 
about the time mine is. Will you make him the district president and 
let me be just a missionary?" 

That is the sort of spirit that our boys and our girls have, — a desire 
to be helpful, a desire to be unselfish ; and it is their unselfishness and 
their lives that have touched so many people. 

I bring you the greetings of nine thousand members of the 
California mission — Latter-day Saints. In the branches now repre- 
sented in the mission the increase in tithes for 1935 over the year 1934 
was some twenty-five per cent. 

We have had some very beautiful experiences in this matter of 
tithing. I thought as President Richards was talking this morning, 
what a fine showing some of these branches and some of the wards of 
this Church make. My thoughts went to Chino valley, a little branch 
that has had five per cent of its membership in the mission field, and of 
the forty-two members that began the first of the year forty-one of them 
were on the tithing record before the end of the year. And the branch 
president said, "Well, the other one moved away or he would have been 
on the tithing record also." 

I intimated to my branch presidents that I thought it would be a 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 



115 



fine thing if every man, woman and child in the California mission could 
be upon the tithing record. In response to that suggestion I received 
a letter from President David Haymore of Douglas, Arizona. 

President Haymore said, "President Smith, there are two hundred 
and seventy-one members of record in the Douglas branch of the 
church, and at the end of the year 1935 there will be two hundred! and 
seventy-one on the tithing record." 

I smiled at the suggestion, but when the year ended and we counted 
up, to my surprise I discovered that President Haymore had made a 
mistake. He had two hundred and seventy-five tithe-payers and two- 
hundred and seventy-one members in his branch. 

He told me this beautiful story. "President Smith, this has in- 
fluenced my life with respect to the matter of tithing. A little child 
came in to see how many times he had paid his tithing, and as he checked 
over the record there was a penny here and a penny there and a nickel 
here. He noticed some of the other names that came under his initial, 
and he said to President Haymore, "Daddy's name and Mother's name 
are not there." 

President Haymore said, "No, Daddy and Mother haven't paid any 
tithing this year, my boy." 

So this little one went home disappointed and broken-hearted, and 
said to his mother, "Mother, Daddy's name and your name are not on 
the tithing record." 

That mother, with tears in her eyes, said, "Thank you, my boy ; they 
will be there." And so they are there now. So a little child led them. 

I am delighted to have heard the report of our church activities 
and the great amount of money that has been expended throughout the 
past year. I know there has been an increase in tithes, from the reports 
I have heard from other wards and stakes and branches of the Church, 
and I am delighted to be a representative of the Church, happy to 
associate with the fine young men and women and the noble people 
amongst whom I live in sunny California. 

May God grant that we may ever have in our hearts a desire to 
test him. For you will remember that he said, "Try me and see." Amen. 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

Humbly I stand before you, my brothers and sisters, yet deeply 
grateful to the Lord for the privilege of representing at this great Con- 
ference the approximately one hundred and fifty missionaries and eight- 
een thousand Saints of the Southern States mission. They are looking 
to you here as their leaders and rejoice in every good report that reaches 
them of your achievements and accomplishments. 

When the Master was upon the earth, he was wont to say: "Know 
ye not that these things must be that the scriptures may be fulfilled?" 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I have sat here and contemplated what a marvelous fulfilment of the 
prophecies of the scriptures we see about us in the establishment of this 
Church in these valleys of the mountains. 

I desire to read a few words here today from the eleventh chapter 
of Isaiah, quoted by Moroni when first he visited the prophet Joseph 
Smith, in connection with the bringing forth of this great gospel dispensa- 
tion. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand 
again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, * * * and 
he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts 
of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four 
corners of the earth." 

That which has been said here during this Conference and that 
which we have observed indicate that the Lord has set up an ensign unto 
the nations. This great assembly, the. beautiful temple upon this block, 
these wise leaders who are here to teach us the way of eternal life, these 
wonderful singers who have come up to "sing in the height of Zion," and 
you brethren and sisters who have come from the valleys that have been 
made "to blossom as the rose," because the Lord has opened "rivers 
in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys," are all evidences 
of the Lord's fulfilment of his promises. 

But the Lord did not indicate that he would set up an ensign by 
the erection of beautiful buildings and the subduing of the desert only, 
but he said he would assemble unto this land the nations of the earth, 
to teach them of his ways, which contemplates the appointment of men 
and women to labor in the vineyard at home and in the nations of the 
earth. Jeremiah expresses this thought in these words : "I will take 
you one of a city and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion, 
and I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed 
you with knowledge and understanding." Surely we have been taught 
of his ways and have received knowledge and understanding here at 
this Conference. 

Then Jeremiah tells us that the Lord would send for many fishers 
and they would fish them, and after for many hunters and they would 
hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes 
of the rocks. I want to say to you fathers and mothers that we are 
mighty happy to have in our mission approximately a hundred and fifty 
of these "fishers and hunters," your sons and daughters, who are fishing 
and hunting the seed of Israel and gathering them into the fold, and it 
is my testimony to you that when men and women are called of God to 
become "fishers and hunters" they are endowed with a power that no 
man of himself can give. Therefore, when these missionaries go forth 
among the children of men they go armored of God to accomplish his 
purposes and gather his people, and their influence and power is felt 
wherever they go, as people who have met them are happy to testify. 

The other day, in passing through one of our large cities, I drove 
up to a door and said, "Do the Mormon missionaries live here?" To 
which the lady replied, "Yes, and they are the finest young men I have 
ever met." 



ELDER LEG RAND RICHARDS 



117 



Upon another occasion, we sent missionaries into a new city to 
open up the work in that section. The city officials were not sure they 
wanted to permit them to engage in their work there. The lady with 
whom they were boarding said, "I have some influence in this city, 1 
will see what I can do." She took these missionaries to her church the 
next Sunday and introduced them to her class and said, "They neither 
smoke nor drink, nor use tea or coffee ; and they don't look like 'sissies,' 
either, do they?" Then she asked, "Which one of you in this class would 
be willing to do for your church what these boys are doing?" 

Following the visit of Elder Melvin J. Ballard at Jacksonville, 
Fla., on Dec. 8, 1935, one of the elders, with only thirty-five cents 
in his pocket, started out to return to his field of labor in South Georgia. 
He attempted to hitch-hike on the highway without the usual success, 
apparently for a wise purpose. About nine o'clock in the evening he 
found himself still quite a distance from his field of labor, so he decided 
he would "tract-in" (seek entertainment) for the night. 

After being unsuccessful at two homes, he called at the third and 
was met at the door by a minister of the Gospel. He introduced himself 
as a Mormon missionary, whereupon he was invited in. The minister 
explained that he was in deep distress — that his little daughter was very 
sick and the doctor gave them no hope of her recovery. By this time, 
they had entered the living roorii where the family were sitting, and the 
doctor was at the side of the bed upon which the little girl was lying. 

The minister remarked, "You believe in anointing the sick with oil, 
do you not?" To which the elder replied in the affirmative. He then 
added, "I wish you would anoint my little girl — I have prayed for her 
without avail," and he offered the missionary a bottle of olive oil. The 
elder asked if it had been consecrated, to which the minister replied, 
"I am afraid I do not understand what you mean ;" so the elder suggested 
that he would use his own oil, as he had a small bottle with him, and 
he invited the family to kneel with him about the bed to engage in 
prayer before performing the sacred ordinance. They seemed rather 
reluctant as though they had given up all hope. The doctor remarked, 
"Maybe the Lord can save her but I cannot." The elder led in prayer 
and then administered to the little girl, and as he removed his hands from 
her head she relaxed, and the doctor immediately reached for her pulse 
as though he feared she was breathing her last. 

For about twenty minutes, the elder sat visiting with the minister 
and his family, at which time the doctor again felt the girl's pulse and 
remarked, "There is no need of my remaining any longer — your little 
girl will be all right. I have seen it with my own eyes and yet I cannot 
believe it." 

Addressing the elder, the minister said, "You were seeking a bed for 
the night, were you not?" And being informed by the missionary that 
he was, he explained that he was not prepared to accommodate hint, 
but that he was willing to take him to the hotel and pay for his room, or 
he would drive him in his auto wherever he wanted to go. He explained 
that his destination was sixty miles from there, but the minister was 



118 



G ENE RA L C NEE FENCE 



])erfectly willing to take him that distance, and upon reaching his destina- 
tion, the minister offered the elder ten dollars for what he had done in 
his home, hut he refused to accept the money, explaining the instruction 
of the Master to the Twelve when he sent them forth: "Freely ye have 
received, freely give." 

I thank my Heavenly Father for the privilege of laboring with the 
fine missionaries who have been sent out to "recover the remnant of 
his people" and "hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, 
and out of the holes of the rocks," and for the marvelous manner in 
which he is opening the hearts of the children of men to receive their 
testimonies. 

God bless this people, this Church and our leaders and our mission- 
aries, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

AUDITING COMMITTEE'S REPORT 

"Salt Lake City, Utah, March 31, 1936. 

President Heber J. Grant, 
Dear President : 

We have examined the Financial Report of the Church for the 
year 1935, which also includes the Presiding Bishop's department. 

The Church is free from indebtedness, its financial condition is 
sound, the accounting is modern and complete. We heartily commend 
the careful management of Church finances by the First Presidency 
and the General Authorities of the Church. 

Respectfully submitted, 
O. W. Adams, 
John W. Hart, 
John F. Bennett, 

Auditing Committee." 

EXPRESSES APPRECIATION OF SINGING 

I am very pleased indeed to express my deep appreciation of the 
beautiful singing that we have had by the Relief Society Singing Mothers, 
the Hyrum Stake Choir, and the Tabernacle Choir. I rejoice in the 
splendid work of Brother Frank Asper, of Brother J . Spencer Cornwall, 
and of all who have helped make this conference so interesting to those 
who have attended. 

AN INSPIRATIONAL CONFERENCE 

Considering that it is a week day, I feel that we have a very won- 
derful and splendid audience here this afternoon. I do not need to say 
to you people who have attended the conference that to me it has been 
a red-letter day in the history of the Church. 

I believe that we have had greater opportunity to carry our message 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



119 



to the world than ever hefore in our history. I am grateful for the 
inspiration of the Lord that has been manifested here in the speeches 
that have been made. I am glad that the brethren have been able to 
keep within the proper time limit in their remarks. Frequently there is 
not time for all to speak. We have thirty-three speakers; if each 
takes two minutes more time than he should, it amounts to one hour and 
six minutes. 

MEMBERS OF GENERAL AUTHORITIES ABSENT 

I regret that I overlooked announcing that Brother J. Golden Kim- 
ball has been absent from this conference on account of ill-health. Of 
course, you all know that Brother Joseph F. Merrill is in Europe presid- 
ing over the European missions. Brother Merrill is meeting with great 
success in his labors in Europe. Brother Alonzo A. Hinckley is in 
California where he is improving in health. 

An anthem, "Great is Jehovah," was sung by the Choir (Relief 
Society Singing Mothers), after which the benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Joseph L. Wirthlin, President of the Bonneville Stake. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The singing at the Friday sessions of the Conference by the Hyrum 
Stake Choir, was under the direction of W. H. Terry; the singing at 
the Sunday sessions was by the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir, J. Spencer 
Cornwall, Conductor ; Sister Charlotte O. Sackett directed the singing of 
the Relief Society Singing Mothers at the Monday sessions ; J. Spencer 
Cornwall led the congregational singing at all the sessions. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played 
by Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

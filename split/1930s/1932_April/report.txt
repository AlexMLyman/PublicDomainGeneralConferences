CA c Ohrilling Story of 

CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 



H 



ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

auditorium and galleries were almost completely filled with people who 
had assembled from all parts of the Church. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and called the Conference to 
order by announcing the opening hymn, "Now let us rejoice in the day 
of salvation," which was sung by the congregation. 

Elder Willard Young offered the opening prayer. 

Sister Edith Grant Young sang a solo "The City four square." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice exceedingly in having the opportunity of again meeting 
with the Latter-day Saints in General Conference. 

It has been customary for many years in the opening of these con- 
ferences to give a statement regarding the expenditures in the various 
stakes of Zion, and for other purposes. 

The expenditures by the Church for the year 1931 are as follows : 

Stake and Ward Purposes: 

There has been returned from the tithes to the stakes and 
wards for the construction of ward and stake meeting 
houses $ 545,630.69

which has been taken from the tithes and other Church 
funds and returned by the Trustee-in-Trust to the 
Saints for the maintenance and operation of the stakes 
and wards for the maintenance and operation of 
Church schools and Temples, for charities and mission 
activities. 

Other Charities: 

In addition to charities paid from the tithes as before 
named, there has also been disbursed the fast offerings, 
other charities, and assistance rendered by the Relief 
Society in the sum of $455,423.46, which amount, 
added to the $224,556.38 paid from the tithes, makes 
the total, charity assistance rendered by the Church. .$ 679,979.84 

There has been collected by the various wards of the Church 

and paid to missionaries to assist in their maintenance 66,783.90 

MEMBERS SPEND MILLION 

Undoubtedly there has been expended by the people themselves, 
in sending missionaries out into the world and taking care of them 
while there, considerably more than one million dollars.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SOCIAL STATISTICS 



Birth rate, 29 per thousand. 

Marriage rate, 12.8 per thousand. 

Death rate, 6.6 per thousand. 

Families owning their own homes, 65.2 per cent. 

HOME OWNING URGED 

Our records show that in years gone by over 75 per cent of the 
people owned their own homes. There is a spiritual growth always 
when people own their own homes. The owning of a home creates a 
spirit of loyalty to the Church and also, really, to the government. It is 
illustrated somewhat in an incident that I heard regarding a noble- 
man in France who was very wealthy. His butler, who drew a large 
salary, attended socialistic meetings. The nobleman noticed that the 
butler had discontinued attending these meetings and asked the reason. 

Said he: "At the last meeting a report was made of how much 
per capita everybody would receive when all of the wealth was ap- 
propriated and distributed, and already I have more in the savings bank 
than would come to me." 

It cured him completely.

LAUDS THOSE DEAD 

I am sure that those of us who had the opportunity of attending the 
funeral of President Charles W. Nibley felt very grateful for the re- 
markable spirit that was present and for the very splendid tributes that 
were paid to him. I had that privilege and I rejoice in the spirit of the 
occasion, and in the excellent remarks. 

I regret that I was in the East at the time of the funeral of the 
Patriarch. But from what I have read of the services I am very pleased 
indeed with the tributes paid to him. 

In addition to these officials of the Church whose names I have read, 
who have passed away during the time since our last Conference, the 
editor of the Improvement Era,_ and former president of Liberty stake 
of Zion, Brother Hugh J. Cannon, has also passed away. Brother Can- 
non presided over the Swiss and German mission many years ago when 
I was president of the European mission. 

He subsequently returned to Germany and Switzerland and ful- 
filled a third mission, he having been there originally as a young mis- 
sionary, not presiding. Brother Cannon, as you are all aware, filled a 
mission with Brother David O. McKay, taking a trip around the world, 
visiting all the missions of the Church, I believe, with the exception of 
South Africa. I rejoice in the splendid record that Brother Hugh J. 
Cannon made in every Church position that he occupied. He was a man 
of God, a man worthy of the respect and admiration of all people. 

RECEIVES LETTER 

I received this morning a letter from Brother Robert I. Burton, 
president of Mount Ogden stake. Among other things he says : 

"The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the source of the greatest comfort 
and joy to me, and I never tire of its message. Attendance at the Con- 
ference thrills and stimulates me more than I am able to tell. I count it 
as one of the great blessings of my life, that I have been permitted to 
become personally acquainted with you and other General Authorities 
of the Church and to labor with you in a humble way in the great cause 
of our Heavenly Father. I know of the cleanness and purity of your 
life, and I am filled with righteous indignation when I read such scur- 
rilous attacks as are made against you in a little four page sheet recently 
issued. It seems to me that something should be clone with men who 
send such slanderous vilifications through the mail." 

MALICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS 

I received the sheet to which he refers and it found its place in the 
waste basket. I did not read a word of it. When men have so lived 
that they are unworthy to be in the Church and are cast out, they are 
wasting their time sending me printed matter or written matter. The 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

waste basket is large and capable of holding all such communications. 
It is a little disappointing in one sense not to take action against pre- 
meditated falsifiers. 

I am tempted to ask the government to prosecute the people who 
use the mails to circulate malicious falsehoods. But there is something 
about the fact that when you handle a smoky, sooty stove-pipe you get 
your hands soiled, and it is a question whether such lies are worthy of 
any consideration. 

DENIES CHARGES 

In all my travels I have never paid any attention to a certain Lulu 
Shepherd, perhaps the greatest female liar who ever drew the breath of 
life. I cannot help but wish that some of her falsehoods were true. In 
a synopsis of one of her lectures in Brooklyn, she is reported to have 
said I owned Union Pacific and other railroad preferred stocks and 
bonds amounting to one hundred million dollars, and I did not have a 
dollar of such securities. I could wish' I had the millions of dollars' 
worth of stocks and bonds for which she gave me credit. In this lecture 
she is reported to have named nine states of the Union that I controlled 
politically, and to have said that no man could be the president of the 
United States without my consent. The states as I remember were 
Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Ne- 
vada and New Mexico. Instead of controlling those states I did not 
know the names of the governors of any of them except Idaho and Ari- 
zona, and of course our own state. And I do not know that I would 
have known personally the governor of Idaho if the president of the 
United States at that time — Warren G. Harding — had not introduced 
me to him when he came into the President's car as I was riding up to 
Idaho Falls and Pocatello — not as a guest of the President, but as a 
guest of the vice president and general manager of the Oregon Short 
Line Railroad company in his private car. 

"mormons" lauded 

I do not know that I would have known the Governor of Arizona 
were it not for the fact that we had had a convention of governors here 
at the Capitol and Governor Campbell was one of those who did us the 
honor of calling at our office. When I met him I shook hands with him 
and said : 

"Governor, I heard a very interesting story regarding a statement 
made by your predecessor. It was that among the best of the citizens of 
Arizona in early days were the 'Mormon' pioneers, and that in one par- 
ticular the 'Mormons' were being robbed out of a share of the public 
funds of Arizona. They were losing from twenty-five hundred to three 
thousand per cent of their share of the criminal taxes ; as they were en- 
titled to have, in proportion to their number, twenty-five or thirty in- 
mates in the state penitentiary, and had but one. When I went to Ari- 
zona I mentioned this fact in a meeting in St. Johns, and the District 
Judge arose and said : 'That one has since been pardoned.' " 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

The Governor smiled and said : "Mr. Grant, that is correct. He 
was pardoned." 

INTEGRITY PLEASES 

I rejoice in the integrity of the Latter-day Saints, I rejoice in the 
absolute honesty of the men who have held positions as the General 
Authorities in this Church, the falsehoods of any human being to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 

I rejoice in the fact that when I was in England I carried a letter 
from non-"Mormon" bankers in Salt Lake City vouching for me as a 
gentleman of unquestioned integrity and honesty, and from bankers in 
San Francisco, Chicago and New York, containing the same kind of 
recommendation. I remember calling on a newspaper that had published 
seven to ten columns, I am sure, of vile misrepresentations about us, 
carrying with me a letter of introduction from the shipping firm with 
whom we had done business for over sixty years, not only vouching for 
my honesty and integrity, but for that of every president of the Euro- 
pean mission during that period. And yet the assistant editor of the 
paper positively refused to publish one word of refutation. I pleaded 
with him to no avail. 

ANSWERS EDITOR 

I walked to the door, turned and said : 

"By-the-way, my letter was not to you. It was to the editor. The 
boy who came down stairs announced that the editor was absent but 
that the assistant editor, Mr. Robinson, would receive me. Is your name 
Robinson?" 

"Yes." 

"Do you know Phil Robinson?" 

"Why everybody knows Phil Robinson." 

I said : "Was he the correspondent of the London Daily Tele- 
graph during the Boer War, one of the two greatest [and I emphasized 
"greatest" because his paper was not one of the two] newspapers in 
Great Britain?" 

"He was." 

"And would you believe anything that Phil Robinson said?" 

"I would." 

"Is he editing the Court and Societv Journal here in London?" 

"He is." 

CHALLENGES PROOF 

"Seeing that you believe anything this gentleman says, buy his book 
entitled 'Sinners and Saints,' it will cost you two shillings, and you wijl 
find that everything you have published in your paper about the 'Mor- 
mons' is a lie pure and simple. Phil Robinson traveled from Idaho in 
the north to Arizona in the south, through all of our settlements, with 
the late John Henry Smith, and he met our people, and yon will find if 
you will read his book that you have published a lot of falsehoods. I 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

defy you to get a letter of introduction vouching for the honesty of any 
person who has furnished you the information that has been printed in 
your paper against us, and I have in my valise letters from bankers in 
Utah and from bankers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, 
vouching for my honesty, and I brand your publication as false." 

"Well," he said, "you surprise me, that Phil Robinson would vouch 
for your people." 

ASKS FOR HALF COLUMN 

"Oh," I said, "you are not the first person that has been surprised 
when he ran up against the 'Mormon' question." 

He said, "Write us a half column." 

I said, "Small favors thankfully received; large ones in proportion. 
Seven to ten columns of misrepresentations and a half column of refu- 
tation. You shall have it within the next two hours." 

He received it all right and kept it thirty or sixty days and returned 
it with the usual printed slip that I have seen very often: "The editor 
regrets that he cannot find space for the enclosed manuscript, which is 
returned." 

ATTITUDE CHANGES 

What a change has come about ! Today reporters attend our meet- 
ings in all parts of the British Isles and make fair reports of everything 
that goes on. Three whole years in England without one single line of 
refutation in any newspaper when I presided there. The wonderful work 
accomplished by Brother Talmage, and that is being accomplished by 
Brother Widtsoe, in getting us before the public honestly and fairly, in 
our missions in Europe, has filled my heart with joy and gratitude. 

SEVENTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATED 

It may not be out of place today for me to make a few remarks that 
are personal in their nature. I never expected when I was a young man 
to live to announce that I had celebrated my seventy-fifth birthday. I 
often said in my youth that if I could live twenty-five per cent longer 
than my father who died when he was forty, I would be perfectly sat- 
isfied with life, which would be until I was fifty years of age. Today I 
have lived fifty per cent longer than that, and to be perfectly frank with 
you, I am not quite satisfied with life now, but would like to live a 
little longer. 

THANKFUL FOR HEALTH 

I rejoice in what I have seen in the seventy-five years of my life. It 
may sound a little egotistical, but few men reach the age of seventy-five 
years in perfect vigor of health of body and mind, and I desire in this 
Conference to express to my Heavenly Father and to the people com- 
posing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, my gratitude for 
this vigor of body and of mind, and for the health that I possess. I am 
grateful, beyond all of my ability to express my gratitude, for the pray- 
ers and the faith and the good will of the Latter-day Saints. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 9 

APPRECIATIVE OF LOVE AND CONFIDENCE OF SAINTS 

There is nothing in the world, I am sure, that a man should value 
so highly as the love of those with whom he is associated, and I appre- 
ciate very greatly the love and confidence of. the Latter-day Saints and 
of the officers of the Church. That this has been extended to me fills my 
heart with gratitude beyond all my ability to express it, and the bless- 
ings that have come to me from my Heavenly Father and the honors 
that have come to me in being permitted to stand here representing his 
Son Jesus Christ in the restored Gospel, fill my heart to overflowing. 

FAITH IN THE GOSPEL 

I am grateful beyond expression that from the time I was a boy of 
fifteen, and entered the office of a non-member of the Church — working 
for non-members of the Church from then until just before I was 
twenty, when I went into business for myself — I am grateful that I have 
never found anything at home or abroad, in all these sixty years, that has 
in the slightest degree lessened my faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

But, on the contrary, I have been constantly finding additional evi- 
dences of the divinity of the work in which you and I are engaged. This 
a' source of the keenest gratification to me. Evidences of the 



is 



f> 



divinity of the work have come to me from time to time, some of them 
very strong. 

STRANGE EVIDENCE 

I have often mentioned it in public, that while I was being enter- 
tained at a dinner in London by one of the managers of the great New 
York Life Insurance Company I met a gentleman who had been connect- 
ed with the British Legation in Constantinople and who had spent years 
in the Holy Land. He had been to America a number of times. I spent 
the evening, after dinner, chatting with him because of his remarkable ex- 
periences and the interesting things he had to say. Finally he said to me : 

"Mr. Grant, do you know that I ran across the most inexplicable 
thing of my life the last time I visited Canada. I went way up into 
the northern wilds of Canada, beyond all civilization, visiting with those 
heathen Indians. I found among them the exact pattern, woven in col- 
ored beads, of Holy Land rugs, and in no other part of the world that 
I have visited have I seen any rugs of the same pattern as those oriental 
rugs in the Holy Land, and in some sections certain patterns have come 
down for hundreds, almost thousands of years, in one family. They 
have no fabrics up among those Indians with which to do weaving, but 
they had the exact patterns, yet they had never heard of Jerusalem, and 
it is the most inexplicable thing of my life." 

I said : "That is very easy to a Mormon. Have you ever heard of 
the Book of Mormon?" 

"No." 

"I will send you a copy. It is the Bible, so to speak, of the Ameri- 
can Indians, their sacred history, and you will find that the forefathers 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of the American Indians and other peoples who have been on this con- 
tinent came from Jerusalem." 

He said: "What! That explains the inexplicable." 
Now that may not be. counted by some as much of a straw of evi- 
dence, but to my mind it is a very great evidence regarding the divine 
authenticity of the Book of Mormon. 

INTIMATE WITH BRIGHAM YOUNG 

I am grateful to bear witness to this audience that from the time I 
was a little child not more than five, I am sure, until the day of his death, 
when I was nearly twenty-one, I was very intimate with Brigham Young ; 
that when the bell would ring for family prayers, quite frequently I 
would run through our back lot across through Brother George A. 
Smith's lot and across the street, and kneel down in President Rrigham 
Young's home at family prayers. 

I knew him intimately, as I say, from the time I was five or six 
years of age. I was born where the Z. C. M. I. store now stands. Fath- 
er's lot was 165 feet front by 330 feet deep, the lot just like it on the 
south was occupied by Edward Hunter, and a lot of the same size on the 
north was occupied by Daniel H. Wells, two of as God-fearing, kind, 
splendid men as ever drew the breath of life. T grew up under their 
tutorship to a certain extent. 

RECALLS LAST INTERVIEW 

The last interview I had with Brigham Young was on the very day 
he was taken sick. I met him coming out of his office with a cape on his 
arm and I said : 

"President Young, I was elected yesterday the assistant cashier of 
Zion's Savings Bank, and I have been told this morning that I must give 
a bond of twenty-five thousand dollars to vouch for my honesty. It oc- 
curs to me that it would be very appropriate and a nice thing for the 
president of the bank to sign the bond of the assistant cashier." 

He smiled and said : "Heber, I have had a very strenuous day. I 
am just going for a ride. I shall be glad to sign the bond. I do not see 
how I could get out of it because I said so many good things about you 
in the directors' meeting yesterday, (or the day before, I have forgotten 
which) about your integrity and honesty and favoring you for this job; 
and if I refuse to sign your bond now, the directors would say, 'What 
did you say all those good things about him for if you are afraid to sign 
his bond?'" 

He came home, was taken sick and passed away. I am sure, from 
my own experience and all of the symptoms that were published in the 
paper, he died of appendicitis. During all those years of my acquaint- 
ance with him, fully fifteen, I learned to love and respect him as a man 
of God, a man of great ability. 

GREATNESS RECOGNIZED 

I remember saying to the vice president of a great bank with hun- 
dreds of millions of dollars, that the day would come when Brigham 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 11 

Young would be acknowledged as one of the greatest pioneers and col- 
onizers who ever lived. 

He said : "Why say the day will come ? No man who knows any- 
thing of the accomplishments of Brigham Young but what could say the 
day has come." 

WANTED LARGE STATE 

Do you know that all this trouble about the Hoover dam and the 
division of water never would have come about if we had got all that 
President Young tried to get. 

All that he asked for when he knocked for admission into the Union 
as the State of Deseret was all of Utah, fully one-half of Colorado, a 
little patch down in New Mexico so as to take in the San Juan River, all 
of Arizona, Nevada as far as the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Idaho way 
up into the north, and one-third of what is now California. 

Los Angeles . and that whole section would have been included. 
Every drop of water that goes into the Hoover dam would have been in 
the State of Deseret. Texas would not have been in it for size. This 
shows the great capacity of the man. He sent scouts into the various 
sections of the country, realizing as he did that irrigation was what was 
going to count, through the inspiration of the Lord, in this country, and 
he arranged to get all of the watershed of the Colorado River. 

LAUDS PREDECESSORS 

As you all know I was chosen as one of the Apostles during the ad- 
ministration of John Taylor, a God-fearing, inspirational man. I can 
vouch absolutely from my intimate association with him from the day 
I was made an Apostle, two years after he became the president, to the 
day of his death, for the inspiration of the living God that came to him 
and the nobility and uprightness of his life. 

I can say the same of Wilford Woodruff during his administration, 
and of Lorenzo Snow. I can say the same thing of President Joseph F. 
Smith, than whom I am sure no man has lived more in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints from the days of the Prophet Joseph to his day as the 
president of the Church. I rejoice in my knowledge of the integrity of 
their lives, their honesty, and their devotion to God, and that the first and 
foremost thing with them was to labor for the Gospel and the spread of 
truth upon the earth. 

LETTER PLEASES 

I rejoice in a letter that I received from the general manager of one 
of the greatest life insurance companies in the world when I was made 
an Apostle. He said : 

"I owe an apology, Heber, to your fourteen associates in the Presi- 
dency and Apostles. I have always thought they were a designing lot, 
that they were getting rich because of the religious enthusiasm and the 
ignorance of the people of your Church, gathering in their tithes, etc. 
But now that you are one of the fifteen, I apologize to the other fourteen. 
If they were not honest and upright men they would not dare invite you 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

into their councils, because if there were anything crooked you would 
give the whole thing away. I know you are fundamentally honest from 
the crown of your head to the soles of your feet." 

No truer statement was ever made by mortal man than that by Josh 
Billings: "Never judge a man. by his relatives, he cannot help them, 
they are crowded upon him; but judge him by the company he keeps, 
because he picks his own." 

PRAISED BY MILLIONAIRE 

I met a millionaire on the street — the late David Wood — the next 
morning after Anthony W. Ivins was made an Apostle, and he said : 

"Hold on, Grant, don't walk so fast. I want to tell you something. 
I am glad you are running your Mormon Church just to suit me. If you 
had come down to my office yesterday and said, 'Dave Wood, you have 
lived among this people for twenty-five years ; you have been a friend 
of the 'Mormons' not only in the United States but in foreign lands ; you 
have spoken well of them ; you have a 'Mormon' bishop managing your 
business in Idaho — now I have been told to come down here, as you have 
met the leading men of the Church from Canada on the north to Mexico 
on the south, to say that the Apostles want to express their gratitude for 
your friendship, and we will let you name the very best man to fill the 
vacancy in the quorum of Apostles,' — do you know, Grant, I would not 
have batted an eye or taken a breath, but I would have just hollered, 
'Ivins.' I am glad you are running your Church to suit me. Good day." 

REJOICES IN GOOD WILL 

I rejoice in the good will of those who know us. I have said many 
times that a man who so lived that those who knew him best, loved him 
most, and whom God loved, was entitled to be crowned with the wreath 
of success although he might die in poverty; and I do know that the 
Lord has seen fit to love, and did love and did inspire all of my pre- 
decessors. 

I am happy in the good will that exists, I believe, for this people. 
Not only in the United States, but wherever I go today I am treated 
with respect. When I think of going to Kansas City some years ago and 
there speaking before the Knife and Fork club which is claimed to be the 
second greatest dinner club in the United States, and speaking on the 
accomplishments of the Latter-day Saints for a full hour — the other 
speakers, one of them the president of a great university, being limited 
to thirty minutes — and I being advertised as the guest of the evening, 
and receiving applause, and then being invited to 'come back again and 
speak before the Chamber of Commerce in Kansas City, my heart is filled 
with gratitude. Where was this? It was within ten miles of Independ- 
ence, from which place the Latter-day Saints had been expelled under an 
exterminating order of the acting-governor of the state. 

EARLY PERSECUTIONS 

I have been reading again lately the wonderful record of the Mis- 
souri persecutions and the fall of Nanvoo, by Elder Brigham H. Roberts, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 13 

and as I think of those terrible things that happened — imprisonment, the 
sentence of death passed upon the Prophet, the Patriarch and others ; the 
murders at Haun's Mill ; the battle at Crooked River ; the driving out of 
the remnant of the Saints from Nauvoo in the dead of winter and their 
crossing the river on the ice — when I think of all these things that the 
early Saints had to endure, it seems to me that this depression is a good 
deal in the nature of a flea-bite in comparison. 

(JUOTES POEM 

I see the time has expired. You will pardon me for being personal, 
but you know they say when a person gets beyond 75 years of age he 
cannot talk about anybody but himself, and likes to deal in reminiscences, 
that he has no thought for the future. I want to quote a few lines en- 
titled "Age" and say that they are my sentiments, although not original 
with me: 

"Age is a quality of mind ; 
If your dreams you've left behind, 

If hope is cold; 
If you no longer look ahead, 
If your ambitions' fires are dead — 
Then you are old. 

"But if from life you take the best, 
And if in life you keep the zest. 

If love you hold ; 
No matter how the years go by, 
No matter how the birthdays fly — 
You are not old." 

I do hold love for the Latter-day Saints. I do love my God, and I 
do love the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope to accomplish more in the 
next five years of my life than I have accomplished during any previous 
five years. May the Lord help us one and all to be loyal and true to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for 2 
prophet." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In nearly all of our Conferences we have been obliged to limit 
the time allotted to our mission presidents to five or six minutes each. 
We are going to start this Conference by giving the mission presidents 
ten minutes each. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

When our beloved President was speaking, these words of the Lord 
came to me: "And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the 
testimony of traitors." This is a continuing promise, fulfilled in the 
life and administration of every President of the Church. 

We are thankful for President Grant. His seventy-five years have 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

been blessings to the people of God and to all the people among whom 
he has moved. 

One of the most comforting and sustaining thoughts and influences 
in our lives is the love that the Lord Jesus Christ has for us. I believe 
that in these dark hours of gloom and trouble he weeps, because of the 
distress that exists among the children of men. And what shall separate 
us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? No. 

The testimony that Jesus is the Christ is the precious heritage of 
every faithful Latter-day Saint. How is this testimony secured? 

"This doth not spring from earthly soil, 

Nor from its wisdom grow; 
"Tis not evoked by student's toil, 

Though years hath crowned with snow." 

This testimony comes through obedience to the principles and or- 
dinances of the Gospel. The Lord says : 

"Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. 
"And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, 
the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh." 

A vision may grow dim with the flight of years, but the compan- 
ionship and testimony of the Holy Ghost, that sustaining power that 
forever abides with the faithful children of God, no length of time can 
dim ; no length of time can silence the voice which says : "This is the 
way; walk ye therein." No length of time can extinguish the lamp 
which is a light to our feet and a guide to our path. The testimony of 
the Spirit is clearest and strongest when we live close to God. 

The gift of the Holy Ghost is the spirit of revelation. This gift is 
enjoyed by the missionaries in their fields of labor, those splendid young 
men and young women whose sacrifice is sacred in the sight of God. 
Their loyalty to God and the Church leaders cannot be questioned. It 
is as firm as the rock of ages. These missionaries love their leaders. 
They are guided by that spirit of revelation which the Lord grants unto 
them for guidance in their own fields of labor, but not for the direction 
of the work of those who are in other parts of the vineyard. 

I testify unto you that as Moses possessed the spirit of revelation 
which enabled him to bring the children of Israel through the Red Sea 
on dry ground, so the spirit of revelation, the presence, the companion- 
ship, the guidance of the Holy Ghost is with our leaders, and they are 
leading us by that spirit. If we will follow them they will bring us 
through this mortal probation, into the celestial kingdom of God, therein 
to be the sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father and joint heirs 
with Jesus Christ. 

God bless our leaders. They are inspired of God, and we will fol- 
low them, with our Father's help, for he will bless the man who sustains 
those who preside over him. No man who has the gift of the Holy 
Ghost will ever be found criticising the oracles of God, entertaining a 
spirit of rebellion against them, or refusing to follow in their footsteps. 

This is my testimony, and I bear it in the fear of God and in hu- 
mility of soul, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 15 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my dear brethren and sisters, to be in attendance 
at this Conference. It has been my privilege for a good many years, as a 
representative of the Central States mission to attend the Conferences 
of this Church, and these Conferences have always been a great source of 
inspiration to me. They have been to me, in part, a guide during the 
time I have been in the mission field. The instruction and doctrine that 
come from the leaders of this Church are inspiring and when reproduced 
in the different magazines of the Church have been encouraging and 
beneficial when I reviewed them later in the mission field. 

I am not at all alarmed over the attacks that are being made upon 
the President and the leaders of this Church. It has always been the 
heritage of the Lord's anointed from the very beginning of time, that 
men who have held the authority of God in the earth have been subject 
to criticism and attack by men and women who are not well informed 
and who have wicked intentions. 

There are individuals, who because of their own transgressions, have 
ever found fault and criticised and persecuted our leaders from the days 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith until now. 

Often we find the more bitter enemies coming from within the 
Church membership. If such individuals ever had a testimony of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ they have forfeited their right to it, and as a re- 
sult they do not apparently recognize the gravity of the position they 
take and the attack they make upon the leaders of the Church. 

People who slander have never hindered the growth of the Church 
in the least, but my observation has been that it has increased the faith 
of those who are diligent in the work of the Lord. 

In my experience during the time I have lived in Missouri, in a 
period of twenty-five years, I have been able to observe that those lead- 
ers who were faithful in the discharge of their duty have made history 
that has always established faith among the children of men ; while those 
who fought the work of God in the early history of the Church, de- 
parted from the truth and were thus disloyal in their conduct, not only 
destroyed their own possibilities, but I have never found the descend- 
ants of those who fought the work of God, from then until now, to be 
faithful in the work of God. On the contrary, I have found them to be 
generally bitter enemies of the Lord's work. Those who stood by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and the rest of the Presi- 
dents and leaders of the Church from then until this present time, their 
descendants are found generally faithful and active and true to the trust 
in the organizations of the Church. The leaders of the Church have 
established the word of the Lord in the earth as instruments in his hands 
and will stand as witnesses for God, while those who oppose the author- 
ity of God in the earth will not have such a record. 

Most all of the places where the Church settled in Missouri and 
other places nearby are practically deserted. Places where once in- 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

dustrious men and women of this Church were building" great centers 
in that land and where everything pointed to greater industries and 
activities are now found to be almost desolate. 

One has only to make observation in these valleys of the mountains 
to recognize where the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ is vested. 
Those places in Missouri where the people once lived are nothing to 
compare with these cities and settlements in the valleys of the mountains. 
Any one who makes a study of the growth and development of the 
Church membership can readily observe that the life and light of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is found in the present membership of this 
Church. 

It has been an inspiration to have known President Grant these 
many years. I have been closely acquainted with him. To me, he has 
been as a father. T knew his predecessor, President Joseph F. Smith : 
he was as a father to me as well. They have been men that have guided 
me in many, many things with which a mission president has to deal in 
the mission field, and I know they are men of God. 

I have known the Apostles in this Church from the beginning of my 
ministry in 1904 until the present time. I have traveled with most of 
them in the mission field. They are men of great inspiration and power, 
and my testimony to the world is that these men are of God and that 
they are entrusted with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ in the 
earth. They will stand in the presence of our Eternal Father as his wit- 
nesses some day, to give testimony concerning the lives of men with 
whom they have lived. 

I know that men live after this life. I know that President Joseph 
F. Smith lives and that President Charles W. Nibley lives. I have seen 
them in my dreams since they have left us, and they are counseling in 
wisdom at the present time. 

I know that these leaders of the Church who sit on this stand are 
examples to all people with whom they come in contact. 

I listened to President Grant deliver a speech in Kansas City some 
years ago before the Knife and Fork club. Two hundred and fifty peo- 
ple at least were in attendance. He gave one of the most inspirational 
sermons I have ever heard. Men who were on the program to talk that 
night gave him as much of their time as he wanted. 

I heard President Ivins speak in a Boy Scout meeting in St. Louis 
and his was an inspirational and instructive address. I saw a man there 
who counted his money by the millions, yield his time to President Ivins. 
No finer tributes could be paid to these leaders of ours than were paid 
by those people who were not of our faith in the places where these two 
brethren were entertained at that time, and I know that men do have 
faith in the leaders of this Church. 

There are thousands of men and women in the world who love the 
truth and there are many of them who are searching for it earnestly. 
There are many preparing themselves to receive the Gospel. I know 
this is the work of God, — that this is his Church, that his priesthood is 
the governing power in the earth, and that the leaders in this Church, 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION 17 

with President Grant who presides at this time, hold their offices with 
authority. 

Ours is an individual responsibility. I bear this testimony to you 
and close with the words of William Ernest Henley, the poet: 

It matters not how strait the gate, 

How charged with punishment the scroll, 

I am the master of my fate ; 
I am the captain of my soul. 

And this is the condition of every man and woman in the world. I pray 
the Lord to bless us in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WM. R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

To face this body of representative men and women of the Church 
is indeed an inspiration, and to bear witness of-this great work that we 
are engaged in, my brethren and sisters, is a joy unspeakable. 

I have rejoiced in my acquaintance with the leadership of this 
Church. I am thrilled beyond all words of expression for this acquaint- 
ance with them and bear witness that they are men of integrity and men 
of God. 

Last summer it was our pleasure to visit Alaska. We took the in- 
land route, and you who have enjoyed that wonderful voyage know that 
the channels you go through, in many cases, are very narrow. One eve- 
ning the pilot invited Sister Sloan and myself into the pilot room. As 
we sailed along the narrow channel he pointed out to us and said, "I 
want you people to note that just on the opposite side, on the right side 
of the boat [and the boat was moving very slowly] a few feet under- 
neath the water, about eight or ten feet from the vessel, there is a great 
ledge of rock. Many a ship has struck the same and been sunk." Oh, 
it was a wonderful feeling of security and safety to know that we were 
under the leadership of a pilot who knew the course the ship was sailing. 

So it is an inspiration to know in this Church that God is at the 
helm, and that his servants are inspired, directed and led by his influence. 
Zion is growing. Let the world say what it will, do what it may, yet 
this work will go on and on unto a perfect day. 

The Apostle Paul in II Timothy, chapter 3, verses 1 to 5, said of 
these times : 

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, 
despisers of those that are good, 

"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ; 

"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from. such turn 
away." 

I admonish you, my brethren and sisters that this is a day that de- 
mands the best that is within us. God demands service of us and loy- 
alty to his priesthood. Let us give it. 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I rejoice in my ministry in the Northwestern States mission. We 
have a wonderful mission. I believe our people are imbued with the 
spirit of the Gospel, so much so that they are trying to live it. I am 
happy to report that the tithes of the mission for the past year show a 
substantial increase over the previous year, and that the tithes for the 
first quarter of this year exceed the corresponding period of a year ago. 

We do a lot of good things up there, and God has blessed us. The 
honest tithe-payer and the men and women who observe the Word of 
Wisdom are being blessed, and it is an evidence of his promise unto his 
children. 

Last evening another blessed privilege was enjoyed by our returned 
missionaries. We made a call six months ago that our returned mis- 
sionaries should enlarge their scope of activity, and we called our breth- 
ren and sisters who have filled missions and are now at home to all unite 
and go to the temple and there assist in extending blessings to the thou- 
sands and millions of people who are unable to help themselves. Oh, the 
thrill that came to my soul, and I sat almost speechless, as I met five 
hundred returned missionaries, their wives, and friends — all in the tem- 
ple to do this splendid work, vicarious work for our kindred dead. 

This is God's work. I bear this witness. I give my allegiance, my 
brethren and sisters, to the men who preside over this Church. I love 
them. 

God bless you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the W'estern States Mission 

What a glorious privilege every Latter-day Saint enjoys through 
membership in this Church ! The Holy Ghost, which emanates from 
the presence of the Father, and fills the limits of space, is available to 
every one who will seek it, and is particularly the heritage of the Saints 
who have earned the right to enjoy it by obedience to the ordinances of 
the Gospel. 

We are told that in the latter days false prophets shall arise, who 
might confuse some as to whether they were true or false. But the 
Savior said : "By their fruits ye shall know them," and in our judg- 
ment, we only' need to apply that measuring rule to ascertain whether 
men are true or false servants of God. And greater than that, let us 
apply the rule to ourselves. The fruits of the Spirit, if they are enjoyed 
by you and by me, are love, joy and peace. When you have within your 
heart a burning desire to love your brethren and sisters, and particularly 
those who preside over you and direct the affairs of this Church, you 
may know that that is the influence of the Holy Ghost. 

If there is happiness and peace in your heart, as expressed in the 
joy of your life, you may likewise know that you are influenced by the 
Holy Ghost ; and if you have peace and love within your soul, then you 
know that you are in the line of your duty. If you are disturbed in your 
hearts, if you are angry with your brethren, if you allow yourselves to. 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 19 

criticise them, you are not happy, you are not at peace, there is no joy 
in your soul. 

What a glorious thing it is, brethren and sisters, to have this won- 
derful key by which to measure ourselves ! I pray the Lord will bless 
his Saints, that they may always keep that in their hearts. I try, as far 
as I am able, to keep that message in the minds of the people in the 
mission where I labor, that they may be a happy people, that they may 
be a loyal and a lovable people, that they may enjoy the gift of that 
spirit which enriches the souls of men. 

I bear you my testimony that the Lord pours out his Spirit upon 
us in great power, that we feel its blessing, and that the hearts of the 
Saints rejoice in the testimony of the missionaries, and in their own 
testimonies, as they meet together to worship the Lord. They do sus- 
tain the First Presidency, the Twelve, and the other General Authorities 
of the Church. They sustain them in their hearts and in their souls. 
They sustain them by their actions. They pay their tithes and their of- 
ferings. They say their prayers. They attend their meetings. They 
strive to gain an understanding of the Gospel and continually improve 
in knowledge, to increase their testimonies. The Spirit burns in their 
hearts, and when we meet together we have some glorious meetings- — 
not large meetings, of course, but we have small gatherings of Saints in 
our district and branch conferences, in which the souls of the people 
overflow with joy and happiness, and with love of each other. 

I believe I can say truthfully that there is peace and harmony ex- 
isting almost without exception throughout the mission. The mission- 
aries themselves are rendering faithful service. They are making their 
sacrifices, trying to curtail their expenses according to the incomes of 
their parents who are so distressed at home ; trying to realize that the 
sacrifice of the parents is a wonderful thing; and they wish to make 
their parents feel that they appreciate it, and are trying to fit themselves 
to the conditions. 

You may be assured that so far as the Western States mission is 
concerned, your children, your sons and daughters laboring there, are 
all in good health, all in good habits. They are prayerful : they are 
humble ; they are diligent in their work : and the Lord is blessing them 
greatly. His power is manifest among us, and we can testify continu- 
ously to his loving kindness and blessing. 

May God bless you. May God bless the work. of the Church every- 
where, and above all, his chosen servants who preside over it. and that 
we may follow their example and have the influence of the Holy Spirit 
to dwell in our hearts, T humbly pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I am very thankful, my brethren and sisters, to be able to report 
progress in the East Central States mission, in which I have had the 
honor and privilege of laboring during the past three years. I am very 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

pleased to state that the missionaries are enjoying good health, with the 
exception of one, who has been confined to his home for some little 
time, but he will soon be out again and be able to carry on his work. 
From time to time as I meet the missionaries who have returned home, 
I find that they have the missionary spirit with them still, and every one 
of them exclaims : "I wish that I were able to go back again and take up 
the work where I left off." 

President Grant has referred, this morning, to some opposition. If 
I recall right the scriptures say : "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile 
you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you 
falsely, for my sake . . . for so persecuted they the prophets which were 
before you." 

Persecution always has been, and perhaps always will be the 
heritage of God's people in the earth. I sometimes wonder if the change 
is almost too much, when I consider that today in practically all walks 
of life, and among all classes of people, we find those who are willing to. 
listen to the message that we have, and to give consideration to it. 

I am very pleased to state that men of influence and women of in- 
fluence, with whom we come in contact today, are giving consideration 
to the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 
are agreeing with our teachings. So I ani wondering if there is a little 
lull at the present time. But nevertheless, we are pressing on in the 
work, and as I hear those people express themselves it fills my heart 
with joy and thanksgiving to my Heavenly Father for the progress that 
is coming, especially in the East Central States mission; and from all 
reports, from all of the other missions. 

During the past year four hundred and eleven honest souls have 
entered the waters of baptism in the East Central States mission ; and 
since the first of the year more, in proportion, have been baptized than 
in the previous year. The outlook for the coming season is very en- 
couraging indeed. 

It may be that some who are under the sound of my voice today, 
both of the seen as well as the unseen audience, are earnestly seeking 
after truth, but have not as yet put themselves in a position to receive a 
testimony of the divinity of this great latter-day work. If there should 
be such, let me say to you, as I have said upon other occasions, that if 
you will go into your chambers by yourself, and there kneel down and 
pour out your soul to the Lord in humble prayer, he will not turn you 
aside, but he will cause a feeling to come into your soul that will bear 
witness to you of the divinity of this great latter-day work ; and by fol- 
lowing the admonition that will come to you, and complying with the 
commandments of the Lord, you, with us, may rejoice in the knowledge 
of this great latter-day work. 

I rejoice in the testimony that I have, because I do know as I know 
that I live that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer 
of the world, and that the Prophet Joseph Smith was the instrument in 
the hands of the Lord, raised up in this day and age of the world, for 
the purpose of establishing his work upon the earth for the last time. 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 21 

which will never more be thrown down nor given to another people, but 
will stand unto the end. 

I know that President Heber J. Grant and those who have preceded 
him as prophets and presidents of the Church are men of God, and that 
President Grant today is God's mouthpiece upon the earth; and if we 
follow his admonition and teachings God will bless us and prepare us 
for every emergency in life and for every calling that may come to us. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 

Former President of the British Mission 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may have the Spirit of the 
Lord to direct my remarks. It is indeed a pleasure for me to be in your 
midst once again, and to report the splendid condition of the British 
mission. 

I bring to you the greetings of President and Sister Widtsoe, and 
of President and Sister Douglas. They asked me, as 1 left, that if I 
were permitted to speak at Conference, to extend to the Saints assembled 
their good wishes and their blessings. They are doing a wonderful work 
in that land. The Lord is blessing them in all of their labors. 

The Saints throughout the British mission are a wonderful people. 
They are imbued with the Spirit of God, and are trying to live the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. The Elders are a splendid group of young men. 
I am pleased to report that in all of my missionary experience the great- 
est joy that came to my heart was to see the Spirit of God take hold of 
these young men, these boys, so to speak, and make men out of them. 
As they studied the scripture, as they prayed to God for his help, I could 
see them grow in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I could see the testimony 
of the truthfulness of this work rest upon them. As they stood in the 
halls and upon the street corners, it brought joy to my heart to listen to 
them bear testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that this 
work had been restored by him, and that he had given his life as a testi- 
mony of its truthfulness. 

I rejoice in the testimony that I have that this is the Church of Jesus 
Christ ; that within it is the power of everlasting life : that the priest- 
hood of God has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith to 
men in this age of the world, and that the keys of this priesthood are 
vested in the. President of this Church at the present time. I am re- 
minded that on one occasion, at a time when a number of the disciples 
were leaving the Master, the Savior asked his apostles this question, 
"Will ye also go away?" Then Peter answered, "Lord to whom shall 
we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life." 

So I ask, my brethren and sisters, if we should turn from the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where would we go, for in 
this Church, and only in this Church, are the words of eternal life. Here 
is the power or priesthood which makes the Gospel the power of God 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

unto salvation. The priesthood is here ; and when men go about reviling 
the President of the Church they revile the Church to which I belong. 
I resent it, because I know in my heart that this is the Church of God ; 
that these men who stand at the head of this Church are inspired of 
God, are our leaders, and have the words of eternal life. 

I rejoice in the testimony that has been given to me that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of mankind, and that through him and 
only through him can eternal life come unto the children of men. 

In the British mission we have established priesthood and genealogi- 
cal classes, and have all the auxiliaries. I rejoice to report to you that 
they are doing splendidly in their work. We have 6,640 members of the 
Church who are divided into 16 districts containing 74 branches. There 
were, at the end of 1931, 68 Relief Societies, 71 Sunday Schools, 71 
Mutuals and 37 Primaries. The Saints rejoice in the privilege of hav- 
ing a patriarch in their midst. Brother Wallis is doing a good work 
among the people. I am happy to report that last year we had two hun- 
dred and forty-five baptisms in that mission. It may seem only a few, 
but brethren and sisters, the people there are not turning their hearts to 
God as we would like to see them do. I wish that they would. I wish 
that they would turn unto him ; that they would come back to him ; that 
they would follow in his footsteps; that instead of so much belief in 
man-made philosophies they would come back to the teachings of Christ ; 
that they would repent and turn unto him. 

In conclusion let me plead with the younger members of the Church 
who may be present, as I am a younger member of the Church, that we 
devote our lives to service in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ; that we remain loyal to this Church, to the leaders of this Church. 
The Church will go on, and the only way that we can remain with its 
progress is to be loyal to it and to continue faithful to all the duties that 
are assigned unto us. We need not fear for the welfare of this Church. 
It is the Church of God, and it will go on and on and fill its destiny. 
Let us, the younger members of the Church, rise up, do our duty, keep 
the commandments of God, pay our tithes, keep the Word of Wisdom, 
and God will bless us with a testimony of the truthfulness of this Church 
and the faithfulness of its leaders, I testify to you, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

I earnestly pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Spirit of the 
Lord may guide the few remarks that I may make, as has been the case 
with those who have preceded me. 

I know that my Redeemer lives, and that this is verily the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for membership in 
it, and for the privilege of acting as a missionary abroad. 

"Go ye into all the world," declared tbe risen Lord to his dis- 
ciples, "and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 23 

is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned." 
(Mark 16:15-16.) 

Whatever the Savior may have meant by "damned," the responsi- 
bility of those thus commissioned to deliver the Gospel message to the 
world is here made clear and emphatic. Every missionary knows, how- 
ever, that Paul may sow, and Apollos water, but only God giveth the 
increase; (I Cor. 3) and he knows that without this testimony of the 
Spirit there is no increase, never was, nor ever will be. It was the Master 
himself who, in answer to Peter's inspired declaration : "Thou art the 
Christ, the Son of the living God," said: "Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, 
and upon this rock [Revelation] I will build my Church; and the gates 
of hell shall not prevail against it." (Matt. 16:16-18.) 

I testify to all the world that this Church is built upon the rock of 
revelation. Now as always, "not flesh and blood, but my Father which 
is in heaven" reveals its truth to men. Our task as missionaries is to 
bring the truth to the favorable attention of men in every possible way, 
and leave the rest to them and to the Lord. 

Now, a word about our missionary work. The North Central 
States mission, though comparatively young and numerically small, is 
approximately a thousand miles square, lying west of the Great Lakes 
and east of the Rockies, half in the United States and half in Canada. 
We have fifty missionaries, about twenty-six hundred members, and a 
population of approximately ten times the total membership of the 
Church in all the world. 

Our missionaries are well and busy and happy in their work. They 
are a credit to their parents and to the Church. So are our members. 
Last year more of them paid tithing than ever before in our history, and 
more of it than for any previous year except 1930, which was our 
banner year. 

Conversions and baptisms, however, though surpassing all previous 
records, come but slowly. Our people are honest, industrious, and I am 
sure, more than ordinarily religious ; but there remains much to be done 
to bring them to an acceptance of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
As I think of these good people, and listen to the testimonies offered 
here, I wish, in the language of Philip to Nathanael, that they might 
all "Come and See." Philip, you remember, had reported to Nathanael : 
"We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did 
write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto 
him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto 
him, Come and see." (John ;1 :45-46). Such is Mormonism's invitation 
to the world : "Come and see." 

Come and see what ? First, I wish they might find here what I be- 
lieve to be the greatest need of the world today ; namely, a real faith in a 
real God, our Heavenly Father. This is the first essential of any worth- 
while religion ; and the second is adherence to the laws of morality, good 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

old fashioned virtue and honesty and honor in the lives of men. These 
ought observers to find here. 

I would invite attention also to the organization of this Church, — 
led by prophets and apostles, — its hundred stakes and thirty missions 
calling into active service literally thousands of people in positions of 
responsibility, — its more than a thousand wards and branches with their 
tens of thousands of officers, — its multitudes of men holding the priest- 
hood, and of men and women engaged in the various Auxiliaries of the 
Church, — all laboring gratuitously and enthusiastically for the welfare 
of others, under conditions best calculated to hold men always at their 
best. All my life I have been engaged, as student or teacher, in char- 
acter education. In my opinion the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is the greatest instrument known to man for the development 
of its members, for the character education of those who participate in 
its blessings. It is God's own plan "for the perfecting of the saints, for 
the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." (Eph. 
4:12.) All this I would have our friends to "Come and see." 

I would have them examine also the law of tithing operative in the 
Church. In these times of financial distress and perplexity of nations, 
when state legislatures, national congresses and parliaments, and inter- 
national conferences are frantically wrestling with mounting deficits, 
let them inquire God's way of balancing the budget in his Church and 
kingdom, a device so simple and equitable as to require neither explana- 
tion nor justification, the ancient law of the tithe. 

The public budget in balance. I would have them observe how the 
individual poor and needy of the Church are cared for by the simple but 
effective device of the fast offering. Then might follow analysis of the 
benefits of the Word of Wisdom, and of our missionary system, etc. 

Thus, I believe, my brethren and sisters, that there is much in the 
fruits of Mormonism which should challenge the attention and com- 
mand the respect of men. But after all these so-called fruits of the Gos- 
pel are of relatively minor importance, — a few acorns, so to speak, from 
the great oak tree of truth. It is the testimony that God lives, and that 
we are his children ; that Jesus is the Christ, and that the Gospel is his 
plan of life and salvation ; that his priesthood and authority are here ; and 
that the promised gifts and blessings do follow the believers, — these are 
the fundamentals in the faith of the Latter-day Saints. All these and 
more are here if the world will but "Come and see." 

I sustain and uphold those who preside in this Church. I know 
that the priesthood is here ; and that in the Gospel as here taught resides 
the power of God unto salvation. 

I am glad, I repeat, to be a missionary, and to assist in bringing 
this message to the attention of men. I pray God to bless the youth of 
Zion and keep us true to our heritage of truth ; and may he bless the 
world, and in his own due time, bring to pass his righteous will and pur- 
poses in the salvation of the children of men. To all of which may he 
add his blessings, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 25

Elder Franklin S. Richards pronounced the benediction. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock p. m. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Andrew Jenson, Assist- 
ant Church Historian. 

A sacred solo, "Arise! Shine!" was sung by Brother John Wood. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am happy in the work of the ministry, 
and pleased to say that our missionaries are in good health and active 
in their work. The past winter has been one of the mildest in the 
history of the East ; while you have had so much snow here, we have 
had practically none. 

There are two features of our work which have greatly interested 
me, one — the enlargement of our radio activities. We have obtained two 
more free stations, one in Buffalo, where there are more people than in 
Utah ; and the only station in Paterson, New Jersey. During President 
Grant's last visit, we secured the largest station in Washington, D. C. 
President Grant opened the service over it with an address, notable in 
the history of the Eastern States mission and the preaching of the 
Gospel over the radio. This makes eight stations over which we broad- 
cast weekly. [We have reports from over the mission, and from the 
East Central States mission, that President Grant was heard clearly. 
In Massachusetts, the bishop of the Reorganized Church at Brockton, 
with a number of followers, listened in. We are guaranteed that we 
can preach to people over that station from Florida to Canada. Thus, 
literally, the Gospel is being proclaimed from the housetops, as pre- 
dicted in the Book of Mormon. 

Another event of marked interest to me is the opportunity that has 
been afforded during the past three months to preach to the Jews 
in their synagogues. The subject thus far has been the Relationship 
of Mormonism to Judaism. It was something of a remarkable ex- 
perience to witness the interest which these educated Jews have mani- 
fested, and especially the Jewish students at Ithaca, New York, where 
the Cornell University is located. About a quarter of the students 
are Jews, and they, with their Rabbi, constituted substantially all of the 
audience which gathered in their synagogue. In fact, it was some of 
these young Jews that induced the Rabbi to invite me to speak to them. 
They remained after the service, wanting to learn more, until eleven 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

o'clock, and then several followed me to the hotel. Two have since 
written letters, promising to visit me at the end of the school year, 
and inviting me back. 

As I say, we have now several invitations to speak at other 
synagogues and Jewish organizations, one at Newark, New Jersey, 
presided over (by the father of one of the Cornell students, who was 
not only present at the Jewish synagogue at Ithaca, but it was he who 
induced his father to invite me to speak to the Newark Jewish Club 
over which he presides. 

I do not know of anything that presents a more marvelous and 
satisfying demonstration that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God than 
the fact that he, a boy not twenty-four years of age, translated the Book 
of Mormon, and published it to the world very shortly after his twenty- 
fourth birthday, and that that book should arouse the interest that it 
does among all classes of Jews. 

On the title page of the Book of Mormon/ — written by practically 
a boy — is found among other things, the remarkable statement that 
it, (the Book of Mormon, was "to come forth by the gift and power of 
God * * * in due time by way of the Gentile * * * to show unto the 
remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done 
for their Fathers ; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, 
that they are not cast off forever — 'And also to the convincing of the 
Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting 
himself unto all nations." 

Bear in mind that this was over a hundred years ago, that this 
country frontier boy, without education, and with only extremely 
limited opportunities of access to books or libraries, or contact with 
learned men, translated the Book of Mormon, which is now translated 
and published into sixteen languages, and about 50,000 of the same 
sold per year, with an ever-increasing demand for the same. 

That book, as previously outlined, and particularly in the prophecies 
found in Second Nephi, in the 30th and 10th chapters, foretells in 
unmistakable language, vital future events and conditions which have 
already been fulfilled, and still more which are being fulfilled. It 
says : 

"And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and 
Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be 
written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many 
which shall believe the words fwhich are written ; and they shall carry them 
forth unto the remnant of our seed. * * * 

"And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin 
to believe in Christ ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land." 

The Prophet then says that they of Jerusalem "who shall not be destroyed 
shall be scattered among all nations. 

"But behold, thus saith the Lord God : When the day cometh that they 
shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers 
that they shall be restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their 
inheritance. 

"And it shall come jto pass that they shall be gathered in from their long 
dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth." 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 27 

When the Book of Mormon was first published, there were ex- 
tremely few Jews in all of Palestine, and they were not permitted the 
privileges of citizenship in that land, or the right to hold title to land, 
and were greatly mistreated by the Turkish government, of which 
Palestine was a part. In fact, the Jews throughout Europe, even in- 
cluding liberty-loving England, were denied many of the privileges 
and the freedom enjoyed by other people. 

All must know something of what has been taking place alto- 
gether subsequent to the publication of the Book of Mormon. 

In about a quarter of a century after the coming forth of the 
Book of Mormon, there commenced some real agitation among Jews 
for their restoration in Palestine. The first material effort in that 
direction was led by Baron Rothchild, in the 70's. That was personal, 
and the first organized movement was led by Baron Hirsch. Then 
followed an the 90's, and the early part of the twentieth century, the 
more general Zionist movement, which has become a real power in the 
world and influenced the British Empire. Since the great World War, 
millions and millions have been contributing, and Jews by the thousands 
have been aided in their migration to and settlement in Palestine and 
their establishment therein in making it a homeland for scattered and 
down-trodden Jews. 

Another notable fact, showing how clearly the youthful Prophet 
understood the hidden but foretold predictions of the prophets of the 
Lord, is shown in the first publication of the Church, other than that 
of the Book of Mormon which was published before the Church was 
organized, namely, the "Evening and Morning Star" printed in June, 
1832, in Independence, Mo. In its first issue, setting forth its mission 
and the object of its publication, is the statement that it was to be 
"a Messenger of truth in these the last days, to present to the world 
the revelations and commandments of God which have been given, and 
those which may be given, etc., and good tidings of great joy to all* — 
but more especially to the House of Israel scattered abroad, that the 
day of their redemption is near, for the Lord has- set his hand again the 
second time to restore them to the lands of their inheritance." 

I would like to call your attention to the fact, that at the dedication 
of the Kirtland Temple in 1836, in the prayer of the Prophet Joseph, 
(found in the Doctrine and Covenants) among other most significant 
things he said : "We therefore ask thee to have mercy upon the children 
of Jacob, that Jerusalem, from this hour, may begin to be redeemed; and 
the y\&ke of bondage may begin to be broken off from the House of 
David; and the children of Judah may begin to return to the lands 
which thou didst give to Abraitt-m, their father." 

Then in April, 1840, the Prophet called Orson Hyde and John 
E. (Page on a mission to go to Jerusalem and there dedicate that land to 
the return of the Jews — at a time when they were not permitted ordinary 
civil or political privileges, including the right to hold land in Palestine. 
It took Orson Hyde a year and a half to get there, traveling without 
purse or scrip. The trials were so great that John E. Page failed on the 
way, and gave up the struggle : but Apostle Orson Hyde arrived on 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the Mt. of Olives, and in Oct., 1841, dedicated that land to the return 
of the Jews, praying, among other things, to the Lord "to remove the 
barrenness and sterility of this land, and let springs of living water 
break forth to water its thirsty soil, let the vine and olive produce in 
their strength, and the fig tree bloom and flourish. | Let the land 
become abundantly fruitful and possessed by its 'rightful heirs; let 
it again flow with plenty, to (feed the returning (prodigals who 
come home with a spirit of grace and supplication. Upon it let the 
clouds distil virtue and richness, and let the fields smile with plenty; 
let the flocks and the herds greatly increase and multiply upon the 
mountains and hills." 

I see my time is up, but I commend to your consideration what we 
call in the mission "The Redeemed Hebrew," written by President B. 
H. Roberts in 1927. It sets forth in much greater detail the whole 
story, with quotations from the Book of Mormon, and the changed 
attitude of the Jews toward Christ, hundreds of thousands of whom 
are accepting Christianity. We are distributing that paper, and it is 
being read eagerly by thousands of Jews. You know that New York 
City is the great Jewish center of the world. I understand that about 
one-fourth or two million of the people living in and near New York 
City are Jews. At our street meetings they take this paper eagerly. 
It was printed in a Jewish-Christian periodical. The Jews are interested 
in it. It is a common experience to learn from well-informed Jews 
that they have read or are familiar with the contents of the Book of 
Mormon. 

Thus the work is going on, and may God bless it and those who 
are seeking to further the purposes of the Lord, is my desire in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

I esteem it a great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be per- 
mitted to come back to Salt Lake City every six months and participate 
in the Conference proceedings. It is a wonderful inspiration unto us who 
are absent in the mission field, and we can carry back that inspiration 
unto those with whom we are laboring. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that I ob- 
tained by listening to the teachings of the Elders many years ago. I 
rejoice that year by year that testimony has grown stronger and brighter ; 
that in all the vicissitudes of life, and the flounderings and the stumblings 
through which we go, and through which I have gone, I have been able 
to retain that testimony. I cherish that as one of the greatest, if not the 
greatest gift that God can give unto us. I do not know of any gift I 
can think of now that would be worth so much to me if I were to lose 
the testimony that this is the work of the Lord ; that it is divine ; that his 
power and authority are here upon the earth ; that he speaks through thai 
authority ; that we are led and guided by his Holy Spirit in all that we 
do ; that we are seeking in our humble way to carry on his work ; that 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 29 

he in reality has given unto us the privilege of being his humble assistants 
in carrying out the great task that he has set for himself, to bring about 
the immortality and eternal life of man. 

I know of nothing more glorious than to have the privilege of work- 
ing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in high position 
or in low. I feel it such an honor, such a help, such an opportunity for 
growth and advancement, that I feel that all Latter-day Saints should 
hunger for the privilege of serving in some capacity in the kingdom of 
God. It gives us joy; it gives us happiness. 

I do not know that at any time in my past life I have realized as 
fully as I do now what that second commandment means : "Love thy 
neighbor as thyself." In contemplation of that so many other things 
that occupy our lives fade away into insignificance. The philosophy of 
that commandment, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," seems to me to be 
made clear in the Book of Mormon. I remember reading in the book 
of Mosiah the story of King Benjamin. As he felt age creeping upon 
him he desired to deliver over the kingdom to his son. He called the 
people together for the purpose of counseling them, to advise them, and 
to deliver the kingdom into the hands of his son. When they had gath- 
ered together he began to recite some of the things that had been done 
and accomplished. What he particularly impressed upon them was this 
one fact, that though he were a king and ruled over them, yet he had 
labored with his own hands for the accomplishment of God's purposes, 
that he might not be a burden unto them. "And this," he declared, "I 
do not desire to boast of, but I tell you these things that ye might learn 
wisdom ; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow 
beings, ye are only in the service of your God." 

This truth is impressed upon us in the mission field ; and the priv- 
ilege of carrying the Gospel to those who are honest in heart, giving un- 
to them the word of the Lord, giving unto them greater opportunity for 
advancement, progress, knowledge, understanding, gives us joy. Grief 
we feel when we find that apparently our words fall on deaf ears, when 
that which is so plain unto us seems as a fallacy to them. They believe 
in Jesus Christ but they have already been saved, they say, and, being 
saved, there is nothing else that they need look [forward to ; the fact 
that we cannot undeceive them in this thing brings us grief. In a small 
way it gives us a little understanding of what our Savior must have felt 
when he came unto his own and his own would not receive him. He 
gave them the opportunity for salvation and exaltation, but they looked 
upon him as a blasphemer. 

I desire to bear my testimony to the goodness of God, and to his 
mercy, to the j oy that has come into my heart since we heard the Gospel 
some 56 years ago, and the satisfaction and the happiness that are ours 
in doing the work of the Lord, in working in his cause, in helping to 
deliver unto the rest of the world that same message that has given us 
joy and happiness. 

May God help us to cherish the testimony that we have received, 
that we may do nothing that will mar it or cause it to fade away, because 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

these testimonies that have come unto us by doing the will of the Lord 
cannot be taken from us by any power on earth, except that of our own 
transgression. Let us cherish it and keep it. It is a wonderful thing to 
know, not only that we are in the way, but to know where we are going, 
and that at the end of this life we still continue in the service of the 
Lord, with the vistas of progression and advancement outlined before 
us. O, that testimony! There isn't anything in the world that I can 
think of for which I would give that testimony. 

May God help us to serve him, to do his will, to be faithful, honest 
and loyal to his cause, not paying so much attention to the things of this 
world, because they fade away, but to look more for the things that are 
of eternal worth and that we can carry with us, that we may find stored 
up there for us when we go there, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I appreciate the opportunity I have of 
laboring in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I bring 
you greetings from the Saints, the missionaries, Sister Rowan, and my 
family. I am happy to say that the missionaries are all well, enjoying the 
spirit of the Gospel, enjoying their labors, and getting great satisfaction 
from bearing testimony of the restored Gospel t'o the people of Texas 
and Louisiana. 

I find there are many faithful Latter-day Saints living in those 
states, and as missionaries we appreciate very much the splendid coopera- 
tion they are giving us in helping to disseminate the Gospel truths. Many 
of our best converts are being contacted through the very fine personnel 
of those who have membership in this great Church. 

It gives me great joy to report that we have fifteen branches, with 
a membership of eighteen hundred fifty-nine souls. We have five dis- 
tricts having a membership of thirty-six hundred five. Making a total in 
the Texas mission of five thousand four hundred sixty-four souls. We 
have thirty-four Sunday Schools, seventeen Relief Societies, and many 
Primaries. Our Primaries, however, you realize, are not entirely stable, 
because the lady missionaries establish temporary community Primaries, 
while they are laboring in the various cities ; yet they are accomplishing 
a wonderful work. 

I am happy to report that the people in these states are very friendly 
and hospitable. It is a source of gratitude to me to find the confidence that 
the business and professional men have in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. The conduct of our people whom they have met has 
thoroughly convinced them that those who have membership in this 
church are honest, honorable, straightforward, God-fearing men and 
women. I appreciate telling you, that many of the leading doctors in 
those states treat our missionaries absolutely free of charge because of 
the wonderful work thev are doing. 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 31 

We are not quite so fortunate in giving addresses over the radio, 
since those in charge say : "We will be delighted, if you will pay, to give 
you a reduced rate, — but we expect money from all other churches and 
receive it ; consequently you will have to pay to get on the air." Hence 
few radio programs have been given. 

During these hard times we are finding great consolation and solace 
in the words of the Redeemer of the world, wherein he said : 

"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you 
rest. 

"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in 
heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 

"For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." 

We are putting this to the test, my brethren and sisters, and I am 
frank to confess that the Lord is blessing his people with his Spirit. 

I believe that the Christian people generally throughout the world 
are depending more on the Lord than they have done in the past. I 
recognize and appreciate that the Lord has given us an invitation to come 
unto him and find rest to our souls, but I am also mindful of the fact that 
the Lord has said there is something of vastly more importance. He 
said, 

"Not every one that sayeth unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. 

"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many won- 
derful works? 

"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye 
that work iniquity." 

So I say to you there is a certain way prescribed by Jesus the Christ 
through which his children must come unto him. The plan is outlined 
completely in our Articles of Faith. 

I am happy to be engaged in the work with my missionaries in call- 
ing upon mankind to repent. I find myself in perfect accord with this 
Church. I honor, revere and respect these prophets ; I bear you my wit- 
ness, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that I know that God our 
Eternal Father has spoken in this dispensation of time, that Jesus the 
Christ has reappeared and that Joseph Smith was an instrument in the 
hands of Almighty God in establishing anew the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

I am also thankful to know that his successors have all held the 
keys of the authority to bind on earth and it shall be bound in heaven, 
and to loose on earth and it shall be loosed in heaven. I certify to you, 
in words of soberness, that President Heber J. Grant is a prophet, seer 
and revelator, and an inspiration to all who are familiar with his life. 

May I make one appeal before closing. Send us the names and 
addresses of your friends or relatives in Texas or Louisiana and we will 
be glad to get in touch with them. I want to thank the Bureau of In- 
formation, and all others who have furnished us with information. Your 
sons and daughters are well and happy. They are receiving testimony 
upon testimony that this is God's work. 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I pray God to bless all of us, that we may live and prove faithful to 
the end, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE. S. ROMNEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I have been thrilled, during this Conference, with the testimonies of 
my brethren. I am happy to report to you that the missionaries in the 
Northern States mission are carrying the message of the Gospel, and the 
testimony that the Lord has spoken again to his people in this day, and 
that they are doing it well. They are faithful young men and women. 
They grow very rapidly in the testimony of the Gospel when they come 
to the mission field. 

This last Sunday I listened to the testimony of a young lady who 
has been only a few months in the mission field. She was a very timid 
girl when she left home, and was extremely frightened when she ar- 
rived in the mission field. It seemed almost beyond her strength to go 
up to the doors of the people and announce that she was a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Last Sunday, in her 
testimony, she stated that she had never known much about the Gospel. 
Just the other day, however, she was invited into a home of very intelli- 
gent people. They asked her questions for an hour and a half, and it 
seemed to her that she did not lack for an answer to any of the ques- 
tions that previously she had no idea she could answer. 

Such is the testimony of the young men and women. I received a 
letter from one of the boys not long ago. He, too, was just a young 
man who had had no experience at home. He said : 

"A non-member of the Church called for us to administer to a young lady 
who had been sick for some time. We administered to her. We were very timid 
and frightened — scarcely knowing what to say. In two hours after the admin- 
istration the young lady was up and out at play, and has been well ever since." 

We are very glad to have the young men and women come into the 
mission field, and we trust that they will come filled with the spirit of 
testimony. 

President Grant spoke this morning of the things that are said and 
have been said against him. I believe that sometimes, even in the words 
of those who write and speak against the prophets of the Lord, we have 
some of our strongest testimonies. 

Just recently a book came from the press in Chicago, written by Mr. 
Beardsley. Its newspaper review was entitled : "A Drunken Fiend, or 
a Prophet, or Mouthpiece of God." The title of the book is "Joseph 
Smith and His Mormon Empire." In this book we have rehearsed 
again many of the old stories that have been told about Joseph Smith, 
the Prophet, derogatory of his character. He is pictured as one of the 
vilest of men. In fact, Mr. Beardsley seems to find him the "drunken 
fiend." I was surprised, when I read that book, to notice some of the 
inconsistencies in it. After picturing the prophet of the Lord as he 



ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 33 

does, he makes statements concerning the time just following the driv- 
ing of the Saints from Missouri to this effect: 

"At that time what talent the little town of Quincy could boast! There was 
Abraham Lincoln, the future President of the United States, and the great martyr 
of the American people. There was Stephen A. Douglas, who has written his 
name so prominently across the pages of history. And there was Mr. Browning, 
a senator and cabinet officer. There was Brigham Young, whose name was to 
become a common word upon the lips of the American people, and there was 
Joseph Smith." 

And he said : 

"In this company of people who was the dominating personality? Was it 
Abraham Lincoln? No. Was it Stephen A. Douglas? No. Was it Mr. Brown- 
ing, or Brigham Young? No. It was Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, a 
fugitive from justice." 

It seems to me that such contradictions in the writing of those who 
would speak evil of the prophets of the Lord are but testimonies to the 
truth of this great work. In the beginning of the book Mr. Beardsley 
refers to the statement of Joseph Smith .which the Prophet made when 
he was fifteen years old, when he said that an angel told him that his 
name should be known for good and evil among all nations of the earth. 
It seemed strange to me that Mr. Beardsley shovdd raise his voice and 
take his pen, trained in literature as he is, to write a book to help fulfil 
that prophecy, wherein he is doing his part in making the name of Joseph 
Smith known among all the nations of the earth. I feel that he would 
be much safer if he were on the right side rather than on the wrong side. 

I have a testimony that the prophets of the Lord came in this day, 
and are here yet ; and I know, as my friends who have spoken before me, 
that our leaders are men of integrity, men of honor and honesty ; and 
that this, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is the truth. I trust that the Lord 
will bless us, that this testimony may sink into our hearts, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

President of the California Mission 

It is my prayer that the Lord will calm my spirit and lead me by 
the influence of the Holy Ghost. I am so new in my field of labor 
that I feel that I can hardly speak with the same assurance relative to 
the mission, that my associate presidents speak in regard to their mis- 
sions. It was only late in January of this year that by divine appoint- 
ment, by prophecy and by the laying on of hands, I was set apart to 
preside over the California mission. 

It was my great pleasure to be led into that mission and introduced 
to my labors and installed under the direction of Elder David O. McKay. 
As he traveled through that mission rapidly, spending some two weeks 
visiting all of the districts, the people flocked to hear him. Along his 
route the chapels were filled. The inspiration of the Lord was upon him. 
The Saints were built up in their faith. The Elders were instructed and 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

given new high hopes, and impressed with the great responsibility that 
rests upon them, and entered into their labors with renewed diligence. 

But when the two weeks were ended, and I saw Brother McKay 
disappear through the gate at the railroad station, on his way back to 
headquarters, headquarters seemed farther removed from California, to 
me, than they had seemed just a day or two earlier. To me that two 
weeks was, of course, a schooling under a prophet. I have never quite 
understood, as I have read the history of the Church, the operation, in 
its entirety, of the school of the prophets. I have always thought that 
it must have been most remarkable. But I do know, in a measure, what 
it is to be schooled under the prophets. 

It has been my great privilege, all the years of my life, to be rather 
close in contact with the Authorities of this Church. My father was a 
president of a stake for twenty-five years, and I followed him as a stake 
president in the same locality for twenty-seven years. So in all those 
years, into our home — into my mother's home first and later, into my own 
home — came the Authorities of the Church, and thus I became ac- 
quainted with all of them as they traveled among the people to direct, 
admonish and bless them ; and their coming into our home was a bless- 
ing. I have appreciated it all my life. I appreciate it more today, I think, 
than at any other time in my life. And as I stand here, thinking of 
what a blessing it is to be well born, to be born into the Church and 
kingdom of God, of goodly parents, today I bless my mother, today I 
bless my father, prince of a man that he was, carrying in his heart a 
reverence for the Authorities of this Church. I thank the Lord that his 
reverence for the Authorities carried over into the hearts of his children. 

I thought when the President was speaking this morning, that never 
have I heard in my mother's home, never have I heard in my own home 
any of the Authorities of this Church lightly spoken of. Oh, ye Saints, 
beware, if in your homes ye speak slightingly of the servants of the 
living God ! Rather that our children should hear our lips uttering 
prayers that come from the heart ; that they, the servants of God, in a 
world of wickedness and strife, shall be sustained and led and inspired, 
so that this people shall be and continue to be an exceptional people, 
chosen of the Lord and led by his servants. 

As I minister with my young brethren down in the California mis- 
sion, and with the lady missionaries, oh, I stand before the Lord and 
express my gratitude for those young men and young women, clean and 
sweet and undefiled ; that down in that country of rapid and continuous 
growth, down in that place where everything seems to thrive, they are 
not drawn away to the right nor to the left. They are not afraid. The 
courage that comes unto those young missionaries to stand up in de- 
fense of the truth, and declare Jesus Christ and his ministry, and the 
restoration of the Gospel, and the call of the Lord unto salvation unto 
all those who will hear it, — I say my soul thrills. 

It is a new experience to step down into that field of labor, among 
these young men and young women, just out of a class where I had been 
associated with high priests, mature and sweet, ripened in their expe- 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 35 

rience ; and to touch these young lives and to witness their giving of all 
that they are, the strength of their young manhood and womanhood, to 
the service of God ; it is one of the greatest testimonies in all the world. 

As I have gone through that mission, that country, that beautiful 
country, from the summit of the hills down in and through the valleys, 
everywhere today it is a garden spot, following the rainy season. I have 
driven past the homes of the rich, the estates of the wealthy, and then 
walked into the homes and sat down with the meek, the Latter-day 
Saints ; and I have questioned in my soul, I have queried : "When shall 
the meek inherit the earth?" Not now, that is certain. The meek are 
pushed aside. The grasping, the selfish — they rule and dominate. 

But if you wish to find sweetness, if you wish to find contentment, 
if you wish to find love, just assemble with the meek who love the Lord 
and keep his commandments, who love the children of the Lord. Then 
you will say : Blessed are the meek now, and what must their blessings 
be when they shall inherit the earth? For the earth and the fulness 
thereof belong to the Lord, and he who bought it, redeemed it and paid 
the price, opened the way for you and me to become sons and daughters 
of God. When he comes, when he rules whose right it is to rule, what 
will be our joy? The promise will be fulfilled, "The meek shall inherit 
the earth." 

* 

Recently in going through that mission, I have gone into the min- 
ing camps, where thousands have found their livelihood heretofore. 
There is no whistle that shrieks now and calls men to work. The 
smelter smoke does not ascend from those smoke stacks, and their towns 
are like deserted villages. And I say in my soul : I wonder if this kind 
of experience will not bring to men's minds the invitation of the Lord, 
when he said unto the people : 

"Lay not up unto yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth 
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal : 

"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust 
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal." 

Uneasy is the head of the man of great estates and holdings today. 
That for which he has struggled, and from which he has hoped to in- 
herit ease and comfort and the power and influence that come from 
wealth, is now threatened and is insecure. He is under anxiety today. 
No peace there. But I bear testimony that there is peace in the hearts 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

It was my privilege not long since to go into one of our branches, 
and as I was met at the depot I was asked : "Did you know that 
Brother Allen had died?" 

"Oh, no. When was that?" 

"Just now, in the hospital." 

"All right." 

The fact of that death caused me to remain there for three days. 
For three days, here and there, in the parks, in the lobbies, in the stores, 
on the streets, I heard people speaking — not our people, as we have only 
two hundred and fifty of our people in that city. They said : "That Mor- 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

mon, that man Allen, was a good man." There was a man that went 
about doing good. My soul rejoiced. 

Oh, the power and the influence of a righteous life ! The president 
of a branch had 'died. He was a Latter-day Saint. 

I walked up to one place and I saw a magnificent building, and I 
said to Brother Johnson : "I wonder, while we wait, if we couldn't 
go through this institution?" 

"Surely, Brother Hinckley. They let me in there any time." 

At the head of the institution was a man named Seaman. I thought : 
"Perhaps that could be George A. Seaman's kinsman. I will go in." 

The first thing he said when I was introduced was, "Do you know 
President Allen?" 

"I have never known him, but I am here to be in attendance at his 
funeral." 

"Great was that man," said this head of that institution. "He 
came in here and held meetings with us." 

This is briefly the story that he gave: "All of the sects and the 
denominations are permitted to hold meetings in this institution on 
Sunday. When President Allen brought his people in," he said, "they 
prayed, they sang, and they preached the Lord Jesus Christ. We had 
been used to seeing them, when others were here, play cards and let 
the radio go on ; but this room became a chapel when the Mormons held 
services here. But it stirred up opposition, and my board was pe- 
titioned to prevent the Mormons from holding meetings in this institu- 
tion. What did your president say? President Allen said, 'No war, 
no contention with us. Our mission is peace. We have preached unto 
you the truth, and when you shut us out you shut out the word of God 
and the message of salvation.' Result : The inmates said : 'Where are 
those Mormons? 

" 'They are not coming.' 

"'Why not?' 

" 'The Board has said they cannot come.' 

"Result : Five hundred people signed a petition and said : 'We 
want the Latter-day Saints to come in here and hold their service.' " 

The privilege was renewed and we continue to hold services there, 
and when the funeral of that righteous man was held the chapel was 
filled ; the archway dividing two rooms was opened, chairs were put in ; 
hundreds were there to pay their respect to the life of a righteous man. 

That is the kind of message that reaches the world when a right- 
eous man manifests before God in daily life the fruits of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

Down in the California mission, under the wise leadership of 
President Joseph W. McMurrin — perhaps the only mission where one 
of the General Authorities has been permitted to preside for years and 
years, covering a period of thirteen years — he has wisely established 
branches all over Nevada, Arizona and California. Twelve thousand 
people in their daily lives are manifesting unto the world the fruits of 
Mormonism, and they are leavening the lump. And while our mission- 
ary force has dropped from its high peak of two hundred and twenty 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 37 

in 1929, to fifty-nine now, and while the depression is forcing fathers 
and mothers to write daily: "Can you not honorably release my son 
or my daughter? We have gone the limit" — in other places, presidents 
of stakes have written to the president of the mission and said : "Send 
no Elder home for the want of funds. When they have reached their 
limit notify us, for in this stake no lady missionary and no Elder has 
ever returned for the want of funds." 

I bear my testimony to the quality of the men, the quality of the 
women, who minister in that mission. It is the choicest of the choice. 
I love them as I love my own sons and daughters. They are wonderful. 
I love those Saints, and I want to bear testimony that in that mission 
are some of the best Latter-day Saints I have ever known. And now 
in answer to this call for local missionary help the presidents of those 
branches have said : "We will give you help ;" and I expect that a 
hundred or more will be installed and divinely appointed to labor part 
time to help in this emergency. 

I know the truth. I love the truth. I hope to live it to the end, 
and to be found worthy to sit down with my father and my mother, 
saved in the celestial kingdom of God. May this blessing be mine and 
be yours, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Congregation arose and sang the hymn, "God moves in a 
mysterious way." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Up to this point in this General Conference I believe that our meet- 
ings have been on a par with the meetings of previous General Confer-, 
ences of the Church, in spirit, instruction and interest. I have been 
greatly edified myself and have been made to feel very grateful and 
thankful for my membership in the Church, the fellowship that I have 
with the Latter-day Saints, the knowledge that I have of the Gospel and 
the testimony I have of its truth ; for I do know that this is God's work, 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I rejoice exceedingly in this 
knowledge. 

INTEGRITY OF STAKE WORKERS 

The brethren who have spoken in this conference, excepting the 
President of the Church, have been the mission presidents, and they 
have spoken of conditions that obtain in the world, of the faithfulness 
s of our young missionaries and the integrity of the Saints in the mission 
field. From my knowledge in visiting the missions I can bear testimony 
to what they have said, and in thinking of it I am reminded of the in- 
tegrity and devotion of the Latter-day Saints in the stakes of Zion. We 
as General Authorities of the Church, visit them quite frequently. We 
are always received cordially, and are given a generous welcome. We 
are treated, I may say, as kings might expect to be treated, given the 
very best that the people have to give, and there are evidences that they 






38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

sustain the Authorities of the Church, evidences of faith and faithful- 
ness as members of the Church. 

A great many faithful workers are laboring in the stakes of Zion, 
men and women who are setting a worthy example before the people, 
living their religion, paying their tithing, keeping the Word of Wisdom, 
doing things that they are asked to do, and rendering service to God, to 
the Church and their fellow men. I am proud of this people, thankful 
that I am numbered with them, that I have association and fellowship 
with them, and I believe I have their confidence and support as do all 
of my brethren of the General Authorities of the Church. 

NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT 

I praise the Lord and thank him for these blessings, yet I realize 
that there is much in Zion that ought not to be. There are things that 
we engage in and do as members of the Church that we ought not to do. 
There are duties that ought to be performed that we neglect. I do not 
know whether the Lord is altogether pleased with us. I feel sure that 
he is pleased with the Church as a church, and with many of the individ- 
uals, but with some I am afraid he is not pleased. I am afraid that there 
will be disappointment on the part of some members of the Church when 
this life's work is finished, when our opportunities are past. Disap- 
pointment is something to be dreaded if not to be feared. 

SATISFACTION IN BEING RIGHT 

There is always a satisfaction, my brethren and sisters, in having 
been right on any question that has engaged our attention, especially if 
the wisdom and judgment of others have been brought to bear upon that 
question and we have not all agreed. You know how prone we are to 
say, "I told you so." The more important the question that is involved 
in a consideration of this kind, the greater satisfaction there will be in 
the end when we find that we have been right ; but if on the other hand 
it is found that we have been wrong there will be correspondingly great 
disappointment. The importance of the question involved determines the 
amount of satisfaction or disappointment. The greatest question that 
man has ever considered, according to my judgment, is that of religion, or 
salvation, of what it consists and how it may be attained. There is no 
other question I suppose that has engaged the attention of so many 
people or upon which there has been such diversity of opinion. That 
accounts for the numerous creeds and religious denominations that 
there are in the world today. 

Those of us who know the truth of the Gospel as it has been re- 
vealed in these last days through the instrumentality of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, know that there are millions of people who, in the end, when 
it shall be universally known of what salvation consists, how it may be 
attained, will be tremendously disappointed, and only the disappointment 
of the wicked or those who have fought against the work of God will 
be greater or supreme. We who know the truth and know the will of the 
Lord and the law of the Lord, understand that we are to love the Lord 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 39 

our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our might ; 
that this is the first great commandment. And the second is like unto it : 
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 

DISCHARGING OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

We ought to desire above everything else, except our own welfare 
and salvation, the welfare and salvation of our fellow men. We are 
organized as a Church. We have received responsibilities from on high 
to preach this Gospel of the kingdom in all the world as a witness be- 
fore the end shall come. For more than a century we have been trying 
as a people to discharge ourselves of this responsibility and prove our 
love of God and man by making sacrifice in the preaching of this Gospel. 
You have seen the results, and yet there are but very few of our Fath- 
er's children in this dispensation who have embraced the Gospel, but 
that is not to be wondered at. It was ever so. Only a few in the days 
of Isaiah, as we read in the fifty-third chapter of the book of Isaiah 
accepted the truth. The prophet said : "Lord, who hath believed our 
report ?" Only a few. And in the days of the primitive church we find 
this expression: 

"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord who hath 
believed our report?" 

This dispensation is a time of warning, just as much, I understand, 
as it was a day of warning when Noah the prophet of God was com- 
manded to warn the people of his day that if they did not repent of their 
sins and obey the Gospel they would be destroyed. We are told that for 
a hundred and twenty years the prophet of God labored among that 
people, but in vain except for the saving of a few souls. A great flood 
was sent to destroy the people. I say for more than a century we have 
been preaching this Gospel of the kingdom to the people of the world, 
and the people of the world are rejecting the message in large measure, 
excepting a very few. They will meet with disappointment and in some 
instances condemnation, according to the law that has come to those who 
have heard and have rejected the Gospel. 

SACRIFICE BRINGS BLESSINGS 

Now in these times of financial stress and business troubles the 
Latter-day Saints, I suppose, are feeling these things the same as other 
people. The Lord rains on the just and the unjust alike. But the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have more to encourage them than have the people of the 
world. We are here not for the gaining of wealth. That is not the end 
in view, but a means to a nobler end, that of serving God and working 
righteousness, striving to save our own souls and the souls pf others ; 
and we can afford to make the sacrifices that the Gospel entails upon us. 

Brethren and sisters, we know that we have the promise, and God's 
promises never fail, that we shall be rewarded abundantly in time and in 
eternity for all the sacrifices made for the accomplishment of his pur- 
poses. For the past. number of years we have maintained in the neigh- 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

borhood of two thousand missionaries in the field ; the report is made 
today that we have seventeen hundred and two missionaries out. You 
have heard the report of these mission presidents, how the numbers have 
been depleted in their mission fields. What are we going to do to keep 
up our record and do the work the Lord requires at our hands ? I have 
a recommendation for our mission presidents. 

LOCAL SAINTS AS MISSIONARIES 

Some of the presidents told us in our meeting with them a few days 
ago that they were using the local brethren and sisters, some in one way 
and some in another. In the closing remarks of President Hinckley of 
the California mission, who has just addressed us, he said he expected 
the branches in his mission to ,furnish a hundred local people to assist 
in this work. I want to relate to you a little experience I had in presid- 
ing over the European mission during the World War. I was there 
from August of 1916 until July of 1919. During that time in the British 
mission the number of missionaries from home was reduced from seven- 
ty-five to seven, including those who were in the mission headquarters. 
We had seventy-five branches that had formerly been presided over al- 
most universally by Elders from home. Those were now presided over by 
local men . Men who were able to bear arms had been drafted into the 
service, ,and those who were not entered the factories for the manu- 
facture of munitions of war. There were very few men left at home. 
We called as missionaries young men who were not old enough to bear 
arms. 

When I left that mission there were twenty-two local brethren 
laboring in the manner referred to, some of them giving part time, pre- 
siding over districts or branches, others giving their entire time as mis- 
sionaries. We called into the service young women and married women, 
and at one time, as I remember it, we had three hundred and seventy- 
five of these good sisters working. They rendered their reports to mis- 
sion headquarters the same as the missionaries had done who were from 
home. They distributed tracts, they held cottage meetings, loaned books, 
and did all the work that regular missionaries did. The result was that 
these missionaries were more faithful than ever before. The tithing of 
the British mission just about doubled itself in three years. We had 
almost as many baptisms as had been the case when we had seventy-five 
or more missionaries in the field. 

It shows what can be done with these local men and women in the 
world. They are just the same kind of people we have here in the stakes 
and wards. In every nation he that fears God and works righteousness 
is approved of him. I see no reason why men and women in the mis- 
sion field should not labor in the Church as missionaries or in any other 
capacity where they are needed, just as well as the people in organized 
wards and stakes. They are doing it in some places. There are some 
missionaries called from one mission to another. Why not the mission 
supply its quota of missionaries and send them out into other missions ? 
These lady missionaries are doing a .splendid work in all the missions 
where they are used. There are ladies locally who are just as efficient 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 41 

as those who go from the stakes and are willing and could be used to 
advantage if we would make use of them. 

I remember two years ago when I was going through the Canadian 
mission with President Hart, at Hamilton we called for volunteer lady 
missionaries to accompany those who were there from Zion. Instead of 
sending out two lady missionaries from Zion who were there at such 
great expense, it was suggested that we take one of these lady mission- 
aries and a local missionary, and have two sets of missionaries where 
formerly we had but one. Several sisters volunteered. We blessed these 
people and set them apart and we have reports that a splendid work was 
accomplished by those local sisters. Why can we not do this, and double 
the number of missionaries ? Suppose a woman cannot give all her time, 
if one sister would go out one day and another another day, if it took 
seven sisters to do a week's work along the side of a regular missionary, 
the work would be accomplished. Why not do the same with our 
brethren? 

I heard an Elder reporting his mission recently who said he tried 
out the plan of taking a little boy and giving him a tract and letting him 
lead up to the doors of homes, and it had a splendid effect. They would 
not shut the door on him or deny him. They would hear what he had to 
say, and his message would be an introduction for the missionary. T 
say that ,in that case the little boy was the equal of the Elder from home. 
When they go into a home there is no need for two Elders from Zion in 
that home to preach the Gospel, one can do all the talking ; all he needs 
is a companion and a witness, and here we have one. 

There are ways and means, and I believe that God expects us to be 
thoughtful men who have charge of this work in the mission field and 
at home. I think we can perhaps do better than we have been doing, 
and, brethren and sisters, all this means that we wash our hands clean 
of the blood of this generation, for we are as watchmen upon the tow- 
ers. Our responsibility is to warn the wicked and to call them to repent- 
ance and to preach this Gospel of the kingdom to those who are in spirit- 
ual darkness. 

A wonderful work is being accomplished. May God be praised for 
it and the Saints for the work they have done, and may this work go 
forward to the entire satisfaction of the Lord, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am glad to know that there are people in the world who are not 
discouraged. For months it has been my privilege to be in different 
parts of our country and it is rare that one finds those who are not ex- 
ceedingly pessimistic, because of conditions over which we seem to have 
no control. Men and women are unemployed and in many cases they 
will be in dire distress unless ways and means be prepared for them to 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

earn their living. The wise men of the earth are seeking to find some way 
whereby this difficulty may be overcome. Quite recently the most ter- 
rible war of all time occurred, and when that was finished many people 
thought that would be the end of war. At present there is suspicion 
and jealousy among the nations of the earth. There are groups that are 
preparing to take by force what they cannot obtain by honest toil, and 
"Men's hearts are failing them for fear." 

These things have been predicted. We have been told that in the 
last days serious difficulties would arise, and before that time the true 
Gospel would be preached. 

BLESSINGS FOLLOW OBEDIENCE 

In the year 1830 this Church with which we are identified was 
organized. It was patterned after the Church that had been organized 
by Jesus Christ our Lord on the other side of the mighty ocean. It was 
intended to prepare people for the things which were to come, and hun- 
dreds and thousands have rejoiced in the blessings that have followed 
obedience to the teachings of our Lord and obedience to the laws that 
govern his Church. 

IN THE DAYS OF NOAH 

It has been remarkable to me as I have read the history of the 
world, both religious and secular, that the children of men so easily for- 
get the Lord and turn away from him. In ancient times it became nec- 
essary for Noah to go about teaching the truth for more than a hun- 
dred years, and yet people rejected him and his message and the pre- 
diction that he made that they would suffer the penalty that always fol- 
lows disobedience to God. They were drowned in the flood. History 
discloses the fact that whenever people have served God and kept his 
commandments they prospered, and when they turned away from him 
and lost their faith they fell into transgression and they suffered the 
punishment that they merited by reason of their disobedience. That is 
not only true of the nations that have dwelt upon the European lands 
and in Asia and in Africa, but it has been true of those who have dwelt 
upon this hemisphere. 

THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF AMERICA 

When the Lord prepared to people this land, Ether and his group 
crossed the mighty ocean. This was soon after the confusion of tongues 
at Babel. They were not able of their own wisdom to cross the ocean, 
but the Lord taught them how they might make barges, how they should 
provide themselves with food ; and then under the guidance of his Holy 
Spirit they migrated to this great western hemisphere and were pros- 
pered. Then they forsook the Lord and fell into transgression, and the 
result was that as a people they were destroyed. Then another people 
came, about six hundred years before the birth of our Savior, under 
Lehi. They came to this western land led as had been the other people 
by the power of God. When they observed the commandments of the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 43 

Lord they were happy, and when they transgressed they suffered the 
penalty which always follows disobedience of the laws of our Heavenly 
Father. They separated into two groups after they arrived here, and 
while they became numerous upon the face of the earth there was a 
large portion of them who did not serve the Lord, and eventually they 
became so wicked that the Nephites or fair-skinned people perished, 
being destroyed by the Red Man. They had builded great cities and 
wonderful things were accomplished by those who kept the command- 
ments of the Lord, but those who would not obey him dwelt in idle- 
ness, or in a way that compelled them, if they would live, to take that 
which belonged to others. The Lord blessed those who honored him 
and kept his commandments as long as they were faithful, but eventually 
they were entirely destroyed, leaving their records buried in the earth, 
where they remained until they were delivered to the prophet Joseph 
Smith. History has repeated itself many times. 

THE RESULT OF DISOBEDIENCE 

In several places in the scriptures we read that "the wisdom of their 
wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall 
be hid," and in the day and age in which we live that is very plainly 
manifested to the children of men. The condition that has come upon 
the earth is not the result of righteousness; it is the result of disobedi- 
ence to the laws of our Father in heaven, and we as members of this 
Church have been warned of what was to come. We have not only been 
warned by the scriptures that were given in the days of the Savior and 
prior to his time, and those that were given after him, but in our own 
day and age the Lord has spoken and the revelations of our Heavenly 
Father are found in the Doctrine and Covenants. If we will read these 
revelations we will learn that the experiences through which we are 
passing were predicted, that the very promises that the Lord made are 
now being fulfilled. 

It does seem strange that so many of our Father's children think 
they are finding satisfaction in doing things that are wrong. The dis- 
tress of the world today is very largely because men have turned from 
the teachings of the Lord. Men are seeking the wealth of the world, 
and it appears to make little difference to some of them how they ob- 
tain it. They cannot take it with them. The things that they obtain by 
selfishness will not be beneficial to them. For thousands of years the 
Lord has been teaching this lesson, yet today it seems to me that men 
and women are as disobedient, as unthankful and unholy as they have 
ever been in any period of the world's history. 

THE ONLY REMEDY 

The message that the Lord has given to the earth, that we have 
been asked to disseminate, is the only rule of conduct whereby this diffi- 
culty may be removed. By following the teachings of the Lord, by 
turning unto him and repenting of sin, by going about doing good — 
that attitude will bring happiness and prosperity. Mankind will love 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

one another, and the hatred and the unkindness that have existed so 
much in the world will pass away. The Lord has not required some- 
thing that is impossible. On the contrary, he has given us command- 
ments and advice and counsel that it is possible for all of us to follow 
in this clay and age in which we live. The daily press brings to us ac- 
counts of disasters that are everywhere — the sea being tempestuous and 
loss of life upon it, earthquakes, great tornadoes, such as we have been 
told would occur in the last days — and it does seem to me, brethren and 
sisters, if men are thinking seriously, if they are reading the scriptures, 
they must know that the happenings that the Lord said would occur in 
the last days are occurring. The fig tree surely is putting forth its 
leaves, and those who are thoughtful must know that the summer is 
nigh, that those things that the Lord has predicted as preceding his sec- 
ond coming are now coming to pass. 

As we sit in this comfortable house today and enjoy the teachings 
that have been given to us under the influence and power of our Heav- 
enly Father, how grateful we ought to be for our blessings, for the fact 
that the Lord has removed from us uncertainty. There should be no 
doubt in the minds of this congregation as to what the Lord desires. 
There should be no uncertainty in our minds as to how we may be 
happy. There is only one way that we can enjoy our lives, and that is 
by being obedient to the teachings of an all-wise Father who knows the 
end from the beginning and has given to us understanding and the 
opportunity to add to that understanding and to prepare for every 
vicissitude of life. 

COMFORTS IN ABUNDANCE 

Isn't it a singular thing that what the world has struggled for from 
the beginning, wealth, power, all those things that make men comfort- 
able, are to be had in abundance today — better and more clothing than 
ever before, more food than can be consumed, more wealth of all kinds 
than the world has ever had before. Our homes are more comfortable. 
The conveniences of life have been multiplied marvelously since the 
Gospel came upon the earth, and today everything that we have strug- 
gled for we have. Education has arrived at its highest point. More 
knowledge of the things of this earth is possessed by men than ever 
before. Everything mankind has struggled for from the beginning of 
time that is considered most desirable is upon the earth today ; and not- 
withstanding that, there is doubt and dread of what the future has in 
store. 

THE CAUSE AND CURE 

What is our trouble ? It is that we have sought the creature com- 
forts, we have sought the honors of men, we have sought those things 
that selfishness puts into our souls. We have sought to set ourselves up 
and have preferred ourselves to our Father's other children. I am 
speaking now of the world. We have ignored the commandments that 
we should honor God and keep his commandments, that we should love 
our neighbors. We have failed to pray in the way that we were taught 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 45 

to pray, and men and women have set their judgment up against the 
teachings of an all-wise Father, and of course we are paying the price. 

Now if we would enjoy the blessings that the Lord has prepared 
for us, the things that we have struggled for, there is yet something 
else for us to do, and that is to love one another. That is to honor 
God and keep his commandments, obey the laws of the land in which 
we live, be considerate of one another, observe the teachings that have 
been given to us from the beginning of the world ; and if we will do 
that all our problems will be solved. The wisdom of men will be added 
upon, the power of God will come upon his children, and this earth will 
be cleansed and purified from the evils that exist that are rapidly de- 
stroying humanity. 

Knowing that, brethren and sisters, we ought to be faithful. The 
land that we live in should be sanctified by our lives of righteousness, 
and we should go about doing good. There should be no doubt in our 
minds as to the power of God to safeguard our interests. We know 
that he can do that, and in this wonderful Church, with its marvelous 
organization, with the authority of the holy priesthood bestowed upon 
thousands of our Father's sons, with these marvelous organizations that 
are given for the training of our youth — our Primary, our Mutuals, 
our Sabbath Schools, our Relief Society organization, our educational 
facilities — there is everything that should prepare us to know what God 
would have us do here. All that we need is to repent of our sins, turn 
from the error of our ways, cleanse our lives of impurity, and then to 
go about doing good. It does not require that we shall be set apart for 
that purpose. Every man, woman and child in the Church of Jesus 
Christ may go about doing good and receive the blessing that results 
therefrom. 

OUR MISSION 

Looking back through the experiences of those who have lived upon 
the earth, and remembering the privations and afflictions of those na- 
tions that have turned away from our Heavenly Father, let us not be 
among those who unwisely and foolishly set our judgment up against 
the wisdom of the Lord. Let us acknowledge his wisdom, let us set our 
hands to the work that he has entrusted to our care, let us bless our 
Father's children wherever they may be, and our lives will be enriched 
and this world will be made happier. This is the mission that has been 
placed upon our shoulders. Our Heavenly Father will hold us responsi- 
ble for the manner in which we fulfil it. God grant that in the hu- 
mility of our souls we will go about with the desire in our hearts to do 
good to all people wherever they may be, and bring to them the joy that 
can only come through observing his laws and keeping his command- 
ments. That peace may abide in our hearts and in our homes, that we 
may radiate sunshine and cheer wherever we may go, that we may 
prove to the world that we do know that God lives, by the lives that we 
lead, and receive his blessings therefor, I humbly pray" in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The auditor's report was not included in the statistics given by me 
this morning. It is as follows : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, 
April 4th, 1932. 
President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, 
Dear Brethren: — 

It gives us pleasure to state that our examination of the reports 
of the First Presidency's office, which cover the Presiding Bishop's 
department, discloses the fact that the Church is entirely out of debt. 
The accounting system of the Church is modern and complete. 

Respectfully submitted, 
Henry H. Rolapp, 
O. W. Adams, 
John W. Hart, 

Auditing Committee. 

The hymn, "Zion stands with hills surrounded," was sung by the 
congregation, after which the closing prayer was offered by Elder John 
M. Baxter, former president of the Woodruff Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, Saturday, April 9th. 



SECOND DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Saturday morning, April 9th, at 10 o'clock, 
with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints," was sung by the congregation. 

Elder Abel John Evans offered the opening prayer. 

A sacred solo, "The Penitent," was sung by Sister PSertha Sessions. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I can assure you, my brethren and sisters, and friends, that I feel 
keenly the responsibility of this position. I rejoice with you in the 
spirit of the Conference sessions that we have had and the instruction 
and testimony that have been given to us. 

GUIDANCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 

I appreciate the fact that we are living in important times, and 
that it is proper for us so to live and act that we may be guided by 
the influence and power of the Holy Spirit. The Lord has promised to 
all of us who have taken upon us his name, who have been baptized 
in water and by the power of the Holy Spirit, that if we will live in 
accordance with his commandments we shall enjoy the light of his 
Spirit to guide us. Surely there has never been a time in the history 
of the Church when that guidance was so necessary for every individual. 

We have 'our free agency. We shall be responsible for the deeds 
that we perform and for the failure to perform those things that will 
be for our progress and development. The Lord is desirous that every 
one of us shall go forward, do his will, keep his commandments, and 
enjoy his blessings. 

I realize the fact that if we will listen to the whisperings of the 
Holy Spirit, and be alert to follow promptly that inspiration that may 
come to us from time to time, we shall be enabled to avoid difficulties 
and troubles, and have joy, satisfaction and contentment in our daily 
lives. 

CHURCH ADVANCEMENT 

I rejoice in the leadership of this Church. I realize that they 
are men who are inspired of God to advise and counsel us in the way 
of truth and progress. 1 am sure that if ,we will listen to them and 
observe to do what they suggest to us, we shall be able to make satis- 
factory progress. 

I was impressed with the instructions and the report given by our 
President at the beginning of this Conference. As was stated by him. 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the Church is growing in membership, and it is growing in activity. 
It is true that the tithes in total have not been so large this past year 
as the previous year. Yet there are instances in various stakes and 
missions where there has been an increase in tithes. There has been 
an increase in the number of tithepayers in the Church. There has been 
quite a material increase in the fast offerings donated for the benefit 
of the poor. I am quite sure that the spirit of the present prevailing 
conditions has influenced many who may have been neglectful, possibly, 
or inappreciative of conditions of unemployment, in the realization of 
the fact that we should donate more liberally for those in need in these 
times. The result has been somewhat more evident in the observance 
of the fast offerings. 

PRIESTHOOD ACTIVITY 

It is to be noted that the activity of the priesthood is increasing. 
I am particularly familiar with the Aaronic priesthood, and that interest 
is evident. We are striving in cooperation with the stake presidencies, 
ward bishoprics, mission presidents, and all others who are concerned 
with the welfare and progress of this important work, to stimulate the 
young men who receive this priesthood, to greater faith and activity 
and an appreciation of the blessings that come through the fulfilment 
of their responsibilities in the Aaronic priesthood. 

Also, in other respects, the work of the Church is increasing. In 
the matter of ward teaching, this important labor has been carried 
on to a larger extent, month by month, in all of the various stakes and 
wards throughout the Church. 

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 

With reference to building construction, the (Church spent, as 
was reported by President Grant, over a half million dollars last year 
in the erection of ward buildings. That amount has been matched by 
the labor and the cash subscriptions of members of the Church and 
others in the various wards that have built meeting houses ; so that, 
in total, the expenditures for this purpose aggregate a very considerable 
sum. I believe that there has been more care exercised on the part of 
those who have had charge of building construction in the various wards, 
to see that the funds were efficiently expended. I am sure that, 
throughout the various wards and stakes, consistent efforts are being 
made to exercise the greatest economy possible in this, as in every other 
phase of material affairs in the Church. 

CLARITY OF CONSCIENCE 

In connection with the matter that I have referred to, of cultivating 
the Spirit of the Lord, I am reminded of a maxim, adopted by George 
Washington, whose two-hundredth anniversary we are celebrating this 
entire year, as a rule of conduct for him as a young man. I think the 
last one of the rules of conduct' that he adopted is as follows : "Labor 
to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called 
conscience." The development of conscience is one of the most helpful 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 49 

means to promote right living and fair dealing. I am sure that the 
Latter-day Saints are possessed of that spark of celestial fire. As a 
result of developing the spirit of frankness, of stimulating . the sense of 
right and wrong, of not allowing their consciences to be dulled by those 
things which interfere with straightforwardness and uprightness, they 
are in a position to have that sense touched by the influence and power 
of the Holy Spirit, to lead them in righteousness and faith and truth. 

A TIME OF TRIAL 

We live in times when we are being tested and proven. All the 
dross, all that is not pure metal is, so to speak, being burned up or 
skimmed off, leaving the pure metal. To the extent' that mankind 
have had to undergo trials and suffering, and that they have, in courage 
and faith, made sacrifice of material things that they have previously 
enjoyed, they have emerged so much stronger and finer. I believe 
adverse conditions are bringing men generally to an understanding of 
the elementals of life; and to a better appreciation of the measure of 
the values of things which really count in life. 

THE POWER OF TRUE RELIGION 

I am impressed with the fact that the acceptance of this Gospel 
involves our willingness to deny ourselves, if necessary, of anything 
that we may be called upon to sacrifice. I am reminded of a statement 
made in one of the Lectures on Faith in the Doctrine and Covenants. 
Though the lectures are not accepted by us as revelation, yet we are 
told they were prepared by the Prophet' Joseph, and were for the benefit 
of the people of the Church. This statement is as follows: 

"A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never 
has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salva- 
tion." 

Abraham's willingness to sacrifice 

Now, that is a very strong saying. Yet, the experiences of some of 
those of whom we have record, who have developed great spiritual 
power, demonstrate the fact that sacrifice has produced such results in 
their lives. I am reminded of Abraham, who was told by the Lord to 
take his son — the son of promise — born to him in his old age, through 
whom the divine assurance to Abraham regarding his posterity should 
be fulfilled, and offer him as a sacrifice. When this son was grown to 
be a youth his father was told by the Lord to offer him as a sacrifice 
upon Mount Moriah. Abraham did so. He took his son to that place 
and there was prepared to do what the Lord had commanded. He 
had proven his determination to carry out the will of the Lord, even 
though it meant the taking of the life of his son. 

There are those who would utter condemnation against such a 
course, as being contrary to all equity and righteousness. Yet Abraham 
recognized that the Lord had the power to give and to take away. 
He had that confidence in the Lord that the course of life that he was 
pursuing, and the instruction he was receiving from God, were such 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

that the Lord could save his son's life if it were necessary. So he 
proved his willingness to sacrifice the life of his beloved son. But 
when it came to the final test, after he had proven himself, the Lord 
did not require that sacrifice at his hands. However, he did greatly 
magnify Abraham, and he became, we are told, the friend of God, 
because of his sacrifice and his faith. He mingled with the great of the 
earth at that time, and was recognized by them as a power. Among 
the Mohammedans today Abraham is recognized as the greatest prophet 
of all. Likewise, among the Hebrews and Christians, he is recognized 
as a wonderful man. 

THE SAVIOR'S GREAT SACRIFICE 

Now, another example is that of the Savior himself. He was 
called upon to sacrifice his life because it was the will of God. It was 
his mission. He had the assurance that the course of life he was 
pursuing was pleasing to God. The final achievement of his mortal 
life was to undergo that atoning sacrifice for the redemption of mankind. 
He realized the terrible agony that he would have to suffer, as well as 
the mental crucifixion that he must endure through the shame and ridi- 
cule that was to be heaped upon him. Yet he was prepared to accept 
and undergo the sacrifice that was before him. Thereby he became 
the Redeemer of the world ; and the mediator between men and God. 
He is the one who stands between us and our eternal Father. Through 
him alone can we gain the resurrection and come to salvation by the 
acceptance of his teachings, and the observance of his commandments. 

MARTYRDOM OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH 

There have been others who have been called upon to make great 
sacrifice for their devotion to divine truth. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
demonstrated in his life the very thing that is contained in the statement, 
that only that religion which has the power to call for the sacrifice of 
all things, even of life itself, if necessary, has the power to produce 
the faith necessary to bring mankind to life and salvation. The Prophet 
Joseph went to his martyrdom assured that the faith he possessed and 
the principles that he had adopted were of God. He (had had the 
assurance from the Lord himself, from his personal visitation to him, 
that he should become an instrument in his hands for the accomplish- 
ment of divine purposes. Through his faith and .sacrifice we under- 
stand that he is appointed to stand at the head of this last dispensation. 

I do not assume that the Lord is going to require of every one of 
us such sacrifices. But I !do maintain that the living of the Gospel 
will develop the spirit of sacrifice. If we are to gain salvation we must 
first have assurance that the course of life we are pursuing is in accord- 
ance with the will of the Lord. In other words, we must have a testi- 
mony of the divinity of this work. If we do not, we cannot, of course, 
be willing to make sacrifices. So it is important that every one of us 
should gain assurance of the divinity of this work, and of the fact 
that the Prophet Joseph Smith was ordained of God for the establish- 
ment of this work. To him were consigned the keys of divine authority 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 51 

to direct the work. All who have succeeded him have been appointed 
to bear the keys of authority in the Church, and have been inspired of 
God. That authority permeates the entire body of the Church. 

REAL VALUES OF LIFE 

Do these sacrifices really mean loss in the real sense of the word ? 
In the mortal or human sense, probably yes. From the standpoint 
of the pleasures of the world, probably yes. The people of the world 
consider anything a deprivation that would restrain them from indulg- 
ing their appetites of whatever nature. But those who have an appreci- 
ation of the values of life will realize that the things that the people 
of the world refer to as the pleasures of life and the satisfying of their 
appetites, are the petty things. They are the things that will pass. 
They are the dross that will be thrown away. It has been aptly said 
that to do without and like it is the 'first lesson in the art of being happy. 
The principles that the Lord has revealed are the things that will count 
as realities in this ilife and in eternity. 

DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SACRIFICE 

These principles are known to us. I do hot need to enumerate 
them. All that the Lord has commanded us to do are for our benefit. 
We receive the blessings. There is no sacrifice in the final and per- 
manent sense of the word. The rewards obtained are so much greater 
than the self-denial necessary. We gain through the observance of 
divine commandments, because every principle and any deprivation that 
may be entailed thereby is for our greatest welfare, growth, and de- 
velopment in life, here and hereafter. 

TITHING REQUIRES FAITH 

I have been impressed with the testimonies at various times in 
these conferences of the Church relative to the results of the observance 
of tithing, that have been borne to' us, and the evidences shown in our 
investigations. I think probably that tithing may he considered a 
principle that from a pecuniary and selfish standpoint requires more 
power and faith to observe than some other commandments. Yet it 
brings blessings far outweighing the sacrifice itself. 

TITHING IN OTHER CHURCHES 

I am reminded, too, of a statement made showing the way in which 
this principle is growing among other people. I have an article clipped 
from a magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church, known as "The 
Diocesan Council," in which the subject of tithing is discussed. It 
refers to a booklet called "The Church has Tithers," written by a Dr. 
Louis B. Franklin. He writes of the observance of tithing as they 
understand it. His comment' in regard to the principle of tithing is 
rather interesting: "The practice of tithing is extremely simple. One- 
tenth of all income, plus one-tenth the rental value of a house wholly 
owned and used as one's residence, should be set aside as God's property 
to be administered for him. Help to dependent relatives is a family 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

obligation and should not ibe taken out of the tenth. Exercise the same 
care in administering God's portion as you do in running your own 
business, or budgeting your household expenses. Whatever the reason, 
many have recorded it their judgment that' it is easier to live on nine- 
tenths than on ten-tenths. The readjustment of a family budget so as 
to provide for setting aside the tithes may demand a reconsideration 
of the whole question of standards of living. Many have found in 
such a consideration the dawning of a new and happier day." 

That is the testimony of people who do not belong to this Church. 
Does that indicate that the principle of tithing is a natural, divine 
principle? Surely if 'it is divine it will produce result's for all who 
practice it in the spirit of it, as far as they have understanding. 

FAITHFUL TITHEPAYERS GENERALLY EMPLOYED 

From the reports given by some of the mission presidents, and 
by the stake presidents and bishops, and from our own investigations, it 
appears that generally the people throughout the Church who pay 
tithing are making their way forward financially as well as spiritually. 
Those who need help are largely not' those who have been faithful tithe- 
payers. On the other hand, most of the faithful tithepayers have been 
able to maintain themselves even under this most extended period 
of depression. Surely this is a splendid evidence of some of the results 
of faith and sacrifice. Let it he remembered, however, that faith in 
the divinity of this or any other principle alone can bring the blessings. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire to testify to you that this and 
every other principle of the Gospel is for our welfare and progress, 
and that the Gospel itself is the greatest thing that has come to mankind, 
both for this life and for the life hereafter. I pray that I may be able 
to stand, with you, firm and faithful, be prompt to accept instructions 
given, alert to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and to measure 
up to the finest standards of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GIDEON N. HULTERSTROM 

Former President of the Swedish Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I am indeed glad and happy for this 
opportunity to be in attendance at this General Conference of the Church. 
I humbly pray that while I stand before you I may have a rich portion 
of the Holy Spirit of God, to direct my report that I am to give of the 
Swedish mission. 

I bring you greetings and good tidings from your sons in Sweden. 
They are performing a faithful labor in that far-off land. They are 
laboring earnestly for the building up of the church and kingdom of 
God. There seems never to have been a time when there has been a 
better opportunity to do missionary work than at the present time, and 
I am pleased to report that the work of the Lord is gaining headway in 
Sweden. 

We are proclaiming the Gospel in the usual way, but also by illus- 



ELDER GIDEON N. HULTERSTROM k 53 

trated lectures about Utah and the pioneers, and also lectures about the 
Book of Mormon. In connection with our conferences held we are giv- 
ing concerts and religious pageants, and I am happy to state that all 
these new methods have had a wonderful effect for good in behalf of 
the Lord's cause in Sweden. 

In one of our conferences in the city of Stockholm we had the honor 
to have with us the U. S. Consul General, Mr. John Ball Osborne. We 
took the opportunity to call upon him to speak. In his address he said 
among other things, that the Latter-day Saints are trustworthy men and 
women. He praised the work accomplished by our Elders, and he spoke 
highly of our Church leaders, especially of those that he had become 
acquainted with, namely, Dr. John A. Widtsoe, Dr. James E. Talmage 
and Senator Reed Smoot. Much good came from the results of this 
conference, especially for the reason that we had this distinguished gen- 
tleman with us, taking part on the program. 

On the 14th of June, this year, it will be eighty-two years since the 
Gospel was first introduced in Scandinavia by the late Apostle Erastus 
Snow. This was the most outstanding event in the history of the 
Scandinavian countries, and the proclaiming of the restored Gospel in 
those lands since the year 1850 has brought nearly fifty-five thousand 
souls into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What a 
wonderful harvest ! I rejoice when I think of the progress of this great 
latter-day work in all parts of the world. 

I am pleased to state that a change has come about in the world, 
because in the past our message has been somewhat misunderstood. I 
am pleased to report that the newspaper press in Sweden is more favor- 
able now than it has ever been before. Our meetings are advertised free of 
charge in nineteen of the newspapers over there, and a friendly spirit 
exists today. Whenever prominent Church members visit us we arrange 
for an interview, and the good things thus published in the papers have 
a wonderful effect for good. I can truthfully say that we have been 
blessed indeed by the Lord in our work in Sweden. 

I take this opportunity to greet you from President and Sister John 
A. Widtsoe, presiding over the European Mission.. By the way, they 
are doing a most wonderful work, and under their able direction we are 
trying to build up the branches of the Church in the Swedish mission, 
and to keep in step with all new things and new methods introduced by 
the Church, here at home and in the missions. 

I can state that more responsibility has been placed upon the local 
brethren, and our auxiliary organizations are working; they are active 
and they are doing a most splendid work. The Primary work was in- 
troduced in the Swedish mission about a year ago and five such organ- 
izations are now functioning. I am also happy to relate that we have 
organized, during the past two years, three genealogical societies in that 
mission, and they are doing a considerable lot of good for the members 
of the Church, in their research work, preparatory to sending their gen- 
ealogical work to the Salt Lake Temple. 

The Book of Mormon has its mission to* fulfil, — a great mission, by 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the way. It contains the fulness of the Gospel, and the Elders have done 
their best to distribute this book. It has been placed in the libraries of 
Sweden, and in some of the leading book stores, and thereby several 
copies are being distributed. During my visit in Finland, a couple of 
years ago, I presented the Book of Mormon to Mr. Uno Thurman, of the 
public library in Helsingfors. He was very glad to receive this sacred 
volume. 

In conclusion I wish to testify to you that Mormonism is the true 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I am grateful indeed to my Heavenly Father 
for the privilege I have had to spend ten years of my life as a mission- 
ary abroad in the ministry of the Gospel. This wonderful privilege has 
come to pass in fulfilment of a patriarchal blessing that I received about 
thirty years ago. 

I rejoice in this work, and my desire is to keep on working in this 
Church during all the days of my life. I know, as surely as I know that 
I live, that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, and that President 
Heber J. Grant and his associates, who stand at the head of this Church 
today, are true servants of the living God, holding the keys of the priest- 
hood and having authority to build up the Kingdom of God in all the 
world. 

This is my testimony, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

The poet, on seeing weather-beaten trees, and remarking their shape 
and outline, wrote reflectingly : 

"Is it as plainly in our living shown, by slant and twist 
Which way the wind has blown?" 

The answer to this query is yes ; we do, in our living, reflect the way the 
wind has blown. Every influence that we have known registers some 
mark upon us. Each one leaves its impress, and one day finds expres- 
sion in our conduct or attitude. 

As you have heard, I come to you from the mission field, where it 
has been my privilege to associate with many of your sons. I have had 
the opportunity to observe them ; to study their actions and reactions ; 
to appraise their character. I have seen them in discouragement and in 
enthusiasm, in defeat and in victory, confused by problems, and tri- 
umphing over them. I have seen their works. I have recognized their 
efforts. I have looked into their lives — their souls were bared to me. I 
have known their faith; and I wish to say to you mothers and fathers 
of missionaries, there are no finer young men in all the world than those 
you send to us as missionaries. I congratulate you as parents, and I con- 
gratulate the Church for such splendid types of young people. Their 



ELDER FRED TADJE 55 

character is an honor and a credit to you, for they reflect the influences 
that you have exerted over them. 

Just as surely as weather-beaten trees show the way the wind has 
blown, so do these young men disclose the kind of training they have 
received. In the lives of these young men we can see the shaping power 
of the Church and of the home, and the influence of their parents. 

One of the most potent factors in molding an individual's life is the 
power of example, particularly the example of the parents. The child 
naturally looks to his father as a. perfect model. His son will copy his 
walk, his speech, his manners, his every action. Father is his model, his 
rock on which he stands. Unconsciously, perhaps, but nevertheless sure- 
ly, the child patterns his life after his father. If the father is a man of 
faith and virtue, if he cultivates the good qualities, then every fine trait 
is accented in the child. But if he is careless and negligent, if his habits 
are bad, his influence, just as strong, is for the worse. 

Fathers and mothers, what a tremendous responsibility is ours ! How 
vigilant we must ever be to guide our children right. How we must 
foster the spirit of faith and love in our homes. There it is that we can 
inculcate a love of the Gospel, an unshakable faith, in the breasts of our 
children. Let every influence be an uplifting one. Cultivate religious 
expression. 

I believe one reason why the Gospel means so much to me is, be- 
cause it meant so much to my parents. We were brought close to the 
Gospel as children in the home. Not a day passed that some phase of 
the Gospel was not discussed. Family prayers were observed regularly, 
and then early in the evening, before any one was over-tired. The motto 
in the home was: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteous- 
ness ; and all these things shall be added unto you." The spirit of the 
home, the discussion of the Gospel principles, the family prayers, and 
above all, the example of the parents, who endeavored to live real Gos- 
pel lives, imbued a desire into the hearts of the children to serve the 
Master in whatever capacity they were capable. 

A father confided to me, at one time, that when his children passed 
through the critical period of their lives he had fasted and prayed a day 
every week for years, for divine help to rear his children properly in the 
Church. He wanted them to grow up in faith and in love of the truth. 
He said : "I cannot bear to see my children go astray, or disinterested 
in the Gospel. Should that happen it would shorten my life, and with 
the help of the Lord I will do all that lies in my power to instil into 
their hearts a desire to serve him." What a devotion to a righteous 
cause ! Were his efforts in vain ? Indeed not, for thus far his children 
are firmly grounded in the faith, and no matter what call is made upon 
them by the Church, they respond joyfully and whole-heartedly. 

I have three boys whom I love dearly. If I can inspire them with 
the same high faith that my parents bequeathed to me, if I can instil 
into their hearts a fervent love of God and his work, if I can be a worthy 
example in all things, then I shall be content. If I can create in them 
an earnest desire to know God's will and to do it, to serve him and to love 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

his Gospel, then I shall be indeed gratified. Some day, I hope, they may- 
take their place as missionaries, thoroughly qualified to carry on in the 
all-important work. And I hope that some future mission president, 
looking upon the lives of my boys, and of yours, may read in them the 
reflection of good influences and proper example. May he never see 
child-like faith dulled by parental indifference, or potential virtue marred 
by parental neglect. 

Let our every influence be for good. Let our example be a shining 
light to guide our children in the paths, of truth and righteousness. Let 
us bring the Gospel close to our children, that they may learn to know 
and love it, and that they may respond to its uplifting influence. 

My experience has proven that, generally speaking, the most faith- 
ful and successful missionaries come from families here at home where 
the Gospel receives first consideration. I have observed, too, that the 
families where the Gospel is the predominant thought are ever responsive 
to the call of the Authorities of the Church, no matter what sacrifice it 
might entail. 

Let us all place ourselves in tune with this great cause by making 
the Gospel a substantial part of our home life and training. I am ex- 
ceedingly grateful for my membership in this Church. I prize more 
highly than I can express the privileges I enjoy as a bearer of the 
Melchizedek priesthood. My earnest desire is to be able to show my 
appreciation for my many blessings by rendering at all times, and under 
every circumstance, acceptable service in the sight of the Lord. This 
Gospel has brought me joy and gratification beyond description. I have 
tasted of the fruits of the Gospel, and I want to testify to you that I 
have found them most delicious. 

May the Lord continue to bless us all, I humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the request of President Grant the congregation arose and sang 
two verses of the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel."

BENEFITS OF CONFERENCE 

It has been my great pleasure now for nearly forty years to be in 
attendance at the General Conferences of the Church. I count it a lib- 
eral education in the science of life to have had this distinguished priv- 
ilege, not alone from the things that were said, but the spirit that pre- 
vailed during those many sessions has brought to me understanding, light 
and knowledge that I have prized most highly. I have observed that 
there has always been something suited for the occasion, for the times 
demanded certain instructions ; and that those instructions were forth- 
coming at the conference, for the profit, the guidance and the blessing 
of the people. I am sure this Conference is proving to be full of fruit- 
ful benefit to the membership of the Church. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 57 

KINGDOM OF SATAN TO BE SHAKEN 

In the beginning of the foundation of this work the Lord said — I 
am reading from the hundred and thirty-second section of the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, 
or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are 
not by me, or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down. * * * 

"For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not 
by me shall be shaken and destroyed." 

I read a statement similar to that in the Book of Mormon, Second 
Nephi, reading from the twenty-eighth chapter. Speaking of these days, 
which Nephi undoubtedly saw, full of all their peril and their trouble, 
he said: 

"For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must 
needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his ever- 
lasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish ; 

"For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, 
and stir them up to anger against that which is good." 

He expressed the same thought in the last chapter of First Nephi, 
and I read as follows ; describing these very events such as we are now 
passing through, he observed : 

"The righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded. 
But it is the kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among the children of 
men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh — 

"For the time speedily shall come, that all churches which are built up to get 
gain, and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who 
are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the 
lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity ; 
yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the devil, are they who need 
fear, and tremble, and quake ; they are those who must be brought low in the dust ; 
they are those who must be consumed as stubble ; and this is according to the 
words of the prophet." 

These marvelous declarations that the day would come, in the his- 
tory of the world, when everything that was set up by man, that was not 
in harmony with God's will and purpose, would be shaken and destroyed, 
indicates a new epoch in the history of this world. 

As we look back over the hundred years that have passed since these 
prophecies in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants were 
made known to us, we see evidences of the Lord fulfilling these very pre- 
dictions ; everything to be tested, to be tried and to be shaken, and only 
that which is the truth and that which was set up by the Lord shall 
survive. 

A CENTURY OF PROGRESS 

What marvelous things the Lord has been doing in the earth, out- 
side of this Church ! Next year, in the city of Chicago, there will be a 
centennial exposition celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the 
founding of that great city, for it was established three years after this 
Church was organized. It has been named "A Century of Progress." 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

using the exact title of a very fine manual which the Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association adopted in 1930. 
The exposition will set forth what has happened in human progress 
during the past hundred years. 

I was impressed recently by reading a book entitled "A Century's 
Changes in Religion," and the observation made that the last fifty years 
have shown greater changes in religious thought and practice than all 
the ages of time. But what changes have been wrought ! What changes 
have occurred in the science and the arts ! How human thinking has 
been modified ! 

When Joseph Smith came forth declaring the restoration of this 
Gospel, with its clear-cut notions concerning the salvation of men, con- 
cerning the doctrine of deity, they were so diametrically opposed to every 
existing religious denomination that there is no wonder he had the hatred 
and enmity of religious bodies. But how the truth he taught has sur- 
vived ! Belief in miracles was necessary to accept Joseph Smith's state- 
ment, and that was not a miracle-believing age. But how the Lord has 
changed human thinking in these hundred years ! 

Let me read two items that I secured recently. One of them is a 
statement which occurred in the very year that Joseph Smith received 
his first vision, the year 1820. 

J. R. Howard, former president of the American Farm Bureau 
Federation, and now head of the National Transportation Institute, 
stated in a recent address that back in 1820 the head of a school board 
at Lancaster, Ohio, wrote the following letter to one who had applied 
for the use of a school house for a debate on the practicability of the 
railroad and telegraph. Here is his letter : 

"You are welcome to use the school house to debate all proper questions in, 
but such things as railroads and telegraphs are impossibilities and rank infidelity. 
There is nothing in the Word of God about them. Tf God had designed that His 
intelligent creatures should travel at a frightful speed of fifteen miles an hour, by 
steam. He would have clearly foretold through His holy prophets. It is a device 
of Satan to lead immortal souls down to hell." 

Even as late as 1870, here is an item that appeared in a Boston 
newspaper : 

"A man about forty-six years of age, giving the name of Joshua Copper- 
smith, has been arrested in New York for attempting to extort funds from igno- 
rant and superstitious people by exhibiting a device which he says will convey 
the human voice any distance over metallic wires, so that it will be heard by the 
listener at the other end. 

"He calls the instrument a 'telephone,' which is obviously intended to imi- 
tate the word 'telegraph' and win the confidence of those who know of the success 
of the latter instrument without understanding the principles on which it is based. 

"Well-informed people know that it is impossible to transmit the human 
voice over wires, as may be done with dots and dashes and signals of the Morse 
Code, and that, were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value. 

"The authorities who apprehended the criminal are to be congratulated, and 
it is to be hoped that his punishment will be prompt and fitting, that it may serve 
as an example to other conscienceless schemers who enrich themselves at the ex- 
pense of their fellow creatures." 

Have we made any progress in a hundred years? When my voice 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 59 

is now traveling over radio — not over wires — to those of you who are 
listening, at the speed of light, one hundred and eighty-six thousand 
miles a second, almost eight times around this globe in one second — have 
we made any progress ? 

I listened to an international broadcast honoring America's greatest 
inventor, who passed away last year, Thomas A. Edison, celebrating the 
fiftieth anniversary of the invention of the electric light ; his voice com- 
ing instantly, and the voice of Dr. Einstein from Berlin, on the other 
side of the world, in the smallest fraction of a second. Then 1 fell to 
thinking of what had happened in the fifty years that I could remember, 
and I concluded that more human progress had been made in these fifty 
years than in all the ages of time; and I asked myself : Why have I been 
permitted to live to see more than all my fathers, back to the day 
of Adam, had seen, all combined together? 

THE HAND OF GOD MANIFEST 

Why this marvelous change, and how it has changed human think- 
ing ! Now we live in the age of miracles ! There are a thousand of 
them that we see with our eyes. They are demonstrated, and yet we, 
many of us, cannot comprehend them. They are miraculous, and yet they 
are realities. 

How all this mighty flood of truth has been an ally to this Church, 
perhaps its greatest ally ! But I count it all as having come from God. He 
was fighting the battles of truth. When it was his good pleasure, as 
Joel saw, the day would come when the Spirit of God would be poured 
out upon all flesh, and young men would dream dreams, and old men 
would see visions, the vision of the things of God. These were all his 
secrets. It was not that the age that preceded ours was lacking in in- 
telligence, that they did not discover these marvels that have brought us 
such great human transformations. It was that God had not willed it. 
When the hour came that he was willing that a new order of things 
should be established in the earth, he unlocked the secrets he had held, 
and let man come to know them. 

Hence these have been our allies, for we find ourselves in no con- 
tradiction to any of these scientific truths that have come. We recognize 
the vast difference between the theories of scientists and the facts of 
science. I have failed to find this Church, or its teachings, in conflict 
with a single fact of science. 

GROWTH OF CHURCH 

It used to be said that Mormonism flourished where ignorance was 
most profound, but in the age of the world's greatest enlightenment 
there is no church on earth whose percentage of growth equals this 
Church. While others are losing ground, how we rejoiced to hear yes- 
terday the report of the continual progress and growth of this Church, 
and that in the age of the world's greatest enlightenment ! 

There was published in 1929 a volume entitled "The Story of Re- 
ligion," and I read this regarding Joseph Smith and Mormonism ; 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"The incredible thing about Mormonism is that such a respectable religion 
could have been derived from such a disreputable person. Mormonism is barely a 
century old, and yet it is one of the most successful religions on the American 
continent. If we are to accept the dictum of Jesus, 'By their fruits ye shall know 
them,' we must rate Mormons high. There is no disputing the fact, however, that 
Joseph Smith, the undoubted founder of Mormonism, was not only a psychopathic 
case, but also a shrewd schemer whose ethical sense was poorly developed. 

"America has no better citizens than the Mormons. At first sight it is diffi- 
cult to account for the evolution of present-day Mormonism from the teaching of 
such an erratic person as Joseph Smith. 

"There are several factors of importance, however, in the situation. In the 
first place, in spite of his visions and vagaries, Joseph Smith was undoubtedly 
a commanding and attractive personality. That fact has been testified to by 
friend and enemy. In the second place, there were elements of power and worth 
in Smith's message." 

We are making some progress, that we are counted to be among the 
most enlightened, and no religion more acceptable. Still they cannot 
understand how it could have come from such a disreputable person. 
How long shall we live until the whole truth shall be known, until out 
of the bigotry of that age that had conceptions such as I have just read 
to you, Joseph Smith shall yet arise gloriously, when the truth he taught 
shall be more fully understood by men ? 

We know that they had not understood him. They have not under- 
stood us. But we shall yet win the world to pay honor and respect to 
that prophet of God, and know that those who traduced his character 
did not tell the truth. So I rejoice in that which is happening. I rejoice 
in what God is doing today, for he is moving among the nations of the 
earth. 

HOPEFUL OF FUTURE 

Yes, I see him even in this depression, brethren. I know that 
greater human progress will be made in the future than in the past. I 
am looking for greater progress in the alleviation of the economic dis- 
tresses of the world in the next ten years than the last hundred years 
have seen. The men of this age are awakening to the need of it. God 
is preparing for the coming of his Son, Jesus Christ. He would not 
come to a world that was in the condition this world was in a hundred 
years ago. Neither is he ready to come just yet. There are many things 
that must yet be clone in the battle for truth and right. There shall yet 
be wars, certainly : but out of each conflict, no matter how deadly, will 
come victory for truth and for human emancipation, for it is in God's 
program. 

You Latter-day Saints need not be afraid, if only you will continue 
to adhere to these principles that have brought us through in the past so 
successfully, and shall deliver us from the trials of the future. Do not 
become alarmed nor disturbed. It is said of human beings, when they 
are confronted with disaster, the great majority lose their heads and go 
temporarily insane. If a fire breaks out in a theatre, the majority of 
people will trample each other to death. How few there are that in the 
majesty of their souls arise to the occasion, undefeated, and walk out 
calmly ! 



ELDER MELV1N J. BALLARD 61 

ADVICE TO LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

In this time of panic and distress there are many who lose their 
heads and rush on banks, to wreck them. That ought not to be a char- 
acteristic of the Latter-day Saints. They ought, in majesty and in peace 
and in self control, to be sane and not insane. There are those who lose 
their faith, some allow their spirit to be broken, and some even commit 
suicide. It should not be so with the Latter-day Saints. Our position 
should be to study our problem and discover what led us into our present 
difficulties. Then go to work, and see to it that we solve our problem 
and let not this lesson be repeated unto us. 

Let us not become ramblers. If we have failed in one place we 
need not go to the ends of the earth to try again. Right in the same 
community where you are you will discover another chance. You need 
not leave your farming occupations either. If you will be patient, and 
stay by the enterprises that you have undertaken, and practice self-denial, 
God will deliver you. The greatest losses are not financial. They are 
spiritual. Our financial losses will all be recovered if we will only be 
patient and see the hand of God working for the furtherance of his holy 
purposes. We have reached the day, thank the Lord, when his truth is 
triumphant, when it is going to succeed, the greatest day truth has ever 
known. 

TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH 

My soul rejoices to be identified with the Church that has the truth. 
I am more interested in seeing the truth succeed than any organization 
to which I belong, but thank God, the organization to which I 
belong has the truth, and everything that has come forth in this age is 
demonstrating it. It will stand every test, and it will stand forever. 

God help us to be loyal to it, support it ; there never has been an 
opportunity, in the history of this world, for the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
to really demonstrate its power, its virility and its strength. Now its 
day has come. Live our religion, arid let our light shine, and we shall 
see God's work going forward to greater and holier accomplishments 
than in the past. 

This is my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, for I believe 
with all my soul that God has not deserted us, but he is moving for- 
ward to the accomplishment of his purposes. May they speedily be 
accomplished. May we keep the faith and be found with God's work in 
the day of its victory, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

As I stand before you this morning I find my mind still occupied 
by an ever recurring thought suggested by a conversation I had recently 
with some students, more particularly with one student, who within a 
day or so, came to inquire for guidance and to seek possible help. 

This particular young man was very much perturbed in his feelings. 
He had heard in one of his classes several imputations that seemed to 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

conflict with his ideas of religion. One of the latest, for an illustration, 
was this : His teacher had said that the principle of "Fasting is a relic 
of asceticism." I immediately asked him if he had ever thought that 
asceticism as related to fasting might be the prostitution of a worthy 
principle. He said he had never considered that phase of the question. 

ASSOCIATION WITH LEADERS AN INSPIRATION 

Before I comment further upon this conversation I desire to ex- 
press a few thoughts in relation to the adequacy of this Church in sup- 
plying the needs of every human heart. An appreciation of the whole 
will make more impressive the importance of any particular part. I 
am happy that this one hundred and second annual conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints finds me in absolute har- 
mony with the teachings and ideals of the Church. My confidence in 
the First Presidency as noble men and inspired leaders is secure. My 
association with the Council of the Twelve, with members of the Gen- 
eral Sunday School Union board, with members of other general boards, 
with stake and mission presidencies, and with the priesthood generally 
throughout the Church is a constant source of inspiration and delight. 

CHRIST THE IDEAL 

The teachings and life of the Master never before seemed to me 
more beautiful, more necessary and more applicable to human happiness. 
Never have I believed more firmly in the perfection of humanity as the 
final result of man's placement here on earth. With my whole soul I 
accept Jesus Christ as the personification of human perfection — as God 
made manifest in the flesh, as the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. 

"He stands alone," as one has said, "in unapproachable grandeur. 
Nineteen centuries roll away, and his character so lives that he inspires 
millions of men with impassioned love. 

"Other men may seem to be children of their surroundings. He 
became what he was despite his surroundings, and he is the only one 
who can say, in truth : 'Do as I have done.' " His eyes looked beyond 
the present, peered into eternity, and comprehended the infinite. He 
is the image of God. 

Christ's gospel a perfect plan 

Accepting him as my Redeemer, Savior, Lord, it is but logical that 
I accept his Gospel as the plan of salvation, as the one perfect way to 
happiness and peace. There is not a principle which was taught by 
him but seems to me to be applicable to the growth, development and 
happiness of mankind. Every one of his teachings seems to touch the 
true philosophy of living. I accept them whole-heartedly. I love to 
study them. I like to teach them. 

Christ's church a comprehensive plan 

So it is with the Church which Christ has established. Since it is 
founded by the Perfect One, it follows that when properly interpreted 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY l 63 

it too approaches perfection. Every phase of it therefore seems to me 
to be applicable in some way to the welfare of the human family. When 
I consider the quorums of priesthood, I see in them an opportunity for 
developing that fraternity and brotherly love which is essential to the 
happiness of mankind. In these quorums and in the auxiliaries I see 
opportunities for intellectual development, for social efficiency. In the 
judicial phase of the Church I see an ample means of settling difficul- 
ties, of establishing harmony in society, of administering justice and of 
perpetuating peace among individuals and groups. In the ecclesiastical 
organization I see an opportunity for social welfare such as cannot be 
found in any other organization in the world. Thus do Christ and his 
Church become my ideal, my inspiration in life. I think it is the highest 
ideal for which man can strive. 

FAITH AN ANCHOR TO THE SOUL 

Such faith in the Great Teacher and in his Church I consider a safe 
anchor for young people to possess, especially during the formative 
period of their lives, and I freely take issue with any man who delib- 
erately destroys such a faith without offering something better in its 
place ; and I know of nothing else in the world that can even approach 
Christ's Church as an anchor for the soul. 

MORE FAITH NEEDED 

One great need in the world today is more faith, less skepticism, 
more confidence, less doubting. As Bruce Barton expresses it: "Faith 
in business, faith in country, faith in one's self, faith in other people, — 
this is the power which moves the world. And why is it unreasonable 
to believe that this power, which is so much stronger than any other, is 
merely a fragment of the great power that operates the universe?" 

FAITH SHOULD BE INCREASED NOT UNDERMINED 

Now, at the opening of my remarks I referred to my conversation 
with a'student because it illustrates two things : First : Insinuations made 
to the young who are yet undecided as to what are the most important 
things in life may shake the faith of youth, and "Youth without faith 
is a day without sun." 

Secondly, I cite that instance to bring home to us today the neces- 
sity of parents and officers in the Church teaching more earnestly and 
diligently the principles of life and salvation to the youth of Zion and 
to the world in order to keep the latter properly balanced through the 
formative period of their lives. 

"Our civilization is imperiled today," writes an American statisti- 
cian, "simply because it is ill balanced. Our spiritual culture lags so far 
behind our material culture, in its development, that we have no ade- 
quate control over the latter. Our science, our education and our gov- 
ernment can do much to help correct this lack in our spiritual develop- 
ment, but in the main this must be done, if done at all, by religion and 
by the Church, for religion is the creator and the conservator of our 
social ideals, and the church is their chief propagator." 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The confidence and faith I have expressed this morning in the First 
Presidency, the Twelve, and others of my associates, as well as in the 
Gospel and especially in the Savior, applies also to the tenets and teach- 
ings of the Church. Every one when properly interpreted and applied 
has in it a saving power and blessing for all who will accept it. 

PRINCIPLES TO BE APPROACHED FROM PROPER VIEW POINT 

There is not time this morning even to mention further these vari- 
ous phases of the Church, each one of which will apply to the needs, 
to the education, to the peace of individuals. I should like to take, as 
an example, however, the principle already named. Considering this 
will illustrate also how even a teacher may himself become warped in 
his attitude toward what he might consider merely a dogma. You know 
there are occasionally men in the profession of teaching — as that is my 
profession I can speak plainly — who pride themselves on being icono- 
clasts ; but unfortunately, when such teachers break their so-called 
images they supply nothing to replace them. They destroy ideals but 
offer no others, thus leaving the young boy in doubt and uncertainty. 
Such a one seems to me to be heaving anchor and starting out on the 
ocean of life before his course is even charted. It is well not only for 
church people but for educators everywhere when teaching the young 
to have in mind the three "C's" as well as the three "R's" mentioned so 
proverbially. By those three "C's" I mean character, conduct, citizen- 
ship. The teaching of religion in public schools is prohibited, but the 
teaching of character and citizenship is required. 

PRINCIPLE OF FASTING APPLIED TO HEALTH 

Every principle and ordinance of the Gospel may be attacked from 
one angle or another as a mere "ism," but it may also be considered as 
possessing elements of soul growth, beauty and sublimity. 

Consider for a moment this principle of fasting. It is as old as the 
human race and undoubtedly when first practiced was related to health. 
It is generally conceded that most people usually consume more food 
than the body requires. Overeating clogs the system with deleterious 
waste products. < (When such a condition exists a short fast is 
useful as a means of restoring the body to its normal active state. One 
authority referring to this says, "The great thing about the fast is that 
it sets you a new standard of health." And an eminent Scotch physician 
adds, "Fasting for a longer or a shorter period is often a beneficial prac- 
tice especially in the case of those who have been living too freely." 

TO SELF-CONTROL 

But besides this there is the spiritual strength derived from the 
subjecting of the physical appetite to the will of the individual. "He 
who reigns within himself and rules passions, desires and fears is more 
than king." As in eternal life, so in self-mastery, there is no one great 
thing which a man may do to obtain it ; but there are many little things 
by observing which self-control may be achieved. And a subjecting of 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 65 

the appetite to the will and a refusal to satisfy desire are two of these 
little things. Writing on this very question, the subjection of appetites 
and desires to the will, the psychologist William James admonishes "To 
do each day something which you do not like to do." If there were no 
other virtue in fasting but gaining strength of character, that alone 
would be sufficient justification for its universal acceptance. 

AS AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT 

But associated with this practice in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is the giving of a fast offering, the underlying pur- 
pose and far-reaching benefits of which make the monthly observance 
of fast day one of the most significant features of this latter-day work. 
Besides the benefits already mentioned there are : First, all the spiritual 
uplift that comes from a Christ-like desire to serve one's fellowmen; 
and Second, an economic means which when carried out by a perfect 
and active organization will supply the needs of every worthy poor per- 
son within the confines of the organized branches of the Church. 

The regularly constituted fast consists of abstinence from eating 
two meals once each month. The value of these two meals is given as 
a voluntary donation for the relief of those who are hungry or other- 
wise in distress. Sincere observance of this rule means spiritually that 
the divine principle of service is expressed and the resultant promise of 
the Master is merited, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of 
these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

Let us apply this principle to some local condition. Recently there 
was carried on in Salt Lake City, as in other progressive cities, a cam- 
paign to raise $155,000 to be used for charitable purposes. Suppose that 
at the beginning of 1931 everybody in this city had observed the fast for 
the special purpose of aiding the needy through the Community Chest. 
There are 140,000 people in Salt Lake City. That would be 280,000 
meals a month. At an average cost of 10c a meal, $28,000 a month or 
$336,000 a year would be made available 'for the relief of the poor, or 
more than twice as much as was collected for this worthy purpose dur- 
ing this year. 

THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT 

So you may take any phase of this Church and prove its potency in 
its particular field in the advancement of the individual, in the happiness 
and peace of the home, in the progress, safety, and perpetuity of so- 
ciety. 

God help us to contribute our might and influence to the perpetua- 
tion of the Church of Jesus Christ, of which we can truly say : "Perse- 
cution has not crushed it ; power has not beaten it back ; time has not 
abated its force; and what is most wonderful of all, the abuses and 
treason of its friends have not shaken its stability." May neither pros- 
perity nor popularity hinder its progress any more than these other 
forces, and may teachers and parents unite in impressing youth particu- 
larly to be loyal to that which we know is good for humanity and con- 
tributive to eternal salvation, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The congregation joined in singing the hymn, "O ye mountains 
high." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Elmer F. Taylor, Presi- 
dent of the Young Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference commenced at 2 o'clock, 
Saturday afternoon, April 9th. 

President Heber J. Grant, who presided, announced that the Relief 
Society Ladies' Chorus, under the direction of Sister Lottie Sackett, 
would sing "Recessional," as the opening number. 

After the singing of this selection by the Chorus, the opening 
prayer was offered by Elder Harry L. Payne, President of the St. Joseph 
Stake. 

The Relief Society Ladies' Chorus sang the anthem, "Within this 
sacred dwelling," solo part iby Brother Cornelius G. Van Os. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

There is one thing that has always been evident to me, since I have 
made a study of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that is this, 
that there has been a constant, progressive divine purpose in all of the 
dealings of God with man, and the history of the world is replete with 
evidence of this fact; that divine purpose is manifest in the coming of 
all the servants of God, the prophets, the apostles, and in the revelations 
that have been given in every dispensation of his providence. 

That divine purpose has been stated in the writings of the prophet 
Moses when he said : "This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass 
the immortality and eternal life of man." That purpose was promul- 
gated before the foundations of this earth were laid. It was considered 
beforehand, and we are now in the process of the development of that 
purpose. It is now approaching its great climax, the accomplishment of 
God's purposes with his children that have dwelt upon the earth. 

It is true that we have only glimpses of these things that took place 
before the foundations of this earth were laid, but, oh, what light and 
understanding are contained in those few glimpses that have been given 
to us. We read in the scriptures : 

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

"And the earth was without form, and void ; and darkness was upon the face 
of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 

"And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. 

"And God saw the light, that it was good : and God divided the light from 
the darkness. 

"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the 
evening and the morning were the first day." 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 67 

In holy writ reference is made to a council held in heaven before 
the foundations of the earth were laid. The Lord said to his servant 
Job: 

"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou 
hast understanding. * * * 

"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for 
joy?" 

These words are very significant. They tell of a time when the 
sons of God were assembled together and shouted for joy. That par- 
ticular phrase does not state exactly what it was they shouted for, but 
in modern revelation that is made clear. It was the promulgation of 
that divine purpose that God had in relation to his children, and the 
very plan by which that purpose might be accomplished. 

I am going to read again from the scriptures : 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word 
was God. 

"The same was in the beginning with God. 

"All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made 
that was made. 

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men. * * * 

"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the 
world." 

From these passages of scripture we must concede that Jesus Christ 
is the light of the world and the power thereof by which it was made. 
The whole plan then centers in that Son of God that was chosen in that 
primeval day to carry out the divine purpose. He was sent into the 
world, 

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who- 
soever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 
"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." 

This revelation of the Son of God, who was with the Father in the 
beginning, and by whom all things were made, came and dwelt among 
us in a mortal body of flesh and bones. That was a vital part of the 
divine plan. 

The coming of the children of God to this earth was fundamental, 
for it was to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life that this 
world was created, that God sent his Only begotten Son. From the 
very beginning we see the purpose in the course of its development. 
This Son of God was born of the virgin Mary. An angel of the Lord 
appeared unto her and told her that she was greatly favored among 
women ; that she had found favor with the Lord ; that she would con- 
ceive and give birth to a son, and should call his name Jesus, and he 
should be called the Son of God. Said Mary unto this angel, "How 
shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?" And the angel replied, 
"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest 
shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be 
born of thee shall be called the Son of God." 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thus is recorded the coming of that Son of God in mortal body to 
dwell among us, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh. None other 
was born of God in the flesh, and yet we were all the children of God, 
but not born of him in the flesh. Let me read again from the scriptures. 

"He came unto his own, and his own received him not." 

No, they crucified him. 

"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of 
God, even to them that believe on his name : 

"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will 
of man, but of God." 

Here we have it plainly stated that they were not born and begotten 
of God in the flesh, not by the will of man, but of God, clearly pointing 
to the fact that we were the children of God born of him in the spirit 
before the foundations of this earth were laid. But he gave unto even 
them that believed on him the power to become the sons of God, even as 
Jesus Christ is the Son of God, of the flesh and of the spirit. For it 
was to them who are thus born of the spirit that he gave the power to 
become the sons of God. What was that power? That power was the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, for it is in the divine purpose that all 
the children of God shall be begotten sons and daughters unto him in 
body and in spirit, these two component parts of our eternal souls, be- 
fore they can be received into his celestial dwelling place, before they 
can become members of his household and the divine purpose be accom- 
plished. 

But, although we were born of God in the spirit before the founda- 
tion of this earth was laid, when the sons and daughters of God sang 
together and shouted for joy upon the promulgation of the divine 
purpose, it still remained necessary in order to be in very deed his sons 
and daughters, that we should be born in these mortal bodies of the blood 
and of the flesh, which were not begotten of him but of our natural 
parents. Therefore, when Nicodemus asked the Lord : "How can a man 
be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's 
womb, and be born?" he made it plain by answering: "Verily, verily, I 
say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he can- 
not enter into the kingdom of God." 

Thus it will be seen that the second birth is necessary, which sym- 
bolizes the first one — born of the water, quickened by the spirit, and 
through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, we are made the sons and 
daughters of God throughout the endless ages of eternity. Thus is 
brought to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, and the Gos- 
pel becomes the power of God unto salvation. Such is the divine pur- 
pose. 

The children of Abraham have been called "God's chosen people." 
That too was in the divine purpose, and people ofttimes ask the ques- 
tion, how is it that God shows such preference to any particular family? 
Why is it that we who also claim to be the children of Abraham should 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 69 

be preferred before others when it is clearly stated in holy writ that God 
is no respecter of persons ? 

Neither is he a respecter of persons, but this process of choosing the 
great and the good in order to carry out the divine purpose was predi- 
cated on their faithfulness and did not begin here, but before we came 
to the earth ; and these were chosen for their integrity and because they 
were valiant for the truth in order to carry out his divine purpose. So 
it appears that even in that primeval day before the foundation of the 
earth was laid, God chose the great and noble ones from among his 
children and elected that they should come through the lineage of Abra- 
ham, because he knew Abraham before he was born and that he loved 
the Lord and would teach his children after him ; and also in order to 
maintain their solidarity as a nation or as his chosen people. 

Let me read from the Book of Abraham : 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were 
organized before the world was ; and among all these there were many of the 
noble and great ones; 

"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of 
them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that 
were spirits, and he saw that they were good ; and he said unto me : Abraham, 
thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born." 

Thus Abraham was chosen to become the father of the faithful, 
arid he received the promise that in him and his seed should all the na- 
tions of the earth be blessed. This was truly a natural selection, or, if 
you please, a survival of the fittest. In this respect, at least, it seems 
to be in accord with modern scientific thought. 

This does not mean that all the children of Abraham will be chosen ; 
neither does it mean jthat none other will be chosen. The children of 
God are again on trial in this their second estate, and the natural se- 
lection is still in progress. There will be many of Abraham's seed cast 
out on account of their evil deeds and many who are not of that lineage, 
on account of their integrity and obedience to God's plan, will be grafted 
into the olive tree and become likewise sons and daughters of God and 
members of his household. 

But before we shall become the sons and daughters of God in body 
and in spirit we shall have rendered obedience to his glorious Gospel 
which is indeed the power of God unto salvation. This reconciles the 
coming and development of the house of Israel, the children of Abra- 
ham, as God's chosen people. It also explains the motive for the scat- 
tering of that seed that all nations might thereby be blessed, for it was 
through that seed that the knowledge of the only true and living God 
was perpetuated in this world. It was through that seed that God has 
communicated to mankind ; through them he has sent his apostles and 
prophets and they have been endowed with power from on high. They 
have been the messengers of God to teach the people the way of life. 
God's chosen people, then, are the children of Abraham through Isaac 
the son of promise and Jacob to whom the Lord gave the name of 
Israel ; with them he established his covenant. Jacob became the father 
of twelve sons who became the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

We live in a day when the children of Israel are again to be gath- 
ered after their long dispersion. We have heard something of the re- 
turn of the Jews, the tribe of Judah, to the land of their inheritance, 
even Palestine; but we are not of that tribe but of the tribe of Joseph, 
"that bright and glorious morning star," and particularly through - 
Ephraim, his son, and are now being gathered on this the land of Joseph, 
given to him and his seed as an everlasting inheritance — a land choice 
above all other lands, the land of liberty, even the land of America. We 
are of that lineage and are now being gathered, having given heed to the 
call of the Gospel, hearing the voice of the true shepherd, even as we did 
in our former estate when we were counted among the great and noble 
ones ; but now as then, many are called but few are chosen. The nat- 
ural selection still goes on. 

And now comes the great responsibility that rests upon that chosen 
few. The Savior said, "In my Father's house there are many mansions 
* * * I go to prepare a place for you * * * that where I am, there ye 
may be also." When the Lord makes up his jewels which shall con- 
stitute the membership of his household you may be sure it will not be 
limited to those who happen to live upon the earth during a Gospel 
dispensation. Nevertheless the same requirements will be made of all 
before they can become members of his household, his sons and 
daughters both in body and in spirit. This must be accomplished through 
obedience to his Gospel and by being born of the water and of the 
Spirit. Those who have died without a knowledge of the Gospel may, 
if they are honest in heart, be converted and brought to repentance 
when the Gospel is preached to them in the spirit world, but even as the 
question arose in the mind of Nicodemus with reference to the living, 
"How can a man be born when he is old," the question now might nat-. 
urally arise : how can a man be born when he is dead ? Provision is 
likewise made for this in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence 
baptism and other ordinances for and in behalf of our dead kindred by 
their living representatives ; "For," as we read in the scriptures, "for 
this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they 
might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God 
in the spirit." Therefore before that final judgment shall overtake the 
world, that dreadful day of the Lord, he has sent Elijah the prophet as 
predicted by Malachi, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children 
and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest he, the Lord, should 
smite the earth with a curse. 

It would indeed be a calamity if we should fail to do the part as- 
signed to us in the accomplishment of the divine purpose as children of 
Abraham and descendants of Joseph and Ephraim, namely, performing 
the work for and in behalf of our ancestors who died without a knowl- 
edge of the Gospel, the work which they are no longer able to do for 
themselves, namely, baptisms and other ordinances in order that they 
too may become the sons and daughters of God, both in spirit and in 
body ; all this, of course, being conditioned on their acceptance and obe- 
dience on the other side. Here again it is seen that God is no respecter 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 71 

of persons but every child of God shall hear the glad tidings and those 
who believe on Jesus Christ shall be given power to become sons and 
daughters unto God, even as many as shall believe on him from father 
Adam until the latest generation of his posterity. May we be num- 
bered among that grand assembly I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

The congregation arose and sang the hymn, "O say, what is truth?" 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am very pleased, my brethren and sisters, to stand before you this 
afternoon and represent the Mexican mission, as well as the Council of 
the Seventies. You understand, of course, that in the last six months, 
since I first stood before this congregation, my entire time has been spent 
in the Mexican mission. Because of that I shall take the liberty of 
telling you just a little of what we have done in that mission and what 
we would like to do, and then I shall take my seat. 

Judged from one point of view we may say that the Mexican mis- 
sion is in good shape. From another point of view we must say that it 
is not in good shape. Our Mexican people depend entirely upon the 
service that they can render others for their food and clothing, and at 
times like this, when industry is at a standstill, they are usually the first 
ones to go out of employment. Because of that fact there is consid- 
erable suffering among the members of the Church of that race, and 
because of that fact also thousands and thousands of the people with 
whom we were wont to make contact in our missionary labors have 
found it expedient to return to Mexico. 

I think close to a hundred thousand Mexicans, perhaps, from the 
United States, have been repatriated, as they say, within the last year. 
I passed one afternoon between Laredo and San Antonio nore than 
twenty vehicles of various sorts and sizes, laden with Mexicans who 
were homeward-bound, all, almost without exception, poverty-stricken 
and forced to retreat because of the lack of employment. That has 
taken out of our territory just that many prospective candidates, just 
that many people with whom we would like to make contact, with whom 
we would like to leave Books of Mormon and tracts explaining the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. They are gone now from our territory, leaving, 
however, a great many people. 

Our headquarters are in Los Angeles, and it may surprise you, just 
as it did me, to learn that the city of Los Angeles is reputed to be the 
second largest Mexican city in the world. It is, or was just recently, 
second only to the city of Mexico in number of Mexican inhabitants. 
It is quite natural then that we should retain for the time-being at least, 
under existing laws of Mexico, our headquarters in Los Angeles. 

The Mexican people whom we have been able to baptize, most of 
them are a faithful and good people. Those of you who know Mexi- 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

cans know that they come to us, almost without exception, addicted to 
the use of tea, coffee, tobacco and liquor. Many of them are converted, 
really, who do not ask for baptism, because they feel as yet too weak 
to give up those vices ; but almost without exception when they come in- 
to the Church they do leave off those habits, and they are to be con- 
gratulated for that fact. They come to our conferences in great num- 
bers, and we never see them using tobacco. We see none of them, 
while they are with us at least, under the influence of liquor, and we 
are told that they leave off the use of tea and coffee. I think that you 
will all agree with me that any people of their habits, their past, and 
their history, who can do that, are a worthy people. 

Our missionaries are enjoying health and strength at the present 
time. We have had one case of very serious sickness in the last six 
months. Very fortunately that young man is now well and strong, 
carrying on his missionary labors again. The Elders, however, many 
of them are struggling, just as the Elders of other mission fields, with 
a lack of funds. Some of them have had to leave their missions even 
before completing a full year of service, because of that lack. The boys 
who have come to us from Mexico, especially, of whom we had a few, 
have had extreme difficulty, because their parents had no market for 
their crops and their money had to be divided by three when it was 
sent into the United States. Some of them have remained in the field 
with utmost difficulty but with great loyalty. They have done excellent 
service for us, and we thank them for it. Others of them have had to 
return home for the same reason — their parents were unable longer to 
find the funds to keep them there. 

We don't need a great deal of money in our mission to get by, but 
some money is necessary. We were pleased beyond expression, just a 
short time ago, to receive a communication which has been referred to 
here already, from a certain stake presidency in the Church, to the ef- 
fect that before any missionary from their stake should be released we 
were to confer with them, because it was their desire that every mis- 
sionary they had in the field should complete his full and customary 
term of service. It made me weep almost to think that I didn't have a 
single missionary from that stake, because I would like to have availed 
myself of that good offer. 

The most outstanding thing that has happened to the mission, 
from a missionary standpoint, in the last six months, was the visit of 
Elder Melvin J. Ballard with me and my wife throughout the mission. 
We held a series of conferences which began at San Diego and term- 
inated at Albuquerque, New Mexico. We covered the entire distance 
from San Diego and Los Angeles, to San Antonio, Texas, almost on 
the Gulf of Mexico. 

When I visit my Elders I travel two thousand miles before I find 
the Elders in Brownsville and Corpus Christi. You see, it is a long, 
extenuated district, and there are only thirty-four men and women to 
serve that territory now. We need more help; we will accept it gra- 
ciously; but we are going to strive with all our power and all our zeal 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 73 

to carry forward with what men and women we can get, and be thank- 
ful for them at this time. 

The trip of which I spoke carried us to the City of Mexico. The 
last time I was in the City of Mexico I was there as a student, and I 
left there, as I remember, in the year 1905. It was my pleasure, on this 
trip, to meet some of the old Saints who were there at that time, still 
faithful and energetic in the performance of their duties. Some of them 
wept when they realized that they were looking upon the son of my 
father, who baptized them there in about 1881, and who are still faithful ; 
and though not strong physically, they are strong in the faith. 

We were really astounded and surprised at the success those people 
down there are having in carrying on their organizations without our 
help. Many of you perhaps know that before a man can function as a 
priest or minister in Mexico, under the present law, he must qualify as a 
native-born Mexican citizen, and we have few of such among our race. 
There are a few young men now in Mexico who bid fair to be pros- 
pects for that service, should they declare themselves ; they are eligible 
to citizenship by birth ; but as yet we have none of them functioning. 

I think, however, it may be considered as an advantage to those 
people that the law was passed and the missionaries were taken out of 
Mexico, for the responsibility fell directly upon the shoulders of the 
native brethren and sisters, and they have carried it on well and faith- 
fully. We dropped in on them as a surprise Sunday morning. We 
found the Sunday School in session, which was conducted very much 
like ours here at home, the same subjects being treated, and the classes 
divided, so far as their numbers would permit, in the same way. We 
attended a meeting as visitors only, for we were not allowed to do it in 
the capacity of our calling. We listened to eight or ten of them bear 
their testimonies and talk, and it was an excellent service. After its 
dismissal we were allowed to visit with them, to discuss some of their 
problems and advise them. 

I can't say too much in commendation of the way those brethren, 
who have come right out of the jacales, as they are called there, the 
poorer houses of the peasants, are carrying on this work. They are 
faithful ; they are true ; they are intelligent. They represent the Indian 
blood of Mexico almost in purity. You will remember that all of the 
outstanding leaders of Mexico, almost without exception, owe their 
prominence and preeminence, I think, to their Indian blood. The great- 
est of all their statesmen, perhaps. Benito Juarez, (was a pure-bred 
Indian. Porfiro Diaz had a large infusion of Indian blood. Their pres- 
ent president has also. He is almost pure Indian, I am told. 

We are very expectant that great things some day may be realized 
from these Indian people. They are very typical. They are very much 
alike, and they are very, very interesting. 

We had also the privilege of visiting the ruins of Mexico at San 
Juan, Teotihuacan, and the pyramid which is called the Snake pyramid. 
They are full of possibilities, from an archaeological standpoint. How- 
ever, in using them to substantiate the Book of Mormon we have to be 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

extremely careful, because while they apparently give evidence of cer- 
tain things, archaeologists are not all agreed as to their value. They 
are, however, extremely interesting. 

Not the least interesting thing to me on that trip to Mexico was 
my visit to the American Embassy. It is the first time in all my expe- 
rience that I have ever been in the United States in Mexico. That really 
is the case, because by fiction of the law the American Embassy is con- 
sidered American territory. We found the embassy occupied by one 
of our own people, a man whose faith is unquestioned, and whose 
friendship we found to be pure and unalloyed. We enjoyed for three 
days the hospitality of Brother and Sister J. Reuben Clark, and I want 
to tell you that I learned to love them while I was there, for they are 
indeed Latter-day Saints right through to the core. The work Am- 
bassador Clark is doing in Mexico is a wonderful work and a wonder- 
ful advertisement for our people. They know who he is. They know 
what people he represents. They honor and respect him for his stand. 

I don't know that I should take more time this afternoon. I have 
extremely enjoyed the remarks of my predecessors. I wish to bear out, 
by testimony, the things that they have spoken. I support and sustain 
and uphold the President of this Church and those who are in authority 
under him. It has been my privilege to know him and his first coun- 
selor, at least, all my life, and I can bear testimony that I have never 
received, in all those years, which are past fifty now, a single word of 
counsel that t could not pass on in public to this congregation. I know 
their motives are pure and unsullied, regardless of all the things that 
may be said. I bear you this testimony and I stand here to uphold it, 
and I do it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Temple Block 

Mission 

I realize the responsibility this afternoon, for I not only represent 
the First Council of Seventy but the great mission here at the Temple 
Square as well. Presiding over this mission as I do, having been called 
by the First Presidency, I am glad to say something about the mission 
and also to bear my testimony of the truth of this Gospel of our Lord 
and Savior. Connected as I am with the University of Utah, I come 
in contact with hundreds of the boys and girls of this State and other 
States, and I feel that I appreciate something of the struggles they 
are making. 

Here at the Temple Square thousands of people come to us yearly. 
They come here as travelers, as tourists ; and the Bureau of Information 
which has been erected for them is the place where they obtain literature 
and information concerning the doctrines of the Church. A different 
type of people come to us now as compared with those who came a 
few years ago. People came with criticism in their hearts and a great 
deal of hate of what we believe. But today it is seldom that people 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 75 

do not appreciate something of the beauty of the grounds, the greatness 
of the buildings, and above all, the message which we missionaries give 
to them. There are fifteen missionaries connected with this mission 
and they are a choice lot of brethren and sisters and are doing a wonder- 
ful work here. .We try to approach all people with the attitude of mind 
as expressed by the old prophet Malachi when he said: "Are we not 
all children of the same God? Is not God the Father of us all?" 

Every day letters come to us expressing gratitude for the message 
that people have received, and I have in my pocket now a letter that I 
received only this morning from Dr. Teeling of London, a graduate 
of Oxford University and a representative of one of the departments 
of government in London. Dr. Teeling was our guest here for a few 
days and made a careful investigation of the history and the doctrines 
of the Church. He wrote us a very lovely letter thanking us for what 
he had obtained here and asking us to visit him in London. So we 
receive such letters every day. People are appreciative and we appre- 
ciate them. 

Not long ago some prominent students from one of the great 
universities of America came through. These students were on their 
way to Southern Utah to study the geological formation of the canyons. 
They came here and spent the day and I had the pleasure of taking 
them through the grounds and buildings, and as they went back through 
our little museum — which by the way one of the attendants of the 
British Museum says is one of the smallest museums in the United 
States, but 'for quality one of the finest — they read those lovely mottoes 
we have in the museum. There are fourteen. I want to read them 
to you because they were carefully chosen : 

"God created man in His own image, in the image of God created 
He him." — Genesis. 

"God ever works with those who work with him," is a saying of 
Aristotle. 

"Reverence for God is the basis of immortality." — The Talmud. 

"Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom."'— Doctrine and 
Covenants. 

"With malice towards none, |with charity for all." — Abraham 
Lincoln. 

"Yea, truth and justice then will down return to men." — Milton. 

"My strength is of the strength of ten because my heart is pure." 
— Tennyson. 

"What a piece of work is man ; in apprehension how like a god." 
— Shakespeare (Hamlet). 

"The grace of God is all powerful." — Stevenson. 

"The glory of God is intelligence. "t — Doctrine and Covenants. 

"Reverence is the chief joy and power of life."- — Ruskin. 

"Faith is happiness, illumination and strength." — Balzac. 

"A gentleman is a man of truth; lord of his own actions." — 
Emerson. 

"What is true and just and honest, all of virtue shall endure." — 
Browning. 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

These students read these inscriptions, and letters came back from 
the university that they represented, asking that we send copies of them. 
In our conversation with one of the students, this remark was made, 
that "a people who profess a firm faith and belief in Jesus Christ and 
could accept the truths of the great philosophers of the world are 
certainly on the road to a greater faith and religion than any other people 
he has ever known. Said he : "There is a rare combination among you 
in your lives of heart and intelligence." 

So we feel that we are getting some results at this mission. The 
high and low, the rich and poor come to us, but with us there are no 
high, low, rich or poor. All people are children of God and they come 
here and take away with them something of the spirit of the Mission, 
something of the spirit of Christ, the spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Now in speaking and thinking of the youth, we have great faith 
in the youth of the land, and faith in the youth of this State. Personally, 
the boys and girls in our State university and all other institutions of 
the State and elsewhere are to me fine types of character. Naturally 
they need directing and at times they do hear things that shake their 
faith in God to the very foundation. They hear expressions they cannot 
understand. They sometimes come with all the honesty of heart and 
ask what to do under certain circumstances. I have them almost daily 
in my office. But those girls and boys are precious souls, they are 
lovely characters naturally, and if they can only be touched with 
divine truth they will be honest, they will be truthful; if we can only 
get them to realize above all things that while it is good to know the 
truth, it is far greater to be a man or woman of the truth. So I feel 
encouraged when I meet them. Jesus Christ came into the world as 
described in the second chapter of Sf. Luke, he died for you and me, 
and the night before he went to his crucifixion he announced to his 
disciples and to all the world that he is the way, the truth, and the 
light. "I am the way, and the truth, and the light," said Jesus, and 
through him we come to the .final understanding of life, a joyful 
understanding, and as a result of it a happiness that we are all seeking. 
This is life, and life eternal to live the Gospel because of an understand- 
ing of Jesus Christ <and him crucified. It' was an old prophet, Zachar- 
iah, who said: "I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O 
Greece." That conflict between Greece and Zion began far back in 
the centuries and it is going on today. We mean by that the conflict 
between the people who have faith — God-given faith in Almighty God 1 — 
and the people who without the faith are seeking truth by science and 
philosophy. What the youth need today is to be stirred to a knowledge 
of God ; to understand that the sublimest thing of all life is the simple 
faith in God the Father, in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost 
— the greatest truth for you and me and yet the simplest. This is 
fundamental, and if the youth can only get to see that after all, civiliza- 
tion has always been based on religion and always will be, and that the 
religion of God comes from one great fundamental source, namely, 
revelation — (God is understood throjugh knowledge, God is (known 
through revelation ; and those two great principles, if they are known 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 77 

and can be seen and understood, the faith of the youth then will grow 
and they will always know that after all, morality, the richness of life, 
the sublimity of all things, lie in the simple Gospel of Christ. It is 
beautiful this Gospel, for truth is beauty, and beauty is truth. 

Now if we can come to know the youth, this buoyant youth, we 
will be better able to teach them, and their faults and failings will be 
eradicated one by one. They will stand supreme before God as his 
children, and be masters of selves and servants of each other. "I am 
the way, the life, and the truth," spoke Jesus. When we come to 
realize this greath truth, we will open our hearts more and more to the 
lesson that life has a meaning, and a meaning for good ; that the moral 
world is governed by the purpose and a purpose of love; we will bend 
to God's will, and everything we experience will speak to us of a 
Father's heart. Let us look forward with hope and confidence and 
place our lives in the hands of God. My brethren and sisters: 

"We know the arduous life, the eternal laws 
To which the triumph of all good is given; 
High sacrifice, and labour without pause 
- Even to the death." 

May the Lord bless us all, I ask in Jesus name. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am very anxious as well as desirous that I be under the influ- 
ence of the right spirit, the Spirit of the Lord. I have no ambition, no 
desire but to serve the Lord and to keep his commandments and to ful- 
fil and complete my labors. 

I have been very much impressed with one thought, and I have had 
quite a number, and that is: the number of speakers that have spoken 
during this Conference. If they have not reached pretty much all the 
people then they have not fulfilled what I believe. I believe that in this 
Church and among the children of men there are people — there may not 
be very many — who understand me. Perhaps I may be the only one 
among you who can reach my kind of people. Well, if that is true, why 
not let me be natural and talk to them? You who do not like my talk 
can go to sleep if you want to. As long as I can reach a soul when 
under the influence of the Holy Spirit and plant a seed of truth in his 
heart, it seems to me, with all the experience I have had, it would be a 
wonderful thing. 

I remember that not many Conferences ago I was called to the 
stand just hefore the Conference adjourned. President Grant told me 
I had seven minutes — I took three — and I think it is the only time that 
President Grant ever shook hands with me after one of my talks. 
(Laughter) President Grant did not shake hands with me because of 
what I said ; it was because I left him four minutes, and that is more 
than any of the other brethren had ever done. 

I have had another idea quite a while, and I think I will express it. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

You see that great big clock over there. I cannot see the hands, my eyes 
are not as good as they used to be. Well, with that great big clock 
before me and this microphone in front of me then tell a man to get the 
Holy Spirit! j( Laughter) 

Now, what I am trying to get at is this : it takes intelligent people 
to understand what I am trying to get at. I do not do your thinking 
for you, you have to do your own thinking. If I give you a little chaff 
to get you to take a little wheat, my trouble has always been you choose 
the chaff and lose the wheat. 

I remember a long time ago when the Mutuals launched the Era. 
I was on a trip with Apostle Francis M. Lyman — we started in at Sevier 
and went to Panguitch and the surrounding settlements and to Kanab 
and St. George ; and when we got to St. George, Brother David H. Can- 
non, the President of the Stake, and Brother Edward Snow, superin- 
tendent of the Mutuals, with their buggies transferred us to Panacea. 
The people had not seen an Apostle for twenty years, and it was Sun- 
day, a fast day. Meetings were begun in the morning and they kept 
them up all day, and we were fasting. I was pretty nearly dead at four 
o'clock. After four o'clock Brother Lyman said, "Now, Brother Kim- 
ball, get up and tell them about the Era." He had done a good deal 
of talking himself about the Era. During that trip I think we got four 
hundred subscribers— $800.00. I wrote out all receipts. It was in 
September. Brother Lyman at this meeting told me to get up, so I 
did, and I said : "All you men that will take the Era if we will let you 
go home, raise your right hand." There was not a single man who did 
not raise his hand and subscribed and paid $2.00 cash for the Era. 
(Laughter) Brother Lyman said: "That is the brightest thing you 
ever did." I do not claim that was inspiration ; it was good psychology. 
Really they paid $2.00 to get out. 

I am trying to say this to you because we never know, if we listen 
to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, just what it will do for us. 

I am going to tell you a story that I have never told before. When 
I was president of the Southern States mission, after a year's time I 
concluded that I would try to hold a conference in a city. Up to that 
time we had always kept out of cities. So I made my arrangements 
with the president of the conference to hold such a meeting and to se- 
cure some place where we could hold it. We had no money. The only 
place they could secure was the court house. I told the Elders : "I will 
do the preaching, and if they kill me you need not bother any further." 
The people were very prejudiced. When the time came I met these 
Elders, a fine body of men, wonderful, courageous men, men of faith— 
they had to be in the South. We went to the court house — all those 
present were men ; there wasn't a woman among them, and we all knew 
what that meant. When there are no women there is a great deal of 
danger. It is dangerous enough when they are present. At any rate 
I made up my mind to deliver my message as fervently and humbly as 
ever a president of a mission preached. I intended to do all the talk- 
ing. I went there determined to preach the Gospel. I had my Bible, 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 79 

and I am well acquainted with my Bible. I cannot find anything in any- 
body else's Bible. I have owned this Bible for forty years and it is well 
marked and every subject traced in my own penmanship. I would not 
take money for this Bible. I went there believing that the Spirit of 
God was on me.as the president of the mission. I was humble as a child. 
It was the only time in my life that I have ever been far enough away 
that I could do as I pleased. Ever since that time I have been close in. 
! I got up to preach the Gospel, faith and repentance, etc. All at 
once something came over me and I opened my mouth and said to that 
body of men: (The building was crowded; among them were some of 
the leading men) "Gentlemen, you have not come here to listen to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. I know what you have come for. You have 
come to find out about the Mountain Meadows Massacre and polygamy, 
and God being my helper I will tell you the truth." And I did. I 
talked to them for one hour. When the meeting was out you could 
hear a pin drop. There was no comment ; there was no noise or con- 
fusion, and we went to the hotel. We had arranged for lodgings at a 
cheap hotel. After a short time a brass band played. Elder Willard 
Bean was the president of the conference. I sent him out to find what 
it all meant. I thought it meant trouble. So he inquired and they told 
him : "We are serenading that big long fellow." That is the only brass 
band I have ever had dispense music after one of my talks. What I 
want to ask you good people is this : Was I moved upon by the right 
spirit ? The next day when we went to the woods to hold our priesthood 
meeting, which we always held in the woods — we had no other place — I 
said to those Elders : "Don't one of you dare preach that sermon ; it 
will cost you your life." And I have never preached it since. 

What I am beating around in the brush to put over is this : Does 
the Lord God direct his servants? He certainly does. If he doesn't 
we are a failure and we are no better than others. We do not know 
just what to say. I don't. I don't know just how to say it, but the Lord 
being my helper as long as I live I am going to try to be natural and 
I am going to try to have my mind open with the hope that God will 
give me his Holy Spirit when I open my mouth and use the talent which 
the Lord has given me. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I know what that feeling is. I have 
not had it very often, but I know that there is such a thing as "the still 
small voice." I have heard it. 

My time is up. But if you people do not believe that I sustain the 
Authorities of this Church and uphold God's work, I do. I don't know 
how I could prove it to you any better than I have in my own way. 
God bless you. Amen. 

An anthem, "Holy Redeemer," was sung by the Relief Society 
Chorus. 

Elder Samuel F. Smith, President of the Snowflake Stake pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, April 10. 



THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Sunday morning, April 10th, at 10 o'clock 
President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

All the seats and every available space in the large auditorium and 
galleries were occupied long before the time arrived to commence the 
meeting. Thousands of people who could not find accommodation in 
the Tabernacle congregated in the Assembly Hall directly south of the 
Tabernacle and on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened to the 
services as they were broadcast by radio. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session, and 
joined with the congregation in 'singing the opening hymn, "Praise to 
the man who communed with Jehovah." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Arthur W. Horsley, 
President of the Carbon Stake. 

The Choir sang the anthem, "Grant us peace, O Lord." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

"And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old. These were 
the years of the life of Sarah. 

"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron, in the land of 
Canaan ; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 

"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons 
of Heth, saying, 

"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a 
burying place with you, that I (may bury my dead. * * * 

"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even 
to the children of Heth, * * * 

"Saying, * * * hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar, 

"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in 
the end of his field. * .* * 

"I will give ;thee money for the field ; take it of me, and I will bury my 
dead there. 

"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 

"My lord, hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of 
silver ; what is that betwixt (me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead. * * *' 

"* * * and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named * * * 
current money with the merchant. * * * 

"And * * * Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of 
Machpelah, before Mamre." (Genesis Chapter 23) . 

Sarah died iB. C. 1872, j3,800 years ago. Fifteen years after the 
death of his wife, Abraham was carried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael 
and buried by her side, in the cave of Machpelah. Later the remains 
of Isaac and Rebecca were interred there ; and after the death of Jacob, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 81 

the grandson of Abraham, who passed away in Egypt, his body was 
embalmed and carried by his son Joseph up to Hebron, in the land of 
Canaan, and interred in the same spot that contained the remains of his 
father and grandparents. 

[FIRST REFERENCE TO USE OF MONEY 

I have quoted this scripture, not alone because of the fact that it 
refers to Abraham, the founder of the Israelitish race and our ancestor, 
but because it is the earliest date, so far as I am aware, at which 
money is referred (to as a medium of exchange and legal tender for 
debt among men. 

This is a General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, an occasion when the members of the Church assem- 
ble together to be taught' the way of the Lord, that they may walk in 
his paths. 

, TEMPORAL THINGS 

It is a time when the elders of the Church, who are selected to 
address the assembled congregation are expected to treat subjects 
which have to do with the spiritual things of the kingdom, rather than 
with temporalities. 

Notwithstanding this fact, and at the risk of being considered some- 
what out' of place, with your faith to assist me, I am prompted because 
of the occurrences of the past several weeks to confine my remarks to 
the temporal interests of my brethren and sisters of the Church, and 
the people of the state at large, because it is a subject that affects all of 
us, men and women, members of the Church, and those who are not 
affiliated with it. 

THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MAN'S OCCUPATIONS 

To trace the development of man from the beginning, and the 
origin of the various occupations and professions which he now follows 
in our intricate and complex life, would take us over a long and winding 
trail. i ' 

I suppose that in the primitive and far distant past, man first 
became a husbandman. His first indispensable necessity was food, for 
the sustenance of his body, and this he learned could (be provided by 
cultivation of the soil. He learned that as the seasons came and went 
there were periods of seed time and harvest; that in order to reap 
he must sow, and that his crop must be gathered and garnered to 
provide for future necessities. Thus he became a farmer. 

Food to sustain his body was not his only requirement, he must 
have clothing with which to cover it. This could be provided from the 
wool and hides of animals, and so he became a tender of flocks and 
herds, as well as a tiller of the soil. 

As time passed he discovered that he had other necessities. He 
was subject to sickness and accident; a limb might be '.broken, a skull 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

fractured, or because of improper diet his stomach might become de- 
ranged. 

In the beginning, with the assistance of his wife and neighbors, 
he attended to these human afflictions as best he could ; then it occurred 
to one of these neighbors that the application of simple remedies would 
bring relief to a disordered stomach, that by binding a broken limb with 
splints it would more quickly heal and become normal, that by re- 
moving the fragment's from a broken skull and taking the pressure 
from the brain, the patient was relieved. 

Men began to study the anatomy of the human body and provide 
means for its proper care. People were willing to pay for the service 
rendered, and thus the profession of medicine and surgery, which today 
does so much to prolong human life and relieve suffering, became one 
of the professions of man. 

PROFESSIONS ARISE 

As society developed laws became necessary for its government 
and protection. Men violated these laws and were punished under 
them. One day a man said to his neighbor, who had been adjudged 
guilty of an offense : You were not guilty of a violation of the law, 
the statute under which you were punished was not properly interpreted. 
If you are in trouble again come to me, and for a consideration I will 
defend and free you. 

Thus a new profession was added to the occupations of man, which 
has developed until men have become so profound in their knowledge 
and interpretations of modern law and its proper application, that 
the judge himself, when criminals are arraigned before him, can scarcely 
determine whether they are innocent or guilty. 

MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE CREATED 

In the beginning, trade was carried on by exchange of commodities, 
rather than by purchase and sale, with a recognized medium of exchange. 
In fact, in my time I have been in countries where this was almost the 
universal custom. 

As civilization developed it became apparent that ifor the conveni- 
ence of commerce and trade some medium of exchange, with a fixed 
and recognized ratio of value, must be created ; and at a very early date 
gold and .silver were used in the beginning counted by weight, as dust or 
in bars, as shown in the scripture which I have quoted, when Abraham 
weighed to Ephron, the son of Zohar, 400 shekels of silver, about 
$250.00, 3,800 years ago. - At a later date minted coins, of specific 
weight, came into use. 

BANKING SYSTEM DEVELOPED 

As people, by industry and economy accumulated more than was 
required for their personal necessities, and merchants began to pene- 
trate new countries with their caravans, and ships to sail the seas, 
it was common practice for those who had a surplus of money to 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVTNS 83 

lend it to those engaged in trade, in order that commerce might be 
carried on between different peoples and nations. 

The borrower was required to pay a reasonable interest on the 
money obtained, but excessive usury was strictly forbidden. 

It was from this simple beginning that our present system of 
banking has developed, until it has become the most important business 
occupation of the world. 

This may appear to be an extravagant statement, but it is never- 
theless true. 

The business of the banker brings him in closer contact' with every 
field of human endeavor than that of any other occupation. 

He is the custodian of the hard-earned money of the husbandman, 
the widow, the fatherless, the doctor, lawyer, merchant, manufacturer, 
and the man who has no occupation at all, of whom I sometimes think 
we have too many, for it was written long ago that the idler shall not 
eat the bread nor wear the apparel of the laborer. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BANKER 

As custodian of the savings of the depositor, the banker assumes 
the responsibility of investing the funds entrusted to him in a manner 
that will bring to the depositor a reasonable return in interest upon his 
savings, and at the same time compensate the banker for the responsi- 
bility he assumes as the agent of the depositor, 'which is very great'. 

Banking is a partnership between the stockholder, who provides 
the capital upon which the bank is founded and the reserves which 
guarantee the security of its deposits, and the depositors who, for their 
own protection, become obligated to support the bank in which their 
money is placed. 

The bank becomes a debtor to it's depositors, and at the same time 
the creditor of the world. It is through banks that all nations maintain 
their 'financial standing and tredit, one with the other. Through bank 
credits the railroads which thread the world and make possible the 
quick transportation of people and things from place to place, by which 
our surplus products are transported to profitable markets, and the 
products of other people which we require brought to us, are made 
possible. 

It is by means of bank credits that our ships sail the seas, that 
the forces which protect us 'from the invasion of foes from without 
and enemies within, are maintained. 

As stated, the occupation of the banker brings him in'closer contact 
with every field of human endeavor than that of any other occupation. 
Thus it will be seen that the success of the banker depends upon 
the stability of all other occupations and business activities, consequently 
it becomes his duty to strive for the stabilization of all. 

He must be constantly alert, constantly in touch with all of these 
various interests to which reference has been made, in order that he 
may know just when to extend credit, 'when to withhold it; having 
always in mind that his first' duty is to the people who have entrusted 
their money to his care; never forgetting that while it is his duty to 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

help those who need assistance, his business is not so toych one of 
sentiment as of duty. 

The greatest of all teachers said: "What mattereth it if a man 
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?" 

Permit me to paraphrase this scripture by saying: What mattereth 
it if a man do a large banking business and assist many needy individuals 
and enterprises, if in doing so he wreck his own credit, lose the money 
of his depositors and stockholders, and bring discredit to the officers of 
the bank and to the banking [business in general? 

MAN ONLY UNIT 

Whatever the occupation of man may be he acts only as a small 
unit, in a sphere which at first thought may appear to be independent, 
but jwhich, after all, is merely a cog pin the wheel of human progress 
and development, one of the many pillars which support the tremendous 
structure that our modern life has builded; and the progress and 
development of this intricate System requires that each of these pillars 
be kept in place, lest the structure fall of its own weight and thus 
bring disaster and chaos to all. 

We cannot say to the husbandman, we have no need of you. His 
occupation is still the one indispensable vocation of man. We cannot 
say to the manufacturer, we can dispense with your service. He takes 
the raw material which exists and converts it into the things which 
add to our comfort and convenience. The merchant is indispensable 
to our modern system of business. He provides for us the things which 
we need, brings them to us from afar to add to our happiness. The 
doctor and lawyer are indispensable to our modern life. 

The miner takes from the earth the treasure which lies hidden 
there, and brings into circulation new money which before was not 
available. His contribution to the commerce of the world cannot be 
overestimated. To all of these occupations the banker is a necessary, 
in fact indispensable, adjunct. 

HOW THE DEPRESSION MAY BE OVERCOME 

Every intelligent person who is familiar with current events, 
knows that a cloud of financial depression, the like of which has never 
before been known, hovers over the world, so dark and ominous that 
the sunshine of hope can scarcely penetrate it. 

Like the great World War, it has found its way into the most re- 
mote corners of the world. 

It can be met and overcome by the united effort of all of the 
people who are affected by it. A beneficent and willing government 
cannot accomplish the task without the loyal support of its citizens. 
The citizens cannot do it without the support of the government. 

Banks cannot do it without the cooperation of the depositors. 
Depositors cannot do it without the cooperation of the banks. United 
together the task can be accomplished. 

If the government, the states, the counties and municipalities will 
exercise rigid economy in the expenditure of public funds; if citizens 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 85 

will loyally support and patronize the industries and business of the 
nation, state and community in which they reside; if bankers will 
carefully and wisely protect the money of depositors ; if depositors will 
loyally cooperate with the banks to which the care of their money is 
entrusted ; if families and (individuals will live within their income and 
avoid debt, the clouds of adversity will roll away, and the sun of 
prosperity and peace will shine again upon a happy and prosperous 
people. 

CHAOS THREATENS 

If we are to continue the lavish, unnecessary expenditure of money, 
and dissipated habits, which have characterized the past ten years, in 
both public and private life, chaos awaits us. 

A ,f ew days ago a person asked me this question : "What of tomor- 
row?" 

I answered : "You may better ask me : What of yesterday ? I have 
had the experience of many yesterdays, while tomorrow is a sealed book 
to me." Then I remembered that I had seen as many tomorrows as 
anyone else. I Tomorrow is a sealed book to all of us, except as we are 
able to penetrate it by the eye of faith. And I discover, too, that while I 
have endeavored to profit by the experiences which the past teaches, 
and cheerfully perform the tasks which the present brings, I have lived 
largely in the future. 

Tomorrow has always been full of promise to me, and the future 
has beckoned me on with the assurance that as the days, and months, 
and years, come and go, they [will bring to me greater happiness, and 
added experience which I may apply to my own affairs and in service to 
others — acting today according to the light and wisdom which I possess 
and believing that each tomorrow has something better in store for me, 
and when this mortal life is ended and I stand upon the threshold of 
another world, I shall still be looking forward toward the better life to 
which I aspire. 

PRAYS FOR WISDOM 

I pray God our Heavenly Father that he will give wisdom to those 
who direct the affairs of our government, and particularly to you, my 
brethren and sisters, and those who preside over you in the Church, 
and to all others who desire and seek his blessings and serve him, 
that the clouds of adversity may iroll away, and the sunshine of pros- 
perity and peace bring happiness to the people of this troubled world. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RUDGE.R CLAWSON 

'President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I would that I had the gift of eloquence 
with which to give expression to the thoughts in my heart. But since 
I have no such gift I must be contented to speak as best I can, with 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the hope that if I speak the truth it will be sanctified for the good of 
those who are present and of those who are listening in. 

TESTIMONIES THRILL 

I have been deeply impressed and thrilled with the opening address 
of President Grant and with the sermons of the brethren which followed, 
and I have also been very deeply impressed with the singing of the 
choir and with ithe solos that have been given at this Conference, which 
have been inspiring. 

In listening to the spirited remarks and fervent testimonies of the 
mission presidents on Friday, I was thrilled and led to reflect with respect 
to the nature of their ministry and the responsibility resting upon them, 
which requires that they should carry the Gospel message to the nations 
of the earth, and particularly to this nation in which there are thirteen 
grand divisions, including the Temple Block mission, numbering in 
population considerably over one hundred million people. This re- 
sponsibility requires that they should lift up their voices, calling the 
people of this nation and others to repentance, to reformation, and 
asking them to give heed to the teachings of the Gospel. 

They are to call upon the people to jepent, which if they do will 
lead to the acceptance of the Gospel doctrines, even those of baptism 
and the laying on of hands. But the people must remember that 
repentance precedes baptism, and faith, the great foundation principle 
of the Gospel structure, precedes repentance. These thoughts and 
reflections passed through my mind. 

PROGRESS REPORTED 

On (Wednesday last, the Council of the Twelve and the First 
Council of Seventy met with the mission presidents, who reported their 
labors in some detail, which showed that progress is being made in 
Gospel conversations, conversions and baptisms. They reported that 
the tithing in the branches of the mission fields for last year kept up 
very well indeed. 

It was shown that the Gospel message is being declared upon the 
streets of the various cities of the country, in halls and chapels, in 
the newspapers, and last, but not least, by radio. And thus the voice 
of warning is going out to the world. For remember that in speaking 
of these particular mission presidents I did not mention the presidents 
of other missions, numbering about fifteen in all. 

THE CHARACTER OF GOD'S WORK 

In respect to this very important' matter, my mind rests upon a 
saying in the Pearl of Great Price, Book of Moses, which saying was 
mentioned by Elder Stephen L. Richards in his address yesterday, and 
also Rulon S. [Wells ; and it is (this : "This js rny work and my glory," 
said the Lord to Moses, "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." 

Truly, this is a wonderful saying. In just a single sentence we 
learn the character of the special work in which God is engaged, and are 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 87 

justified in believing that' he could not be engaged in a greater work, and 
possibly there is no greater work. One reason is that man, who is the 
child of God, has within him the attributes of Deity, and he may become 
in time like unto God, his jFather, in this work of salvation. The 
accomplishment of such an undertaking by our Heavenly Father involves 
the important work of salvation. You will remember the saying of 
Paul the Apostle, that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God 
unto salvation unto all who will receive and obey it. 

REVELATION EXPLAINS 

The word of the Lord given to Joseph Smith by revelation June, 
1829, as follows, is pertinent to this important matter : 

"If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be 
saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for 
there is no greater gift than the gift of salvation." (Doc. and Gov. 6:13). 

Also the word of the Lord given to Joseph Smith by revelation in 
June, 1829, for the benefit of John Whitmer, indirectly emphasizes 
the value of human souls and calls attention to the importance of seeking 
their salvation. The wording of said revelation in part is as follows : 

"Hearken, my servant John, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, your 
Lord and your Redeemer. 

"For behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine arm 
is over all the earth. 

"And I will tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone — ■ 

"For many times you have desired of me to know that which would be of 
the most worth unto you. i 

"Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which 
I have given 'you according to my commandments. 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most 
worth unto you iwill (be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may 
bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father." 
(Doc. and Cov., Section 15). 

MORE LIGHT GIVEN 

In a further revelation from the Lord given to Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, in the same month, viz., 
June, 1829, greater light is thrown upon this interesting and most 
vital subject. Listen to these solemn, impressive words: 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; wherefore 
he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on conditions of repentance. 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your 
joy with him in the kingdom of .my Father! 

"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you 
should bring many souls unto me ! 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation. 

"Ask the Father in my name, in faith believing that you shall receive, 
and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are 
expedient unto the children of men. 

"And if you have not faith, hope, and charity, you can do nothing." (Doc. 
and Cov., Section 18:10-19). 

DUTY TO PROCLAIM GOSPEL 

Permit me to call your attention to the fact that the prophets of 
old, jand Jesus and his disciples during their ministry, were constantly 
engaged in preaching to the world, thus seeking the salvation of the 
people. They had received a dispensation from God and seemed to 
feel the weight of it. They had little of worldly goods but were rich 
in the knowledge of God and preached the Gospel in power. 

So it is in this age of the world. The Latter-day Saints received 
a dispensation of the Gospel from the Lord — even the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. Divine authority was sent down from heaven 
and sealed upon the head of Joseph Smith, by which he organized the 
Church of Christ' among men. 

Having received from on high, without money and without price, 
the Gospel with its saving power, Joseph Smith and his people were 
in duty bound to give the Gospel to the world freely without money 
and without price, that all might have equal opportunity of securing 
the blessing of salvation, and that it might be said of God that he is 
no respecter of persons and that the righteous in every nation are 
acceptable unt'o him. 

RESPONSIBILITIES EXPLAINED 

The nature of the responsibility that goes with a Gospel dispensa- 
tion is set forth forcibly in a revelation given to Joseph Smith the 
Prophet, in September, 1832, a portion of which reads as follows : 

"Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, 
and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. 

"And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. 
T will be on your right hand and on your .left, and my Spirit shall be in your 
hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up. 

"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me ; and the same will feed you, and 
clothe you, and give you money. 

"And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise 
lose his reward. 

"And .he that doeth not these things is not my disciple; by this you may 
know my disciples. 

"He that receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves, and 
cleanse your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and 
bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven, and return not again 
unto that man. 

"And in whatsoever village or city iye enter, do likewise. 

"Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not ; and wo unto that house, 
or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony con- 
cerning me. | 

"Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth 
you, or your [words, or your testimony of me ; 

"For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them 
for their wickedness. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 89 

"And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until 
I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness — 

"Until all shall know me, who remain, even from the least unto the greatest, 
and shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall see eye to eye, and 
shall lift up their voice, and with the voice together sing this new song — " 

QUOTES NEW SONG 

I declare to you, my brethren and sisters, that this new song which I 
will read is one of the greatest songs that was ever written, and I have 
no doubt that it is a greater song than anything that ever can be written, 
because it sets forth the works of Almighty God and the consummation 
of all things. Let me read these words : 

"The Lord hath brought again Zion ; 
The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, 
According to the election of grace, 
Which was brought to pass by the faith 
And covenant of their fathers. 

"The Lord hath redeemed his people ; 

And Satan is bound and time is no longer. 

The Lord hath gathered all things in one. 

The Lord hath brought down Zion from above. 

The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath. 

"The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength ; 

And truth is established in her bowels ; 

And the heavens have smiled upon her ; 

And she is clothed with the glory of her God ; 

For he stands in the midst of his people. 

"Glory, and honor, and power, and might, 

Be ascribed to our God ; for he is full of mercy, 

Justice, grace and truth, and peace, 

Forever and ever. Amen." 

BEARS TESTIMONY 

My brethren and sisters, when all this is accomplished one might 
well exclaim : "God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform !" 

I testify in all solemnity that the work in which we are engaged 
is the work of God, that Jesus was the Christ, that Joseph Smith was 
his prophet, and that Joseph's successors in office were and are prophets, 
even men holding the keys to the kingdom of God upon the earth ; and I 
invoke the blessings of the Lord upon you in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The Choir and Congregation sang, "America." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto 
those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space there, and we will 
take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell ; 

"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatso- 
ever the Lord their God shall command them; 

"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those 
who keep their first estate ; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory 
added upon their heads forever and ever." 

AS A REWARD OF FAITHFULNESS 

These words which I have read present to us an epitome of exist- 
ence. They are the words of Jesus Christ, uttered in the pre-mortal 
state. From them we discover that we are here in this world because of 
obedience to former commandments and laws. We are here in this 
world, in this mortal existence, passing through all of its vicissitudes 
because of former faithfulness that has entitled us to receive these taber- 
nacles of flesh. One-third of the hosts of heaven, through rebellion, 
were denied this great and glorious blessing. But we are here on pro- 
bation. This is called a probationary state. We are here to be tried, 
to be proved, to be found worthy of exaltation in the kingdom of God, 
to go back into his presence, to become his sons and his daughters, 
entitled to a fulness, or to receive other rewards, according to works of 
lesser degree of importance. 

ALL THINGS SPIRITUAL WITH THE LORD 

I desire to spend the portion of time allotted to me in speaking of 
temporal things and spiritual things, if I may so designate them. The 
Lord has so designated matters that we may understand them. But to 
him there are no such things as temporal things. These are his words : 

"Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my 
works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may 
understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed. 

"Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and 
not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal ; neither any 
man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created. 

"Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself ; and 1 
gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, 
for my commandments are spiritual ; they are not natural nor temporal, neither 
carnal nor sensual." 

Nevertheless, that we may understand, the Lord uses these terms 
and speaks of temporal things. We, naturally, being in this mortal 
state, are surrounded by change, and all things are subject to change; 
and seeing the end but not the beginning, we naturally conclude that 
there are things temporal. All things in this life are mortal, and yet in 
the eyes of the Lord there is nothing but eternity and all things are 
eternal. 

POWER TO CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF 

In this world, as you have discovered in the words which I have 
read, the Lord has given unto man the power to become an agent unto 
himself. We are not coerced, we are not forced, there is no compulsion 
in the Church. Every man has that freedom granted unto him by virtue 
of the power given him by our Father in heaven to choose for himself 
what he will do and be. 

One of the ancient prophets upon this continent has summed this 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 91 

matter up very beautifully, and I desire to present to you his words. 
These are the words of Alma: 

"For I know that he [God] granteth unto men according to their desire, 
whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men 
according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men ; he that 
knoweth not good from evil is blameless ; but he that knoweth good and evil, to 
him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life 
or death, joy or remorse of conscience." 

An earlier prophet, in fact the founder of this race upon this con- 
tinent, has also given us this information, not new by any means, as it 
comes from him, as it is found in all the revelations of God, but he says : 

"Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. 
Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed 
by the one or the other." 

That is, by the power of righteousness or the power of evil. From 
this we learn that opposition is necessary. We must be enticed. We 
are subject to temptation. We are subject to all the ills of the flesh as 
well as to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And then as agents we have 
the right, the great God-given right, to choose for ourselves, and we 
may choose righteousness and eternal life or we may choose death by 
disregarding the commandments of the Lord. 

A -TEMPORAL LAW 

I said that I was going to speak of some things temporal. I must 
hurry if I do so. In the beginning of this Conference, President Grant 
presented figures in relation to certain sums of money that had been ex- 
pended for the benefit of this people, in our education, in our temple 
work, in the building of meeting houses, in the care of the poor and 
many other ways in which the funds of the Church are spent. I want to 
call your attention to the fact that money for these purposes cannot be 
spent unless it is received, and the Lord has given us a law by which 
these revenues may be obtained ; this is called the law of tithing. Bishop 
Sylvester Q. Cannon has called your attention to this law and the neces- 
sity for it. It is a very important one. It seems to me that a man hold- 
ing membership in this Church is certainly disloyal, he certainly does 
not comprehend the nature of this work or his duty, if he fails to pay 
his tithing. 

A PROMISE AND WARNING 

I want to present to you a few things coming from a former Presi- 
dent of the Church, President Lorenzo Snow, uttered more than thirty 
years ago, but just as true and binding upon the people today as when 
his words were uttered. Said he : 

"Teach the children to pay tithing, so that it may be perpetually observed. If 
we observe this law, no matter what our enemies may do the Lord will preserve 
us." 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

What a wonderful promise ! And it appears to me that little do we 
appreciate it ! Then again he says : 

"Because we are his sons and daughters he loves us and he has forgiven us 
our f orgetf ulness to this holy law in the past, but he will not forgive you and me 
any longer. I say it in the name of the Lord. He will not forgive this people 
any longer if we continue in this dilatory way of paying tithing. We will be 
scattered just as the people of Jackson County were. It is true, just as God is 
true." 

I call your attention to the fact that this comes from the one who 
had the right to speak in the name of the Lord and give commandments. 
He goes on further to say : 

"Those who will not observe this law are not entitled to the blessings." 

I shall not take time, much as I would delight in doing so, to read 
farther, because in this expression which I have already presented there 
is food enough for thought to keep us busy in our reflections regarding 
our duty in this matter for many days to come. 

OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH 

One or two other items. Our attention has been called to the fact 
during this Conference that we are living in perilous times. There is 
sin, there is distress everywhere and disregard of the commandments 
of the Lord. He has given us another commandment, and that is that we 
regard the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Who does it ? Do the people 
of this nation? Do the people of other nations? I have been in some 
parts of this land where on the Sabbath day people worshipped, but 
here among us we find Babylon in all its glory, all its wickedness ; and 
we are face to face with temptation, with sin, with enticement of various 
natures to lead us from the path of truth and from the worshipping of 
the true and the living God. 

The Lord has pointed out in the revelations what we should do on 
the Sabbath day to keep this day holy. We should not go to picture 
shows, nor go to places of amusement, nor spend our time foolishly; 
but in thought and in reflection and in study, in consideration of the 
things of the kingdom of God. What more can be said ? I leave these 
thoughts with you, fragmentary they are. 

May the Lord bless and guide the Latter-day Saints and keep them 
in the path of righteousness, in the path of humility, in the path of 
truth. We must uphold the standards of Zion. May we do it, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

The Twelve Apostles, the First Council of Seventy, and the mis- 
sion presidents, who have addressed you in this Conference, as already 
stated, met together during last Wednesday, to hear reports and con- 
sider matters pertaining to the missions of the Church. I had the pleas- 
ure of attending that meeting. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 93 

I call your attention to the fact that this was the gathering of special 
witnesses for the Lord. That is particularly true of the quorum of the 
Twelve, who are designated as the "special witnesses of the Lord Jesus 
Christ ;" and also the Seventy, the Council of Seventy, and as a matter 
of fact of all the Seventies of the Church. They were not all present, 
but those who were present were among "these special witnesses of 
Jesus Christ." And also these mission presidents, by reason of their 
appointment, are witnesses of the Lord, and preside over the work of 
proclaiming the Gospel in their respective fields of labor. 

During that meeting, I think more than at any other time, I was 
impressed with the dignity, with the importance and the glory of those 
who are witnesses for the Lord Jesus Christ. iWhat do we mean by 
that general term, "Witnesses for Jesus Christ?" I think sometimes 
we leave it in that generalized statement, and fail to appreciate 
just what is meant by it. I want to express some thoughts in relation 
to that. 

What is it to be a "witness for Jesus ?" One of the best examples 
that I can recall just now is given in the experience of St. Peter. When 
on the coast of Caesarea, on one occasion, the Christ seemed to be a little 
anxious to know what men thought of him — whom men thought him 
to be. So he inquired of those disciples that were around him. Some 
thought he was John the Baptist, raised from the dead. Others, one 
of the old prophets who had reappeared. They got about that far when 
the Christ, with some earnestness, put this question: "But whom say 
ye that I am ?" Then St. Peter spoke up, as perhaps was his place, by 
reason of his age and his position in the quorum as the chief of the 
apostlesi — he said : "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." 
That was his testimony. And the Christ said unto him: 

"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it 
unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. * * * 

" * * * And upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it." 

I do not intend to go into a discussion of that tremendous state- 
ment. I merely call attention to what it is to be a witness for the Lord 
Jesus Christ. First and foremost must be the great truth, and it must 
become the testimony of .the witness : "Thou art the Christ, the Son of 
the living God." That is one item at least of our lesson of being wit- 
nesses. It is to testify of the sonship of the Christ to God, the eternal 
Father. 

Also to be a witness of him is to testify that he is the revelation of 
God to man, for so he is. If men would hold before them a vision of 
God the eternal Father they need only refer to the glorious resurrected 
Christ, as he stood before the disciples in Galilee, where he met them 
by appointment, after his resurrection ; and from his glorious condition 
of a resurrected, eternal personage, he said : 

"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 

"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

And so we are to speak iof him, as witnesses for him, that he is the 
Son of God, and the revelation of God to men ; also that he is the Re- 
deemer of the world, through the resurrection from the dead. Redeemer 
of the world because it is a redemption that will come unto all people, 
saint and sinner ; for "as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made 
alive;" and the being "made alive" is as broad as the death through 
Adam. So men are assured of this resurrection, because it was im- 
peratively necessary to pass through the portals of death in order to 
reach the stage, through resurrection, where God carries out his great 
purpose of bringing to pass the "immortality and the eternal life ot 
man;" meaning the race. 

So Jesus is the Redeemer of the world from death. Of that we 
are assured. But also he is the Savior of men, the Savior of individual 
men, by bringing repentance of sin within their power, and salvation 
from the consequences of sin, through forgiveness, in the symbols of 
his death and resurrection in baptism; also to bring individual men 
into union with God, through the Holy Ghost, so that the lives of men 
may be linked up to the source of light, intelligence, power, glory, pro- 
gression — united to God. So the Christ is the "Savior of men," in that 
he has made salvation possible unto them, every one who will believe, 
and repent of his sins, and thus come unto God. 

To bear witness of these truths concerning the Christ is to be the 
witness of Christ in relation to all these things. What a privilege thus 
to be witnesses for God ! And how fundamentally important ■ is all 
this to the children of men, that they should know these things ; that 
they should come to a knowledge of the way of salvation ! I glory in 
the greatness, in the immensity of such a mission as this. 

But there is still a closer and a dearer thing coming out of all this, 
and that is the association it brings to us with the Christ himself as a 
witness; for St. John, in his revelation, declares jthat "Jesus Christ is 
the faithful witness," the first witness, the greatest witness of all. It 
is our privilege to stand in the throng of which he is the leader, and 
what could be more honorable, greater or more desirable than to be one 
with Jesus Christ, as a witness for God ? > 

And then the definiteness of the Christ's mission as a witness. You 
perhaps will recall, at these suggestions, the language of the Savior 
when teaching Nicodemus some of the supposed mysteries of the Gos- 
pel. At the conclusion of his interview with him he said : 

"We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye 
receive not our witness." 

What an upbraiding, and what definiteness of God's chief and lead- 
ing witness ! 

He has presented the same thought to us also in his conversation 
with Pilate, who was seeking every possible opportunity to deliver him 
from the unjust clamor of the Jewish multitude, who charged that he 
had committed blasphemy by proclaiming that he was the Son of God. 
And then, in order to influence Pilate more greatly, they charged the 
Christ with claiming to be a king : "He who .claims to be a king is not 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 95 

Caesar's friend," said they ; and this touched Pilate more nearly, because 
he must maintain the attitude of patriotism toward ( Caesar. Hence this 
declaration of the Jews sent Pilate into the inner court to inquire care- 
fully of Jesus if he were a king. "Well," Jesus said, "my kingdom is 
not of this world. If it were, my disciples would fight, that I might 
not be delivered to the Jews. But ,my kingdom is not of this world." 
"Thou are a king, (then?" said Pilate, and Jesus, as if despairing of 
making him understand, said : "Thou sayest I am a king," as if he 
would say, "Let it go at that." Then he made a declaration that is 
most thrilling: 

"To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I 
should bear witness unto the truth." 

That was greater than being a king, to be a witness of the truth. 
And he added now, not — "and ye receive not pur witness" — as in the 
case of Nicodemus, but said, "Every one that is of the fruth, heareth 
my voice" — they who are of that spirit of truth would hear his words, 
and so will they by that same power of self-evidence, that goes with the 
truth, hear all his witnesses who proclaim the truth. And "they who 
are of the truth" will be attracted to it, and ultimately find their places 
in the great body of the Church of Christ. 

Well, all this, to my mind, stamps with importance and glory those 
who are called to be witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ, and they share 
with him the high honor of bearing testimony to the truth, by the power 
of truth. 

The Savior, in the dispensation when he established his atonement 
for the sins of the world, and brought to pass the beginning of the 
resurrection from the dead, chose special witnesses. These were the 
Twelve apostles. And after he had chosen these apostles and sent them 
into the world, then he "called other seventy," and giving a like com- 
mission to them, sent them into the world to be his witnesses. To both 
these classes he made these declarations, in substance : 

"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him 
that sent me." 

It is a true principle; and conversely: those who reject you reject 
Vne, and those who reject me reject my Father also. 

To these men he gave power that they should heal the sick, cleanse 
the lepers, raise the dead even, heal the lame, open the eyes of the blind, 
and pronounced woe upon those who rejected these, his witnesses. They 
went forth as witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. When the Seventy 
returned they were very joyous about what their experiences had 
brought to them. "Why," said they unto the Lord, "even the devils 
are subject unto us through thy name ;" and (Jesus raised up his eyes and 
glorified God in that hour, that he had revealed his great truth to the sim- 
ple, and to the humble among men. It hadn't fallen upon the great, 
who stood in the establishments of learning in those days, but the rev- 
elation had come to those who, comparatively, might be thought of as 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"babes and sucklings" in knowledge. God had exalted them through 
the spirit of knowledge which comes of faith, rather than from the 
learning of men. 

He said to these men, whom he sent into the world, that "He that 
repenteth and is baptized shall be saved ; and those who do not repent, 
and consequently will not be baptized, they shall be damned." Now, I 
have no disposition to soften that word. Let it stand, in all its ruggedness. 
You may put all the "cons" before it you please, but there it is, and 
whatever "damnation" may consist of, it will fall upon those who do 
not hearken to the message that God sends to them, and I leave those 
upon whom it falls to render this definition as they please. But what- 
ever it is, that is it ; it is "damnation ;" so let it stand ! 

'Well, we happen to be associated with a new dispensation of this 
Gospel. Men in early Christian centuries at least, fulfilled the great 
prophecy of Isaiah — speaking of the last days — when he said that men 
in those days would "transgress the law, change the ordinances, break 
the everlasting covenant," — and the blood of Christ is spoken of as 
"the blood of the everlasting covenant." It is that covenant with Christ, 
who brings salvation through his Gospel to the world that he sealed 
with his blood, and that is the "everlasting covenant." God's prophet, 
speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, seven hundred years 
before the coming of the Christ, declared that men would break that 
covenant, and if broken, the only possible way to ever re-establish it is to 
renew it through a new dispensation of it. 

We happen to be the witnesses and the heralds to proclaim that this 
dispensation of the Gospel has been renewed in our days, to bring to pass 
the final fulfilment of all the dispensations from Adam to now, and 
weld them into one, that should consummate the work of God in rela- 
tion to the salvation of men and the redemption of the world. 

How does this matter of being witnesses appear in this new dis- 
pensation? It began as of old. Men had departed from God, changed 
his ordinances, broken the covenant, and the only way to go about re- 
establishing all this is to give the new dispensation and raise up new 
witnesses to its truth. The Lord took one in every way prepared to be 
chosen and educated by him, and made a witness for himself and for 
the Lord Jesus Christ. To Joseph Smith, as you all know, both Father 
and Son appeared in the commencement of his ministry. With them 
he conversed ; he saw — he heard them, and had most definite knowl- 
edge concerning God — the Father and the Son — and received at that 
time the promise that he would be an instrument, in the hands of God, 
in accomplishing some of his great and mighty purposes in these last 
days. 

God had established a witness among men, one who could speak 
with positiveness ; who through the senses of sight and hearing, to- 
gether with the responsive pulsation of soul, could say : "I know God 
lives, for he spoke unto me and I beheld him. His Son Jesus is the 
Christ," and he could say it with all the positiveness that ever St. Peter 
couldf— "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And it can 
be applied to Joseph Smith: "Blessed art thou, Joseph, for flesh and 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 97 

blood hath not revealed that unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. 
. . . And on this rock will I build my church." And now, in this dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, truly the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against the Church of the Christ, not only in this time but in all times. 
Men forgot that the Church of God began in the days of Adam, and the 
method, and the means by which all men could become the sons of God 
was revealed to him ; and those who reacted in faith to the message of 
God, through all time, constitute the redeemed in the Church of the liv- 
ing God in heaven, and there shall nothing prevail against that church, 
from first to last. 

We shall see the consummation, that is, this dispensation of ours 
shall see the consummation of God's work, against which the gates of 
hell have not prevailed and cannot prevail. 

Then another mighty stride forward was made, when God revealed 
the scriptures of the American continent, and brought them to the 
knowledge of men. He raised up witnesses to bear special testimony 
to that great event. And these three whom he favored with what is 
called a "miraculous testimony" — a vision from heaven in relation to 
these things — he told them that they would be called upon to choose 
other witnesses, even twelve. So it came to pass in this new dispensation 
that twelve were chosen as special witnesses. Then groups of seventy 
special witnesses were to follow them in the great work of preaching 
the Gospel in all the world. I would like to dwell a little on that, but 
time will not permit. 

I can only ask this question: Must the same consequences follow 
the testimony of these witnesses in the new dispensation as those in the 
time of the Christ? Yea, verily! Brother Rudger Clawson has read 
to us just now how some of these things will be. Let me hastily say : God 
gave unto them the same commission he did to the ancient witnesses. He 
named the same consequences that would follow their proclamation of 
the truth: He that believes and is baptized shall be saved. Those that 
believe not, and are not baptized, shall be damned. The same positive- 
ness — and I don't undertake to make any limitations about it. 

Then he enumerated the great blessings that were to follow their 
preaching and bearing witness of the truth, for God said : 

"As I said unto mine apostles, [meaning the ancient ones] even so I say unto 
you, for you are mine apostles, even God's high jpriests ; ye are they whom my 
Father hath given me ; ye are my friends. Therefore, as I said unto mine 
apostles I say unto you again, that every soul who believeth on your words, and 
is baptized by water for the remission of his sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost." 

What man is authorized to say that of a group of witnesses he is 
sending out into the world? It is in the first great promise to be 
fulfilled, also that they shall have power to impart the Holy Ghost. 

Then further on: 

"And these isigns shall follow them that believe — In my name they shall do 
many wonderful works ; in my name they shall cast out devils ; in my name they 
shall heal the sick; in my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop 
the ears of the dtjaf ; and the tongue of the dumb shall speak. * * * 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast themselves 
of these things, neither speak them before the world ; for these things are given 
unto you for your profit and for salvation." 

Pointing to these so-called miraculous gifts and their fulfilment, 
what a testimony to those who accept the Gospel ! Yet they are not to 
prize those things above other great spiritual truths, namely, for one 
thing, receiving the Holy Ghost. That is more than equal to all these 
spiritual gifts named. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are 
not baptized in water in my name, for the remission of their sins, that they may 
receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my Father's 
kingdom where imy Father and I am." 

I think that must be the "damnation" spoken of above. At least 
they can not attain unto the rewards that come with obedience to the 
Gospel. 

And then the Christ continues on speaking of these witnesses, that 
they shall labor in the spirit in which the ancient apostles — the former 
witnesses — labored. When he traveled with them in the world, he neither 
suffered them to take purse nor scrip with them in their mission, but 
taught them to rely upon the Lord, and promised they should not be 
darkened in mind or limb or joint, but he would sustain them in their 
missions. Being without money is no excuse for the witnesses who are 
to go forth in the name of the Lord in the New Dispensation. They 
are to preserve the same spirit of earnest, sacrificing devotion to the 
work as in ancient times. 

The revelation (Doc. and Cov., sec. 84:79-91) dealing with these 
things in the New Dispensation says : 

"Behold, I send you out to prove the world, and the laborer is worthy of his 
hire. 

"And any man that shall go and preach this Gospel of the kingdom, and 
fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither 
darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall 
to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst. 

"Therefore, take ye no thought for the morrow, for what ye shall eat, or 
what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. * * * 

"THEREFORE, LET NO MAN AMONG YOU, FOR THIS COM- 
MANDMENT ,IS UNTO ALL THE FAITHFUL WHO ARE CALLED OF 
GOD IN THE CHURCH UNTO THE MINISTRY, FROM THIS HOUR 
TAKE PURSE OR SCRIP, THAT GOETH FORTH TO PROCLAIM THIS 
GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM. 

"Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, 
and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. 

"And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your 
face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my spirit shall be in 
your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up. 

"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me ; and the same will feed you, and clothe 
you, and give you money. 

"And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise 
lose his reward. 

"And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple ; by this you may 
know my disciples." 

To my surprise I see the time is up. I would like to dwell upon 
these matters a little longer, if it were possible. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 99 

I was delighted with the suggestions made by Elder George F. 
Richards here yesterday, in regard to widening the mission force in 
various mission fields. Now that we are in the midst of this so-called 
"financial depression," it becomes increasingly more difficult for the 
Saints in Zion to provide the funds for a mission for their sons and 
daughters, especially if asked to make the provisions from the begin- 
ning of it to the end of it, before they start. I want to make a suggestion 
or express a thought I have upon the subject, and that is that these wit- 
nesses for God I think should learn to trust more in the Lord and his 
promises — summon up the faith of the Gospel and be willing to face the 
world with faith in God, and depend upon him more and more for sup- 
plying their needs, while preparing the hearts of the children of men 
for the coming of the Lord as in the beginning of our work. 

The Lord bless Israel and sustain the witnesses of this dispensa- 
tion as in former dispensations, increase their power so that when they 
go forth to speak it will not occur to the children of men to question 
their truth but to know, by the response of the spirit in their hearts, 
that these are witnesses sent of God — in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Mr. H. A. Smith of Arizona, who has been addressing the Com- 
mercial Club, is here in the interest of a tariff on copper. We wish 
him God-speed in getting it. I do not think I could get one vote against 
a tariff on copper. 

I wish to say, incidentally, do not go wild over a lot of books that 
claim the world is coming to an end in a few days. The scriptures 
tell us that no one knoweth. I am sure that some of the people who 
are wasting days, weeks and months of study trying to frighten them- 
selves to death will not be successful. 

The Chpir rendered the anthem "Inflammatus," solo part by Sister 
Laurinda Brewerton. 

Elder Heber J. Meeks, President of the Kanab Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock, Sunday afternoon, April 10th, the attendance at this meeting 
being similar to that at the morning session, large crowds of people who 
were unable to gain entrance to the Tabernacle, having assembled in 
the Assembly Hall and on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened 
to the proceedings as they were broadcast by radio. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The Choir and Congregation sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God 
like a fire is burning." 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Elder Lee R. Taylor, president of the Nebo Stake, offered the open- 
ing prayer. 

A ladies' chorus under the direction of Prof. Anthony C. Lund sang 
a sacred anthem, "The Twenty-third Psalm." 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

People are moved to action by a diversity of motives, and much de- 
pends upon the incentives by which a man is prompted. Indeed, mo- 
tives may be regarded as constituting an index to the character of the 
individual; and doubtless there are many whose motives are not gen- 
erally understood in their full significance. 

SIGNIFICANCE OF MOTIVES 

I call to mind that the Master while in the flesh warned against un- 
worthy motives : When you give to charity, he said, though as he put it 
"when thou doest thine alms," do not so act before men to attract their 
attention and win praise for yourselves; for those who do this receive 
their reward then and there and have nothing more to expect by way of 
recompense. And do not make a display of your piety and your pray- 
ers, for there are those who pray that they may be heard of men. Well, 
they are heard of men, they have their reward and that is all there is 
to it. 

And when you fast, he continued, do not go about with a haggard 
countenance, displaying to men the fact that you are fasting or pretend- 
ing to; but fast in earnestness and sincerity unto the Lord and pray 
unto him in secret and do your alms quietly. 

Now, I would rather a man do a good deed even with a motive that 
may not be the best than that he should fail to do it ; and far rather that 
he should do that good deed rather than do evil. Nevertheless there is 
an importance to be attached to the incentives that move us. 

CONFERENCE ASSEMBLIES 

In looking over these assembled thousands in the several meetings 
of this conference I have thought of the motives that bring such multi- 
tudes together, not only now but at all of our recurring conferences. 

The gathering of people in conferences of this Church is a phe- 
nomenon, or appears to be such to those who do not know us well, while 
to the members of the Church it is an ordinary and regular occurrence. 
I am inclined to impute good motives to men, to communities and or- 
ganizations, until I have reason to act otherwise. I have not lost con- 
fidence in this family of ours, this human family. .We are a pretty good 
family after all, much as there is to be improved in our affairs ; and I 
ascribe worthy motives to those who are assembled here this afternoon. 

ACTUALITY OF RELIGION 

I believe that the great majority — oh, I may say that all of us— 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 101 

have come together with good intent. This is a day set apart for wor- 
ship, the Sabbath, and we come with the spirit of worship in our hearts. 
We are here to learn more of the duties that pertain to us as members 
of the Church. Our religion is very real to us. There is that feature 
about the Latter-day Saints — they take their religion to heart. They 
believe what they say, and though I know we can do much better than 
we are doing, I believe that the people are trying to live according to 
what they know to be the revealed truths of their religious system. 
There are many to whom religion is really lacking in actuality — in 
f actuality let me say — it does not reach the heart, therefore it does not 
impel to right living. Many are apt to deal with religion in the abstract 
and to shrink when concrete application is made. There is nothing new 
in this. 

Christ's affirmation of his divinity 

You remember the story told, not a story in the sense of a bit of 
fiction but the recorded account of the Christ as he made his way from 
Jerusalem northward, passing through Samaria, near the beginning of 
his ministry, when he met a woman at Jacob's well and asked her for 
water to drink. She was surprised that a Jew should solicit any favor 
of a Samaritan, but she hastened to comply with the request, and Jesus 
talked with her. She asked him questions and soon became aware that 
he could read her thoughts, that he knew the story of her life, and she 
was somewhat disturbed. She raised the query, perhaps in a casual way, 
as to whether it was necessary to worship in Mount Moriah, as the 
Samaritans held, or in Jerusalem, as the Jews insisted. She reasoned 
on it for a moment and then put it away, really thrust it aside or tried 
to, saying: 

"I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ, when he is come, he 
will tell us all things." 

That may seem a good way of putting things off; but she was 
brought to solemn attention when he spoke the next few words: 

"/ that speak unto thee am he." 

For that she was not prepared, the application, the present reality. 
The Jewish nation had been waiting for the coming of Messiah ; their 
rabbis had preached upon it Sabbath after Sabbath, and their synagogs 
had resounded to the words of the prophets telling of the coming; but 
when they were told that he was there in their midst they rose up and 
tried to kill him, and eventually did bring about his death. 

THE REVOLT AT NAZARETH 

From Samaria our Lord went on to Galilee, and there, in what has 
been called his home city — though not the place of his birth, yet the 
town of his youth, Nazareth — he went into the synagog after he had be- 
come thirty years of age, the age at which a Jew was entitled to be 
heard if he had anything to say, in the synagog, and he there appeared 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

for the first time so far as we know in what we may call the speaker's 
stand, perhaps by invitation. The president of the synagog handed to 
him the roll, the Book of Isaiah. Jesus opened to what in our Bible is 
the sixty-first chapter and read from it as recorded by Luke : 

"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach 
the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach 
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty 
them that are bruised, 

"To preach the acceptable year of the Lord." 

Possibly there were few if any there who had not heard that scrip- 
ture quoted aforetime. It was a favorite with speakers and com- 
mentators of the day, and it aroused some solemn interest in all who 
listened to him, but his words that followed struck to the heart of every- 
one : 

"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." 

They were startled. Some began to find fault, and the tumult cul- 
minated in their seizing him and dragging him to the brow of a nearby 
hill, intending to cast him down to his death even at the beginning of 
his ministry. But his hour had not yet come. It was the present, the 
individual application, that had stirred their anger. And so with many 
other incidents in the life and earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus. 

PREDICTED SIGNS OF THE END 

As you read in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew our Lord 
declared as one of the signs of the approaching end of the dispensation 
of which he was speaking, that this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be 
preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall 
the end come. That scripture has been preached in many places, syna- 
gogs, tabernacles, cathedrals. People passively believe in it, yes, it is 
scripture and it goes with other scripture. But when the voice of author- 
ity is heard declaring that this Gospel that we preach is the Gospel refer- 
red to by Jesus Christ, verily the Gospel of the Kingdom, that it is now 
being declared in all the world, that this declaration is a witness unto 
all nations, people get angry; they reject it; they do not want the appli- 
cation. In theory it is to them all right. As a matter of record they 
are willing to let it stand, but if you apply it to them they object. This 
is the attitude of many. 

Elijah's coming 

So we could cite instance after instance. Indulge me in one other. 
Remember what the Lord said through Malachi regarding one particular 
characteristic of the last days, that before the great and dreadful day of 
the Lord Elijah the prophet would be sent with a particular mission to 
turn the hearts of the living children unto their dead progenitors, and 
on the other hand to turn the hearts of the dead ancestors, alive in the 
spirit, to their posterity now in the flesh. Yes, that is scripture also, 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 103 

and many have quoted it and let it pass. But when we raise our voices 
in solemn declaration that Elijah the ancient prophet has come, that that 
prediction has been fulfilled as to its initiation and is in rapid course of 
progressive operation, people object. When we say that on the third 
day of April, 1836, Elijah appeared in person, a resurrected being, in 
the Kirtland Temple, and did confer his authority, power and commis- 
sion, upon the prophet of this dispensation, people refuse to receive it 
and they are loud in their denunciation of the claim. 

A SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF DENIAL 

I call to mind that it was my privilege once to address the Philo- 
sophical Society of Denver on the Philosophy of Mormonism. I quoted 
that passage from Malachi, and dwelt upon it at some length. In the 
discussion that followed the address a cultured gentleman, a Jew, took 
part. He said : 

"I wish I could believe all that the speaker has said tonight, and 
I believe much of it; but when he tells us that Elijah, the ancient 
prophet, has actually come in person to the earth in this age, I say simply 
that I can not believe it. I wish I could, but I can not." 

Well, of course the rejoinder was simple when my turn came again : 

"Do you accept Malachi as one of your prophets ?" 

"Certainly." 

"Do you believe what he said when he voiced the word of the Lord 
that in the last days Elijah the prophet would come?" 

"Well, yes ; yes of course." 

"Now, we simply affirm that your Jewish prophet Malachi was a 
true prophet as is proved by the fulfilment of his prediction ; that Elijah 
has come ; that the work without which the earth would be smitten with 
a curse is now in progress." 

SIGNS OF THE TIME 

The calamities of these days, phenomenal disturbances in nature — 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, destructive hurricanes — as also the 
struggle of nation against nation in actual warfare and in scheming di- 
plomacy, the pestilence and the famine — these and yet greater disasters 
have been definitely predicted. None can gainsay their actuality, and all 
who read must see that they were foretold. 

Yet men are prone to deny the reality of these dread occurrences 
as signs of the time, telling of the imminence of the Lord's coming to 
rule among men and to inaugurate the millennium of a new order. Con- 
ditions prevailing in the world today demand our serious attention. The 
solemnities of the eternal word and plan should move mankind to re- 
pentance, reformation, and soulful worship of Deity, worship expressed 
in a rectification of individual and national life. 

I plead for the reality, the actuality of religion, in belief and prac- 
tice, feeling that this is no day for mere theory and supposition. This 
religion of ours, this Church of ours, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is real, 
vital, living, eternal. God help us to understand and live accordingly, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER LEONIDAS DeVON MECHAM 

Former acting-president of the Australian Mission 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children 
of men. 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before 
God at the last day." 

These few lines, the beginning of the fourth section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, have been running through my mind from the very 
opening of the Conference sessions up until the present time, more espe- 
cially so during the address of Elder Ballard. It seems to be the general 
theme of this Conference to me, and I have been wondering if we are 
taking these things which are indeed a luxury, which we have started to 
class as necessities of life — taking them to heart to such an extent that 
we are crying depression when we are really enjoying marvelous bless- 
ings from God. We are living in a truly marvelous age. 

Having been handicapped somewhat in this Conference in the earlier 
sessions — as I recently had my tonsils removed, in fact a little over a 
week ago — I was unable to participate with the audience in singing the 
hymns. I love to take part in singing the Latter-day Saint sacred hymns. 
They surely contain Gospel sermons and I love the beautiful harmony 
in them. As I stood listening to those hymns my faith and my testimony 
were increased and I felt well repaid for having attended these services. 

I rejoice in having this opportunity of meeting here with you peo- 
ple in a General Conference. It has been some time since this has been 
my privilege. 

Going back to the point I want to stress. In thus being a listener 
and not a participator in the rendering of the hymns I could not help 
noticing the confusion caused by people leaving during the closing hymn 
and benediction, not mentioning those who leave before the last speaker 
has finished. I cannot help but feel that this is not only improper but 
shows disrespect to God himself. If we have a true testimony of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ how can we leave a spiritual feast before it is fin- 
ished. One would never think of leaving a banquet before the serving 
of the last two or three courses. Of course there are exceptions, there 
are cases and times when necessity makes this necessary. But seeing 
the members do this, not only at these sessions of Conference but in our 
ward meetings, it has been a mystery to me, because as I stated before I 
do love to hear our sacred hymns sung and the final benediction pro- 
nounced at our Church services. I am sure that if we have embarked 
in the service of God, and if we are trying to live up to our religion with 
all our heart, might, mind and strength, we will never leave a meeting 
before it is completely finished and the amen has been said. 

Some reference has been made during the Conference to anti-"Mor- 
mon" literature that is being spread abroad. Australia has been no ex- 
ception in this regard. During the past four years there has been a man 
by the name of Julian Barclay, masquerading as or professing to be the 



ELDER LEONIDAS DeVON MECHAM 105 

re-incarnation of Christ, and he has received wide publicity as such, 
throughout Australia. During the course of the past year this same man 
has been led to see the light through the diligence of some of our mis- 
sionaries and through his own prayerful and earnest desire to find the 
truth. He accepted the Gospel and joined the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and I believe humbly and sincerely, because of the 
true change of heart which I have witnessed in him. The newspapers, 
took advantage of this, and have circulated false propaganda in regard 
to statements that they claim he made which in reality he did not. Along 
with this they have written a number of articles of an anti-"Mormon" 
nature, some of them three to four columns in length. In some instances 
they have printed them on the front page, using one to two-inch block 
type letters in their headlines. Two papers in particular did this, and 
they had statements similar to the following as their headlines : "Mor- 
mon Agents are Seeking Girl Recruits in Australia — Wiell Spoken Amer- 
icans Frequent Cafes and Offer Jobs to Pretty Waitresses — All Expenses 
For Journey and 8 pounds ($40.00) Per Week !" Some of these articles 
have carried with them beautiful pictures and descriptions of Salt Lake 
City and the Church Office building, along with fine write-ups about 
scenic Utah and its wealth in natural resources. The truth mixed with 
such brazen falsehood made the articles so ridiculous that instead of 
doing harm to our people they have been of inestimable value to our 
missionaries, because people who are educated and think for themselves 
realize that these statements are impossible, and when they came in con- 
tact with our missionaries the first thing they wanted to know was just 
how our Church organization does operate, why it is we send mission- 
aries into the world, just what constitutes our beliefs, etc. These things 
gave us a wonderful opportunity to spread the Gospel among that peo- 
ple, giving us audiences that we could not otherwise have had. There- 
fore the Elders are taking advantage of this and are laboring with all 
their heart, might, mind, and strength among that people. 

I believe firmly that the Australian mission at the present time is in 
the healthiest condition it has ever enjoyed. The missionaries, though 
few in number, are doing a marvelous work. I have left them in the best 
of health. The Saints generally throughout Australia are also enjoying 
very good health and are not being hurt by this depression nearly so 
much as are the other people of the commonwealth. During the past few 
months there has been a remarkable growth in the Australian mission. 
There have been more converts baptized and more Books of Mormon 
distributed than in any other similar period in the entire history of the 
mission. This speaks volumes for the work the missionaries are doing 
there. 

I do not want you to think I am in any way placing all the honor 
or glory upon the Elders who are laboring there now. They are reap- 
ing what the other missionaries have sown in years past. These things 
run in cycles, and Australia at the present time is enjoying a cycle of 
reaping. Of course I realize fully that all blessings are contingent up- 
on God and to him belong all praise, honor, and glory. 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

In closing I want to bear my testimony. I only hope and pray that 
I may ever remain steadfast in the Church of Jesus Christ, that I may • 
remain firm in the faith. As President Grant expressed in his opening 
address, I have never seen a time yet when I wavered the least bit or 
had any cause for doing so, nor have I come in contact with any doc- 
trines of other churches that would cause me to waver in the least so far 
as my faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is concerned. I only hope and 
pray that if I live to see the age that President Grant has attained, I too 
may look back on my years and be able to continue to say that very 
thing. In fact, after looking over the doctrines of the world as they are 
being taught in the various denominations, I feel just as Peter did in the 
time of the Savior. You will recall some of the Redeemer's disciples 
had fallen away and left him, and he turned to the Twelve and said, 
"Will ye also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to 
whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life." That is what 
I say in regard to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If we haven't the Gospel 
in our Church today I do not know of any church that has, and I would 
say, to whom shall we go, because the words of eternal life are inculcated 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I know that it has everything within its 
fold that is conducive to health, happiness, and success, and the richest 
of all blessings, that of eternal life and increase. 

May God bless us all that we may worship and obey him through- 
out our lives, with all our heart, might, mind and strength, is my 
humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

Today, my brethren and sisters, I rejoice in my lot. I am grateful 
to my Heavenly Father for the privilege of laboring in authority of the 
holy priesthood. 

As I have listened to the remarks made during this Conference I 
have wondered if this so-called depression is not really a blessing. I re- 
call six months ago President Charles W. Nibley called this condition 
to our attention and urged that we prepare ourselves to be ready to live 
according to the United Order. 

May I be pardoned if I take a moment to speak of him. He was 
as a father to me, for he was all a kind and loving father should be to a 
son. He came into our family life before I was born. In my youth I 
learned to call him "uncle." He loved my father with a devotion seldom 
found in men. Because of that devotion I have been exceedingly blessed. 
It was my good fortune and great privilege to work with him many 
years, to know of his faith and his integrity ; and I want to testify to you 
that he was, through faith, the service he rendered and his life's work, 
in a position to advise us to prepare to meet the requirements of these 
Gospel teachings. He lived them and never taught anything that he did not 
believe, and that which he taught he believed with all his heart. As he 
learned the joy of service in the Lord's work during times of poverty and 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 107 

the need of such service in times of plenty, should we not accept his ad- 
vice and example to guide us during this period of depression ? I want 
to relate just one incident. While he was the presiding bishop of the 
Church the majority interests of the Sugar Company were held by east- 
ern capitalists. They were declared by the Government to be a trust 
and ordered dissolved. It appeared that if that were carried out the 
sugar industry of the intermountain country would cease to be, for sugar 
could be made much cheaper elsewhere. He went to New York, nego- 
tiated for the purchase of that stock, pledged every cent he had in the 
world to secure it and came home thinking it would be an easy matter 
to persuade his friends and business associates to help him carry the load. 
But few of them helped. On every hand men looking at dollars, not with 
the viewpoint he had, refused to help. 

I remember one day while sitting in the office he said : "I have been 
impressed that this industry should be preserved for this people. I may 
lose every cent I have in the world, but if I save the industry for this 
people I shall be satisfied." 

Later on, the demand seemed to grow in the East for that stock. It 
increased in value. Day after day men came to the office, the telephone 
rang, for people were then willing, when they could see a chance for an 
increased monetary value, to give him support. Later, during the great 
war, when the price of sugar was at the highest it has ever been, I had 
the honor of representing him on a committee to deal with the beet- 
raisers to negotiate a contract ; and his only advice was, "I want you to 
endeavor to secure an agreement for the division of profits between the 
beet-growers and those who have put their money into this industry." 

For days we argued, labored and pleaded with those who repre- 
sented the beet-growers. Finally we were unable to reach an agreement. 
I shall never forget the final answer. I shouldn't repeat it but perhaps 
I can make a lesson of it. When I finally said : "Now let us be reason- 
able ; let us reach an agreement in this matter that will be equitable and 
just," the spokesman of that committee said : "To hell with equity and 
justice. We know what we want and we are going to have it." And 
he evidently did know, for he got what they wanted and the beet-grow- 
ers and the stockholders of the Sugar Company are still paying the debt. 

President Nibley was always ready to enter into the United Order. 
He taught it. He paid his tithes and his offerings, and every call 
made of him through the Gospel of Jesus Christ was uppermost 
in his mind and his soul. He never overlooked that statement which 
the Lord made, warning the rich man that unless he gave of his 
substance to the poor his riches would canker his soul. He had been 
poor, he knew what it was to go hungry and cold. He knew that the 
salvation of man, that which would secure for him exaltation in the 
kingdom of our Lord, must be obtained by faith and work. 

Again I say, I believe this time of depression is really a time of 
blessing, a time of fasting, a time in which we are called to turn to God, 
a time of purification. How can we live the United Order when we have 
not learned to live according to the law which teaches us to pay our tithes 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and offerings? How can we live according to the law of the United 
Order, which is only a counterpart of the great law of eternal salvation, 
which does not mean that every man shall share alike in amount, but 
only, as we have already learned in this Conference, insofar as he earns 
through his faith and his works the right to participate in the blessings ? 
Not all shall enjoy the celestial glory, but those only who earn that priv- 
ilege. 

And so it comes right back to us, are we worthy, are we worthy to 
enjoy the blessings the Lord has promised? It seems to me that there 
is something more than to feed men and women bread. Oh, how many 
are there who are dying, slowly dying, spiritually, for want of spiritual 
food. We cannot help them by ridicule. We know ridicule and abuse 
are the methods of hell. The Gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that we 
shall love one another, and how many of us who hold the priesthood really 
love our neighbor ? How many of us are trying to feed those who are 
hungering for the Gospel ? If we could only touch the spark of life and 
cause it to burn within their souls, we should have no further concern, 
for the Gospel teaches men to do good. The testimony of the Gospel 
leads into the path of truth and righteousness and there is no greater 
work that we can do during this time of depression than to take ad- 
vantage of this forced condition of humility in which we find ourselves 
and go forth to carry the Gospel message to those who are hungering, 
dying spiritually, for lack of spiritual food. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters, may his Spirit be 
upon us, that we may carry his Gospel message to those who are careless 
and indifferent, who because of careless habits have lost the spirit and 
are wandering in darkness. Let us give them a helping hand and lead 
them into the light, that we may be blessed eternally, is my prayer, which 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

It is a wonderful privilege to be a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and to enjoy the fellowship of men and 
women whose standards of life are noble and uplifting. I appreciate 
the opportunity I have to live in this choice land of Zion and be guided 
and directed by the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and 
by the revelations given to the prophets of these latter days. I am 
thankful I have faith in the immortality of the soul, in divine revela- 
tion, in the restoration of the Gospel and in the blessings of the holy 
priesthood. In this Conference we have listened to words of inspira- 
tion, encouragement and helpfulness, which help prepare us for the bat- 
tle of life and give us a greater desire to continue in this work in which 
the Lord has called us to labor. 

Marvelous changes have taken place in the last thirty years because 
of the development of the automobile, the radio, motion pictures and 
sound pictures. Not only have amusements and recreation changed the 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 109 

general attitude toward life, ibut modern commercial life has also af- 
fected us. We are still suffering from the effects of the World war, 
which has changed some of our ideals and habits. I feel that these 
changes have had a serious effect upon the attitude of the Latter-day 
Saints, particularly toward the Lord's day of rest. Our own exacting 
requirements have made it necessary for railways, street cars, and other 
forms of transportation to be carried on even on the Lord's day. 

I have been thinking concerning the Lord's day, mentioned briefly 
by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, and I wish to call attention at this time 
to the important commandments of the Lord which he has given to his 
people in the past and in the present day concerning his day of rest. 
Let us briefly remind ourselves what the Lord requires of us. 

While the Children of Israel were traveling in Sinai preparing to 
enter the Promised Land, an incident of great importance took place. 
Moses was commanded to prepare the people to behold the face of God. 
They gathered around Mount Sinai, but when the ground shook and 
the mountain rocked and was covered with smoke and fire, the people 
were afraid and said unto Moses, "Speak thou with us, and we will 
hear : but let not God speak with us, lest we die." Then the Lord spake 
unto Moses, giving him the decalogue, or the Ten Commandments. 
Among those commandments is one that refers to the Sabbath day, as 
follows : 

"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work : 

"But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt 
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy 
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates : 

"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in 
them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, 
and hallowed it." 

The Lord required the seventh day as a day of rest. It was to be 
holy unto the Lord. Even in the daily collection of manna, a double 
portion fell on the sixth day, the day before the Sabbath, so there would 
be no necessity for gathering food on the seventh day. Not only was 
it a day of rest, but the Lord said that the Children of Israel should 
observe that day and sanctify it. The observance of the Sabbath day 
was a distinctive badge of membership in the Hebrew community. No 
law given to the Hebrew people was more strictly observed. 

In the days of the Savior the Jews had made so many restrictions 
concerning the Sabbath day that the Master himself stated, "The Sab- 
bath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." The Jews 
looked upon the observance of that day as a covenant, as indicated in 
the word of the Lord to Moses, contained in Exodus 31, verses 13, 16 
and 17, as follows: 

"Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye 
shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; 
that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. . . . 

"Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the 
sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever : for in six days 
the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was 
refreshed." 

In commemoration of the resurrection of our Redeemer and the 
fact that he appeared to his disciples and others on the first day of the 
week, this day was observed by the early Christians as a day of rest, 
which was known as the Lord's day. 

To us the first day of the week is the Lord's day. The Lord has not 
left his people in doubt as to the use and purpose of his day. On Sun- 
day, the 7th day of August, 1831, a few days after the land of Zion had 
been dedicated for the gathering of his people, there was given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith a revelation known as Section 59 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, part of which is as follows : 

"Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land 
with an eye single to my glory, according to my commandments. . . . 

"Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even 
that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 

"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy 
day; 

"For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to 
pay thy devotions unto the Most High ; 

"Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and 
at all times ; 

But remember that on this the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations 
and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, 
and before the Lord. 

And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be pre- 
pared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, 
that thy joy may be full." 

This is the way the Lord intends the Latter-day Saints to observe 
the Lord's day. He intends that we shall cease from our labors and pay 
our devotions to the Most High, live restfully and quietly during the 
day, and attend the house of worship and offer up our sacraments to 
our Father in heaven. It is obligatory upon every Latter-day Saint to 
observe this day both in its spirit and meaning. 

President Brigham Young in his day called attention to better ob- 
servance of the Lord's day. He said : 

"All Latter-day Saints should observe the Sabbath by resting from all labor, 
except those who must be detained to take care of children or perform some 
work of mercy. Now, remember those who go skating, buggy riding, or on ex- 
cursions on the Sabbath day are weak in the faith and gradually, little by little, 
the spirit of their religion leaks out of their hearts and their affections. When I 
see a man gathering in his crops, or cattle, or making repairs on the Lord's day, 
I count him weak in the faith. At least he has lost the spirit of his religion. We 
should devote our time as the Church requires it on the Lord's day, for the ex- 
press purpose of renewing our mental and physical powers and getting our spirit- 
ual food." 

President Joseph F. Smith frequently called attention to the lax 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 111 

observance of the Sabbath day among the Latter-day Saints, and spoke 
as follows : 

"Men are not resting from their labors when they plow, plant, dig or do 
work of any kind. Men are not resting when they work around the house all 
day doing odd jobs. Men are not honoring the Lord when they go to places of 
amusement. Men are not honoring the Lord when they loiter around ice cream 
places, go to ball games and witness these games. It is a reflection on any 
Latter-day Saint to patronize a ball game on the Lord's day." 

Quite recently President Heber J. Grant and his counselors, not- 
ing the trend among the Latter-day Saints, made the following appeal : 

"The Lord's day is a holy day — not a holiday. It has been set apart as a day 
of rest and worship. A sacred Sabbath begets reverence for God. It is not 
pleasing in his sight that the day be given over to pleasure-seeking in places of 
amusement or elsewhere. Sunday schools and meetings have been so arranged as 
to meet the convenience of the people and leave a considerable portion of the 
Sabbath day without Church appointments. We earnestly appeal to the people 
to keep their meeting appointments faithfully and to utilize that portion of Sun- 
day not appointed for meetings in promoting family association in the home, with 
the purpose of stimulating and establishing greater home fealty, a closer com- 
panionship among parents and children, and more intimate relations among all 
kindred. We believe that it is unnecessary for families to go beyond their homes 
or those of their kindred for the relaxation and association which are proper for 
the Sabbath day, and we therefore discourage more traveling than is necessary 
for this purpose and attendance upon appointed meetings. Let all unnecessary 
labor be suspended and let no encouragement be given by the attendance of mem- 
bers of the Church at places of amusement and recreation on the Sabbath day. 
If Sunday is spent in our meetings and in our homes, great blessings will come 
to our families and communities." 

No person can disregard the Lord's day without suffering serious 
spiritual consequences. If we neglect to observe it, we shall become 
sick spiritually. The Sabbath-breaker will lose faith in this great work, 
for faith can only be developed by service and obedience to the com- 
mandments of the Lord. The Lord is not pleased with Latter-day Saints 
who attend Sunday shows, Sunday ball games, who play golf on Sun- 
day, go on canyon trips, or visit places of amusement ; .nor is he pleased 
with those who do unnecessary labor on the Lord's day. 

When we observe the Lord's day and carry out the spirit of the 
instructions of the Lord, as I have quoted in Section 59 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, we shall grow in spiritual power and usefulness, great 
faith will come into our souls, and our minds and bodies will become 
rested. This observance will have a refining influence in our homes 
and on our families. Sabbath observance will teach our children the 
great lessons of obedience they so much need. 

The commandment to keep the Lord's day holy is always binding 
upon the Lord's people. Let us get in harmony with the word of the 
Lord concerning the proper observance of his day and make it a day 
of rest and devotion to the Most High. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "High 
on the mountain tops." 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 
Dear Brethren, Sisters, and Listeners : 

INDIVIDUAL REVELATION 

Recently I was asked if I thought the Lord would not have some- 
thing to say to the people of the Church at this Conference, of course 
through his prophets. "If there was ever a time when divine revela- 
tion was needed, it is now," my questioner remarked. Apparently he 
did not have in mind one of our fundamental doctrines relative to rev- 
elation. It was stated by President Joseph F. Smith in these words : 

"The spirit of inspiration, the gift of revelation, does not belong to one man 
solely; it is not a gift that pertains to the Presidency of the Church and the 
Twelve Apostles alone. It is not confined to the presiding authorities of the 
Church ; * * * and it is the right and privilege of every man, every woman, and 
every child who has reached the years of accountability, to enjoy the spirit of 
revelation. * * * It is the privilege of every individual member of the Church to 
have revelation for his own guidance, for the direction of his life and conduct — " 
(Gospel Doctrine, page 42). 

In further explanation, President Smith said, 

"Every individual in the Church has the right to enjoy the spirit of revela- 
tion — for his own good — to exercise these gifts and these privileges in the conduct 
of his own affairs, in bringing up his children in the way they should go, and in 
the management of his farm, his flocks, his herds and the management of his 
business" (Gospel Doctrine, page 43). 

These truths relative to revelation are generally understood by the 
Latter-day Saints but they are also sometimes forgotten. Is it not 
greatly encouraging, however, to know that we may get light and wis- 
dom from God our Father to guide us aright in solving our individual 
problems and to help us in our private affairs ? If we can be so fortu- 
nate as to have wisdom enough to manage well our personal affairs and 
to carry acceptably our particular responsibilities, why should we worry 
about revelations to the Church? 

REVELATION TO THE CHURCH 

Respecting this type of revelation, President Smith said on another 
occasion : 

"So far as I know there is not an ordinance of the Church now enjoyed or 
practiced that was not revealed to the Church by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
know of no new doctrine that has been revealed. Principles that were revealed to 
the Prophet Joseph have grown and developed more fully and clearly to the un- 
derstanding; but we have received nothing new that I know of." (Gospel Doc- 
trine, page 43). 

But on another occasion in speaking on this same subject, President 
Smith said : 

"There is a great deal that has been revealed that has not yet been lived up 
to, I assure you. There is a great deal yet remaining to be learned. * * * There 
is a great deal that has been revealed through the Prophet Joseph and his 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 113 

associates that the people have not yet received in their hearts, and have not 
yet become converted to as they should. When we obey and are capable of 
observing the precepts of the Gospel and the laws of God and the requirements 
of heaven, which have already been revealed, * * * then there are other things 
still greater yet to be revealed to the people of God." (Gospel Doctrine, page 44.) 

Weak as we are, disobedient as we are, hard hearted and stubborn 
as we are, I wonder if it would not be more becoming of us to fear new 
revelation than to desire it. Of course we believe "God will yet reveal 
many great and important things pertaining to" his kingdom. But I fear 
that we are not yet ready for or worthy of the revelation of these things. 
What do you think about it ? . 

But of course we do believe in continuous revelation, in the doc- 
trine that God lives and that he reveals his will to worthy individuals 
who believe in him and who obey his commandments. Especially do we 
believe that God makes known his mind and will concerning the Church, 
its membership and the world generally through his prophet, the Presi- 
dent of the Church. At this point let me illustrate my meaning by an 
example. 

CHRISTMAS GREETINGS QUOTED 

In the Christmas edition of the Deseret News, December 19, 1931, 
the First Presidency of the Church published their "Christmas Greet- 
ings." May I read some excerpts from these Greetings? 

"With the coming of Christmastide and the dawning of a new year, we are 
confronted with a bankrupt world — a world in which the nations, as well as 
individuals, find themselves fettered with the bonds of debt. A universal de- 
pression exists, the like of which has never before prevailed under similar 
conditions. 

"With banks overburdened with money, thousands of honest toilers are 
unable to pay the grocer. With elevators bursting with wheat, industrial workers 
are without bread. With warehouses over-stocked with sugar which cannot be 
sold, children cry for the sweets which they so much crave but cannot procure." 

And the Greetings continue : 

"The prophet Isaiah, referring to the age in which we live, tells us that a 
time of tribulation will come from which none shall escape. He says : 'It shall 
be, as with the people, so with the priest ; as with the servant, so with the master ; 
as with the maid, so with her mistress ; as with the buyer, so with the seller ; 
as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with 
the giver of usury to him.'." 

And then the Greetings continue with these cheering words: 

"Notwithstanding the confusion which at the present prevails in this world 
of ours, we have much to be thankful for, and we can look (confidently to 
brighter days." 

But what are the conditions ? They are clearly stated in the Greet- 
ings as follows : 

"If the people of the world will turn to God, and acknowledge His Son, our 
Redeemer; if each citizen of our country will put away selfishness, strife and 
bitterness; if men who enact our laws will be governed by the necessities of all 
of the people, and not of a favored few; if every citizen will pledge himself to 
rigidly observe the laws, and uphold the men Who frame and execute them — " 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Then what will happen if these conditions are all fulfilled ? Listen, I beg 
of you, to the glorious promises of the Greetings : 

"The sun pi (prosperity will shine again, and peace and plenty will prevail 
from the rivers to the ends of the earth." 

But what if these conditions are not fulfilled and we continue as we 
have been doing? I reply in the language of the Greetings: 

"If the extravagant expenditure of money by our government, our states, our 
counties, and municipalities, and citizens, as it has prevailed during the past few 
years, is to continue; if heavier burdens of taxation are to be saddled upon the 
people; if murders, robberies, racketeering, tha appointment or election of dis- 
honest men to office, and other violations of the law are to go unpunished — " 

Then what will be the consequences ? Hear, I pray you, these fate- 
ful words of the Greetings: 

"Chaos must be our inevitable heritage." 

To all of you who are looking for or desire the word of the Lord 
applied to the conditions of this very hour, I most earnestly commend 
these Greetings. And may I remind you that the document, part of 
which I have just read, was signed by the Presidency of this Church, 
Heber J. Grant and Anthony W. Ivins, who are mouthpieces of God to 
this people. And do not forget, I beg of you, that President Grant 
holds all the keys, authority, rights and, powers of the holy priesthood 
that were ever given to any man that lived upon the earth. 

And so to me these Greetings are an expression of God's will to us, 
to the world. They are in very deed a revelation of his will to the 
Church, as authoritative and as scriptural as any passages in the Holy 
Bible. Extravagant claims, do you say? Well, they state my deep and 
honest convictions relative to this point. 

HOW TO WIN THE FAVOR OF THE LORD 

And what must we do to win God's favor in order that "the sun 
of prosperity shall shine again," a desideratum for which all the world 
is longing? Let us read the document over and over until the condi- 
tions are unforgettably impressed upon our memories. Briefly para- 
phrased, we must observe the two great commandments and make the 
Golden Rule the actual motto of our lives. 

CAUSES OF DEPRESSION 

Why are we, the country, the world, in our present fix? Because 
we have forgotten and disobeyed our Creator and God. The words in 
the Greetings are my scriptural authority for this declaration. My 
thinking leads me irresistibly to the conclusions expressed in the docu- 
ment. 

In this "depression" the people as a whole are perhaps not unjustly 
suffering. We live in a world governed by law. There are so-called 
natural laws — divine laws — as well as human laws. A violation of law 
entails, in justice, a recompense. Hence, we suffer, in general, not be- 
cause God whimsically afflicts us, but because of violation of some kind 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 115 

of law or laws. The idea I have in mind is related to the declaration 
in Section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 20-21. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this 
world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is iby obedience to that 
law upon which it is predicated." 

It follows, of course, that if we violate law we shall have to suffer 
the consequences. Justice requires this. 

We live in a world of plenty — there is plenty of food, plenty of 
clothing and shelter or the means of making them ; yet there are millions 
of God's children who are hungry, ragged, and cold at this very moment. 
And why ? Many reasons can be given, but in the last analysis, they are 
reducible to one— selfishness. And through his servants, the Lord lays 
down as one condition for the return of prosperity the elimination of 
selfishness in our inter-relations. 

Of the many "cures" for the "depression" that I have read, except 
the one just quoted, not one is based upon unselfishness. In fact, selfish- 
ness appears to be the most prominent characteristic of most of these 
"cures" and for that reason none of them will "cure." God's inspired 
servants have made this plain, and reason, too, tells the thoughtful that 
they are right. 

UNSELFISHNESS THE CURE 

The return of peace, happiness, and prosperity to all the people 
demands a basis of stability. But this can never be until all who are 
able to work have work to do, until there is a job for everyone. And a 
workable plan that will provide a job for everyone at a living wage, 
must have unselfishness as its outstanding characteristic. I can find no 
logical escape from this conclusion. And so far as I can see, no work- 
able plan can go into effect until our political, financial, economic, in- 
dustrial and labor leaders get together around a council table and agree. 
If this is true, why do they not do it? Selfishness is the answer. And 
selfishness will always be a controlling factor until the two great com- 
mandments are dominant in the minds and hearts of men. We demand 
that the federal government reduce expenses and balance the budget. 
And have you observed that every proposition made in Washington to 
reduce federal expenses in Utah meets with our violent protest? We 
wish the government to reduce expenses elsewhere but to increase them 
in Utah. Why? Is not selfishness the answer? 

And we want the budget balanced. This means the government 
must raise more money. How? The only way seems to be by some 
form of increased taxation, but we protest every suggestion to increase 
our taxes. Apparently we are far, very far, from a willingness to live 
the "Golden Rule." We are willing for the other fellow to be taxed, 
but protest being taxed ourselves. 

BANK FAILURES 

Let me give you another illustration, a delicate one I admit. There 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

have been many bank failures in this intermountain country during the 
past year. The closing was due in most cases, probably, to a "run on 
the bank." Now of course when we think a little about the matter it is 
clear that no bank can immediately give back to depositors all their 
money. Some of it is always loaned out on time accounts, and borrowers 
are not able to pay on demand. Hence if all the depositors make a run 
on a bank they will inevitably force it to close. Now what causes a run ? 
Selfishness, of course. If the bank is in distress, let the other fellow 
lose. I want my money and so rush after it, hoping to beat the other 
fellow to the bank, if in this matter all depositors were to live the 
Golden Rule there would be few, if any, losers and few, if any, bank 
closings. This is a self-evident fact. 

THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT 

Another illustration: Certain powerful interests in the United 
States are carrying on an intensive campaign, designed to nullify or 
eliminate the 18th amendment to the constitution of the United States. 
Vast amounts of money, it is said, are behind the active but deceptive 
propaganda to effect this result. And why do some people want the 
manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors again legalized? Once 
more I assert, selfishness is the dominating motive. Selfishness is at the 
bottom of all law violation, of depravity, and crime. And if selfishness 
shall continue as the ruling motive in human affairs, chaos will result. 
This is the conclusion of the Greetings. 

Some people are simple enough to believe that legalizing the manu- 
facture and sale of alcoholic liquors in the United States will bring back 
prosperity to the country. Are England and Germany prosperous ? As 
well say a man can lift himself by his boot straps. Can a country drink 
itself into prosperity by imbibing narcotic beverages? Reason stands 
aghast at such a proposition. And the fact that the governing board of 
a powerful local organization gives support to such an idea does not 
rob it of its absurdity. Further, 2.75 °fo beer cannot be made and sold 
in this country without violation of the 18th amendment, because 2.75% 
beer is intoxicating, a fact unquestionably established by scientific in- 
vestigations. (See How to Live, p. 366.) 

THE LORD'S WAY BEST 

Now the sooner we believe the Lord's way is the best way, the 
better it will be for us, the country and the world. It is not only the 
best way, it is the only way to secure permanent prosperity. If we do 
not accept this truth and act accordingly we shall continue to suffer, for 
the Lord will not be mocked. His prophets have spoken. 

May the Lord give us eyes to see, hearts to feel, minds to under- 
stand and wills to do, so that the clouds of adversity shall roll away, the 
sun of prosperity shall shine again, and peace and plenty shall prevail 
"from the rivers to the ends of the earth," I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Literary Digest of April 2nd, 1932, contains the following 
3.rticlc • ' 

"THE DRUNKARD DISAPPEARING" 

"The tremendous army of the -unemployed and down-and-outers seeking 
aid from the Salvation Army is almost entirely drink-free, and poverty from 
drink is a negligible factor in the current depression. 

"This is the testimony of Col. 'George H. Davis, in charge of the Salvation 
Army forces at Chicago, who backs up his opinion by the experience of his 
organization with more than a million cases of hard luck and poverty in the 
past few months. i 

"Colonel Davis' statement was made to the Illinois Conference of Organiza- 
tions Supporting the Eighteenth Amendment. It is offered by the W. C. T. U. in 
opposing the group now fighting Prohibition. 

"As it is issued by the Salvation Army, Colonel Davis's statement is, in part, 
as 'follows : \ 

" 'Out of more than a million cases we have dealt with in the last sixteen 
months, there were only seventy-five bad cases of drink, and of moderate cases, 
only 500. 

" 'From October 11, 1930, to February 3, 1932, we helped 1,102,545 unemployed 
men. Of this number ,we found 99.92 per cent drink free. Having nothing to 
do, many of these men would have drunk to excess if they could get the liquor. 

" 'I did not realize the small percentage of drinking men that (pass through 
our doors until I personally checked it up. 

" 'The number of iwomen coming to our doors with a tale of being ruined 
Iby drink is less than 1 per tent of the entire number, whereas in former days 
it was a considerable proportion. i 

" 'In our family welfare relief work in these days we seldom find need 
arising from strong drink on the jpart of one or other of the parents, whereas 
in the old days it was 90 out of 100 cases. In fact, poverty from drink has 
almost disappeared. I 

" 'The old-time drunkard, the wets of the country notwithstanding, is gone. 

" 'Before Prohibition the Salvation Army would gather drunks by the 
truckload and busload ,from the saloons and park benches. Today one would 
have to search high and low in every American city to find at one time 100 
men and women of the type the Salvation Army ( used to gather by the thousands 
under the rule of John Barleycorn.' 

"This agrees with the experience of Commander Evangeline Booth. As 
noted in these pages May 17, 1930, she said that before Prohibition the Salvation 
Army in New York .would collect 1,200 to 1,300 drunkards in a night, whereas 
Prohibition immediately reduced the number to 400." 

PROHIBITION MEETING TO BE HELD IN TABERNACLE 

There will be held in this building next Thursday evening a Pro- 
hibition meeting, and the speaker will be Dr. Daniel A. Poling, a man 
of great renown. The meeting will commence at 7:30. 

I have heard Dr. Poling speak, and can assure you that he is one 
of the best speakers for Prohibition that I have heard. He was one 
of the speakers of the "Flying Squadron" that was started by the late 
Governor Frank Hanly of Indiana, than whom no more eloquent, 
magnificent defender of Prohibition and fighter against whiskey have 
I had the privilege of listening to. I hope that this audience is an 
indication of what we will have here next Thursday night. I would 
be delighted if it could be said that the greatest audience Daniel A. 
Poling ever faced was in the Mormon Tabernacle. It would give me 
great joy. 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I told Elder Charles H. Hart that I was going to steal his time 
today. It is the first time during my presidency that I have failed to 
ask all of the General Authorities to speak; but it being so near my 
birthday and wanting to throw bouquets at myself and talk about 
myself, and so on, I feel a little selfish. So I decided to take part 
of the remaining thirty minutes to read announcements, to present 
the Authorities of the Church, and to do the bouquet throwing. 

VACANCIES NOT TO BE FILLED AT THIS CONFERENCE 

I expect there will be considerable comment when I present 
the General Authorities, seeing that we are not going to fill the vacancy 
in the First Presidency nor call a man to succeed Brother Hyrum G. 
Smith as Presiding Patriarch. Some will say : Did you ever hear of 
such a thing? Yes, way back in 1880, fifty-two years ago next October, 
there was a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that lasted for two 
years ; then Brother Orson Pratt died, making two vacancies that lasted 
a little over a year. When President Brigham Young died there was 
no First Presidency for three or four years, and when President John 
Taylor died there was no First Presidency for several years. So this 
is not so new after all.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, 
and saying, 

"Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 

"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all ithy mind. 

"This is the first and great commandment. 

"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 

"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." 

I endorse very heartily indeed the remarks made here by the last 
speaker. It shows a remarkable lack of love of our neighbor for 
Latter-day Saints, some of them holding high positions in the Church, 
to rush and get their money out of a bank in which the Church owns 
fifty per cent of the stock. It shows wonderful lack of loyalty, to say 
the least. ; 

DENOUNCES FALSEHOODS 

I remarked here the day before yesterday that the New Era came 
to my desk and found lodgment in the waste basket. Lo and behold, 
another New Era came to me, not only containing the same things 
as the one that landed in the waste basket, but also an open letter from 
a gentleman who had approached a man and tried to persuade him to 
certify to the fact that he was a go-between between me and a girl in 
Liverpool to propose marriage, which would have been certifying to an 
absolute falsehood. 

Jesse B. Stone is the man who sent me this New Era. I have a letter 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 121 

from the man whom Stone tried to get to sign this falsehood and he says 
that he informed Stone there was not a word of truth in the story. The 
lady that I am supposed to have been married to tried to come up here on 
the stand the other day. She has been in the insane asylum, and I think 
she was there before our friend Stone interviewed her at all. 

Now when the second New Era arrived I decided to read at least 
the headlines and then throw it into the waste basket, but after I read the 
headlines I decided to read part of the contents. 

"A rift in Commercial Mormonism." There is no commercial 
Mormonism and never has been. The Mormon Church upon many 
occasions has reached out its hand to help industries for the benefit of 
the people. There is no commercialism in that. This is something in 
the nature of a father, figuratively speaking, trying to help his children. 

"The beginning of the end." "One bank closes its doors and 
another commences to totter." 

I consider that an absolute falsehood pure and simple. With the 
help that can now be secured from the Reconstruction Corporation 
under the government there is no necessity for any bank whatever with 
its capital unimpaired, closing its doors. I do not know, but I think 
I shall ask an attorney if there is no law that will deal with a man 
and send him to the penitentiary who circulates falsehoods which might 
cause the failure of a bank. Of course the other bank that is to close 
it's doors, judging from this article, is undoubtedly meant to be Zion's 
Savings Bank. 

"In spite of all denials evidence shows that plural marriage is 
taught by the Authorities." In spite of all falsehoods by liars — I 
thought I wouldn't use that word, but really a liar is a liar, and perhaps 
once in a while it is wise to say sol — in spite of every document printed, 
in spite of every statement to the contrary by any person on the face 
of the earth, the Authorities of this Church under the administration of 
Heber J. Grant as President, have never taught, have never encouraged, 
have never sustained any human being in entering pretended plural mar- 
riage. All these statements are pure and simple falsehoods. You all know 
that we have cut a great many people off the Church for entering into 
pretended plural marriage. I have had a letter from one who was 
excommunicated in which he wanted to know when the time would 
come when we would stop treating the best blood of the Church that 
way, namely, by cutting them off the Church. I answered : When people 
quit going into adultery, so to speak, and calling it celestial marriage, 
maybe it will stop, so far as they are concerned. 

I pledge myself here if any person will bring to us the evidence 
that any man or any woman belonging to this Church has entered into 
pretended plural marriage, that we will cut them off the Church. 

"When the Deseret Savings Bank, fostered by the leaders of the 
Church"! — a falsehood. It was not fostered by the leaders of the Church 
■ — "and prominent members thereof whose financial ability was not 
questioned, closed its doors during February and that Zion's Savings 
Bank was harassed by depositors withdrawing funds until it was almost 
'bled white' a situation was created, which brought home the realiza- 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

tion that security of financial institutions functioning by means of 
Church funds are not as iron clad as certain quarters endeavor to make 
the commoner, not informed as to the real situation, believe they are." 

Zion's Savings Bank was not "bled white." The bank was open 
until nine o'clock at night during the run and would have kept open 
just as long as anybody wanted to come and get his money. 

"To save the Zion's Bank from closing its doors, the President of 
the Church was forced to rush two million dollars into its vaults, money 
which he had secured from a financial concern in the east for the 
purpose of financing the beet crop of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, 
and enable it to function another season, information which proceeds 
from a most reliable source." 

Heber J. Grant did not borrow a dollar in the East. Heber J. 
Grant did not know that Zion's Bank was in distress ; he did not know 
there had been a run on the bank until he reached home; and Heber 
J. Grant did not go east to borrow money to finance the crop of the 
Sugar Company, because the Sugar Company financed its own crop and 
paid all of the people who had raised beets before there was a run on 
Zion's Savings Bank. The "reliable source" reminds me of what 
Josh Billings says: "Never judge a man by his relatives, he can't 
help them, they are crowded on him, but judge him by the company 
he keeps," and the reliable company from which this man gets his 
information is one of the crowd of falsifiers. I would like to use the 
other word. It is shorter and more emphatic, but I think I will let it 
go at falsifiers. 

I did intend to comment on |a full half column, but I really think 
it is a waste of breath. 

FAVORS LAW PROTECTING SAVINGS BANKS 

I want to endorse what Brother Merrill said. I hope some day 
to see {a law passed, and I have held this opinion ever since the year 
1893 — nearly forty yearsi — that no savings bank should ever be per- 
mitted by law to pay any depositor a dollar on his deposits except when 
it became due after proper notice. I do not think people should be 
permitted to put their money in a savings bank, and then rush and get 
it, when they know as (well as they know they live if everybody else 
like themselves had heart failure, financially speaking, no savings bank 
on earth could exist, because a bank cannot pay interest for money 
and then keep it in (vaults waiting for somebody to come and get it. 
I am sure even if there were such a law that any depositor would be 
given his money if he actually needed it. 

PERSONAL LOSSES 

I might incidentally remark that I owned $37,500 of stock in Zion's 
Savings Bank way back in d.893, which cost me $75,000, and Zion's 
Savings Bank was "bled white" figuratively speaking in 1893, because 
of the loss of confidence by the people who drew out their money; 
and I lost every dollar of my stock. I lost that stock at $140.00 a share 
and I had paid $200.00 for it. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 123 

I thank the Lord for men like the late Isaac Barton who would 
not draw a dollar out of the State Bank during the run of 1893. I 
had thirty thousand dollars stock in the State Bank of Utah, and it 
was paid ior, but I was borrowing money on Zion's Savings Bank 
and State Bank stocks in New York, with George Q. Cannon, Joseph 
F. Smith, John Henry Smith, Francis |M. Lyman; Thomas R. Cutler 
and other loyal men, with which to build the first beet sugar factory 
ever built with American machinery in the United States. I lost 
$62,000, President Cannon eighty-odd thousand, Presidents Joseph F. 
Smith and John Henry Smith and Francis M. Lyman twenty thousand 
dollars apiece. (We all lost our bank stocks with the exception of 
Brother Cannon. I was very glad that he was able to buy the stocks 
that we had to sell, his share of them at least, and did not eventually 
lose anything, but got the benefit of their subsequent growth. 

; LATTER-DAY SAINTS FULFILLING THE LAW 

So far as these liars are concerned — they claim that Brother 
Ballard taught a woman plural marriage. It is a falsehood. This 
man goes on reiterating again that John A. Widtsoe has a plural wife — 
one more falsehood. There are so many of them that it is really a waste 
of time to refer to them. But let me say to> these falsifiers that the 
work of the Lord is onward and upward. It is progressing and the 
majority of the Latter-day Saints are fulfilling the law that I have 
read here, namely, that their first allegiance is to God, and second, the 
love of their fellow men. There is no question about it in my mind. 

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE VISION 

I endorse the necessity of living the laws of the Gospel. I rejoice 
in the Gospel. 'I am inclined to think that damnation is more or less 
in the nature of condemnation. The Gospel, according to the vision 
given to (Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, is as follows : 

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the .voice out of the heavens 
bore record unto us — 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and 
to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from 
all unrighteousness; 

"That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his 
power and made by him ; 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except 
those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him." 

They are few and far between — very few. ' ' 

Again I rejoice that we are fundamentalists: 
"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, .which ,we give of him: That he lives!" — speaking of 
the Savior. 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

I see that I have occupied Brother Hart's time and my own too. 
I rejoice in the wonderful attendance we have had at this conference, 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

in the faith manifested ,by the Saints, and in the most remarkable and 
splendid attendance that we had at our general priesthood meeting, 
the largest we have ever had at one of those meetings. 

CHARITY TOWARD ALL 

There is one more thing that I want to say : In preaching on the 
Word of iWisdom, or preaching about cards, or preaching about any- 
thing else along the line of the teachings of the Authorities of the 
Church, if anybody preaches without charity he is not preaching accord- 
ing to the laws of the Gospel. We have the following statement in the 
121st section of the Doctrine and (Covenants : 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. * * * 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 

priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, 

and by love unfeigned ; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 

without hypocrisy, and without guile — " 

Something else however — 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost ; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom 
thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy." 

I am naturally emphatic in my talk, and I want to say to all of 
our young Ipeople that I hope they will never get the impression that 
because they fail to live up to the Word of Wisdom and other teachings 
of this Church there is any hatred in my heart towards them. I try 
to even love my enemies, to say nothing about the sons and the daughters 
of men and women who would readily give their lives for this cause. 
There is no jsection in all the iDoctrine and Covenants from which 
I have quoted 'more often and that I have tried to live up to more 
perfectly than section one hundred and twenty-one, that wonderful 
revelation given to the Prophet of God while he was in Liberty Jail. 

God bless you one and all, is my prayer, and I do bless you by the 
authority of the priesthood of the living iGod that I hold and in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Choir sang the anthem, "Great is Jehovah, the Lord," solo 
part by Sister Margaret S. Hewlett. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Henry A. Gardner, presi- 
dent of the Palmyra Stake. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

Prof. Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing of the Choir and 
Congregation at the Conference meetings. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played 
by Edward P. Kimball and Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

An Introduction to the Study of 
the Book of Mormon 

By J. M. SJODAHL 

To be mighty interesting and illuminating 

"Some of the contents of the book has appeared in the IMPROVEMENT 
ERA and other Church publications during! the last ten years, and friends 
have been good enough to say, repeatedly, that they would be glad to have 
those contributions in some form more convenient for reference. Acting 
on their suggestion, I have collected some papers previously published and 
others that now appear for the first time, and respectfully submit them in 
this form to the public. In doing so, it is my sincere prayer that the testi- 
mony here offered may be of benefit to the reader, and especially to honest 
seekers after the truth."

A veritable epic of empire-building 

The Lite Story oi 
Brigham Young 

By SUSA YOUNG GATES AND LEAH D. WIDTSOE 
WITH A FOREWORD BY HONORABLE REED SMOOT 

"This book presents the life story of a New England cabinet-maker, 
who, well into his thirties, entered upon a career that made him an empire- 
builder of the West; the founder of a hundred cities; the governor of one 
of the territories of the United States; and one of the outstanding figures 
of the nineteenth century." 

Thus does Senator Smoot begin his enthusiastic foreword to this notable 
biography. "A graphic, gripping story," he terms it, and every reader 
undoubtedly will agree with his definition of this life of the indefatigable, 
indomitable Brigham Young, which was written by one of his daughters 
and her daughter. The entire record of the great Mormon leader is un- 
folded from his birth in a little Vermont town to his death at the age of 
seventy-seven as bead of the church, the success of which was due to his 
courageous and arduous leadership. 

A Special Edition. Beautifully and Substantially Bound in Cloth.

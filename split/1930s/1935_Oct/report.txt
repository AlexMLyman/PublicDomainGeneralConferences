A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One— 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the Conference was held Friday morning, 
April 4, at 10.00 o'clock. 

When the time arrived for opening the Conference the large Taber- 
nacle auditorium and galleries were well filled with people. 

The music for this session was furnished by the Summit Stake 
Choir, under the direction of Sister Judith Anderson Beard. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the Choir would sing the 
hymn, "Lo, the mighty God appearing." 

After the singing of this hymn by the Choir, Elder A. Richard 
Peterson, President of the Emery Stake, offered the invocation. 

The Choir sang the hymn, "I'll praise my Maker while Pve breath." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice in again having the opportunity of meeting the Saints in 
general conference. I have always during the past 53 years enjoyed 
attending our annual and semi-annual conferences. It fell to my lot 53 
years ago this coming 16th of October to be chosen as one of the apostles 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have not the 
language at my command to express the gratitude of my heart for this 
great honor that came to me so long ago. I was not in the very best 
of health at the time, in fact, I have no hesitancy in saying that I am in 
far better health today, after the expiration of 53 years, than I enjoyed 
when that call came; I can with greater ease perform the duties that 
devolve upon me, and without the same fatigue. 

I recall that during the first two or three years of my administration 
as one of the apostles, quite frequently after preaching at a quarterly 
conference two or three times on a Sunday, I would lie awake all night 
because I was so nervous. I am grateful beyond expression for the 
vigor of body and mind that I possess today, and my gratitude goes 
out not only to my Father in heaven for the splendid health that I enjoy, 
but it goes out also to the people of the Latter-day Saints generally. I 
believe sincerely that because of the faith and prayers and good-will of 
the Saints my life has been extended and my health has been improved.

JOY IN LABORS 

I can truthfully say that during all of these years I have had great 
joy in my labors in traveling among the Latter-day Saints. There is a 
brotherhood and a love existing in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints 
for one another that I am sure no other people enjoy. When I con- 
template my reception as an inexperienced young man, not quite 26 
years of age, when called to this important office; when 1 remember 
the reverence and respect that were accorded to me wherever I went, 
notwithstanding my lack of knowledge and information, my heart goes 
out in gratitude to the people in all the stakes of Zion, and as the years 
have come and gone I have been thankful beyond expression that I have 
never found anything at home or abroad that has weakened my faith in 
the divinity of the work in which you and I are engaged. 

FINDS MANY EVIDENCES 

I am grateful on the other hand that as the years have come and 
gone I have been constantly finding additional evidences of the divinity 
of this work. There have been many things in my life, as I am sure 
there have been in the lives of you, one and all, that have been inexplic- 
able to me; that it has been difficult for me to understand and compre- 
hend. But I am a firm believer that faith is a gift of God, and I am 
grateful indeed for the gift of faith that has been with me. When I 
have not comprehended things I have had faith that some day they 
would be made plain to me. 

I remember that the first time I read the Doctrine and Covenants, 
section 19, about eternal punishment, and so on, that I wept for joy 
regarding the explanation therein given, that it does not claim that there 
is no end to punishment. 

I remember that it was always a remarkable statement to me that 
"every ear should hear." I could not understand how that could be 
possible, and yet I believed in it, I had faith in it and I accepted it 
without any doubt. Radio has demonstrated that every ear can hear. 
I have been grateful for the opportunity on two different occasions of 
having a worldwide broadcast of what I had to say. I wondered how it 
would be possible that "every eye should see." And yet I have seen 
and conversed with my daughter and my granddaughter when they were 
miles away from me at the time. They were in the laboratories and I 
near the foot of Broadway, New York; they were several miles 
distant, and great buildings were between us. We had no difficulty in 
seeing each other, no difficulty in conversing with each other. 

The one and only thing for you and me and for every Latter-day 
Saint to do is to keep the commandments of the Lord, and sooner or 
later those things that may have been inexplicable and have seemed im- 
possible will be demonstrated to us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FAITH IN BOOK OF MORMON 

I am grateful that as a young man I had faith in the Book of 
Mormon. When I was ridiculed for believing in that book, the person 
saying that he could point out to me two absolute falsehoods in it that 
could not be gainsaid, I told him to go ahead, that pointing them out 
did not affect my faith nor in the least degree lessen my reverence for 
and my belief in the Book of Mormon. I read it as a young man in my 
teens, prayerfully and humbly, and there came into my heart the perfect 
assurance that that book is just exactly what is purports to be. 

One of the two things that this person said were falsehoods was that 
there were dwellings built of cement in early days by the Nephites in 
Mexico, Central and South America, that such a thing as a cement dwell- 
ing had never been found, and "You know," he said, "that cement is 
not so destructible as brick or stone, and that if dwellings of cement had 
been built they would have been found long ago." 

I said: "That does not affect my faith at all. Hundreds and hun- 
dreds of years have passed since the Nephites were destroyed and there 
is an abundant tropical growth in that country. If they do not find any 
cement dwellings during my lifetime I am sure they will when the 
grandchildren come along, if not then they certainly will when the great 
grandchildren come." 

He said : "What is the use of talking to such a fool, who puts aside 
an argument that cannot be gainsaid, by referring it to his children, or 
grandchildren, or great grandchildren?" 

HISTORY BEARS OUT FACTS 

What is the subsequent history? Within a few miles from the City 
of Mexico, less than a hundred, if I remember correctly, there is a 
great monument, the outside of which was apparently covered with 
cement, and it is 150 per cent higher than this building in which we 
are assembled, and instead of being one hundred and odd feet by two 
hundred and odd feet, it is larger than this entire block, covering a space 
of eleven acres, and from the top of that monument one can see in the 
valley large mounds and as they are uncovered, lo and behold, they are 
discovered to be splendidly built houses, with cement covered walls and 
floor, showing a skill in the use of cement equal if not superior to that 
of today. 

VOICE HEARD THROUGHOUT LAND 

He said : "Well, I will give you an argument that you cannot extend 
the answer to your children, your grandchildren, or your great grand- 
children. That book teaches that Jesus Christ after his resurrection, 
came to this country and organized his church and that he spoke to the 
people, and his voice was heard all over the land. Now you know that 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

if you were to get up on top of a house and shout, your voice would 
carry only a few hundred feet. So you know that is a lie." 

I said : "I do not know any such thing. I know that Jesus Christ 
and others under the direction of God took the existing elements and 
created this earth, and I am a firm believer that if Jesus Christ knew 
how to create the earth on which we live he would know how to cause 
his voice to go all over the world at one and the same time." 

He said : "I do not care to argue with such a fool." 

THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH 

The radio has demonstrated that faith is a gift of God, and I am 
grateful that I had it. I have sat in my home and listened to Admiral 
Byrd talking from the South Pole, there being a little box in the corner 
that brought the message to me, and my heart has gone out in gratitude 
that as a young unmarried man my faith in the Book of Mormon could 
not be disturbed by the arguments of a young man who had his doctor's 
degree and had graduated from a university, and thought he had knocked 
me out completely with two of his arguments. 

Let us get faith as a people. Let us so order our lives that we are 
entitled to an increase of that faith. I am thankful that I know of no 
man or woman who ever joined this Church and attended his or her 
sacrament meetings, partaking of the sacrament in remembrance of the 
suffering of our Savior and his death ; who was honest and conscientious 
in the payment of his or her tithes ; who divided with the Lord as per- 
fectly as they would ask the Lord to divide with them if they were 
making up the account ; who have kept the Word of Wisdom — I have 
never known such an individual to lose his or her faith. But I have ■ 
seen men and women apostatize from the Church and almost without 
exception I have seen that apostasy come upon them gradually. 

IN LINE OF DUTY 

When you are in the line of your duty it is like standing in front 
of a line of posts, and every post is in line. But step one step aside, and 
every post looks as though it were not quite in line. The farther you get 
away from that straight line, the more crooked the posts will appear. It 
is the straight and narrow path of duty that will lead you and me back 
to the presence of God. I am thankful that from my youth until now 
such a thought as doubting the divinity of the mission of the Savior has 
never entered my head. 

Many times I have referred here to a book, one of the chapters of 
which is entitled "The Young Man and the Pulpit." The author of the 
book said that a certain individual with good opportunities for investiga- 
tion asked every young preacher whom he met during a summer vacation 
— they being ministers in the eastern and New England states — the 
question, "Do you believe that Christ was the Son of the living God, 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sent by him to save the world ; that Christ was God's very Son, with a 
divinely appointed and definite mission, dying on the cross and raised 
from the dead ? I am not asking whether you believe that he was inspired 
in the sense that the great moral teachers are inspired. No one has any 
doubt about that. But, yes or no, was he the Son of God, the Redeemer 
of the world?" 

I am grateful that every Latter-day Saint can answer yes to that 
question. We are all delighted that we have that knowledge. I am sorry 
that every one of those ministers failed to answer yes, and that the sum 
total of those answers was that he was the greatest moral teacher that 
ever lived. 

HIS FAITH HAS NOT BEEN SHAKEN 

I am thankful that it has fallen to my lot to meet many men not of 
our faith in my travels. Before I reached my twentieth year I worked 
for five years for people not of our faith. My business has been of 
such a character, representing insurance companies, one of them in 
Canada, one of them way off in New Zealand, one of them in France 
and some in Great Britain, and others in New York, San Francisco, 
Chicago and New Orleans, and I have come in contact with many men not 
of our faith. I do not remember having met in any of the offices of any 
of the companies I have represented or among the men who came to 
Salt Lake as traveling representatives or officers, anyone who belonged 
to our Church, but in all my contacts with these people not of my faith 
I have been grateful that nothing I have heard or read or come in con- 
tact with has in the slightest degree lessened my faith in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. On the contrary, in my contact with men, I have been 
finding evidences of the divinity of this work. 

I call to mind visiting with an assistant manager of that great cor- 
poration, the New York Life Insurance company in London. This man 
told me he had been connected with the British legation at Constantinople, 
that he had been in the Holy Land many years, that he had been in the 
United States and Canada many, many times. 

CONSTANTLY FINDING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCES 

He said : "Do you know, Mr. Grant, the last time I was in Canada 
I went up to the northern wilds, beyond all civilization, where I doubt 
that a white man had ever been before, among those heathen Indians., 
arid I found there the most inexplicable thing in all my life. I found 
' the exact duplicate of a Holy Land rug, the exact pattern and color 
that I have seen in Jerusalem, and, lo and behold, that rug was woven 
in little colored beads. How under heaven those people way up there, 
who had never heard of Jerusalem, could duplicate a Jerusalem rug 
perfectly, is beyond my comprehension." 

I said : "I will send you a copy of the Book of Mormon, in which 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



7 



you will find that the forefathers of the American Indians who came 
to this country before Columbus, came from Jerusalem." 

"Well, well," he said, "that explains the inexplicable." 

I am grateful that as I have read the creeds, the doctrines and ideas 
of other people and other churches I have never found anything that 
disturbed my faith. On the contrary, day by day, week by week, and 
year by year, I am continually finding additional evidences of the divine 
mission of the Savior and of the divinely appointed mission and labors of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am grateful indeed when I realize that be- 
fore the Church was organized wonderful revelations were given stating 
that the field was ripe already to harvest, and when I think of the wonder- 
ful harvest that was reaped in Hawaii by President George Q. Cannon, 
which country President Clark and myself and others recently visited. 
During the few years he was there he translated the Book of Mormon 
into the Hawaiian language, and he baptized over 3,000 natives. I have 
never been among a people that seemed to me to be more sincere, to have 
a greater love for each other and for the Gospel, and a greater reverence 
for those who hold places of honor in the Church of Christ than I met on 
our recent visit to Hawaii. 

GRATEFUL FOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

I am grateful for the temple that has been erected there, and for 
the interest of the people in temple work. I am grateful for the organi- 
zation of a stake of Zion there, which I believe will be of great spiritual 
benefit to the people. I am very thankful for the evidences that have 
come to me of the divinity of this work in which we are engaged. 

I am grateful when reflecting upon the fact that Wilford Woodruff 
baptized several thousand people, and that Orson Pratt did the same. 
Year by year additional evidences have come to me of the inspiration of 
the Lord and the truth of the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. There is absolutely nothing in the entire Doctrine and Cove- 
nants by way of commandment and exhortation for you and for me 
but what if we performed those things that the Lord desires us to do 
would be for our benefit. There is not a thing in them that would not be 
greatly to our advantage if we would do that which the Lord desires 
us to do. 

I have been requested time and time again — principally by anony- 
mous letters — '"For heaven's sake find a new subject, and quit preaching 
so much on the Word of Wisdom." 

NEED WORD OF WISDOM 

Never in all my life have I thought and believed and been convinced 
that the Latter-day Saints need so much the Word of Wisdom as they 
need it today. Why? Because the whole United States has discarded 
prohibition. They have gone back to liquor. This they have done 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



because the cry went out, "There is more drunkenness, there is more 
drinking of whisky under prohibition than there was before we had 
prohibition." 

Pardon me, but all of the advertisements of that kind were pure, 
unadulterated falsehoods. During prohibition I traveled up into Idaho 
quite frequently attending conferences. During all the years of prohi- 
bition I never saw a drunken man or woman while on those trips. I 
recently went up to Rexburg to dedicate a meeting house. When we 
reached Pocatello I had to change from the train to a bus to go to Idaho 
Falls, and at Idaho Falls I changed again. Two men on the bus were 
drunk. During the fifteen minutes that I waited in Idaho Falls I saw 
three more drunken men. Men and women by the dozens in this city 
have been seen standing around in front of one of the principal places 
where they dispense liquor, waiting for their chance to get their liquor. 
I have met drunken people in more than one place in Salt Lake City 
since we did away with prohibition. Millions upon millions of dollars of 
money were spent in propaganda which was based on falsehoods, to 
bring back whisky to the people. At a great national convention the 
people shouted, "Hurrah! Hurrah! We want our beer; we want our 
beer; we want our beer!" And they got it. Of course it does not 
intoxicate anybody legally, but they are very careful to keep the Indians 
from drinking any of it for fear they will become intoxicated. 

APPEALS FOR INFLUENCE 

Today I appeal to you, each and all, to use your influence at home 
and abroad, to get the people to keep the Word of Wisdom, and I am 
going to read it. It may be that it will be the fifty-third time in the 
past fifty-three years. I think that I have read it at least once a year, 
if not a half a dozen times. 

"A Word of Wisdom" — you know wisdom is almost the greatest 
thing in the world, second only to health, and this is wisdom from God, 
not from man. The wisdom of man is "beer, beer, beer." 

A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, 
assembled in Kirtland, and the Church, and also the saints in Zion — 
To be sent greeting ; not by commandment or constraint — 

I have heard many people say, "Brother Grant, it is not a com- 
mandment. That is how I get around it, and can have my tea and coffee." 

— Not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation — ■ 
Revelation from whom? Revelation from God Almighty. 

And the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God — 
It is the will of God that we take advantage of the Word of Wisdom. 

— In the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days — 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

AN ECONOMIC AID 

I believe that if every dollar of money that is expended in Utah 
for liquor and for beer, tea, coffee and tobacco, were saved, Utah would 
need no help from the United States government to take care of the 
poor, but that peace, prosperity, happiness and abundance would be given 
to the people of our fair state, and of every other state in the Union, if 
in addition we observed the suggestion by the Lord, which is a very 
wise one, that once a month we refrain from eating two meals, which 
would be physically beneficial to every living soul, and give the equiva- 
lent to help those who are poor. It would go far towards solving our 
financial problems. 

Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence or 
evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men 
in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto 
you this word of wisdom by revelation — ■ 

"evils AND designs" 

Evil and designs ! Men hired to certify that cigarets do not injure 
them and never have done, and I have been told that when you challenge 
some of them regarding these things they say, "Of course they never 
hurt me, because I have never used any of them." 

— In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the 
hearts of conspiring men in the last days— 

Don't you think it is evil and conspiring to publish pictures of beauti- 
ful women, using cigarets, knowing as they do that it destroys the very 
purpose of life ? We have been warned against these things. A billion 
is beyond my comprehension, and yet, if I am not mistaken, on an aver- 
age of 117,000,000,000 cigarets per year were used over a period of 
many years in the United States. A billion is the equivalent, if you 
figure it in dollars, to one dollar a minute for every minute from the birth 
of the Savior until the late World war. So, for a number of years the 
equivalent of 117 cigarets a minute has been consumed in the United 
States each year for every minute since the birth of the Savior. 

FURTHER COUNSEL FROM THE LORD 

That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, 
behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only_ in 
assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 

And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape Q,f the 
vine, of your own make. 

And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing 
of your bodies. 

And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be 
used with judgment and skill. 

And, again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

And, again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath 
ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man — 

Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season 
thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, 
have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving ; nevertheless they are 
to be used sparingly ; 

And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times 
of winter, or of cold, or famine. 

All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the 
staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the 
fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth ; 

And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger. 

All grain is good for the food of man ; as also the fruit of the vine ; 
that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground — ■ 

Nevertheless, wheat for man, corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, 
and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and 
barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain. 

GREAT BLESSINGS PROMISED 

Here is the all-important point in the entire revelation: 

And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel 
and marrow to their bones ; 

And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. 

Could there be a greater promise made to anyone than wisdom and 
life, and that the destroying angel shall not slay us? I can think of 
nothing to compare with it. 

INSPIRATIONAL TIME AT CUMORAH 

I rejoice in the very wonderful time that we had at the dedication 
of the monument on the Hill Cumorah, in the wonderful turnout of 
people who were not of our faith, in the splendid reception given to 
us by the people of Palmyra, who provided accommodations at a 
moderate charge for the visitors from Utah and other sections of the 
country, making them feel at home._ All of the feelings of animosity 
and hatred that existed in the hearts of the people of that town in early 
days against the Prophet Joseph Smith and others have entirely dis- 
appeared. 

I am grateful for the inspiration of the Lord that was given to us 
in the dedication of that monument. I am thankful for the privilege 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



I had of being there and offering the prayer at the dedication. I thank 
the Lord for the inspiration of his Spirit that was given to me in 
dedicating it. 

At the close of those three days I was weary, I felt tired and decided 
not to speak that evening. But as I listened to President McKay bearing 
witness of the divinity of this work, and speaking to the people, I could 
not resist the urgent desire to stand up and pay a tribute to Joseph 
Smith, the man who in the providences of God was the instrument in 
the hands of our Lord and Savior of establishing again upon the earth 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I could not resist the temptation to pay 
my tribute of respect to Brigham Young, to John Taylor, to Wilford 
Woodruff, to Lorenzo Snow, and to Joseph F. Smith, who have stood 
at the head of this Church from the time of its organization. 

I rejoice in the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord given to me 
in speaking to those people at Palmyra. I rejoice beyond my power to 
explain my feelings of gratitude because of the fifty-three years of 
peace, joy and happiness that I have enjoyed in proclaiming the Gospel. 
There is no joy that is greater that can come to man than the joy of 
bringing souls to a knowledge of the Gospel. In the 18th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants we find the following regarding that subject : 

Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; 

For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; 
wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and 
come unto him. 

And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men 
unto him, on conditions of repentance. 

And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth! 

Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people, 

And if it should be that you should labor all your days in crying 
repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how 
great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! 

And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have Drought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you 
should bring many souls unto me! 

JOY IN SERVICE 

Think of the joy of President Cannon in bringing three thousand 
souls to a knowledge of the Gospel ! Think of the joy that has come to 
•Wilford Woodruff and Orson Pratt, who brought nearly that same 
number into the Church. 

I rejoice beyond my power of expression in the pleasure that has 
come to me in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, Bel- 
gium, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, 
Mexico, Hawaii, and far-off Japan, in lifting up my voice in all humility, 
proclaiming that I know, as I know I live, that God lives ; that I know 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of the 
world, and the Savior of mankind ; that I know that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of the true and the living God, the instrument in the hands of

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God of bringing to the earth again the plan of life and salvation, and 
that all the men who in the providences of the Lord have been called to 
stand at the head of this Church were in very deed called of God, and 
the servants of God in laboring for truth here upon the earth. 

May God help you and me and every soul that has a knowledge 
that he lives, that Jesus is our Redeemer, that Joseph Smith was the 
instrument of Almighty God in restoring again the Gospel, so to live it 
and so to keep his commandments that our lives will proclaim it, and 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

At President Grant's request the audience arose and sang one verse 
of "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I attended a stake conference a number of years ago and spoke on 
the Word of Wisdom. At the close of the conference a good sister 
came up somewhat excited and said : "Brother Smith, you never said a 
word about backbiters and fault-finders, and I think it is far worse to 
bear false witness and to backbite than it is to drink a cup of tea." 

I said: "I think I can say things just as emphatic perhaps about 
backbiters as I can about people who break the Word of Wisdom, but 
I did not have that for a subject this afternoon." 

When I went to the rear of the building nearly everybody had left, 
but a man held out his hand and said : 

"Brother Smith, that is the first discourse on the Word of Wisdom 
that I ever liked." 

I said: "Haven't you heard other discourses on the Word of Wis- 
dom?" 

He said: "Yes, but this is the first one that I ever enjoyed." 
I said : "How is that?" 

He said : "Well, you see, I am keeping the Word of Wisdom now." 
I will not be offended, nor will I cease to rejoice whenever President 
Grant feels to speak on the Word of Wisdom. 

SCRIPTURAL PROMISES TO OBEDIENT 

I want to read to you a few verses from a very important revelation 
given to the Church in 1831. This was given to those who had assembled 
in Zion, meaning of course Jackson County, Missouri. The Lord said 
unto them : 

Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this 
land with an eye single to my glory, according to my commandments. 

For those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest 
from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



13 



receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for 
them. 

Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things 
of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength. 

And- they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and 
with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time — they 
that are faithful and diligent before me. 

Wherefore I give unto them a commandment, saying thus : Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and 
strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him. 

Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither 
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it. 

Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. 

Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, 
even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 

And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the 
world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments 
upon my holy day; 

For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, 
and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High ; 

Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days 
and at all times. 

I have read quite a large portion of this revelation. I think it is 
very important. The Lord here promises those people who gathered in 
Zion — and I think the promise is just as good for us today — that if they 
would keep his commandments, he would pour out upon them the bless- 
ings of heaven and the blessings of the earth. 

BLESSINGS FORFEITED 

The world has been in distress. Why? Because of selfishness, 
greed, and unrighteousness, because they have forsaken the God of this 
land, who is Jesus Christ. We would have good crops and abundant 
crops if we would serve the Lord. We would not be in distress finan- 
cially and in our substance, if we would hearken unto these command- 
ments, because we have the word of the Lord for it. He has made the 
promise. We have failed to heed the instruction. 

Moreover he says in this revelation that he would give unto us 
commandments not a few. I am not afraid of the commandments of the 
Lord. And he says that he would give us revelations in their time. I am 
not afraid of the revelations from him. I sometimes tremble about 
revelations from men, and commandments coming from men, but not 
from the Lord. And yet the Lord is holding back from us revelations 
and commandments pertaining to our welfare and salvation because we 
will not hearken unto that which has already been given. 

WHEREIN WE HAVE FAILED 

The President of the Church stood where I am standing now and 
pleaded with the people more than once to uphold and sustain the law 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of God in regard to the Word of Wisdom, and protect the people who 
needed the protection, and we ignored his counsel. That was not pleasing 
in the sight of our Father in heaven, and some of us need to repent, we 
need to turn unto the Lord and serve him more faithfully in many ways. 
We are not keeping his commandments as we ought to do. I have in 
mind what I just read in regard to the Sabbath day. We are commanded 
to do certain things and none other upon this day, and we do not do 
those things, and we do things that we are commanded to abstain from 
doing. 

A week or two ago I attended a conference in the Grant stake taber- 
nacle, it was the Cottonwood stake conference. In going down Ninth 
South to get to that meeting place, it was all I could do to pass down the 
street in an automobile in front of a certain park which had been dedi- 
cated as a playground, because of the people who were assembled there. 
I do not know how many. Farther on others were assembled, engaged 
in sports on the Sabbath day. I took it for granted, and I believe I am 
right, that many of those people were members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

PLEA FOR SABBATH OBSERVANCE 

I plead with you, my brethren and sisters, to observe the Sabbath 
day and keep it holy. This is one of the great Ten Commandments the 
Lord has given, and do not get the idea that this commandment was a 
part of the law of Moses which was done away in Christ. The Decalogue 
was older than Moses, it continued after Moses passed away. The Lord 
has reiterated these commandments, he has renewed them and com- 
manded us in our day to observe them and keep them sacredly and holy, 
and therefore I plead with you. 

We ought not to be playing baseball on the Sabbath day. We ought 
not to be going to the resorts, we ought to keep away from these picture 
houses on the Sabbath day. It was my privilege some years ago to go 
through the East Central States Mission. In the city of Goldsborough, 
on the Sabbath day, we were granted the use of the leading show house, 
the best one in the city, in which to hold our meetings, three of them, 
morning, afternoon and night, without any charge. It was free for us to 
hold religious services and closed against the amusements which were in 
that house all other days of the week. The people were quiet, there were 
no great gatherings on the streets, in the parks, or shouting at baseball 
games or other sports. The people were quietly engaged in prayer and 
going to their churches. I thought, Why can't we have that among 
our own people in the West ? I felt somewhat ashamed. We cannot do 
anything, it seems, today in the way of sports, unless we have to include 
such sports on the Sabbath day. When we want to engage in skiing, 
to find men to enter the Olympics, it appears that we have to do it on the 
Sabbath day. When we dedicate a park or playground in this city, we 
think we have to do it on the Sabbath day. Our hunting and fishing 
season must begin on the Sabbath day. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH

A PROPER OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH 

These things are displeasing in the sight of God, and I speak not 
merely for the Latter-day Saints, but for all good Christian people. If 
they believe in the words of Christ, in the words of the scripture, then 
they ought to sanction what I am saying, and when we turn from the 
commandments the Lord has given unto us for our guidance then we 
do not have a claim upon his blessings. 

President Joseph F. Smith said : 

To observe the Sabbath day properly is the plain duty of every Latter- 
day Saint — and that includes the young men and young women and the 
boys, and girls. It may seem strange that it should be necessary to repeat 
this often-asserted fact. But there appear to be some people, and some- 
times whole communities, who neglect this duty, and therefore stand in 
need of his admonition. 

What are we required to do on the Sabbath Day? The revelations 
of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith are very plain on this subject, and 
these should govern us, for they are in strict harmony with the teachings 
of the Savior. Here are some of the simple requirements : 

The Sabbath is appointed unto you to rest from your labors. 

The Sabbath is a special day for you to worship, to pray, and to show 
zeal and ardor in your religious faith and duty — to pay devotions to the 
Most High. 

The Sabbath day is a day when you are required to offer your time 
and attention in worship of the Lord, whether in meeting, in the home, 
or wherever you may be — that is the thought that should occupy your 
mind. * * * 

The Lord is not pleased with people who know these things and do 
them not. * * * 

Men are not showing zeal and ardor in their religious faith and duty 
when they hustle off early on Sunday morning in cars, in teams, in automo- 
biles, to the canyons, the resorts, and to visit friends or, places of amuse- 
ment, with their wives and children. They are not paying their devotions 
in this way to the Most High. 

There is a good deal more of this that I could read if there were time 
We know our duty ; we know what the Lord expects of us. How can 
we expect his blessing and to be in harmony and fellowship with him if 
we ignore his commandments which are given for our guidance and for 
our temporal as well as for our spiritual salvation? 

NEED FOR REPENTANCE 

Brethren and sisters, let us observe the Word of Wisdom, let us 
observe the Fast day, and fast and pay into the Church in offerings what 
would be equal to what we would consume if we should eat. Let us 
pray to the Father on our knees. We are not praying enough. We are 
not giving the attention to the commandments that we ought to give. We 
need repentance, and I plead with you, let us go forth in the spirit of 
humiliation and with the contrite spirit and the broken heart of which 
the Lord speaks in this revelation. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to greet you 
in conference and to be able to participate with you in the spirit of this 
occasion. I am sure that our Eternal Father is pleased with all those 
who support him in the establishment of his purposes in the earth. His 
revelations are not understood so fully perhaps as they might be, but I 
think that the majority of men and women in the Church are giving atten- 
tion to his plan and are endeavoring to conform their lives to it. 

The history of this Church is a most interesting one. There is 
nothing to compare with it in the world. In the building up of the 
Lord's great work in the earth there has not been a break since the days 
of his appearance to the boy prophet, when he introduced his Son, and 
when he planned the organization of the Church ; there has been a steady 
advancement of his purposes among his people. The building of a great 
commonwealth, the establishment of homes and cities, of stakes, wards, 
branches, where people reverence the Lord, the spread of missionary 
work — these things all indicate the progress that has been made. 

There has never been a change in the doctrines of the Church. When 
I read the sermons that have been delivered, when I listen to men preach 
today, when I listen to missionaries in their testimonies I can see the 
same common teacher, the same common spirit all through the period of 
years during which this Church has existed. It is true that men and 
women will not observe the things the Lord wants them to do as fully as 
they might. Temptation is on every hand. There are many things to 
lead men and women and boys and girls astray, but the Lord's plan will 
prevail, for his word is sure and certain, and men will finally comprehend 
the plan that has been inaugurated by him. 

The work of the Lord in all parts of the world is a testimony to 
men who make investigation. There can be no objection raised by any 
man, I feel sure, who will sincerely consider the principles of the Gospel 
that are taught by the leaders of the Church, and by the lay-members of 
the Church in all the world. In the hearts of all good men and women 
there are desires for righteous living. There is faith among men. 
Prayers are poured out to our Heavenly Father for his help and for 
his guidance. And the principles pf truth that he has revealed appeal 
to the desires and needs of all who honestly investigate. 

The Lord said, when he was in the ministry, to those people to 
whom he was speaking, that every plant that is not planted by our 
Heavenly Father shall be rooted up, every doctrine that is taught, every 
principle that is introduced into the world that does not come from him 
shall be rooted up and cannot stand. It is only the word of the Lord that 
can stand. The men who believe that our Eternal Father is a great spirit 
without body or parts must have revealed to them some day the truth. 
They cannot walk into the presence of God under such a belief. Men 
who say there is no Hereafter in the family organization, that there 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



17 



cannot be and is not a continuation of the marriage relation beyond the 
grave, must be informed, for they cannot enter into the presence of the 
Lord until they understand these things. 

The living monuments that we are acquainted with — those that we 
read of in history, and that we individually know — are evidences of the 
divinity of this work to men and women who are honest in their hearts. 
Brigham Young, who led the people into this country, is recognized by 
every one who visits this land and this city from other places, as a great 
leader, and as one whose works must have been under divine guidance. 
Men who listen to the sermons President Grant preaches cannot but be 
impressed with their psychology and sound doctrine and must feel the 
inspiration directing them. 

Faith is taught in this Church today as it was in the beginning. The 
people of the world need to have faith taught to them, and it must be 
exercised by the people in the Church, by men and women who profess to 
know God. It must be shown in their lives that they have faith in God 
and in his Son Jesus Christ; that they believe in the Word of Wisdom, 
and that they believe in divine revelation, for after all the great fact upon 
which this Church is founded is the revelation of God our Eternal 
Father as it came to Joseph the Prophet in the beginning. 

As I stated before, there is nothing so interesting as the history of 
this Church, both the doctrinal and the historical parts of it. There is 
nothing to equal it in all the world, and I invite men and women every- 
where to read the record that the Church has made as a body. They 
will have to conclude that no man or set of men could lead men and 
women as this Church has been led except God be with them. It could 
not be done by man alone. Men would fail, their doctrines would fail, 
but the Lord is with this Church as he has been with his children in 
former times. From the days of Adam until now he has led his people, 
whenever he has had a people in the earth who would serve him. 

We do not expect that we are going to be perfect here in mortality, 
but we hope to go on to perfection, to overcome our weaknesses, to be 
lenient and kind to each other, and to stand for the thing that we know 
is right and try our very best to get others to think along the same line. 
Again I say, if men would only read the doctrines of this Church, I 
don't care who they are, if they would read a little every day and then 
make an investigation themselves as to whether this thing is right, I am 
sure there would be a change in the hearts of thousands of people. 

These western hills are made for men and women to live in. Our 
Eternal Father led our people here. Yet the strength of God is not in the 
hills and in the rocks and the stones, but is vested in his sons and daugh- 
ters in these great valleys of the mountains. Here is his priesthood. 
His power is here, and here is where his resource lies, and here is where 
he lives in the hearts of the children of men. 

It is our privilege and duty to lead all whom we can into the way of 
salvation. We must help them to think and act and live so that they may 
receive the blessings of our Eternal Father. We ask them to investigate 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the plain statements that we make so that they may know for them- 
selves the things that the Lord has revealed, and begin to plan for them- 
selves to live beyond the grave, where their glory will be. May we 
ourselves live so that we may measure up. May we keep the command- 
ments of God and glorify him, knowing that he is our Father, I pray in 
Jesus' name, Amen. 

An anthem, "In our Redeemer's name," was sung by the Choir. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

For mankind, it has been observed, there are five great destructive 
forces, namely, poverty, war, disease, crime and intemperance. It is 
concerning intemperance that I desire to speak on this occasion. 

One of America's greatest newspapers has stated that the liquor 
business has been the devoted and intimate ally of every vicious element 
in American life, that it has protected criminals, fostered the social evil 
and has succeeded in bribing politicians and juries, and legislatures in 
every part of our fair land. 

"billions for rum" 

For prohibition the Church stood strong. It has been said that 
in 1915 we were expending "billions for rum," and that in 1930 as a 
result of Prohibition we were expending those billions for homes and 
better living. It looks now as if we have already returned to the old 
standard of "billions for rum." 

Thinking Latter-day Saints surely do not need to be told that the 
standards of the Church remain unchanged and that these require 
Church members to abstain from the use of all alcoholic beverages in- 
cluding beer. This Church does and must and will forever stand firmly 
against the use of beer, cocktails and every other beverage containing 
this poisonous narcotic, alcohol, which I designate our nation's public 
enemy number one. 

THE FOUR GREAT HEALTH SCOURGES 

Dr. Bogen, authority on the symptoms, causes and nature of dis- 
eases says, "No other poison causes so many deaths or leads to or inten- 
sifies so many diseases, both physical and mental, as does alcohol." Dr. 
Weeks, great English authority, cites four British medical writers who 
name alcoholism as one of the four great health scourges of modern 
civilization. Cancer, tuberculosis and venereal diseases are the other 
three. It hardly seems possible, that any human being of moderate 
intelligence could be induced knowingly to expose himself to the ravages 
of any one of these four scourges. And yet every glass of beer, every 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



19 



cocktail or taste of any other alcoholic liquor is an exposure to the first 
named of these four terrible scourges. 

DAVID STARR JORDAN'S VIEW 

In our Church organizations we propose to continue to struggle to 
teach young people that alcohol is a habit-forming drug, that the first 
drink is the easiest to resist ; and that while a few seem to use liquor with 
little apparent harm, yet by its use no one is ever made more efficient 
or more skilful or does more or better work, while by its use untold 
thousands, many of them the ablest and most promising, have been 
ruined. When the truth concerning this public enemy number one is 
thoroughly understood, when its harmful effects on both health and 
character are realized, its use will be avoided and prohibited with the 
same vigorous unanimity with which we now prohibit the use of mor- 
phine. 

David Starr Jordan says : "The basis of intemperance is the effort 
to secure through drugs the feeling of happiness when happiness does 
not exist. * * * 

"There is nothing more hopeless than the ineffective remorse of 
a man who drinks and wishes that he did not. * * * Men drink to 
forget. They drink to be happy. They drink to be drunk. Sometimes 
it is a periodical attack of madness. Sometimes it is a chronic thirst. 
Whichever it is, its indulgence destroys the soundness of life ; it destroys 
accuracy of thought and action ; it destroys wisdom and virtue ; it des- 
troys faith and hope and love." 

ALCOHOL AND THE DEATH RATE 

The drinker not only thinks he is not harmed by taking his first 
drink but he thinks he is more clever, witty, skilful and competent. He 
does not realize that drinking has brought shame and illness and death 
to uncounted millions and unspeakable sorrow to those related to these 
millions. The effect of alcohol is to paralyze judgment and the paralysis 
begins with the first glass. 

In 1917 for the benefit of 43 life insurance companies a study was 
made which covered the records of two million policy holders for a 
period of 23 years and the conclusion reached is that alcohol invariably 
produces a higher death rate. 

This national public enemy of which I speak is no respecter of 
persons. To him rank and station mean nothing. There is no man so 
rich that this public enemy cannot take from him his fortune ; no brain 
so brilliant that liquor cannot reduce its chances of success ; no human 
body so full of health that by drink its life cannot be materially shortened. 

One manager of a large business institution said recently, "Our 
greatest trouble today is with liquor." Another said, "We can't have 
this woman in our institution. She actually comes to work drunk." A 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



man came to me for help recently because he had lost his position. He 
had been discharged for drunkenness and he was drunk when in tears he 
made his appeal to me in the interest of his wife and children. Officers 
tell me that rarely does an accident involving two automobiles occur when 
the occupants of one or both of them have not been drinking. 

"I'll give you a thousand dollars in cash if you will only quit," said 
a rich man to his young friend. Later the young man replied, "I've 
tried. I've done my best. I am defeated. I cannot quit." 

WHOM SHALL WE FOLLOW 

And this serious drinking and drunken condition is found every- 
where. Are we the people of this great nation whose motto is "In God 
We Trust," are we the people of this land of liberty who sing, "Protect 
us by thy might, great God our King," are we in this chosen land follow- 
ing the example of a drunken few who are swinging their bottles and 
shouting for liquor, or are we following the example of our Pilgrim 
fathers who, Bible in hand, wended their way to their places of worship 
and there upon bended knees prayed for strength to resist temptation? 

Where are those, our so-called patriotic and country-loving friends 
and neighbors, who before the repeal of Prohibition announced repeatedly 
that repeal would improve conditions? I have not been able to see im- 
provement nor have I been able to find others who think conditions are 
better. 

OUR GREATEST ENEMY 

The man who has become an addict to drink is powerless to help 
himself. He has lost the faculties of will and self-control. There are 
other substances which, in one or more ways, act something like alco- 
hol upon the human system, but in the three particulars which make it 
our greatest enemy, alcohol stands alone. First, it is easy to manufac- 
ture ; second, it is easy to take — it is drinkable ; and third, it deceives 
the drinker in its effects upon himself. In this matter of coping with 
the drinking habit, we the people of the Church can only succeed, as 
can the people of the nation also, if unitedly and firmly we stand for 
abstinence, yes, total abstinence, as well as for reformation. 

NOT INTERESTED IN DRUNKEN PRATTLE 

Some people used to think that a few drinks of liquor made the 
tongue wag more f r.eely and therefore made conversation more interest- 
ing ; but today, in this age of scholarship and intelligence, no wise man 
nor even the average man of ordinary intelligence is interested in the 
prattle and nonsense of a man who is drunk. No man would care to 
spend his time with his most intimate, his closest, his most beloved 
friend, if that friend were drunk or even tipsy. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



21 



Robert G. Ingersoll appreciating the seriousness of the use of liquor 
said, "I believe that alcohol to a certain degree demoralizes those who 
make it, those who sell it and those who drink it." 

LET US BE ORTHODOX 

I appeal to you Latter-day Saints to stand by our Church stand- 
ards, to live in accordance with Church ideals. May we be able to say 
always, "Latter-day Saints do not drink liquor ; therefore, I being a 
Latter-day Saint do not drink." Let us be orthodox. Being orthodox 
should mean that this and many other questions will always be answered 
for us in advance as we travel along life's journey. When others parti- 
cipate in social drinking, let us stand by our ideals and standards with • 
out having to stop and come to a decision. Let it be cleared up and settled 
in our minds once and for always that being Latter-day Saints we never 
drink. 

LIQUOR LAWS SHOULD BE ENFORCED 

With many of my friends in and out of the Church I stood for 
Prohibition as vigorously as I knew how to stand. I thought then and 
think still that Prohibition will finally prove to be the ultimate solution 
to the liquor question. But living in a country where the majority rules 
I now stand with equal positiveness for the enforcement of our present 
laws. It was said that if Prohibition were repealed all good citizens 
would unite in an effort to eliminate the bootlegger, to eliminate drunken- 
ness and drunken driving, to enact and to enforce laws that would keep 
liquor from minors and from those weak adults who spend for whiskey 
the money their children and their wives need for food, clothing and 
education. 

I now appeal to you and to all other good citizens to unite and help 
enforce the laws which have been enacted for the regulation of the liquor 
traffic. I appeal for the election to office in every branch of our govern- 
ment those who live in accordance with the law and those who favor its 
enforcement. Will you be good citizens and go to the primaries and to 
the polls and help as best you can to see to it that no one is elected to 
public office who owes allegiance to the liquor traffic or to any of its allied 
evils ? 

THE WAY TO STRENGTH AND POWER 

If we would have the strength of the Puritan we must hold to the 
practises of the Puritan ; we must have in our hearts a hatred for that 
which is evil. The way that leads to strength and power has ever been 
and will always be straight, stony and stormy. It will ever remain true 
that the paths that are easy and flowery often lead to weakness and mis- 
ery. Resisting temptation strengthens the mind ; it strengthens the soul. 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



May our children be able to resist successfully the numerous and trying 
temptations of today. This is the way of righteousness. It has been said 
that no man can be called strong and virtuous until he has come innocent 
from the conquest of temptation. And in our teaching let us remember 
that resistance to temptation must come from within. We cannot by 
compulsion make our children good. 

What is going to give the necessary strength, the necessary power 
to resist temptation ? Education alone, it seems, will not do it. A knowl- 
edge of science will not do it. Many with scholarship and knowledge 
have had their lives ruined by drink. 

The greatest power that can come into human hearts and lives is the 
power of God. This added to scholarship and education, will give the 
required strength. It is the doctrine and practises of the Church, it is 
Christian ideals, it is belief in a life beyond the grave, it is a testimony 
of the divinity and effectiveness of the restored Gospel that will make it 
possible to resist the temptation of liquor. 

MAY WE RESOLVE 

May we have faith in all of these, may we be able, I humbly pray, 
actually to believe what is written in the holy scriptures. May we feel 
in our souls the divinity and effectiveness of holy writ. May there be 
awakened in our hearts an ambition to assist, especially by example, in 
preserving from temptation those who are young and inexperienced. 
May we be able to convince them of this truth that touching liquor is 
playing with fire. 

And may we down in our hearts resolve and get our children and our 
children's children in their hearts to resolve also never to buy or drink 
or sell or give any kind of alcoholic liquor. Let us struggle until we 
have thoroughly conquered this our present outstanding public enemy 
number one, so that our choice young folks, promising young men and 
promising young women, may be protected from its terrible temptation. 

An anthem, "The Pilgrim's Chorus," was sung by the Choir. 
Elder John C. Todd, President of the Gridley Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 :00 p. m.

Elder Danford M. Bickmore, President of the Hyrum Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The Choir sang the hymn, "An angel from on high." 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I plead with you for your supporting power. I never needed it 
more. 

This is a beautiful occasion, a wonderful opening to a great con- 
ference. Our souls have been thrilled by the sweet melodies of this 
stake choir. God bless their talents and give them a desire to use these 
talents to praise the Lord our God forever. My soul has thrilled, and 
I have said out of the depths of my heart when every one of the 
brethren has closed his remarks, Amen — the Lord let it be so. 

A BEAUTIFUL SETTING 

We are surrounded with beauty, with peace, with comfort in this, 
one of the most remarkable spots upon the face of the earth. It seems 
to me it was never more beautiful than today. I do not have to invite 
you to look over the beautiful sweep of green which extends back to 
the north wall and see the wealth of color that rises to the top of that 
wall. There is no other setting like it in all the world. It is a rare privi- 
lege, in the shadow of the Temple erected to the most high God, to 
meet in this great assembly room in conference capacity, after a lapse 
of a hundred and six years since the organization of the Church. 

THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCH 

I thought as I listened to the burning testimony of the President 
this morning, testifying of the divinity of the Lord our God, the 
Redeemer of the world, testifying of the divine mission of Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, and bearing his testimony as to the worthiness of his prede- 
cessors — I thought, after having had a lifetime acquaintance with the 
general authorities of the Church and now one year's experience in 
close daily contact with them, why could I not, a humble man, testify 
of the living, testify of the leadership of this Church as it is today. 

I have seen these men day in and day out. I have witnessed them 
in their wrestling with the grave problems that arise to be solved. I have 
observed the vast amount of routine work that must constantly be 
given careful attention day by day. These leaders are known to us. 
Their lives are open books. They have grown up under the eyes of 
the people. Their incomings and their outgoings are known to all. 
They are chosen of God to carry forward his work at this period in the 
history of the Church. 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I ask for your deliberate consideration and your feeling of rever- 
ence for the authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. What a variety of men constitutes the General Authorities of 
this Church ! When any problem comes before them, think of the 
various viewpoints that are brought to bear in its solution, and think 
of the safety and security of each solution as it goes out to the people 
with the wise recommendations of all. 

THE ORACLES OF GOD 

I bear testimony that my brethren live in the love and favor of 
God and that they carry their responsibilities with fidelity. I bear 
testimony of the unity and the feeling of brotherly love that exist in 
the presiding councils. I bear testimony of the deference and rever- 
ence that are given to the President of the Church, in recognition of his 
long life of faithful devotion to the cause of truth, his known unswerv- 
ing integrity under every condition of life that has ever confronted him, 
his generous spirit, his heart of understanding and his ear that is open 
to the petitions of the just and the good. 

We rejoice with him in the inspiration that came to him in the 
happy choice that he made of his counselors. President Clark, a born 
straight thinker, a righteous defender of the truth, is a man of undeviat- 
ing and unfaltering devotion to the Church, who is never given to 
expediency and cannot be lured by position or place away trom the 
high standards of the Church. President McKay, with his manly 
physique, a perfect physical specimen, it seems to me, presided over 
by a trained and a keen mind, enjoys a spirituality that has made him, 
not of his own volition but by common consent, the idol of youth, the 
foremost Sunday School teacher and officer of his day. The sweetness 
of his life flows into ours in richness and lifts in us every good quality 
and ambition. 

These men constitute the Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, the oracles of God chosen to receive the mind and 
the will and the word of the Lord and to impart it unto the people. 1 
bear testimony that the avenues of revelation are open. The brethren 
are worthy. Jesus is at the helm. This is his work and he leads his 
servants. 

WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE 

I could go on down the line, for one year's close contact with these 
brethren has found a response in my heart and brought a richness into 
my life that I have no ability to express in words. President Clawson, 
who stands at the head of the Council of the Twelve, has been steadfast 
and true while he has pegged out his better than seventy-eight years in 
faithful service. He stands before us a living witness that men walk 
the earth in this generation of time who would give their lives for the 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



25 



truth and for their friends. I recall, as many of you recall, in history 
that Rudger Clawson stood by the side of his companion, Elder Joseph 
Standing, and saw him shot down in cold blood, and then heard the 
voice of the leading mobocrat give the order, as he designated Rudger 
Clawson, "Shoot that man." Brother Clawson, looking down the barrels 
of those guns that were leveled at his head, folded his arms and said 
with majesty, "Shoot." He made the sacrifice, he offered his life, but 
the Lord willed it otherwise and he walks about among us true and 
faithful, living out the measure of his creation. 

MEN WITH OUTSTANDING QUALIFICATIONS 

So I could go on down and name my brethren: Reed Smoot, the 
illustrious Senator, now at this mature period of his life giving out of his 
rich experience all that he has for the building of the Church and King- 
dom of God; George Albert Smith, the apostle of love and sympathy 
and good will ; George F. Richards, the patient, the exact, the true, the 
tried; Joseph Fielding Smith, an oracle, one who knows all that God 
has revealed perhaps as well as any other living man. 

And so I might go on down through the list, but time will not 
permit, naming each in his place, each with his outstanding qualities, all 
united for the building of the Church and Kingdom of God upon the 
earth. 

LEADERS IN STAKES AND MISSIONS 

Then as we reach out and discover, as I have been permitted to 
discover as I have visited the stakes and missions and met the fine 
leaders we have serving as presidents of missions, presidents of stakes, 
bishops of wards, as superintendencies and presidencies of auxiliary 
organizations and the good men and women that they have gathered 
about them, all down the line, I marvel as I say : "Oh, Lord, it is true ; 
Thou hast brought forth a great and marvelous work. Thou hast 
lifted an ensign to the world." And I feel that I could almost sing 
with Isaiah: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him 
that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace ; that bringeth good 
tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy 
God reigneth. Rise from the dust and shake thyself, and go forth in 
power and in dominion." 

AS THE VOICE OF GOD 

God bless the leaders of Zion and bring into our hearts a renewed 
feeling of reverence; that henceforth their voices, as they speak as they 
are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, shall be unto us as the voice of God. 
In this hour when war drums are rolling, fleets are massing, soldiers are 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



being marshaled and all the powers of destruction are being assembled, 
let us remember the word of the Lord who said : "When that day shall 
come that peace shall be taken from the earth, when the devil shall have 
dominion over his own, I the Lord shall rule in the hearts of Zion and 
shall come down in judgment upon the earth." 

That God may help us to know who we are, be what we ought to 
be, live as we should live and go forth with the irresistible power of 
righteousness in the proclamation and living of the truth, is my prayer 
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

President of the California Mission 

My brethren and sisters, last night I was visiting the home of one 
of my brothers, and in talking with him about the Church he said : "Not 
long ago the Bishop made certain proposals of things that he wished 
to do in the ward. I immediately stood up in that meeting and objected 
and made a tirade against what he was wanting to do. Apparently I made 
one convert, for as I took my seat another brother arose and began to 
berate the Bishop for his proposals, and as I listened to that brother I 
thought : 'What a'fool I have made of myself.' As soon as he had finished 
his talk against the Bishop's proposals I stood up again and said : 'Bishop, 
I am right back of you in anything you want to do'." 

I find that frequently we, as members of the Church, are not as 
loyal as we should be to the brethren who preside over us. It is an easy 
matter to criticise and find fault with what is being done, but I have 
learned, through my association with the brethren that they don't do 
things without considerable prayer and thought ; and that when they are 
united, we can well afford to stand directly behind them and support them 
in every move they make. 

Not so very long ago, in California, a member of the high council 
came to me and began to complain and criticise because at the Exposition 
in San Diego we had placed young men and women, our missionaries, 
to meet the public who came from all parts of the world to visit that 
great Exposition. He said: "We should have more mature men to 
handle the crowds that gather there." For be it known that some fifteen 
hundred people a day have come to our little bureau at the San Diego 
Exposition, to hear the story that these young men and young ladies have 
to tell. I said to him, "I have every faith in our missionaries, young 
though they be, and I am sure that with our faith and prayers they 
will be able to do their job successfully." 

Just recently I visited the Fair, and in reading the diary of one of 
the missionaries I came to an entry that he had made which interested 
me and I asked permission to copy it because I thought it was really 
rich. This happened on September 7th. The diary was that of Elder 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 



27 



James Shelby of Arizona, perhaps the youngest missionary we have in 
the California Mission. He said: 

September 7th. I entertained the Archbishop, W. H. Francis, and 
Victor James Hartman, of Bedford Village, New York, at the booth today. 
They came in to see the exhibit and said : "We visited your exhibit twice 
when in Chicago at the great Fair. It was the best exhibit there, and seeing 
it here on the grounds we just couldn't help coming and seeing it again. 
It is the best exhibit here, too. We are impressed by the zeal and en- 
thusiasm of you young people who explain the exhibit to us. I certainly 
envy the wonderful program that the Mormon leaders have that holds 
young people so firmly rooted in the spiritual lines." I explained the model 
of the Tabernacle to him, and told him that we regarded it as quite an 
edifice, to be carved out of nothing but wood. To this the Archbishop 
remarked : "My boy, you carved that building out of wood, but you have 
carved an empire out of nothing but a wilderness." He also told me of a 
time when he was receiving applications for a position. One boy in par- 
ticular, he said, interested him. He asked the boy if he smoked, drank 
liquor, cr drank tea, coffee, or any other stimulant. The boy answered 
in the negative. He asked the boy if he went to church, and he told him 
yes. He then told him that he was a Latter-day Saint. The Archbishop 
said he hired that boy out of a hundred and twenty-five applicants, because 
he stood up for his convictions and was not ashamed to stand by them. 
All in all he was one of the most remarkable and interesting men I have 
ever, had the privilege of talking with. 

The manager of the Standard Oil Company exhibit, just across the 
way from us, came over and remarked that he was surprised that such 
young people should be given the responsibility of putting over such an 
important message, and he was amazed to see how these boys and girls 
were standing up under such a strain, and convincing the outside people 
of the value of Mormonism and the teachings of the Mormon Church. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I feel that if we could have a little 
more sympathy from within perhaps we could do much more good. 
A lawyer came to my office not long ago. He said: "I had the 
grandest time of my life in Utah. I spent two hours yesterday on the 
Temple Block, a thrilling experience, listening to the guide as he told 
me of what had been accomplished. I came down to Los Angeles yester- 
day. As soon as I got here I remembered that in a warehouse I had a 
Book of Mormon that I had never looked at. I hunted it up and 
I was reading that book till 2 :30 this morning." At 9:00 o'clock he was 
in my office telling me this. "What a marvelous church you have ! Why, 
no one can tell me that a man wrote the Book of Mormon. I have a great 
deal to do with detail, and there is too much detail in that book for any 
man to think of and write out and make it fit in so well. I want more 
literature." So we sold him more literature. 

Yet I have heard people complain about the Temple Block, that 
forsooth we were giving them too much religion here, just overdoing it a 
little bit. The people who come from the world are hungry. Thousands 
of them come here, and as they pass on, back into their homes, they 
are thrilled when these Mormon missionaries come to their doors, 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thrilled to hear their testimony, glad to take them in and feed them and 
help them. 

Brethren and sisters, let us be loyal to our Church, and to the men 
who lead us. Let us remember that our Heavenly Father is not very far 
from us, and his promise is very definite, for he tells us that "the 
obedient shall eat the good of the land." Let us therefore not feel to 
criticise, but feel to be obedient, that the blessings may come to our 
families, to our homes. That will come through obedience. 

God bless and keep us all in the line of our duty, loyal, constant 
and true to those who preside over us, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a source of great satisfaction to the leaders of this Church, who 
have at heart the welfare of the Latter-day Saints, to see the many evi- 
dences of faithfulness on their part. I thought this when I saw men and 
women rushing toward this building this morning, anxious to attend the 
opening session of this wonderful conference, and I have thought since 
that there are many other ways in which the Latter-day Saints are evi- 
dencing their love of the truth and their support of the authorities of the 
Church. The generous response that is made by our young men and 
women who leave their homes and loved ones and go out into the world, 
representing the Church and the Lord in the preaching of the everlasting 
Gospel, is an evidence of faith on their part and also on the part of their 
parents. 

EVIDENCES OF FAITHFULNESS AND DEVOTION 

The response made to calls to various positions of trust and respon- 
sibility in the ministry of the Lord at home, in the various organizations 
of the Church; the faithfulness and devotion manifested by men and 
women in the various positions which they occupy in the Church; the 
reports from wards and stakes and missions of accomplishments there 
and of the faithfulness of the members of the Church — all these are very 
gratifying. 

We cannot help but realize however that these evidences of faith- 
fulness are confined to but a portion of our people ; that there are others 
in the Church who are very indifferent to the faith of their parents and 
the responsibility that rests upon them as members. This is a source of 
much regret. 

THE LORD'S PURPOSE 

The Lord made known to his servant Abraham the purpose he had 
in the organizing of this earth and his purpose in placing men here : 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



29 



And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space 
there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth 
whereon these may dwell. 

We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things what- 
soever the Lord God shall command them. 

Now, brethren and sisters, that is the end that our Father in heaven 
and those associated with him had in view in the creating of this earth- — 
placing us here to see if we would keep all of his commandments. I 
wonder how well we are meeting that obligation. 

our captain's platform of principles 

Aside from the commandments, we read also in the Pearl of Great 
Price — in the Book of Moses — about a great controversy that took place 
in the world of spirits, and that one noble spirit came forth who was the 
first-born in the spirit — afterwards the Only Begotten of the Father in 
the flesh — and presented a platform of principles which was accepted, 
couched in simple terms : "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine 
forever." There was a sufficient number of those spirits of men that 
stood with him, our Captain, upon that platform of principles, to prevail. 
We were among them, brethren and sisters, and we upheld the standard 
of principles : "Thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever." That 
principle had reference to this life as well as to the spirit life. 

When the Savior came to earth he renewed his declaration and 
repeatedly stated that he came because his Father had sent him, that he 
came to do the will of his Father. On one occasion, when he was ad- 
dressing the Nephites when he visited them on this American continent 
and preached the Gospel to them, after his crucifixion and ascension into 
heaven, he stated that he had come because he was sent of the Father, 
and that he came to do the will of his Father. Then he asked them : 
"Now, what manner of men ought ye to be?" And he answered the 
question for them : "Verily I say unto you, even as I am." 

THE .WILL OF THE LORD 

I do not know how we could read any other meaning into it than 
that the Father sent Jesus our Lord and Savior here to do his will, and 
that we were all sent here for the same purpose. So to me — and I think 
it should be to all Latter-day Saints — the expressed will of our Heavenly 
Father is as forceful as a direct command, and when he says in the 
revelation known as the Word of Wisdom it is his will that we observe 
and keep that word, refraining from the use of intoxicating drinks and 
hot drinks, and the use of tobacco, we should be obedient thereto. Not- 
withstanding there is no mention of tea and coffee in that revelation we 
have known from the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith to the present 
time that every leader of this Church who has been the mouthpiece of 
God has interpreted the revelation to mean that tea and coffee are in- 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



eluded among those things which are forbidden. In other words, it is the 
will of the Father that we should not use tea and coffee. 

god's mouthpiece unto us 

And recently, because of the prevalence of the sale and use of 
legalized beer, the President of this Church and his associates have con- 
sidered seriously that problem, and have declared that the use of beer 
is a violation of the Word of Wisdom, hence a violation of the expressed 
will of our Father in heaven. 

Are we willing, as Latter-day Saints, to sustain and to support the 
President of this Church as God's mouthpiece unto us — a prophet, seer 
and revelator — and sing with sincere heart and purpose : 

We thank thee, O God, for a prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days ; 
We thank thee for sending the Gospel, 

To lighten our minds with its rays. 

When the President of the Church stands up in general conference 
and declares in favor of prohibition, it has been a source of great regret 
to me that prominent, leading, faithful men in this Church have felt 
justified in voting in favor of the return of liquor as against the expressed 
will of the President of the Church, who I believe expressed the mind and 
will of God unto this people. 

CONSISTENT AND CONSCIENTIOUS ACTION 

We are here, brethren and sisters, not only to be proven to see 
whether we will keep all of God's commandments, but to see whether 
we will do his will and permit the authorities of the Church to interpret 
his mind and will to us. Is not that consistent ? 

May the Lord help us, brethren and sisters, to be consistent, to act 
conscientiously. 

I have thought that there are some doctrines taught by some of the 
religious creeds of the world which many men and women of intelligence 
cannot subscribe to, when they answer according to their own conscience, 
but do so because they are the creeds of the church to which they belong, 
and I place these religious organizations and political parties in the same 
class. 

God help us to live according to the light which has come to us, 
to support and sustain those whom the Lord has given unto us, for they 
are prophets in very deed, and they will be so to this people if we will 
follow their lead. No man or woman has ever gone astray, or ever will 
do so, when in full accord with the Presidency of this Church and the 
Twelve Apostles. 

My admonition to the Latter-day Saints is that we heed the advice 
and counsel given us in this general conference, that we take the same 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



31 



home to ourselves, and that we be resolved that we will be doers of the 
word of God, and not hearers only, deceiving ourselves. 

May the Lord help and bless us to this end, I .pray earnestly, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

Sister Judith Anderson Beard sang a solo, "How beautiful upon the 
mountains," after which, at the suggestion of President Heber J. Grant, 
the congregation arose and sang two verses of the hymn, "O say what 
is truth?" 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

These words from the 128th Section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants come to me as I rise before you this afternoon: 

Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A 
voice of gladness ! A voice of mercy from heaven ; and a voice of truth 
out of the earth ; glad tidings for the dead ; a voice of gladness for the 
living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the 
mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, 
and that say unto Zion : Behold, thy God reigneth ! As the dews of 
Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them ! 

And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah ! lyioroni, 
an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets — the book 
to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca 
County, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book! 

The outstanding event during the last six months in the Eastern 
States Mission was the dedication of the monument on the Hill Cumorah, 
near Palmyra, New York. Reference was made this morning to this 
event. The work of the mission has centered, during the summer, 
largely around that place. Our missionaries visited every home within 
a radius of twenty miles of the Hill Cumorah. More than seventy 
thousand people live within that area. 

We are deeply grateful to the Lord for the blessings that have 
been given to us in our mission. We are especially grateful for the 
fine publicity that was given through the newspapers, magazines, and 
over the radios concerning the dedication of the monument. Thousands 
of articles were published. The Hill Cumorah has continued to be a 
place of interest for many people since the dedication services were 
held. No day has passed, since the dedication of the monument, that 
has not seen many people come to that hill. Forty, I think, is the 
smallest number, and we have had as high as seven hundred and seventy 
in a day visit the monument and listen to the message of the missionaries 
who have been stationed in that locality. 

I do not know whether you fully appreciate, as we do, the blessings 
of publicity. The messages of our brethren who visited us were written 
in detail and printed in literally hundreds of the papers in that mission. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Reference was made to individuals, to the President of the Church, and 
to many others in the kindliest manner. 

I recall at this time some of the quotations that were made regarding 
our exercises, and with the consent of the brethren I would like to insert 
in my remarks in the permanent record a few of these brief quotations. 

The Evening Journal of Rochester, New York, made this forecast 
on June IS, 1935 : 

When Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, led his little band of faithful followers westward from Pal- 
myra 100 years ago, it was because they were driven out by the persecution 
of other sects in this, vicinity. 

But when their descendants, many of them among the nation's wealthi- 
est and most prominent figures, return here next month, they will be 
received with' open arms. A holiday will be declared in their honor — 
the key to the city will be theirs. 

On July 14 the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle printed a full- 
page story which was concluded with these words : 

History repeated itself in western New York when this year the story 
of Mormonism was taken to the people of the section through a projected 
missionary campaign participated in by 50 young men and women from 
the church in the West, many of whom were third and fourth generation 
descendants of the early converts in this state. * * * 

At the coming celebration at the site of the monument itself, a 
homecoming of unique proportions will be enacted. Thousands of ad- 
herents to the faith that was cradled in Palmyra a century ago will return 
to see the marking of one of its prominent places and the memorializing 
of one of its salient events. 

While the early Mormons were driven from New York by misunder- 
standing neighbors in 1831, their returning descendants are welcomed by 
friends in the same places. Where the faith was once despised, mission- 
aries find people who want to know of it. 

Building a stately memorial in their church's birthplace, the Latter- 
day Saints take up again the threads of a religion which were dropped 
one hundred years ago. 

The monument's dedication was reported in this way by the 
Courier-Express of Buffalo on July 22: 

About 105 years ago Joseph Smith and his little band of followers 
' were driven out of their homes in Palmyra and Manchester to wander 
across the continent before they found peace. 

Yesterday approximately 3,000 persons from all parts of the United 
States and Canada, as staunch in their Mormon faith as the battered band 
of 1830, returned to Palmyra and Manchester. Prosperous, and zealous 
for their religion, they came as honored guests of the same communities 
where founders of their faith were stoned and killed. 

The New York Times, on the same date, quoted one of the dedica- 
tion day speakers thus : 

We do not erect this monument to express the wealth of the Church, 
or the deeds — mighty as they were — that took place from 1820 to 1830 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 



33 



on this hallowed ground, but to express gratitude for the gospel of 
Jesus, said Mr. McKay. 

It is a monument to the question and the answer of ages; if a man 
die, shall he live again? We must in testimony of Joseph Smith say 
that if a man die, he shall live again. 

A report written with remarkable sympathy and understanding by 
Mrs. Thelma G. Bryant of Monroe, Michigan, was carried by the 
Evening News of that town on July 27 : 

If the dead can see and know of earthly events, as some people believe 
they do, then the heart of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, must have 
been filled with joy because of the recent events around his boyhood home. 
Over 5,000 of his followers, and others, gathered at "Cumorah Land" as 
it is called by the Mormons, for a four day celebration commemorating 
the restoration of the gospel. Sunday, July 21, on top of Mormon Hill, 
as the natives there have long called it, or the Hill Cumorah, as the Mor- 
mons say, was unveiled and dedicated a beautiful monument, which was 
set to mark the place where it is claimed the young Prophet Joseph 
found the golden tablets from which he translated the record known as 
the Book of Mormon. * * * 

Members came from long distances, some from California, Idaho, 
Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Michigan. A large delegation came 
from Utah, among them being Heber J. Grant, who is the head of the 
church over all the world. There were also several apostles and other 
important leaders of the church. In simple unassuming fashion these 
men spoke, paying tribute to the man Joseph, the first latter-day prophet. 
Mr. Grant holds the same place in the church today as Joseph did, and 
is honored by his people as a prophet, seer, and revelator unto the church. 
Despite his high place, Mr. Grant as also the other leaders of the church, 
mingled freely among the people. 

The papers quoted much of the wonderful speeches made by Presi- 
dent Grant and President McKay at the last session of the conference. 
President McKay said, as I recall, that the monument connoted at least 
four things ; first, the personality and the reality of our Father in heaven ; 
second, that he has communicated his mind and his will to men in this 
day ; third, that he had given authority to establish his church upon 
earth ; and fourth, that there is no death. President Grant bore a most 
powerful testimony of the divinity of the Gospel. 

A short time ago a man visited the Hill Cumorah, and after listen- 
ing to the. story of the elders he said : "The test of a man's greatness is 
measured by ideas original with him. What did Joseph Smith give to 
the world new in the way of ideas?" 

Our elder replied : "At least four come to me now : First, in the 
face of a doctrine that man is a worm of the dust" — which, by the way, 
has no place in Mormon philosophy — "he gave to the world the idea of 
the relationship of man to God. He restated what the Psalmist had 
said, that the Lord had created man a little lower than the angels. He 
gave to the world the idea of man's greatness, and not of his littleness, 
providing he seeks to make himself great. Second, he gave also to the 
world the idea of man's origin. True, it had been taught before, but it 



34

was new religiously." Preexistence of man, so far as I know, is a 
doctrine, even to this day, peculiar to the Latter-day Saints. "Third," 
said our missionary, "he gave to the world the thought that all true 
religion is based upon the doctrine of free agency; that it is freedom 
and reason that make us men, in the face of an accepted doctrine of 
predestination. And fourth, he gave to the world a beautiful and wonder- 
fully new doctrine of the onwardness or eternal progress and growth and 
development in the life hereafter ; that there is no such thing as static, in 
Mormon theology ; that in yonder world we take up the threads of life 
largely where we leave them off here, and go on to endless growth and 
development through the countless ages of eternity." 

When our missionary had spoken — I have not, of course, used his 
exact words — when he had finished speaking this man said: "I have 
been listening and looking for ideas such as you have spoken here today. 
I want a religion that gives me a revelation concerning the kinship of 
man to God. I want to believe that I am great if I make myself great. 
I want to worship a God who deigns to call me his son, and reveals 
that I am his literal child. But I want that religion to be based upon 
free agency, with the glorious thought that for every personal act I, 
myself, am held responsible, when I arrive at the age of accountability." 

That is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That is the glorious message. 
It is founded upon the doctrine of free agency, but always with the 
thought that we are rewarded and we are advanced as we seek knowl- 
edge and gain power and grow toward the good, the infinite and the 
righteous. This is a glorious message, and how beautiful, how wonderful 
this glad tiding of great joy ! 

The Eastern States missionaries have been happy this summer. 
They have been thrilled. I wish I could tell you, you parents particularly, 
of some of the testimonies that have been borne in my hearing by your 
sons and daughters out there proclaiming the word of God. They 
rejoiced and were thrilled at the dedication, when we had with us two 
of the First Presidency, four or five of the Council of the Twelve, one 
member of the First Council of Seventy, the Presiding Bishop, and 
others of the general boards and representatives of the various organi- 
zations of the Church. 

We rejoice in the privilege that is ours of laboring in the land 
where Mormonism had its birth. With new pride, with new hope, with 
new thrills we are performing our labors, as best we can. In humility, 
but with the strength that is born of conviction, we are bearing our 
testimony that we do know that God lives ; that he is a personality and 
a reality; that he has revealed himself in this day; that he has given 
authority to organize and build up his Church ; that we know that life 
is real, and that there is no death — life, life eternal, glorious, splendid 
and wonderful life. 

God help us to live it well, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER GEORGE W. BURBIDGE 

Former President of the Tahitian Mission 

It has been almost two years and a half, my brethren and sisters, 
since we left the Tahitian Mission, but I think I can say that the condi- 
tions are about the same there now as they were in 1919. I left there in 
1919, after finishing my first mission, and was home ten years before 
returning. I found the conditions almost the same at that time as they 
were ten years prior. 

My heart thrilled this morning on hearing President Grant speak 
of his experience with the Hawaiian people. I can appreciate the feel- 
ing that he had when he expressed what he did about them. Tahiti is 
just twenty-eight hundred miles west of the Hawaiian Islands. The 
native people in that mission are of the same type, the same lovable, 
wonderful, sincere people. I have never labored among a people to 
whom the Gospel of Jesus Christ means so much as it does to the 
Tahitian people. They are handicapped, of course, but with the means 
at their disposal they do live their religion, and are faithful and true to 
the Covenants which they have- been permitted to make. They enjoy 
the priesthood up to the office of elder, and they magnify their callings 
and obey the principles of the Gospel to a very remarkable degree. 
To know those people is to love them, and to understand them is to 
love them more. 

I am grateful to my Heavenly Father that I have had the privilege 
of spending almost nine years of my life among those people. They 
have taught me many things. They have taught me humility. They 
have taught me what it means to fear the Lord. The Lord does hear 
and answer their prayers. 

There is just one thing that happened on my mission that really 
cut deep into my heart, as well as the hearts of all the missionaries and 
friends in that mission, and that was when the members of this Church 
refused to obey the counsel of President Grant. When I tell you, my 
brethren and sisters, that we had friends in the Tahitian Mission who 
would have wagered large sums of money that Utah and the Mormons 
would have stayed with prohibition, I am just expressing it mildly. I 
was acquainted with a banker in that town who was the most influential 
man there, and he told me and told others that there was no question, 
although the other forty-seven states might go wet, but that Utah would 
still maintain the principles which this Church teaches. It was a very 
discouraging, heart-breaking time when the news came to us that Utah 
had fallen in line with the rest of them, and disobeyed the admonition 
of the President of this Church. 

It happened that one of the missionaries of the Reorganized Church 
was at the mission home at that time, listening to the broadcast over K. S. 
L. When the returns came in that man almost wept. Although he had no 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



love for the authorities of our Church, still he felt that something was 
giving way. We all felt that way. 

I want to say, in conclusion, that I know this Gospel is the truth, 
that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of the Lord, and that Brigham 
Young was indeed an inspired instrument in the hands of the Lord to 
lead his people after the death of the Prophet, and so on down to our 
present prophet and seer, President Heber J. Grant. I know that he is 
the mouthpiece of the Lord in this dispensation. That has been made 
known to me, and I know for a fact that he is the Lord's anointed in 
this dispensation. 

Shortly after I returned from my first mission — I have never said 
this before in public, but I feel to say it now; it will take just a few 
moments — it was shortly after I returned from my first mission, in 
1919, that the general authorities gave out instructions concerning a 
temple ordinance. The recommendations caused quite a bit of con- 
troversy, and several of my friends at first could hardly see the wisdom 
of it. I too worried about it considerably, though I did not say much. 
I remember one night, around two o'clock in the morning, I found 
myself sitting up in bed. I had been weeping, and my wife asked me 
what was the matter. This is the thing that I experienced. I don't 
know whether I was asleep or not, but a voice came to me as clear as 
any voice I have ever heard in my life. It said : "Thou shalt not speak 
evil of the Lord's anointed." That was the thing that comforted me. 
I have a testimony and I know that as long as we adhere to the 
admonition given us by President Grant and those associated with him, 
we shall not go astray. 

My prayer to our Heavenly Father is that he may bless us all, 
that we may support those who are in high positions, those who have 
jurisdiction over this church, that we may give them our support and 
be loyal to them. I humbly ask these blessings, with all others that we 
stand in need of, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, Jr. 

Former President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am delighted to have this opportunity. I 
was released from presiding over the Texas Mission some six months 
ago, but I feel grateful to the Lord for the privilege I had of laboring as 
a missionary there. 

I am grateful for the knowledge I have that this is the work of the 
Lord. During the past six months I have had the opportunity of visit- 
ing among the people and of speaking virtually every Sunday. I have 
been invited to speak at five different funerals. I have enjoyed very 
much being home among the Latter-day Saints. I am grateful, my 
brethren and sisters, for the testimony I have, and for the knowledge 
that has come to me that this is indeed the work of the Lord. 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 



37 



"Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret 
unto his servants, the prophets." Oh, how I rejoice in the testimony 
that has come to me that these men whom we sustain as our general 
authorities are indeed prophets, seers and revelators to this Church and 
people — a marvelous thing, my brethren and sisters. 

The other day, when I was going out on the mountain, I heard a 
noise. I looked, and a large deer jumped and gave a little snort. I 
looked a little farther along the ridge and I could see eight more deer 
bounding off into the quaking asp, and I thought that the Lord in his 
kindness had placed sentinels even among the animals and those of his 
lesser creations. 

How important it is and how grateful we should be as members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that the Lord has 
placed sentinels, has given us authorities in the wards and stakes who 
represent the Master, and above all, that we have a prophet, seer and 
revelator who stands at the head of the Church. I am just as confident 
as that I live, that the Lord our God will reveal unto him his mind and 
will pertaining to this great and important work. 

I have been impressed with this conference. I have enjoyed very 
much each and every one of the testimonies. I was thrilled this morning 
with the message of President Grant — as I always am — when I heard 
him bear his fervent testimony as to how the Lord had blessed him in 
body and in mind all these fifty-three years that he has been serving 
this people. 

May the Lord bless us. May we live our religion. May we prove 
to the world that we are indeed God's chosen people, I humbly pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DON MACK DALTON 

Former President of the South African Mission 

I anticipated, my brethren and sisters, that I might be called upon, 
timid though I feel in this position. I hope I may be able to say something 
relative to the Lord's work in South Africa that may be edifying to the 
people who are gathered close to the authorities of the Church here in 
Zion. 

The South African Mission, as you might understand, is the most 
distant mission in the world from the authorities of the Church. It takes 
thirty days to get a letter to an elder down there, and it takes even longer 
for an elder to travel that distance. We have not very many elders in 
that land, but I am sure that the ones who are there do about as much 
missionary work as any missionaries in the world. 

I am very proud of the young men who have been sent to that far-off 
land to teach the people the principles of the Gospel. With them, my 
wife and I have been grateful for the splendid labors of our predecessors ; 
and to my immediate predecessor, President Samuel Martin, I desire to 
pay a tribute of honor, because that man lost everything he had and 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his health and strength, after he returned home. I have not seen him 
since, but he did a marvelous and great labor. When I received word 
that I would be released and that President LeGrande Backman would 
succeed me, I felt greatly comforted, because he is a noble and good man. 
I am sure President Grant acted under the inspiration of the Lord when 
he sent him there. 

The people of that mission are wonderful and our members are 
loyal and faithful. About forty per cent of them pay tithing. During 
the six years I had the honor to preside there, there was 129 per cent 
increase in the mission membership. Upon my arrival there were 596 
members on the records. This included children blessed. We rejoiced 
greatly because we felt that the people accepted our message. 

We had various methods of doing missionary work. We used 
motorcycles to some extent. We realized that we had to get to the 
people in order to teach them the Gospel, and the quickest way was 
none too quick. We stressed Book of Mormon contests in various forms, 
such as reading contests. Many people there, like the people here, had 
never read the Book of Mormon through. We stressed Book of Mor- 
mon selling contests, and in this way we got the people to cooperate 
with us in spreading the Gospel. We also held a meeting contest be- 
tween the Districts and likewise a membership contest. We formed 
small organizations in remote places, in order to give to all the privileges 
in the Church that they deserve. 

We had conventions of the elders every year, so that we would 
know exactly what we were counting as tracting, counting as visiting 
saints, and so forth. We tried to labor as one unit. 

We found that in order to gain publicity we had to do something that 
was a bit different. On one occasion my wife and I were attending a 
foot-ball game. Two universities of that great nation were competing. 
The bands were playing; people were yelling; and all at once the 
athletes marched into the field. They stood in perfect alignment. Sud- 
denly everything became silent, and a grave dignified gentleman marched 
forth to shake hands with the athletes. 

Who was he? The Earl of Athlone, the Governor General of 
South Africa, the brother of Queen Mary of England. The majesty 
of the great kingdom of Great Britain was present. 

This silence seemed to strike me and I thought, if only something 
could be done in some kind of way to get such a great man to recognize a 
few Mormons. A little poem came into my mind. The author I do not 
know. 

Some one said that it couldn't be done, 

But he, with a chuckle, replied, 
That maybe it couldn't, but he'd be one 

Who wouldn't say so until he tried. 
So he buckled in with a bit of a grin 

On his face, if he worried he hid it, 
He started to sing as he tackled the thing 

That couldn't be done, and he did it. 



ELDER DON MACK D ALTON 



39 



Some one said, Oh, you'll never do that, 

At least no one has ever done it; 
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat, 

And the first thing we knew he'd begun it. 
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin, 

Without any doubting or "quit it," 
He started to sing as he tackled the thing 

That couldn't be done, and he did it. 

It seemed that as I looked for an opportunity, as time passed, all at 
once the thought of baseball came into the minds of the people. We 
organized a team among the missionaries and began to get write-ups. 
Suddenly baseball began to take precedence over the national game of 
cricket, until soon we were playing to nice crowds. The newspapers 
that previously would give us no recognition whatsoever, began to 
write about the Mormon missionaries, to tell the people something 
about us. What did it mean? It meant that we were gaining the 
confidence of the people. And then we had a great match game 
against Transvaal, the land of gold. The other team came to Cape- 
town to play. All was ready. Here were six missionaries, with other 
baseball players, lined out in front of a tremendous grand-stand filled 
with spectators, and amid the stillness that prevailed the Governor- 
General of that great land shook hands with six Mormon missionaries. 
A similar occurrence took place last March. 

This impressed the people so much that upon my departure one of 
the big business men of that town came to my wife and me, and he said : 
"Mr. Dalton, you do not know what a great thing you have. It is the 
greatest thing in all this world. Anything that will make young men do 
as your young men do is the greatest thing on this earth." 

I was very much pleased to find, as we went along in our work, that 
the Lord blessed us, and though we were far away from the authorities 
of the Church, and were lacking their advice in many particulars, the 
Lord answered the prayers of the missionaries and myself. 

My wife and I, while returning home, made a trip around the 
world and visited very many nations. While in Italy we had the distinc- 
tion of visiting the Pope of Rome and the Vatican, and seeing the marvel- 
ous earthly power of that great dominion. We also visited Greece and 
Turkey, and then went into Syria and Palestine and saw the Armenian 
saints, who are doing a faithful work, under President Piranian. We 
found in Palestine need for great improvement. Jerusalem is a hill of 
rocks, it seems to me. May the Lord bless that country. It needs it 
greatly. 

While going over that great land of Africa I could appreciate how 
hard the authorities of this Church have to work. With the little pre- 
siding capacity that I had I sometimes felt fatigued with the constant roll 
of the car wheels under my ears as I traveled for thousands and thou- 
sands of miles, trying to reach the people. I thought of what the author- 
ities of the Church have to undergo in order to reach the people as they 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



do, visiting the wards and stakes and missions and holding meetings with 
them. Let me tell you that these great men are the hardest-worked men 
in all this world, I believe, and we should sympathize with them, and do 
what they say, and comfort them, and I am sure we will not go amiss. 

In my heart there rings a melody. I am thrilled constantly with 
my testimony of the Gospel. I know that the Gospel is true, that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, that President Grant is his legal successor 
in office. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I felt it in every part ot my 
body when I visited his birthplace in Bethlehem. 

Oh, if we could only realize more fully the truthfulness of the Gos- 
pel, and put it into our lives effectively, so that other people might recog- 
nize the truth by reason of what we do and say, I am sure that those not 
of our faith would have greater friendship for us. Why ? Because they 
would have more confidence in us, and we cannot get friendship before 
we get confidence. 

May the Lord bless us, I ask, in his name, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am deeply impressed with this vast assembly of worshippers, and 
it has brought to my mind an incident in the life of the Master con- 
cerning his interview with the woman of Samaria at Jacob's Well. He 
departed from Jerusalem to return to his native Galilee. He was weary 
with his journey. He arrived at Jacob's Well about noon and rested 
on the curb of the well while some of his disciples went into the village 
to buy food. While they were away, a woman came to draw water from 
the well, and Jesus said to her, "Give me to drink." She expressed sur- 
prise that a Jew should ask her for a drink, she being a Samaritan, for, 
as she said, the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans. During the 
conversation the Master said that whoever drank of the water of the 
well would thirst again, but whoever drank of the water that he would 
give should never thirst, for the water would be in him as a well of 
water springing up into everlasting life. The conversation continued, 
and, because of his statement regarding her past life, she was impelled to 
say, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet." 

The woman then brought up the age-old question of worship, and 
this is the subject which I desire to call to your attention. She said : 

Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; [meaning Gerizim] and ye 
say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship 

The Master answered her : 

Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this 
mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, worship the Father. 

Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salva- 
tion is of the Jews. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



41 



The Jews had a system of worship based on the knowledge of God 
and his attributes given to them through their leaders and prophets of old. 
The Samaritans accepted only the five Books of Moses. They were 
without an authorized priesthood and had drifted somewhat into idola- 
try. Jesus continued : 

The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall 
worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to 
worship him. 

God is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in- spirit 
and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 

No doubt the Master intended to convey in these words that the 
worship of the Father should not be confined to Jerusalem or to the 
synagogues of the Jews, or to Samaria, but that wherever his Gospel 
was preached, the Father should be worshipped in spirit and in truth. 

Worship comes to us from two Anglo-Saxon words meaning 
worthy-ship. The more comprehensive our knowledge of the object of 
our worship, the more intelligent and sincere will be our devotion to 
him. It is inborn in man to worship, but true worship is the spiritual life 
of the soul. It is sweet communion with God. To worship in spirit 
and in truth is to worship in meekness, humility, and sincerity. 

We have not been left in doubt as to whom to worship. The Master 
when tempted of Satan said : 

For it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only 
shalt thou serve. 

In this day, as recorded in Section 20 of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, the statement is made : 

And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of 
Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on 
his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God. 

We give homage and reverence in our worship to our Father in 
heaven in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. 

Worship may take place in the mountains, in the forests, by the 
water's edge, as well as in our homes. However, I wish to direct our 
attention to worship in the chapels or buildings of the Latter-day Saints 
that are used for sacred purposes. The Lord has commanded us to go 
to the house of prayer on his Holy Day and there offer up our oblations 
and prayers unto him and partake of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper 
in remembrance of the sacrifice of our Savior, and to covenant that we 
will keep his commandments that we may have his Spirit to be with us. 
This sacrament meeting is the basic meeting of the Church, and all who 
have reached the age of accountability are required to attend. 

In order that we may have the Spirit of the Lord with us, and feel 
its impressions, our conduct must be in keeping with the occasion. We 
should maintain an attitude of worship and reverence from the time we 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



enter the chapel until the services are closed with the "Amen" of the 
benediction. Until the meeting opens, our conversation, if any, should 
be subdued and consist of a friendly greeting only. Children should sit 
with their parents, for parents are responsible for the orderly conduct 
of their children. We should always bear in mind that our worship will 
not be acceptable to God unless we approach him on this solemn occasion 
with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, which I interpret as humility, 
meekness, and sincerity. 

Recently I attended a sacramental meeting where there was the true 
spirit of worship. The members of the ward entered the chapel quietly, 
while soft music was rendered. The hymns sung by the congregation 
and selections given by the ward choir were sacred in character. The 
prayers were appropriate to the occasion. The sacrament was adminis- 
tered in an orderly manner and in the spirit of solemnity and reverence. 
We were fed the bread of life in an address on a principle of the Gospel. 
Here we truly worshipped the Lord in spirit and in truth. 

Our ward meeting houses are the centers of social life of the com- 
munity. Many of our places of worship are of necessity used for 
meetings other than sacramental services. They are also used for recrea- 
tional purposes. Even in these meetings, in order that the spirit of the 
Lord may be present, our conduct should be orderly and in harmony 
with the spirit of the purpose for which the building was erected. There 
should be reverence not only for the occasion, but for the place. 

Carlyle has said : "No greater calamity can befall a nation than the 
loss of worship." Then, we should go to the house of the Lord with 
the spirit of worship in our hearts, and our minds prepared for com- 
munion with God. The hymns of praise, the prayers of thanksgiving, 
the words of exhortation and comfort, and the testimonies of the restored 
Gospel will fill our hearts with appreciation if we enter that place of 
worship in the right spirit. 

Through this worship there will come into our hearts greater faith. 
We shall receive courage to go forward in life's duties. We shall renew 
our covenants with the Lord. We shall be brought nearer to God and 
to our fellowmen. We shall acquire a deeper understanding of the 
Gospel. There will come a sense of gratitude for the atonement of our 
Savior, for the restoration of the Gospel, for the holy priesthood, for 
the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, for our membership in the 
Church, and for opportunities to render service in the cause of God. 

My soul is filled with thankfulness for the many blessings which 
are mine. I know that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of God. I am happy to be counted worthy to hold the priest- 
hood, to be a member of the Church, to partake of the blessings of the 
Gospel, and to be of service to God and my fellowmen. I feel that our 
meeting houses are places of worship. They are sacred to me. No 
matter what meeting of the Church is being held in that place of wor- 
ship, I feel that I am on holy ground. 

May we as an assembly of worshippers renew our determination to 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



43 



have greater reverence for our houses of worship and by example and 
precept influence others to have more reverence for these sacred places 
and to worship God as he has commanded, in spirit and in truth, or, in 
other words, in meekness, humility, and deep sincerity, I ask in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We express our gratitude and appreciation to the Summit Stake 
Choir and to their conductor, Sister Judith Anderson Beard, for their 
beautiful music. 

An anthem, "Arouse, O ye mortals," was sung by the Choir. 
Elder A. Carlos Schow, President of the Lehi Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning, October 5. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The third session of the Conference convened at 10 o'clock a. m., 
Saturday, October 5. 

President Grant announced that the music for this session would be 
furnished by the Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direction of 
Sister Charlotte O. Sackett. 

The congregation and the Relief Society Singing Mothers sang the 
hymn, "Come, come, ye saints." 

Elder Fred G. Taylor, President of the New York Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

A contralto solo, "Seraphic," (Rubenstein) was sung by Mrs. Bessie 
Morley, assisted by the Singing Mothers chorus ; violin obligato by Pro- 
fessor William M. Hardiman. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in this glorious privilege of 
meeting with you in this great conference of the Church. I have been 
inspired by what has been said and earnestly desire that I may con- 
tinue in the same wonderful spirit that has characterized the remarks 
of the brethren up to this moment. 

RAPID CHANGES NOTED 

By reason of some impressions that I have received in visits to 
some of the missions during the past season since our last conference, 
and having had the great privilege of being present at the dedication of 
the monument at the Hill Cumorah, and by reason of some conversa- 
tions which I had with some distinguished gentlemen who drove many 
miles to come to that dedication and asked earnestly concerning the 
Church, I have felt that the changes that are occurring are so rapid that 
we can probably scarcely appreciate them, being so close to them, and 
then perhaps we do not fully understand the meaning and significance 
of these changes. 

I have been led to appreciate the work of our forefathers, who 
subdued this desert and made it blossom as the rose, and distinguished 
themselves and have won great honor and credit from the world, every- 
where where people have studied the achievements of the pioneers.

COMMUNITY LIFE AMONG THE MORMONS 

I read in a book recently published by Mr. Warren H. Wilson, who 
discusses rural community life in America, the following introduction 
by Professor Thomas Nixon Carver of Harvard University, one of the 
outstanding economists of the world. Speaking of those elements which 
have made for ideal rural community life, Mr. Carver states: 

The elements of permanent cultivation of the soil are found in great 
numbers among the Mormons, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians and Pennsyl- 
vania Germans. * * * 

The best farmers in the country are the Mormons, the Scotch Presby- 
terians and Pennsylvania Germans. 

Then Mr. Wilson in his book says: 

The Mormons represent this organization, these outstanding farmers 
of America, in the highest degree. Perhaps no other so large or so power- 
ful a body of united farmers is found in the whole country. 

They have turned the force of religion into a community-making 
power, and from the highest to the lowest of their church officers the 
Mormon people are devoted to agriculture as a mode of living. 

The Mormons are organized by an idea and by the power of leader- 
ship. They have recruited their population through preachers and mission- 
aries. This new population is woven at once into the fabric of the com- 
munity ; they are married to the community. 

The organization on which the Mormon community is based becomes 
embodied at once in a society with its own modes of religious, family, 
and moral feeling and thought. 

The Mormons are consolidated both by formal organization and by 
instinctive preference for their own in a multitude of cooperative habits, 
through which they build up their communities and contend with one 
another against their economic and religious opponents. It is not enough 
to say that this is clannishness ; it is a mingling of kinship and religious 
preferences. It constitutes the strongest form of agricultural cooperation 
to be found in the United States. 



BUILDING AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION 

From this very pulpit I heard, as some of you did, this same dis- 
tinguished gentleman, Mr. Carver, say, after having spent two summers 
in Utah at the Utah State Agricultural College, that "the philosophy of 
life involved in the Mormon Church is the most constructive thing I have 
seen in American life." He sees only "a church which embraces the 
whole state and has a tremendous pragmatic value for its adherents, so 
well is it organized, so much is it the center of all community pleasure, 
and so closely does it endeavor to establish heaven on earth." 

And he continued : "I have never found more sound and wholesome 
personal habits than among the Mormons. I have never mingled with 
people who showed fewer signs of dissipation. I have never studied 
groups of people who seemed better nourished and more healthful. I 
have never known people who took more pains to educate their children.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"This gives a clue to the success of the Mormons as colonizers and 
nation builders." 

Further he said that if he were hunting the whole world over to 
find some one building an advanced civilization, he would come and 
learn of it here in Utah from the Mormons. 

NEW DAY REQUIRES FURTHER DEMONSTRATION 

Now, that period is past. We have subdued the desert. We have 
distinguished ourselves, at least our fathers have, in doing this remark- 
able and unusual thing. As President Theodore Roosevelt said from 
this very pulpit : "It is not so much what you Mormons did as where 
you did it that distinguished you." But this generation cannot exist on 
the honors of the past. We must make our own contribution. 

And now it appeals to me that we have moved to a new day, the day 
to build upon that foundation, a day of demonstration, and I believe that 
this is in full harmony with the Lord's program. Let me read to you 
from the 45th Section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants this 
injunction the Lord gave to his Church : 

I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world to be a light 
to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to 
seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before 
me. 

And in the 115th Section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
given in April, 1838 the Lord, among other things, said: 

Verily I say unto you all [speaking to the Church] : Arise and shine 
forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations. 

THE CHURCH A STANDARD FOR THE NATIONS 

And in the 103rd Section, in a revelation given in one of the dark 
hours of the Church, following those days of expulsion from Jackson 
County, Missouri, February 1834, the Lord said : 

But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my 
people shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the 
counsel which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them. 

Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine 
enemies from this very hour. 

And, [here are the conditions of this marvelous promise] by hearken- 
ing to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall speak 
unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world 
are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to 
possess it forever and ever. 

But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not to 
observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against 
them. 

For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors 
of men. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

I am impressed, therefore, that we ought to be conscious of a new, 
or at least an enlarged responsibility, not only the responsibility to adhere 
to this Mormon way of life that was set forth yesterday by all the 
brethren as different from the way of life that men ordinarily follow 
in the world, for the personal benefits and blessings that come to the 
individual certainly, but also there is another reason why we ought to 
live this Mormon way of life. It is for the world's sake. It is for the 
Lord's sake. He did set us to be a light — we haven't aspired to it — but 
by divine appointment we are set to be the light of the world and to 
exalt here standards for the nations, that the promises of old might be 
some day fulfilled, when men would say : 

"Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the 
house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will 
walk in his paths." For that is the purpose of this Church, to become 
a standard for the nations. 

WORLD-WIDE NEED OF MORMONISM 

It does seem to me in our new opportunities that the Lord has been 
at work breaking down the prejudice of the past. Oh, how I rejoice 
that those who have fought against us, that the powers of evil that have 
arrayed every force with which they have successfully destroyed every 
other gospel dispensation have utterly failed, and that our fathers, who 
were able to stand like beaten anvils under all the fire that was hurled 
against them, have survived and given evidence that they were in God's 
favor because they have succeeded. 

And now comes, I say, a new opportunity, the day of demonstra- 
tion, when the world is fast losing its faith. When I think of a great 
nation like Russia turning entirely away from Christianity, and the 
great nation of Germany, that contributed perhaps more to the establish- 
ment of religious liberty and the establishment of Protestantism than 
any other nation in the world, turning away from Christianity, and 
some there are trying to introduce a religion, in some respects pagan, 
and other nations being influenced by the same spirit — I discover a need 
for Mormonism in the world, and it is apparent that men are beginning 
to realize it more than ever before. 

WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH CHRISTIANITY? 

In a book recently published entitled "Why Wars Must Cease," 
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, one of the leading American women pioneers 
in the great woman's movement of the world, says: 

The threat of hostilities challenges Christian statesmanship which, 
heretofore, has found itself helpless to prevent war. 

Wars did not decrease after the advent of the Christian era ; Instead, 
they grew more terrible, each more bloody and destructive than the 
previous one. 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The most startling fact about the World War is that it was a 
Christian war. Christian nations began it, Christian nations led on both 
sides, and kept it going until the bitter end. 

She asks : 

What is the matter with Christianity? We have waited nineteen 
hundred years for Christianity to reach the zenith of its power in wealth 
and in membership, and then we found it utterly helpless to save the 
world from one of its greatest catastrophes, war. 

POWER OF GODLINESS LACKING 

And war comes out of the spirit of men, the spirit of greed, the 
spirit of selfishness and of hatred, all of which the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ could eliminate from the hearts of men. 

In this very hour in a mighty Christian nation, where there is the 
seat of the largest Christian denomination of the world, the members 
of that church, not listening to the pleadings of their own leader for 
peace, are waging one of the most unjust wars that was ever inaugurated 
against a poor and defenseless people, and all to gratify the vain ambi- 
tions of those whose hearts are filled, not with the spirit of the Master, 
the spirit of love, but with greed and with hatred. 

What does it all indicate? It proclaims that what the Lord Jesus 
Christ said to Joseph Smith more than a hundred years ago is true, 
that these institutions built in his name have a form of godliness but 
they lack the power thereof. 

I do not condemn my brethren of other Christian churches. Among 
them I find many noble and great men, whose hearts are set upon doing 
right, but they struggle helplessly to accomplish the things their hearts 
desire. To me they are in institutions that have the form but not the 
power that was in the Church of Christ as he originally endowed it, 
and so I have no spirit to criticize them. 

DEMONSTRATORS FOR GOD 

What I rejoice over is that with the new day that is coming, the 
works of this people, speaking in mighty tones, will attract the attention 
of the thinkers of the world that here is something more than a theory, 
for there are those willing to follow theories in Russia and in Germany 
and elsewhere ; but here is a plan advocated by this Church that would 
meet and solve every human problem, if only the Latter-day Saints and 
the world would subscribe to it, the Lord's plan for human happiness and 
the elimination of war and distress and there are a hundred years of 
practical demonstration behind our theory. It does work. 

Therefore I see a new reason why every Latter-day Saint should 
live up to the Word of Wisdom. Do you want to produce a nation of 
men and women perfect physically in this age when the world is 
troubled, and tomorrow will be more seriously troubled by the painful 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



49 



effects of disregarding the Lord's plan of life? Do you want to dis- 
tinguish yourselves ? You will never do it by living like the world lives. 
You are demonstrators for God and are to save the world from its 
utter loss of faith in Jesus Christ as the Redeemer and Savior of man- 
kind. 

SOLUTION OF WORLD'S PROBLEMS IN CHURCH PLAN 

Do we want to save the world from its economic troubles and 
distresses ? Behold the Lord's plan, this principle of fasting which the 
Lord has given us, that once a month we abstain from food. Oh, what 
a splendid exercise that is to obtain spiritual control over the physical 
desires of men and make our contribution ! If every Latter-day Saint 
had lived up to that law of the Lord, supplemented by the law of tithing, 
that perfect, that just law — just to the rich as well as to the poor — we 
would have been the only people in the United States who would not 
have been on relief. 

Do not imagine that the world's problems are going to be solved 
by the schemes of men. They will be solved and solved permanently, 
not by one class filled with hatred toward another, but by love and 
brotherhood, in which every man makes his contribution, rich and poor 
alike, for the common well-being of mankind, that is found alone in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

WE SHALL BE DIFFERENT 

When that time comes— and it is here now — we shall need the 
strength of the pioneer, the strength to live up to our moral standards, 
to maintain the Mormon way of life, to enter into marriage that binds 
us in love and fellowship and union for time and for all eternity, and 
have children, the heritage of the Lord, to bless that marriage. Then 
we shall be different from the world that is fast drifting into divorce, 
into childless marriages, and attract the attention of the world. 

If you want to distinguish yourselves keep the commandments of 
God and you will find blessings personally and we will be teaching a 
lesson, holding aloft the standards that will attract good men and good 
women elsewhere and they will come to learn of our ways and to walk 
in our paths. 

The Lord has also enjoined upon us the responsibility of being our 
brother's keeper, of being men and women who are bound in love. It 
is inspiring to me when I think of this demonstration, men and women 
from all parts of the world brought into this Church, amalgamated into 
one people in the great melting pot in glorious America, with love 
existing in the hearts of these men and women of all nations. If the 
same spirit that is in your hearts were in the hearts of the people of all 
the nations of the earth there couldn't be any war. There would be no 
need of parliaments to reduce armament. Peace would come to men. 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This demonstration, I say, is one of the unusual things that is and will 
attract the attention of men everywhere. 

So I feel a new interest should awaken in the heart of every Lat- 
ter-day Saint towards the world, and by adhering to these standards of 
living, as the Lord has enjoined us, we can solve the problems for our- 
selves and be ready to demonstrate before the world. I fear that the 
world will be looking to us long before some of us are ready. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND DESTINY 

Oh, I pray you, my brethren and sisters who are on the dole, get 
off relief just as soon as you can. If you don't you will be thrown off 
and it will be a sorry day when that time comes. Get off and get on 
your own feet. Let us all, rich and poor alike, band together to show 
the world that Christianity has been weighed in the balance and found 
wanting, for it is not vested with the power of God that once was in 
the Church of Christ, that a great apostasy has swept over the earth, 
and that men have a form of godliness but they lack the power. It is 
our responsibility to show a doubtful and skeptical world that there is 
power, there is strength, there is ability in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints to fulfil all the expectations of the Master and here 
establish a people that shall be the light of the world, the salt of the earth. 

God help us to keep our eyes upon our destiny. God give us the 
strength to meet the situation, to conquer and master and overcome the 
flesh and subscribe to these standards of living, for the great joy that 
shall be ours who participate in it, and then in the day when from the 
ends of the earth people shall come to learn of our ways we will not be 
ashamed for them to come close unto us and look upon us and learn of 
our ways. It will be harder to conquer ourselves than to subdue the 
desert. 

God help us and prepare us to fulfil in our day, as gloriously as our 
fathers did in their day, the assignment that now is ours, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, the sight which greets one's eyes 
from this pulpit is indeed inspiring and leads one to thoughts which are 
beyond, perhaps, his ordinary manner and way of thinking. 

As I listened to the beautiful discourse which was given just a few 
moments ago by our beloved apostle Melvin J. Ballard, I thought of 
the masterful things which have been accomplished by our forefathers, 
the things which have been done by those pioneers laboring here in that 
barren wilderness which they found. I thought of the hauling and 
hewing of the rocks for that great Temple, and the delicate work of the 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



51 



blessed hands of those masters who have passed and gone, who laid 
the foundations of this building and reared it even to the time when 
you and I should enjoy it as we now are enjoying it. 

This congregation speaks wonderfully and well of the things which 
the forefathers gave unto vis, that we might go on and carry forward the 
work which was in their hearts and in their minds, even to the day when 
God should say: "It is well done." 

Speaking one day to his disciples, Jesus Christ said to them : 

Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. 
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask, and ye shall receive, 
that your joy may be full. 

And then, turning to his disciples, after having told them that he 
came to the earth and was to return to his Father, he said : 

Do ye now believe? 

Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, 
every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, 
because the Father is with me. 

So I am led to think, and feel, that the Father has been with this 
people ever since the cradle days of 1830, when that little handful of 
people came westward and builded, as you now see, the praiseworthy 
things that have been moulded by them. 

God has always been a jealous God, blessing those who relied upon 
him and who paid attention to the commandments which he, through 
his servants, throughout all ages of the world has given. Do you recall 
in the old days, that great servant of the Lord who led the hosts of 
Syria, how he, being afflicted with leprosy, after having come back 
from his victorious march, was told by a little maiden, .who was a 
captive, that God, the Lord, the Father of all, could heal and cure him? 
So we find him presenting himself, with his horses and his chariots, 
at the door of Elisha, and this great and mighty prophet saying to him 
to go and bathe himself seven times in the River Jordan. Then Naaman, 
being rebellious, said: "No, there are better streams in my land. Why 
bathe in the River Jordan?" Yet those who surrounded him prevailed 
upon him and he went and bathed in the River Jordan, with the result 
that he was healed completely. Coming back he said : 

Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. 

God Almighty has prepared the way for this people. He will open 
up avenues for us that we have never dreamed of. He will lead us before 
the people of the world in such a way and in such a manner that they, 
paying attention to the things which we do through the keeping of the 
commandments of the Lord, and obeying his word, shall give praise 
unto God, our Eternal Father. 

I know the difficulties, I know the troubles and I know the distress 
with which some of us are faced. I see these things as I go from place 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to place, up and down these great stretches. Yet, as God says through 
the Prophet Amos, "I have given you cleanness of teeth in all your 
cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet have ye not returned unto 
me. 

I say unto you that God can and will relieve us of our burdens. 
Remember the days when the Psalmist said that, "He raiseth up the poor 
out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill ; that he may 
set him with princes." 

All things are possible through work, — hard work — and a reliance 
upon our Lord God. I think there is nothing that can not be accom- 
plished by this people, and that will not be accomplished by them, if, 
however, we will but put our trust in God, if we will but go back to the 
old principles which were given us by our leaders from the very com- 
mencement, when that great man, Brigham Young, taught us to be 
frugal, to work, to strive, and that the glory and the honor of honest 
work was godly in its nature. 

If we will return to those ways, then at the same time, with humble, 
contrite hearts, pray, not to our father who is in Washington, but to 
our Father who is in heaven, — if these things shall be done by this people 
we shall arise until we will have climaxed and brought about those 
beautiful things which Brother Ballard has suggested to us. 

God grant us the ability and the power and the courage to carry on 
and to do those things which from time to time are told us of the Lord, 
through his servants, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "Holy Redeemer," was sung by the Relief Society Sing- 
ing Mothers ; Lucy Gates Bowen, soloist ; Lydia White Boothby, harp- 
ist ; William Hardiman, violinist. 

The congregation then sang the hymn, "School thy feelings, O m; 
brother." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Grant announced that the choir and congregation would 
sing the hymn, "School thy feelings, O my brother." This hymn, the 
President said, was written by Elder Charles W. Penrose after he had 
given ten years of his life as a missionary, without purse or scrip. When 
he started on his mission he lent his furniture to the British Mission, and 
after completing ten years of missionary work he took back his battered 
furniture, it having been used by the elders during this time, and sold 
it to get money with which to help him immigrate to Utah. He was 
accused of stealing the furniture out of the British Mission home. He 
went home and wrote this hymn for his own consolation. 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



53 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

I am very much pleased, my brethren and sisters, to have this 
privilege of standing before you for a few moments to report the 
Canadian Mission. I feel it a great honor that has come to me, and I 
deeply sense that there is also a great responsibility attached to that 
honor. I sincerely pray that I may fulfil that responsibility with some 
degree of success. 

I have enjoyed very much the three and a half months I have spent 
in the Canadian Mission. Sister Rich and I have been happy there. We 
have felt the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon our work. I am 
pleased at this time to bring to you greetings from the missionaries and 
the saints in the Canadian Mission, and should like to say to the parents 
of those young men and women who are lahoring in that mission, that 
I may not get to see personally, that I have seen them all within the 
last three weeks, and they are well, both physically and spiritually. 

It has been a wonderful testimony to me as to the truth of the Gos- 
pel, to see what influence the Church has on these good young people 
when they devotedly put their time and attention to it. The develop- 
ment and growth that comes into their lives is beautiful, and to me it is 
further testimony of the wonderful fruits of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 

The saints in Canada are scattered through wide areas. They envy 
you brethren and sisters in Utah the privilege you have of associating 
with great numbers. In many places the saints are isolated, a family 
here and a family there. In some cases they get to see a Latter-day Saint 
only once in a year, and that only when an elder may call. It is always 
a joy and a happiness to us to find them still faithful. When such saints 
go to their little treasure chest and bring out the tithing they have saved 
carefully for a year, and we ask them: "How, in this time of stress, 
could you do this ?" .they have said : "Many times we have had to bor- 
row it, but it is a joy and a happiness to show this evidence of our faith 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ." 

I have been interested very much in another fruit of Mormonism 
that I have seen since I have been in the Canadian Mission. It is in con- 
nection with the young people with whom I have worked all my life. 
I have seen the benefit and advantage of the training we have here in 
Utah, in our auxiliary organizations, in our church schools and in our 
seminaries. I have seen young people join the Church in Canada, in 
the various branches, with just as fine faith, just as fine young people 
as we have in Utah, but they lack the experience and the development 
that comes through these organizations. As I have seen this growth, and 
as I have traveled here and there and found that the young people in 
the world are open-minded, that they are anxious to receive the truth, I 
have thought of our young people here at home, and the great responsi- 
bility that is devolving upon them to carry the Gospel message to the 
world. 

Many of the people of the world are not open to the truths of the 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Gospel of Jesus Christ. Their minds are closed. They sometimes are 
afraid of the truth, illustrated very much by a lady I met in Nova Scotia. 
When she was invited to attend our meeting she said : "I would like to 
but I daren't, for fear of the criticism of my neighbors, and I don't know 
what my minister would say if I should attend your services." On the 
other hand, we have many fine people who, converted to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, do not care what the world says. Their minds are open 
to the truth, and they accept it and stand firmly for it. 

Typical of this type of individual is a young man who was training 
for the ministry and who became very much devoted to his church. He 
had influence with young people. He had gone here and there and 
gathered up seventeen young men that had never identified themselves 
with the church, and became their teacher. While he was their teacher 
in one of the Protestant churches of the world he met the Mormon 
missionaries. His mind was open and he received their message, but 
when he found such prejudice against him he still stayed with his 
teaching in the church he was with. His parents pleaded with him not to 
listen to the message, and then he bore this testimony : 

At one time, while he was in his church with these seventeen young 
men that he was teaching, around him, the choir sang that song, a line 
of which runs : "Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone" ; and he said 
he knew then that he must stand alone and that he must dare to be true 
to the convictions that he felt. He joined the Church and became the 
superintendent of our Sunday School and is doing a mighty fine work. 

As we travel here and there and see these signs I am reminded of 
what Channing Pollock, one of America's greatest playwrights, had to 
say, as recorded in the latest Readers' Digest, about the "World's Slow 
Stain." He said that we begin life in youth with our ideals high, our 
banners raised, and we feel that this divine man within us must assert 
himself. Then as we go on through life, little by little, he said, brick 
by brick, we are undermined until we are smeared by the world's slow 
stain and thus led off by detour signs from the ideals we set ourselves. 
He says, how beautiful it would be if, like one great playwright has 
written, we could be born old and grow younger and cleaner and then, 
as we approach the end of this life, we could come to that beautiful 
idealistic period of adolescence where our ideals are high and clean, and 
approach our life with God hereafter with our ideals still unstained. Yet, 
he says, with all this, and these detour signs attracting our young people 
away, there are evidences that the person who will keep his ideals high, 
who will refuse to be detracted by these detour signs, will have the 
world welcome him and the world honor him. 

Emerson is called the wisest American, and he, like the wisest 
European and the wisest Oriental, had it in his soul to make no com- 
promises. Being aware of his strength, he didn't have to seek for ap- 
plause or for money. We are told that the first book he wrote sold 
so few* copies that he lived on less than we pay our chauffeur, and yet 
he would not change his ideals to write the things the world was demand- 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



55 



ing. When he was invited to speak before the divinity school of one of 
our great institutions, and was literally pelted with critical brickbats, he 
was led to say, when they asked him what he would do about it, "I 
shall go right on seeing whatever I can and telling what I see." 

So today we honor men like Emerson, and they leave for us a story 
that should be worth while to the American youth, and especially to the 
youth of the Church of Jesus Christ, those of the noble birthright, that 
the world is looking to and the world is anxiously watching. Will the 
youth of Zion carry forth the ideals set by their ancestors in the great 
sacrifices they made ? It is my opinion that with the fine set-up we have, 
with the homes devoted to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, with our church 
school system and seminaries, that our young people will be able to hold 
high their ideals, and to so live that the world will be led to recognize 
that the youth of Zion, truly proud of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, will 
stand forth and uphold it even unto the end, regardless of what criticism 
may come. 

I am very happy indeed in my privilege to serve in this new capacity 
in -the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am happy also that the people who 
are converted to the Gospel in Canada are in love with you people, in 
love with Zion. How they look forward to coming and enjoying the 
privileges that are every day open to you, this privilege you have today 
of meeting with the authorities of the Church, that does not come to them 
only possibly once a year. When I think of Apostle Smoot's visit to us 
this last year, and how those people, many of them, came hundreds of 
miles to see him and shake hands with him ; the good he did them, and 
the honor they felt in having seen and talked with an Apostle, I think of 
the things that you enjoy in Utah that they do not enjoy out in the 
world. 

Many of those people are anxious to come to this great block and 
participate with the saints in the beauties that are here. We had 
several of our people come to Utah last summer, and I was so happy 
when they returned and said: "Oh, we found things in Utah beautiful, 
and among the most beautiful of the things we found were the saints. 
They were all we had expected to find them." They came home happy 
indeed with their visit here in Utah. 

These are the things that are telling the true story of Mormonism 
to the world. The people who visit us go back with honor and respect 
for our people and the things we stand for. I am proud to be a repre- 
sentative of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this new capacity, for I am 
receiving joy and happiness that I have not experienced before. 

I most sincerely pray that our Father in heaven will bless us here 
in Utah, that we may hold high the standards and ideals that have been 
set for us, that people who visit among us may continue to carry the 
report that was so beautifully illustrated by Brother Ballard this morning, 
and that it may spread wide that we are what we stand for, in our lives, 
in our ideals, as well as in our teachings. I pray that the Lord's 
choicest blessings may be with us all, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I earnestly pray that I may be guided and directed by the Spirit of 
the Lord during the few moments that I occupy here this morning. 

I am deeply impressed with the great drama that is being enacted 
upon this world's stage. Shakespeare tells us that "all the world's a 
stage, and all the men and women merely players." It is a wonderful 
thing that is taking place before our very eyes. This drama is one of 
great importance to every man, woman and child. 

There was a prologue to this drama, enacted in heaven before the 
foundations of this earth were laid. In this prologue the purpose of 
the Almighty with reference to his sons and daughters who had been 
begotten of him in the spirit before the world was made, was vividly 
portrayed — unfolding the divine plan of life and salvation — greatly to 
the delight of his children, especially those great and noble ones of that 
primeval day, the morning stars, for their hearts were filled with joy 
and gladness and they sang together in a mighty chorus and shouted for 
joy. Let me refer to scriptures which have a significant bearing on this 
thrilling episode of human history. That we were begotten of God in 
the spirit and that just such a prologue was enacted is clearly indicated 
in the following simple narratives in holy writ: 

And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, 
and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. (Gen. 4:1.) 

From this we may readily conclude that all children born to earthly 
parents are gotten from the Lord and that earthly fathers and mothers 
are the divinely appointed guardians of God's children, for he is the 
Father of our spirits and is appropriately addressed when we approach 
him in prayer as "Our Father in heaven." 

Again : 

Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and 
we gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection unto 
the Father of spirits, and live? (Heb. 12:9.) 

And again: 

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, 
if thou hast understanding. * * * 

When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted 
for joy? (Job 38:4, 7.) 

A fuller and more complete presentation of this prologue is set 
forth in the Book of Abraham : 3 :22-28 : 



Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was ; and among all these there were 
many of the noble and great ones ; 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said : These I will make my rulers ; for he stood 
among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he 
said unto me : Abraham, thcu art one of them ; thou wast chosen before 
thou wast born. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space there, 
and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell. 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them ; 

And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they 
who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom 
with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second 
estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. 

And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto 
the Sen of Man : Here am I, send me. And another answered and said : 
Here am I, send me. And he Lord said : I will send the first. 

And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that 
day, many followed after him. 

No wonder that there was rejoicing in heaven among the children 
of God upon hearing this marvelous proclamation. Those who kept 
their first estate were to be added upon. In other words, there was to 
be added to their immortal spirits these bodies of flesh and bones. All 
who now live upon this earth or ever have lived or shall live upon it are 
they who kept their first estate in the spirit world before the foundations 
of the earth were laid and are now to be given the opportunity of proving 
their fitness for celestial glory. To this end they are given the span 
of human life — a period of probation — to "prove them herewith, to see 
if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command 
them." All things whatsoever the Lord shall command are embodied 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and now if they keep their second estate 
or in other words, obey the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this probationary 
period, "they shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever." 

This is the covenant — the everlasting covenant which God made 
with his children in that primeval day while they were yet in the spirit 
and concerning which we read so much in the scriptures. With these 
glorious promises and the holy covenant by which God binds himself to 
us if we enter into it with him and keep the same inviolate, or in other 
words, keep our second estate, the curtain falls and the prologue is 
ended and the recollection of it is withheld. 

For a wise and glorious purpose, 
Thou hast placed me here on earth; 
And withheld the recollection 
Of my former friends and birth. 

The first act of this great drama was performed in the Garden of 
Eden. Among the features of that act, our eyes were to be opened. 
The recollection of our previous existence was withheld from us. Wp

were to be agents unto ourselves, and the peculiar part that each one of 
us had to play should be selected by ourselves. We had our free agency 
to act whatever part we would in the unfolding of this great drama. 
But before this could take place our eyes had to be opened; we had to 
receive the light, even the light of Christ, that enabled us to know good 
from evil, as we read in the Book of Mormon, in Chapter 7 of the Book 
of Moroni and in the 16th paragraph, where it says : 

For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he 
may know good from evil. 

That having been given to us, we were under obligation to walk in 
the light. Simultaneously with that experience came also the opposition 
which needs to be set up in order that we might be tried. How could 
we be tried unless there was opposition ? So Satan came also with his 
vile temptations, endeavoring to lead men and women away from God. 
Therein lies the whole purpose of human life and experience as it has 
to do with our lives, and every one of us must act our own part upon 
this stage. 

There are many acts that have been provided. Each one may be 
designated as a dispensation of God's providence among the children of 
men. They have been accompanied by an outpouring, a dispensation 
of God's goodness to his children in the effort to bring us back to him. 
The great hero, the great leader, the great captain of all these various 
dispensations is and always has been the first born of all the children of 
God, and the only-begotten of the Father in the flesh, namely, our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ. In the meridian of time in which his great act 
of atonement for the sins of the world was enacted he dwelt amongst 
mankind in mortal body as the son of Mary — the very Son of the living 
God. 

He has raised up mighty prophets to usher in these various dispensa- 
tions. They have each one had their important part to play, and the 
world has been benefited by them. They have left behind them a 
record of their doings, of the principles that they have taught, of the 
truths that have been revealed from heaven through the instrumentality 
of the prophets of God and the instrumentality of our Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ. 

How grateful, then, we ought to be that the Lord has not left us in 
darkness. He has enlightened our minds through the Spirit of Christ. 
He has given us our free agency, and whether or not we shall play our 
part well depends entirely upon us as individuals, and no one can escape 
from performing his own part. 

So we are all on the stage, and will be required to answer the call 
when the cue is given, and we must perform our part according to the 
light that we have, if we would obtain the benefits that God has promised 
if we do all things whatsoever he hath commanded us. 

The trouble with mankind, the greatest difficulty to be overcome is, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



59 



I think, indifference on the part of mankind to learn what is the will of 
God, what is the underlying purpose of this great drama. . It is a wonder- 
ful drama. It is full of dramatic incident. It is full of romance. There 
is much of comedy, but it is also a great tragedy in which the whole 
world is involved. 

We have been favored in being permitted to live in the closing act of 
that great drama, ushered in by that great latter-day prophet, Joseph 
Smith. It is the final act upon this earth, warning mankind of the 
promises made of old to the prophets that have been before, the promises 
that have been made to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the 
promises that have been made through all the ages, the different dispen- 
sations of God's providence to us. The climax of this last act will be 
the second advent of our Lord when he comes to reign upon the earth 
for a thousand years — when he shall appear in the clouds of glory usher- 
ing in the great millennial reign of peace. 

Are we acting our parts well ? The Lord is proving us, and to what 
end? That we might inherit eternal life, for we are living in this last 
dispensation, and shortly the curtain will fall and what then ? What shall 
become of us? Where shall we be? Some will be exalted into the 
celestial kingdom of God. Some will be in the terrestrial kingdom ; 
others in the telestial kingdom. A few, I hope very few, shall fail 
utterly and be numbered among the sons of perdition. 

Our ambition is that we may do all things whatsoever the Lord our 
God shall call upon us to do, and if we do we shall inherit eternal life in 
the presence of God. Celestial glory shall be added unto us forever and 
forever. And then our "Confidence shall wax strong in the presence 
of God, and the doctrine of the priesthood [which is the power of God] 
shall distil upon our souls as the dews from heaven." The Holy Ghost 
shall be our constant companion, and our scepter an unchanging scepter 
of righteousness and truth, and our dominion shall be an everlasting 
dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto us forever 
and ever. 

These are the promises of the Almighty, but they require us to do 
our part. In the first act of this great drama our eyes were opened. 
We received the knowledge of good and evil. Have we chosen the 
good and rejected the evil? Have we loved darkness more than light? 
We have had the opportunity to choose — every man. Blessed are we 
if we have chosen the better part. One distinguishing feature of this 
drama is that every man can act in it according to his own will. He 
can make of himself a hero or a villain of the deepest die. He can make 
of himself a valiant servant of the Lord, a worthy child of God. No 
matter what positions or roles he may be called upon to enact, even 
the least of us can attain to the highest degree if he acts his part well. 

Then ought we not to appreciate the great value of this Gospel, 
and the great value of the revelations, the dispensations of God's 
providence to us, wherein the truth has been made known to us? But 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



alas ! the indifference of mankind toward the truth — they don't seek to 
know what that truth is. The Lord wants us to know the truth. He 
said : "Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life ; 
and they are they which testify of me," and of course of his work. 

Oh, how we ought to love the truth and seek to know it. It should 
be the ambition of every man. We sing about it: 

O say what is truth, 'tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or gods can aspire ; 
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, 

Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies; 
"Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 

Let us desire the truth, then. 

Dr. John A. Widtsoe, in his little choice book, "In Search of Truth," 
makes this comment: 

Every man may find the way to truth, if he only desires it, but he 
must desire it with all his might, mind and strength. 

Let us then seek to know the truth, and it will make us free. Let 
us search the scriptures, the volume of God's dealings with mankind; 
his revelations to this generation, found in this precious little book here, 
known as the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. The preface to that 
book, which wasn't the first of the revelations, by any means, now oc- 
cupies the place as the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants. In 
conclusion let me quote the closing paragraphs of that wonderful pre- 
face to this book of revelations: 

Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse net myself ; 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same. 

For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and 
the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES H. DOUGLAS 

Former President of the British Mission 

How shall I sing thy beauty, pow'r and light, 

O glorious kingdom of the latter days ! 
I see thy loveliness, I feel thy might, 

But fail in utterance to speak thy praise! 

I search in vain the records of the past, 

Which paint dead kingdoms in their short-lived pride, 
They cannot picture thee, whose pow'r shall last 

While heav'n and truth and Deity abide. 



ELDER JAMES H. DOUGLAS

And shall the little "powers that be" today, 

Be likened for a moment to thy majesty? 
As well declare pale Vesta's twinkling ray 

Unfolds the splendor of eternity. 

In hist'ry only Egypt's greatness lives — 

Lost are its treasures, all its wisdom hid, 
Except the scraps the crumbling mummy gives, 

The sculptured sphinx and tow'ring pyramid. 

Where are the palaces of Babylon, 

The "hanging gardens" and the golden tow'rs? 

With the Chaldeans' starlight wisdom gone, 
Walls, gates and glory, images and flow'rs ! 

And thou, O Rome ! proud mistress of the world ! 

Thine armoured legions spread no terror now. 
They bring no blood-bought spoils of gems impearled, 

To deck thy bosom and thy haughty brow. 

O ! all ye living governments and states ! 

Gaze on the relics of far mightier powers ! 
The hand that shattered them, uplifted waits 

The bell that ends your few remaining hours! 

In the high chambers of the West, I see 

An infant kingdom struggling to the birth. 
And the prophetic spirit says to me, 

"In manhood this shall govern all the earth." 

(The words I have quoted are from the inspired poem "The Latter- 
Day Kingdom," by the late President Charles W. Penrose.) 

The sight that I behold today, as I stand before you, cannot be seen 
in any other part of the world that I have ever visited, — and I have 
visited many countries and seen large congregations ; but I have never 
seen a picture just like this, and I tremble as I come before you today 
to report briefly my mission as president of the British Mission. 

The British Mission is the oldest foreign mission of the Church. 
Away back in 1837 our first missionaries were sent to England, now 
ninety-eight years ago. Since that time, if I am correctly informed, 
125,000 persons have been baptized of the British people, and as I under- 
stand it, at least 100,000 have immigrated to this country. Some have 
died. Some have remained there, and are still there anxious to come 
to this glorious land of Zion. 

England has been a fruitful country. It is a marvelous country, 
beautiful beyond my description, with flowering hedges, trickling streams, 
shaded lanes and ever-green pastures. In that little area of fifty-one 
thousand square miles there are thirty-eight millions of people. In 
England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the Channel Islands and the 
Isle of Man, there are forty-nine millions of people. There is an area of 
one hundred twenty thousand square miles in these four little countries 
and small islands, about three-fourths the area of California, and yet 
they have a population almost double the population of the United States 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



west of the Missouri River. It is marvelous to think that so many 
people can live in such a small space. England alone has fifty-one thou- 
sand square miles, and Utah has eighty-five thousand. A little country 
five-eighths the size of our state has thirty-eight millions of people, and 
we have only five hundred thousand. London alone has sixteen times as 
many people in it as there are in the entire State of Utah. 

While we have had hundreds of missionaries in Great Britain in the 
last ninety-eight years, I doubt whether we shall not have to labor there, 
(using the present method of proselyting) hundreds of years to come, 
before our message can reach the great multitude of people who live 
there. 

We learned to love the people very dearly. When we went 
there President Widtsoe said: "These people need your love." We 
extended that love to them. They gathered about us wherever we as- 
sembled, in our district conferences, and we extended the hand of 
fellowship and love to them, and as far as I know we did not make a 
solitary enemy. 

We attended ninety-three district conferences, and traveled up and 
down England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, ninety-three times. During 
the period we were there we crossed the usually rough Irish Channel 
twenty-one times and were never sick once. My wife accompanied me 
on every trip and was very helpful, as 60% of our membership are 
women. We did not miss a solitary appointment. Every appointment 
that we made, we filled. And not a Sunday evening passed, as I remem- 
ber it, during the three years we were there, that we missed speaking to 
some congregation, small or large, somewhere, explaining to them the 
beauties of the everlasting Gospel as revealed in these latter days. 

There are sixteen districts in Great Britain and seventy-seven 
branches, eighty-five percent of the branches being presided over by 
local people. Let us hope that in the near future they will all be presided 
over by local members. We began selecting and setting apart local people 
to preside over the districts, and I think since our departure and Presi- 
dent Cannon's arrival there the districts are now nearly all presided over 
by local people. We desired to place the responsibility of caring for the 
people upon the local saints. There is an enrolled membership of the 
Church in Great Britain of 7,117 persons. I doubt very much whether 
they could all be found. It would be like hunting for a needle in a hay- 
stack to try to find a member of the Church in London, if he were not in- 
clined to find us. 

In my judgment, a building program in Great Britain would im- 
prove conditions very greatly. We have only thirteen small chapels 
there now, and seventy-seven branches, most of which need a better 
place in which to meet than they have. We need building accommoda- 
tions for our auxiliary work, and some day, I am sure, if we progress as 
we should, and reach the hearts of that great multitude with our message, 
we should have suitable chapels in which to worship. President Grant 
and President McKay and others who have presided there know our 



ELDER JAMES H. DOUGLAS 



63 



needs, but we cannot get them all at once. The saints there are mostly 
working people and cannot pay for them fifty percent. Some day per- 
haps we shall be well enough off to extend the needed help — I hope 
so, because investigators, unless their hearts are touched by something 
unusual, will not worship in those places where some of our splendid, 
faithful saints now have to worship. 

If I were to ask this congregation today to hold up their hands, 
those who came from England, or from the British Isles, or who are 
the descendants of those who have come from Great Britain, thousands 
of hands, I think, would go up. 

In Ireland we are doing some good work. In Dublin we have a 
branch of about sixty members, nearly all descendants of German people. 
It is the only wealthy congregation we have. They are all well-to-do. I am 
sure Brother Callis will be glad to know this. I have thought sometimes 
that with his life-long experience and great fund of knowledge he could 
accomplish a marvelous work in Ireland. In Dublin there are 398,000 
people. 97% of them belong to the Catholic Church. I am told they 
have 70,000 Catholic priests and nuns laboring in that vicinity, so you 
see what a big job we have if we convert the Irish people. 

In Northern Ireland we have a fine congregation, mostly Irish 
people. That is a Protestant section. But the southern section is mostly 
Catholic. We also have several active branches in Scotland and Wales. 

President George Q. Cannon, President John Taylor, President 
Charles W. Penrose, President Charles W. Nibley, Apostle James E. 
Talmage, President B. H. Roberts, all came from the British Isles. That 
country has given the Church many outstanding people, and I feel that 
I can safely predict that there is yet a great and wonderful work to be 
done over there. 

My wife and I were blessed with remarkable health. We clung 
closely to the promised blessings that were given us when we were set 
apart, that we would go in peace, return in safety, and have perfect health 
while we were away. We didn't have to lie in bed one day because of 
sickness. We were marvelously blessed. Notwithstanding the fact that 
I am getting along in years, pretty close to our President now, in my 
seventy-eighth year, the Lord has blessed me so that my voice has been 
strong and I have been able to speak two or three times at every district 
conference. 

We have sixty-two Relief Societies there and sixty-nine Sunday 
Schools — President McKay and Brother Pyper will- be glad to know this, 
We have fifty-nine Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, 
sixty-eight Young Women's Mutual Improvement Associations; and 
fifty-four Primaries. The officials in charge of these departments will 
be pleased to know this, I am sure. We have made a special effort in 
Primary work during the past year and a half. We also have forty- 
three genealogical organizations. 

We now have a cabinet in the British Mission office containing forty- 
four thousand cards, where records are made of genealogical work. I 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



predict that genealogical work there will advance faster and more cor- 
rectly than it has in the past. 

As I said before — I again repeat, after ninety-eight years of prose- 
lyting we have only thirteen churches. We need at least fifty more with 
suitable accommodations for auxiliary work. If this work progresses as 
it should we must have better places in which to worship. 

During the three years we were there, there were three hundred 
young men missionaries, and four young women, from the inter- 
mountain country, occasionally one from California, some from Arizona, 
and some from other parts of the United States. These young people 
were energetic, dutiful, faithful and exemplary — ever willing to do their 
duty. We loved them dearly and I convey this message to their fathers 
and mothers that they were wonderful examples to the British people. 
They loved their work and made impressions for good wherever they 
went. 

While we were there we had with us Patriarch James H. Wallis 
and his dear wife. They were a great asset to the Mission. Brother 
Wallis had the spirit of his calling as a patriarch, giving about one 
thousand three hundred blessings. Many of these were given while we 
were there, some prior to our going. He also acted as associate editor of 
the Millennial Star, and was of great assistance to me in my missionary 
labors. 

My wife's work among the sisters was marvelous. Her refined 
personality was an inspiration to me and to all those with whom we 
came in contact. 

Some of the principal achievements of the mission during my 
Presidency are: 

The establishing of mission headquarters in London — a great for- 
ward movement. 

The granting of the privilege to perform marriage ceremonies in 
our Church owned chapels. 

The organization of mission-wide boards of all auxiliary organiza- 
tions. 

Placing the book shop on a cash basis — greatly saving time and 
reducing losses. 

Gaining the good will of the Press and receiving favorable news- 
paper reports of our conferences and mission work. 

Securing the privilege of organizing Scout troops in various sections 
of Great Britain. 

BUILDING PROGRAM 

Through the generosity of the saints in the Hull district and the 
co-operation of the First Presidency we were able to build a nice little 
chapel in Hull. And also purchased a beautiful chapel in Burnley, and 
remodeled the chapels in Oldham and Manchester. We erected an amuse- 
ment hall joining the chapel in Norwich and greatly improved the ac- 



ELDER JAMES H. DOUGLAS 



65 



commodations for Church service in London and various other districts 
throughout the Mission. 

Nearly 600 baptisms were performed during our mission period. 

With prejudice abating and favorable newspaper comments, people 
are getting a better understanding of our aims and objects, and we are 
getting the attention of many who formerly had a very vague, unintelli- 
gent impression of the Latter-day Saints. 

As I close I want to express our sincere appreciation to the First 
Presidency and to all the general authorities of the Church for their 
confidence in us. We were certainly God-blessed in every way while we 
were away, in health and strength and spirit. 

May the Lord bless you all, is my prayer, in the name of our Lord 
and Master, Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "Charity," (Rossini) was sung by the Relief Society 
Singing Mothers, soprano solo by Mrs. Margaret S. Hewlett. 

Elder Scott B. Brown, President of the Boise Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 o'clock p. m., Saturday, October 5. 

The music for this meeting was rendered by the German Latter- 
day Saints Choir, under the direction of Otto Michaelis. 

As an opening number the Choir sang the hymn, "The morning 
breaks, the shadows flee." 

Elder H. Edward Sutton, President of the Oquirrh Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

The Choir sang the hymn, "Let the mountains shout for joy." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Jesus giveth a blind man sight. 

A MIRACLE OF HEALING 

And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, 
and besought him to touch him. 

And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town ; 
and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked 
him if he saw ought 

And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look 
up ; and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 

He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of town. Great 
humility and condescension ! What a lesson to the overseers of the flock 
of Christ, to take men by the hand and lead them out of the corruption 
of the world ! 

Come along, come along, is the call that will win, 

To lead us to virtue and keep us from sin ; 
Most men can be led, but few can be driven, 

In shunning perdition and striving for heaven. 

This is the only recorded example of a progressive cure — a progres- 
sive miracle. All the others wrought by the Lord Jesus Christ were 
instantaneous. There must be a lesson in this. Is it not reasonable to 
believe that this miracle is intended to exemplify in the lives of men the 
gradual progress of spiritual vision ? Certainly it illustrates the methods 
employed in the spiritual kingdom. 

Professor Agassiz, the great scientist, said every scientific truth 
passes through three stages : First, men say it is not true. Then, they 
declare it is hostile to religion. Finally, they say that everyone has 
always known it. 

Mormonism is entering the third stage. I believe that it is in some 
ways the most dangerous stage of our progress. I think it was Emerson 
who said that blame is safer than praise. 

A MIGHTY NATION 

There is a wonderful promise in the Book of Mormon respecting 
the great republic in which we live. We are told in that sacred volume 
of scripture that the Almighty would raise up a mighty nation among 
the Gentiles, and that the Gentiles would nourish the people of God, 
likened unto carrying them in their arms and on their shoulders. We 
are living in that mighty republic. I hope and pray that America, the 
United States, will be kept out of that inferno (the Ethiopian-Italian 
War) in Europe. I humbly pray that not one drop of American blood 
shall be shed on foreign shores in a foreign war. Let the United States 
keep out of it. 

I think the people of this land are fulfilling a wonderful mission — I 
mean the non-Mormons, — a God-given mission. He has given them 
a heaven-inspired Constitution, and if we will stick close to that bulwark 
of liberty the sun of freedom shall never set on the people of this 
favored land. 

THE GOSP.EL LEAVEN 

It is remarkable how the Gospel is appealing to people. The leaven 
of the Gospel is leavening the whole lump. It is in the hearts of men, 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



67 



secretly urging them and working with them to come to the obedience 
of the faith. 

Some time ago Frank A. Munsey, the great American author and 
publisher, had a book prepared containing the genealogy of the families 
of his father and mother. It cost him, so I was credibly informed, the 
sum of $75,000. In his introduction he says: 

The absence of trustworthy family records all the way down from the 
time of the Pilgrim settlers was so well nigh universal throughout New 
England, that it would almost seem that all interest in ancestry was re- 
garded as a kind of snobbishness unbecoming in the hard-working, God- 
fearing American — unbecoming, unmanly, or even sinful. * * * One of 
my mother's unsatisfied desires was to know, — actually to know — whether 
the old Hopkins family tradition was really true. Her faith * * * told 
her that it was true. I know with deep appreciation what those dreams 
and aspirations must have been, for I am her son. * * * One of these 
services, with me, was to do for my mother what she would have liked 
to do for herself with respect to the Mayflower ancestry of her family. 
* * * I had no other purpose in the undertaking. 

One doctrine of the Gospel, a glorious doctrine, is the doctrine of 
salvation for the dead. It seems that this is captivating the hearts of 
men and they are rallying to it and helping the people of God to gather 
genealogy. 

In the time of which Frank A. Munsey wrote there were few if 
any large genealogical libraries or institutions, but now the College of 
Heralds in London, the great collection of genealogies in the Library 
of Congress and the files of the Daughters of the American Revolution, 
contain invaluable data respecting the genealogical status of multitudes. 
It seems to me that this is a remarkable contribution to the work of 
the Lord. Are not the Gentiles, God bless them, nourishing and carry- 
ing in their arms and on their shoulders the chosen people of God? 
And when I say the chosen people of God, I mean those who show us by 
their works that they are worthy of the name of Christ. 

With every American I sincerely deplore the fight that is made on 
any race or creed. We cannot afford to join in such a crusade. It is 
unmanly; it is un-American. 

a minister's opinion 

Some time ago a minister who delivers nation-wide broadcast ser- 
mons weekly was asked this question : What, in your opinion, becomes of 
those souls who in this life had no opportunity of accepting or rejecting 
the truth as it is found in the Gospels ? The minister replied : 

Those who never heard the name of Jesus, since human beings first 
appeared on the earth, constitute the vast majority who have lived and 
died here. Moreover, hundreds of millions now living are in the same 
condition. Imagination cannot conceive their endless array. 

Even today multitudes exist in Christian lands who, because of the 
circumstances of their birth and upbringing, are almost as ignorant of 



68

the New Testament faith as were the ancient Greeks who never heard of 
Christ. Think also of the hosts of innocent children who pass on before 
arriving at conscious responsibility for their own lives. 

Even when dimly understood your question would be unbearably 
oppressive if none except those who have intelligently and voluntarily be- 
lieved in Christ are hereafter admitted to the Divine Presence. If, as we 
are taught to believe, the incalculable myriads of human beings who have 
occupied, or now occupy this life, exist for eternity, and must spend it 
somewhere, how can we limit the redemptive efficacy of divine love to the 
brief span of man's mortal existence here? 

SPIRIT OF ELIJAH AT WORK 

Isn't this a remarkable work that brothers and sisters not of our 
faith are doing? I believe we talk too much about indifference. True, 
it exists, but what I have read proves that many people are not indifferent 
to the work of God, but there is an urge, an inner urge which tells them 
some power not of man is with this Church. 

Behold, I will send you Elijah, the prophet, before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord : 

And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the 
heart of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with 
a curse. 

I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. 

These things I have read are beautiful, but there is one thing lacking. 
These good men who are gathering genealogy, and who are inspired by 
the spirit of Elijah, do not belong to churches that have the power to 
give expression to their noble thoughts. Godliness cannot be expressed 
only through the authority of the priesthood of God and the ordinances 
of the Gospel. More and more it becomes evident that Joseph Smith, 
the prophet of God, spoke the feelings of men and women who were 
longing to express themselves with respect to this glorious doctrine. 

PROPHECY BY ORSON PRATT 

Another thing that the Gentiles are doing. Listen to this prophecy 
by Orson Pratt. In the course of a sermon he made this statement : 

There must be something connected with the sounding of this trump 
that is miraculous in order that all nations may hear it. Any sound that 
can be produced by mortal man does not reach, generally speaking, over 
about thirty miles from where it originates, which is a very small space 
indeed. But there will be something connected with the sounding of the 
trump of the first of the seven angels which will manifest a power which 
we know nothing of. The sound of that trump will be heard by all 
people, nations, kindreds and tongues in the four corners of the globe. I 
do not know that the sound will be so much louder than some we have 
heard, but it will be carried by some miraculous power so that all people 
will hear it. 

I am quoting from the Millennial Star : 

These words were uttered sixty-two years ago. They were uttered 
three years before the Edinburgh-born genius, Alexander Graham Bell, 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

had even exhibited the invention which was to develop into the telephone, 
and twenty-three years before Marchese Marconi patented the first simple 
wireless apparatus. Who would have thought in those days, when the 
voice was untouched by science and invention, that in years to come mil- 
lions would hear simultaneously a sound "No louder than some that had 
been heard"? 

Through the facilities of this same invention that was foretold by 
Orson Pratt, President Heber J. Grant recently proclaimed the Gospel 
message in a sermon that sounded around the world and was received by 
the ears of millions of people. He was speaking over a chain of sixty- 
eight leading broadcasting stations of the Columbia network in the 
United States and Canada. 

Only a few weeks earlier President Grant delivered a sermon on an 
"Around the World" program of Station K. S. L. in Salt Lake City. 
Letters describing perfect reception in far-off Japan were received by 
station officials. 

Isn't this another example that the mission God Almighty gave to 
the Gentiles is being splendidly fulfilled? God is touching their spiritual 
vision. They may not be converted — they may not be spiritually healed 
by one sermon or a dozen sermons, but sooner or later the word of God 
shall reach their hearts, their spiritual vision shall be touched, and they 
shall see Mormonism clearly, — not as they did see it, "men as trees, 
walking." 

SEEING WITH SPIRITUAL EYES 

At the time when Syrian soldiers surrounded Dothan to take captive 
Elisha, the prophet, his servant, paralyzed with fear said unto him : 

Alas, my master! how shall we do? 

And he answered, fear not; for they that be with us are more than 
they that be with them. 

And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that 
he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he 
saw; and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire 
round about Elisha. — (2 Kings, 6:15-17.) 

The eyes which Elisha prayed should be opened were those of the 
spirit, not of the body. 

More than twenty-four centuries later, William Tyndale, the Eng- 
lish reformer, translator of the Bible, and a martyr, was strangled and 
his body burned at the stake. Midst flame and smoke he gasped forth 
this dying prayer: "Lord, open the king of England's eyes." God's 
answer to that pathetic supplication was King James' translation of the 
Bible, as it is popularly called. 

Joseph Smith, prophet, seer, revelator, translator of the scriptures, 
and martyr, by his death proved his words to be true. He proved the 
divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. 

Oh God, open the eyes, the spiritual eyes of the world, of all men 
and women, that they may come into the spiritual Canaan flowing with 
thy word and filled with truth and joy and salvation, I humbly pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CLARENCE H. TINGEY 

Former President of the Australian Mission 

During the past two and one-half months since we have returned 
from the Australian Mission, I have looked forward to the assembly of 
the Latter-day Saints as they were to convene in this semi-annual con- 
ference, believing that possibly President Grant would expect me to 
make some report of our activities in the Australian Mission. I cannot 
say that I feel comfortable, altogether, and yet I consider it a distinct 
honor to face you, my brethren and sisters, this afternoon. I feel that 
the responsibility is particularly heavy, after listening to such an able 
discourse by President Callis. I have been thrilled and heartily say 
Amen to all that he has said in these few moments. 

I am very happy to report conditions in the Australian Mission are 
very favorable. We have had some obstacles to overcome. Our appoint- 
ment first came in 1928. We had the opportunity of laboring in that 
field for three years, were then released and returned home. A few 
months later President Grant asked if we would return for a second 
visit. We accepted the honor, and have had three and a half years more 
among those delightful people. 

During the first three years we faced the task of encouraging, 
building up and strengthening our people during the years of depression. 
During the years of 1929, 1930 and 1931 the Australian people met 
their most severe hardships. Some of our saints became discouraged, 
of course. We spent much of our time attempting to point their at- 
tention to the future, that they might see something better beyond the 
horizon. 

During our second visit we were under the necessity of meeting a 
depression in missionaries, and were compelled to fight through with a 
very materially reduced missionary force. But I am very grateful to 
report here now that through all of this the Lord has sustained and up- 
held the work in that land in a most remarkable way. The Spirit of 
the Lord, under the guidance of the priesthood, is permeating the hearts 
of the people of Australia. Our saints, I feel, are more spiritual minded 
than they have ever been before. Their friends are more sincere than 
they have been previously, and men and women of all types are giving 
more earnest consideration to the presence of the Mormon missionaries in - 
their cities and communities. 

I am happy to report that our missionaries were all well when we 
left them. Their spirits were high, and they were displaying a remark- 
able devotion to the trust which had been reposed in them. Likewise 
with the saints, the members of the Church. We bring you greetings 
from these, and President Rees and his good wife, who succeeded us 
there. They would all like to be with you today. 

There has been a remarkable change in the public attitude toward 
the Latter-day Saints. We hear of this so much these days. I want to 
explain briefly some of the incidents which support this declaration. 



ELDER CLARENCE H. TIN GEY 



71 



On the day that we were celebrating the 104th anniversary of the 
appearance of John the Baptist to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, I 
was honored with an invitation from the Council of Churches of Sidney 
to attend a meeting of representative ministers of all faiths. There were 
some four or five hundred representatives there. Dr. Norwood, of the 
City Temple of London, was the speaker. As I looked over that vast 
group of intelligent, clean-looking men, I felt a distinct insignificance, 
and yet, as the thought came to me of the day on which that gathering 
was held, I stood amazed at this thought: Among all of these men I 
could claim honestly and legitimately to be the only one among them 
who actually held the priesthood of Almighty God. 

But these men were friends, most of them, a most interesting 
change, compared to that which we had experienced previously. 

At the farewell which was given us when we left Sidney, there were 
members of Parliament, doctors, university professors, members of the 
American Consul's Office, the mayor, and a number of his aldermen, of 
the city municipality where our headquarters are situated. All of them 
came happily, extending their congratulations for the work which was 
being done by our small organization in that part. 

Mayor Goddard addressed the group, as did others, and in addition 
to his splendid tribute, verbal tribute, presented us with a letter of 
appreciation, signed by himself, the town clerk, and under the corporate 
seal of the municipality. 

These things, brethren and sisters, would have been almost unbe- 
lievable had they been mentioned a number of years ago. President 
Callis spoke of the leaven. I declare before you that the leaven of the Gos- 
pel is operating. It is permeating the hearts of men. It is sinking deep 
into the consciousness of intelligent men and women. And I bear 
witness before you today that come what will, let all the fury of the 
world, all of the inbred hatred of mankind, be released at once and let 
it wrap the world in its embrace, it shall not stop the development, the. 
progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus, the Christ, was his Son, 
and I delight in that testimony. I bear witness also that I know that 
Joseph Smith was a faithful, honest, humble prophet of the living God ; 
that the priesthood which is now held by the Church, the keys of which 
are in the hands of President Heber J. Grant, is indeed the priesthood of 
God the Eternal Father, and has a right to operate, legally and efficiently 
among the children of men. 

May God help us to understand the treasure that has been given us, 
I pray humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER FRANCIS SALZNER 

Former President of the Swiss and German Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, only once before in my life have I 
beheld such a sight as I see today. I shall never forget it. I pray for 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



your indulgence and the Spirit of the Lord to guide the few remarks 
that I may make today, that they may be worthy of the cause that we 
represent and of this great occasion. 

In returning from presiding over the Swiss and German Mission, 
having been home some three months now, I wish to bring to you the 
greetings of the missionaries and the saints of the Swiss and German 
Mission. Of the missionaries I may say that I don't think there has 
ever been a finer lot of young men sent out into the world at any time 
than the missionaries who have labored with us in that mission. 

I also wish to commend the fidelity and the faithfulness of those 
good saints who make up the Swiss and German Mission. They are 
surely an example to us, and I have received from them and their in- 
fluence a great deal of benefit, for I have seen things there which I 
never beheld before. I have seen how the Gospel has taken hold of 
them, and the living of the Gospel has brought unto them the greatest 
of blessings. 

Yes, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power unto salvation to those 
who obey it and live it, and there we see those faithful saints trying with 
all their might to live it, and the blessings of God are showered upon 
them. Peace and joy and happiness are in their homes and their hearts, 
and they appreciate the Gospel. I wish that we also would appreciate 
its blessings as those saints do who are in that far-off land. 

There was, while we were there, what is known as a revolution, in- 
asmuch as the government changed from a democracy to a dictatorship. 
We had expected perhaps to be curtailed in our rights or in our privi- 
leges, I may say, but until now we have been free to preach the Gospel. 
We have preached repentance and baptized people. What the future 
will bring of course we do not know. 

Brother Ballard has mentioned the religious contention over there. 
This perhaps is somewhat misunderstood by us here; perhaps taken 
much more seriously than it really is. This idea of a pagan religion, 
as fostered by Dr. Rosenberg, who has a following of perhaps two hun- 
dred and fifty or three hundred thousand out of sixty-five million people 
is of small consequence, although we can see from all this contention 
that the people are not satisfied with the religion which they have and 
are looking for something different. 

In the western part of Germany, which is mostly Catholic, I noticed 
this summer there has been a new movement started, namely, the people 
want a Rome-free church, devoid of pagan ceremony and rituals. They 
want to come back again to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the things 
which influence men and help them to become better and make life 
better for others. 

I wish also to relate a visit that I made to a world-known establish- 
ment there, which is called Bethel. It is located near the city of Bielefeld, 
and was started nearly a hundred years ago by a pastor by the name of 
Dr. Bodelschwink. It is an entirely benevolent institution, and is built 
for the purpose of taking care of epileptic patients. The day we were 



ELDER FRANCIS SALZNER 



73 



there, there were over five thousand patients in that institution, and I 
saw the most pitiable sights I have ever seen in my life. After going 
through the institution we talked to the guide and he told us that in every 
case they make a thorough study of the ancestry of the patient, to try 
to determine what is the cause of that condition in the patient. He said 
they have determined that sixty-five per cent of those unfortunates have 
been brought to that condition through drunkenness of the parents and 
grandparents ; twenty-five per cent from sexual diseases ; ten per cent 
they were unable to determine. 

Sometimes when I hear Latter-day Saints say : "I wish they would 
not talk any more about the Word of Wisdom," I say, let us cry out 
the Word of Wisdom to the four ends of the world, that the people may 
know what God says about this thing. When I looked at those thou- 
sands of unfortunates there, I felt shocked when I realized that the 
responsibility for their condition rested upon some one else, that their 
parents through drunkenness were responsible and that the suffering 
could have been avoided had those parents and grandparents been prop- 
erly taught from their youth up. 

We as a church stand out in the world today as teaching the great 
principle, that a clean life is the one thing that will bring happiness and 
joy to us and to our posterity. We don't know how far-reaching this is ; 
we don't know how many are affected by our living clean, upright, hon- 
orable lives. 

When I listened yesterday to Elder Hinckley giving us a eulogy on 
these men who are sitting here upon this stand, I thought how blessed 
are we to have such men as our leaders, — men experienced in almost 
every walk of life, who can give unto us counsel and advice, who can 
look ahead and show unto us the way which we should go, who can see 
the pitfalls ahead of us and warn us of the dangers. How thankful we 
should be for such leaders, and we should go home and put into practice 
the counsels that they give us, and by doing so we would all be blessed. 

Many times I have said if the Latter-day Saints were to live the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ they would be the greatest power in the world 
today. Men would come here from every corner of the world to see 
the accomplishments and the lives of these people. The reason why this 
prophecy which was read to us this morning — that men should come up 
to the mountain of the Lord to learn of the Lord's ways — has not been 
fulfilled is because we, as a people, are not living the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ as we should. We have a power in our hands, but as yet we 
haven't made use of it. 

A professor in one of the largest universities in Germany called 
upon me just a few days before I left for home. He had been here in 
Salt Lake City for six months, studying the economic side of Mormon- 
ism, and he said : "You people have got the greatest thing in all the 
world, but you don't know how to use it." 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us go home from this conference and 
disseminate the spirit of this conference among our neighbors and 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



friends, using our influence wherever possible to build up, to raise up, 
and to induce our brethren and sisters to live the Gospel. By doing so 
we shall make a better state, a better community, and a nicer place in 
the world to live. 

May God bless you all. May the spirit of this conference emanate 
from here to every corner of the Church, that its influence may also be 
made manifest with those who are not present here, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Hosanna anthem (Stephens) was sung by the Choir. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am pleased to announce that for the first time in my recollection 
all of the returned mission presidents have had the opportunity of 
speaking in Conference. 

ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege 
of again attending a general conference of the Church. I have 
often remarked during my work in the mission field that I was sure 
the Lord knew what he was doing when he instituted conferences 
in the Church, as they are always a great inspiration to the saints 
and to those who bear the responsibility of leadership, from the 
very head down through all the organizations of the Church. I am 
very grateful to the Lord for this great organization. 

It has been my privilege during the past thirty years to labor 
in nearly every one of the various auxiliaries of the Church and the 
quorums of the priesthood, and having presided as a bishop of a ward 
and the president of a stake I have often noted that the men and 
women who were assigned to labor in the various auxiliaries felt 
that their particular assignment was the very most important part 
of the great organization of the Church, because of the splendid 
work assigned to the particular organization in which they were 
serving. I feel that as we analyze the various auxiliaries and the 
priesthood quorums and see the work that is being accomplished, 
we recognize that truly this is a marvelous work and a wonder. 

When the Apostle Paul referred to the organization of the 
Church and named the offices therein he said, that this organization 
had been given to men, "for the perfecting of the saints, for the 
work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ, 
till we all come to a unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the 
Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature 
of the fulness of Christ; that we henceforth should be no more 
children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 



75 



doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby 
they lie in wait to deceive." 

I feel grateful that the organization has been restored to the 
earth which contemplates the direction of the activities of the lives 
of its members, in the carrying out of this great mission, and I am 
sure that this mission could not be fully accomplished without 
such an organization. I think you realize with me that there are 
those who lie in wait with cunning craftiness and the doctrines of 
men, seeking to lead away and destroy the faith of our people. In 
the particular work assigned to the Church, to which Paul refers, 
one important part is the work of the ministry, and since that 
happens to be my assignment at this time I desire to say a few 
words about missionary work. 

True to form, it seems to me that this is almost the most 
important part of the work, and yet when I realize how important 
are our auxiliaries in preparing men and women for activity in the 
Church, I realize that one department is not more important than 
the other; but I do want to say to you that it is a great joy to have 
the privilege of laboring with your young sons and daughters who 
come into the mission field. Sometimes I feel that the mission field 
might be likened unto the great laboratory of the Church, where 
our boys and girls are privileged to put into activity and to the 
test the things that they have been taught in the auxiliary organiza- 
tions, to try them out to see if they are good and true to the teach- 
ings that we have received. We read in holy writ that "this is life 
eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God and Jesus 
Christ whom thou hast sent." And he that hath faith must "believe 
that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek 
him." 

It is a glorious thing in the mission field to see how the faith 
of these boys and girls is developed in a very short period of time, 
so that they actually know that God lives, that he moves in the 
affairs of individuals and of peoples and of nations. These boys and 
.girls soon have all doubt dispelled. Many of them come to us with 
critical ideas and analytical minds, and it is a great privilege to sit 
with them as they begin to study the scriptures, and see how mar- 
velously the truth of the Gospel, as it has been committed to us by 
the prophets and restored in these latter days, unfolds; how their 
minds are able to grasp the truth of it, and to see how their faith in 
God develops so that their prayers become sincere, and they feel 
that the Lord is with them. 

When our missionaries travel on the highways it is not just 
a mere form with them that they find a little clump of trees and 
kneel down together and ask God to open the way that they may 
be provided with transportation. They learn not only that it is 
recorded that the priesthood has been restored, but that God recog- 
nizes their administration when they are called to administer to the 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sick and to otherwise officiate in his name. They learn that he 
lives ; they come to realize and know that the Lord is working 
toward a great end and destiny. They learn to observe the influence 
of the Gospel upon the lives of the men and women who keep the 
commandments of God. 

It seems to me that in the face of demonstrated truth, before 
the eyes of our boys and girls, it should be very difficult for them 
to return home and turn away from the teachings of this Church. 
Men and women are literally born again. They are literally made 
over in a very brief space of time through the influence of the 
Gospel in their lives. 

At a conference a few weeks ago, one man who had been a 
member of the Church since last November was called upon to 
speak, and he said: "Brethren and sisters I have grown more in the 
last year than in all the rest of my life." These boys and girls 
contact the Saints and hear their testimonies day after day because 
of their faithfulness in keeping his commandments. The letters 
that reach the mission office bring great joy and happiness to our 
souls because of the faithful testimonies of these saints. One good 
sister wrote in the other day and said : 

"Brother Richards, when the season commenced we hardly 
knew how to get the seed to plant our crops, and now our bins arc 
full of grain and our smoke houses are full of hams. I don't know 
why, except that we pay our tithing." 

I went down into Florida a few months ago, following a very 
cold spell that destroyed many of the crops there. As I went 
through the groves of one of our faithful saints I said : "Brother 
So and So, it is remarkable how well your crops thrive." 

He said : "President Richards, my crop is tithed." 

In the midst of all these demonstrated evidences that the Lord 
does keep his promises to his people, our boys and girls are seeing 
worked out before their eyes the fulfilment of the promises of the 
Lord. I remember a promise that the Lord gave unto his people 
in this day. He said : 

I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not 
what I say, ye have no promise. 

I want to bring you the greetings of the missionaries and the 
saints in the Southern States Mission. I thank the Lord for the 
privilege of laboring with them, and I feel that this great missionary 
system of the Church is one of the very outstanding parts of its 
organization. I feel grateful to the fathers and mothers who are 
making the sacrifices to send their boys and girls into the mission 
field. I pray that this spirit may increase in power among the 
saints and never diminish, so that our boys and girls may enjoy 
the great privilege of experience and training that comes to them. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



77 



May God bless this great Church and its leaders and all who 
labor therein, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I pray that I may be guided by the Holy Spirit in what I say this 
afternoon, on a subject that is of great interest to us all. 

Just four hundred years ago there was printed, possibly in Zurich, 
Switzerland, the first complete English Bible. The translation had been 
made and secreted and carried over to the Swiss people, who at that time 
had established a free government. The translator was Miles Coverdale, 
and his translation became the basis of the English Bible that we study 
today. 

The word "Bible" signifies books, and these books, sixty-six in num- 
ber, are bound into one volume. It took some fifteen hundred years to 
write these books by the authors, who were prophets of God, and who 
gave us the basis of our true religion. No inscriptions discovered by 
the archaeologists compare with it in value. As we all know, there are 
two Testaments, both of which were written entirely by Jews. The Old 
Testament narrates the history of Israel, as a background. Every phase 
of human form of endeavor is revealed with unsparing and yet tender 
realism, and enriched by poetic accomplishments. 

The New Testament, filled with allusions to the Old Testament, con- 
tains an account of Jesus, his disciples, his teachings, and his founding of 
Christianity. There are the four gospels or lives of Christ ; together with 
the writings of Peter and Paul and others of the apostles ; and the great 
vision of John the Revelator, who writes of the New Jerusalem, where 
sorrow and weeping shall be no more. The Bible is thus the work of 
many minds, writing in different ages. 

When William Tyndale, farther back in time than Miles Coverdale, 
translated parts of the Bible, he went to Belgium and suffered martyrdom 
for his work. But the work of Tyndale and Miles Coverdale brought 
about the translation of the Bible in 1611, which required six years for 
the fifty-six scholars to translate the old Latin and Greek Bible. The 
Bible at the time of the Savior was in Greek. It had been translated by 
Greek scholars in the old city of Alexandria about two hundred and 
seventy years before Christ. 

Interesting to you and me today is the fact that one of the earliest 
translations of the Holy Bible was made by the Ethiopians far back in 
the fourth century. The Ethiopians are Semitic. They are descendants 
of Shem as were the ancient Israelites. The man who today is at the 
head of the kingdom of Ethiopia is a great character. We have on 
record, according to a European writer, that he has prayed in his heart 
that if his people are influenced by the spirit of progress of the western 
nations, that they might be preserved in their traditions and in their 
religion. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



To give an example : One of the loveliest ideas, I think, that we 
may learn from that great people, though they are still living their primi- 
tive lives, is in reference to the holy day of God, or Sabbath Day. Their 
king has sent out a decree that as they take upon themselves the civiliza- 
tion of the West, that his people will never do anything to desecrate the 
holy day of God. We do pray for them, for it is interesting to know 
that they had one of the first Bibles. 

It is said that : "The first leaf of the Mosaic record" — these are the 
words of John Paul, the German — "has more weight than all the folios 
of men of science and philosophy," "and he is right," says Geikie, "for 
we owe to it the earliest and grandest revelation of that first principle 
of all religion, the existence, the unity, the personality and the moral 
government of God." 

Almost contemporary with the Holy Bible is the Book of Mormon, 
really the Bible of the American continent. Like the Holy Bible, it was 
written over a period of years, and like the Bible, it was written by 
divinely inspired prophets, on papyrus, or on metal plates, then finally 
all brought together on gold plates, to be found and translated through 
the gift and power of God, by a prophet of these the last days. 

These two divinely written books form the greatest message ever 
given to the human race. In the Bible we have Moses ; in the Book of 
Mormon, Nephi. In the Bible we have Isaiah ; in the Book of Mormon, 
Alma. In the Bible we have Ezekiel ; in the Book of Mormon, Mosiah. 
All were prophets of holiness. All wrote of the supreme beauty, truth 
and goodness, and the divine gift of life through Jesus Christ, our Lord. 
These sacred books all point to one great truth, summed up in what the 
prophet Moses says, at the beginning of the ancient scriptures of the Old 
World, when he wrote : 

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

And the earth was without form, and void ; and darkness was upon the 
face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the 
waters. 

And God said, let there be light; and there was light. 

And then, some two thousand years later, Jesus of Nazareth gave us 
the same message in the holiest words he ever uttered, namely, the Lord's 
prayer, when he called his people and said unto them : 

After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven, 
hallowed be thy name. 

The holy scriptures express the great truth that lies at the very 
foundation of true religion : "Our Father in heaven." 

The American prophet, Mosiah, also wrote the same message when 
he said : 

The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, 
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG

Should we not more and more read the holy scriptures and know 
them ? How shall we know the truth about them ? There is but one way. 
It is the way that was given us by the ancient prophet, Moroni. He 
wrote, some fifteen hundred years ago, these words : 

Now I. Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good ; and I write unto 
my brethren, the Lamanites ; and I would that they should know that more 
than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was 
given of the coming of Christ. 

And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way 
of exhortation unto you. 

Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, 
if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember 
how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the crea- 
tion of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, 
and ponder it in your hearts. 

And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye 
would ask God, the eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things 
are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, 
having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. 

Jesus, the Savior, gave us this same truth, and every prophet has 
given us the same admonition from then until the present hour: "Seek 
ye the kingdom of God and the word of God, and ye shall know." 

This is our message to the world. Knowledge of God can come in 
no other way but by prayer and revelation. May we go forth, illuminated 
as we will be by this great conference, and become a light unto the world, 
and remember in our hearts always that it is our Father in heaven who 
is directing his holy work, through the priesthood of God which he has 
established in the world. 

That we may be blessed to this end, I ask, in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am happy this afternoon, my brethren and sisters, in having this 
privilege of meeting with you. I have rejoiced in this conference from 
the very first moment. I find here the spirit of peace and of love, the 
spirit which comes always when men and women are engaged in the 
work of our Father, our God. 

As I sat here yesterday and listened to the music, and thought of 
the work of the Summit Stake choir that sang for us yesterday, I saw 
them gathering in little groups in different parts of their stake., driving 
four, six, eight or ten miles, one night each week, to a meeting place, 
to prepare themselves to be of service to their fellows in their own stake. 
A week ago tonight they drove from their homes to this building, where 
they practiced for two hours.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I see in that not only the music, which is helpful 'to all, but also 
a service in which they too have found joy and happiness. Yesterday, as 
I looked over this group, and felt the spirit that was present, I looked 
in imagination beyond this building out into the world, and I saw war 
and bloodshed and strife and turmoil, selfishness and greed. 

Then I looked back a few centuries and I saw the Pilgrim Fathers 
coming to this land. I saw them tilling the virgin soil and making 
homes. Finally I saw them as the bands of oppression were again 
tightening upon them, and I saw them taking up arms to defend their 
liberty and their rights, for which they had suffered untold hardships. 
I saw them at Lexington and at Concord, poorly equipped, but with 
courage, facing the trained army of their parent nation. I saw them 
expend their ammunition and retreat before superior forces, but deter- 
mined and hoping and praying. 

It is said by military experts that had the British at that time 
followed through with the course they had commenced the great revolu- 
tion would have been at an end and the United States would not have 
existed. But instead they took to their ships, leaving several hundred 
cannon, ammunition and supplies sufficient partly to equip the then 
small army which they had been fighting. 

The colonials continued on with that great struggle, which lasted 
for more than three years, without a single chance of winning — enough 
to discourage anyone — until finally victory came on that historic night 
when Washington crossed the Delaware river with his troops, starting 
in three columns, two of which failed to arrive. There was no battle. 
One man was taken prisoner, two men killed, and two men frozen to 
death. 

In reviewing all of this — I am going over it hurriedly, because time 
will not permit me to go into detail — I refer to a report made by a 
military reviewing officer who said, "One is almost compelled to believe 
they were protected through divine providence." 

And later, when we were engaged in the Civil War, the Northern 
forces outnumbered the South, but did not have the spirit and determina- 
tion found in the South. They were beaten in every battle for three 
years, and there were times when the Northern forces were almost 
completely surrounded, but each time something happened that caused 
the Southerners to withdraw and the Northern forces were permitted to 
reorganize. Finally, when the South had exhausted its man power and 
its resources, it was compelled to surrender, and the history was written. 
The military reviewer said : "We are almost compelled to agree with 
those who believe that this great government was established through 
divine providence." It seems to me that one cannot be a Latter-day 
Saint unless he believes that this government was established through 
divine providence. 

I want to read from the Book of Mormon, and I refer to Ether, 
second chapter, 9th and 10th verses : 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



81 



And now we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, 
that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall 
serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall 
come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when 
they are ripened in iniquity; 

For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands ; 
wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; 
for it is the everlasting decree of God. 

And again, in Ether the 13th chapter, beginning with the first verse : 

And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the 
destruction of the people of whom I have been writing. 

For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether ; for he truly told 
them of all things, from the beginning of man ; and that after the waters 
had receded from oft" the face of this land, it became a choice land above 
all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would 
have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof ; 

And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should 
come down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord. 

Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a 
New Jerusalem upon this land. 

And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem 
from whence Lehi should come — after it should be destroyed it should 
be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord ; wherefore, it could not 
be a New Jerusalem for it had been in a time of old ; but it should be 
built up again, and become a tioly city of the Lord ; and it should be 
built unto the house of Israel ; 

And that a New Jerusalem should be built up upon this land, unto 
the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which things there has been a 
type. 

For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even 
so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of 
Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the 
seed of Joseph that they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto 
the father of Joseph that he should perish not ; 

Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon 
this land ; and it shall be a land of their inheritance ; and they shall build 
up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old. 

And Nephi, recorded in I Nephi, 2nd chapter, beginning with the 
19th verse : 

And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed 
art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, 
with lowliness of heart. 

And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, 
and shall be led to a land of promise ; yea, even a land which I have 
prepared for you ; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. 

And I Nephi, 17th chapter, beginning with the 33rd verse: 
the land of promise, who were driven out by our fathers, do ye suppose 

And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who were in 
that they were righteous? Behold I say unto you, Nay. 

Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice than 
they if they had been righteous ? I say unto you, Nay. 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one ; he that is righteous is 
favored of God. But behold, this people had rejected every word of 
God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God 
was upon them ; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless 
it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruc- 
tion, and he did bless it unto our fathers, unto their obtaining power over 
it. 

Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited ; 
and he hath created his children, that they should possess it. 

And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of 
the wicked. 

And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked 
he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for their sakes. 

We have gone through great tribulations during the last few years — 
depression, we call it. Brother Ballard called upon us to get away from 
the dole, to get away from relief. It seems to me that some of us are 
in the condition the people were in at the time the prophet of the Lord 
said: "Will a man rob God?" and he was speaking of tithing. There 
are those who rob God, for they fail to pay their tithing. Brother 
LeGrand Richards has given us one little reminder of what the Lord 
will do for those who approach him in faith. 

Have we ever stopped to wonder whether or not we have robbed 
God of our time ? He requires that we give of our time in the service 
of his cause, in laboring with our fellow men, those who have troubles, 
those who are weak, those who need encouraging ; and he says : "Let 
those who are strong encourage those who are weak, that my church 
may be built up," and it is our responsibility. 

We rob him of his holy day. It is a holiday with many. How 
many times have you called your solemn assemblies on the Sabbath day, 
only to have them disturbed by ball players in an adjoining lot? I have 
observed that a few times this year, while attending conferences. 

It seems to me that this can become a choice land — a land choice 
above all other lands — only through the righteousness of God's people, 
for he has so said, and there is no other interpretation that we can place 
upon it. Therefore, if depressions come upon us, if we are caused to 
suffer because of a lack of rain or moisture, if our ground, fails to 
produce in the season thereof sufficient for our needs and requirements, 
may it not be because we go about our work unconcerned for those who 
are careless and neglectful ? 

I attended a conference recently where the president apologized for 
changing the program. He informed me that the people came from great 
distances. Instead of holding a meeting on Saturday night they held 
it at one o'clock, in order to provide daylight time that all might partici- 
pate in a ball game on Saturday afternoon, and he pointed out to me 
in the congregation that afternoon the players who would play after 
meeting. After our meeting had been brought to a close all adjourned 
to the adjoining ball park where we witnessed the ball game, leaving the 
Sabbath day free for services and the work of the Lord. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



83 



It seems to me this is not a difficult thing to do. I have no desire 
to deprive any young man or boy of the privilege of playing ball or 
engaging in any other athletic sport. I think they need to do so. But it 
seems to me it is about time that we elders of Israel, at least where we 
have control and have the right to say what shall be done, should put 
a stop to the desecration of that day which God has said "shall be holy." 

I refer to these matters briefly, as a reminder to us that while 
blessings have been promised they are contingent upon our faithfulness 
to the work entrusted to our care. The Lord has said : 

I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may 
turn to you for your salvation. 

I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not 
what I say, ye have no promise. (D. & C. 82 :9, 10.) 

Oh, if we could take the spirit of this conference home and sit 
down with these boys and men, pray with them and urge them to see 
what they are doing to their fellow men, and how much more they might 
enjoy life and the blessings of God should they turn their minds and 
their thoughts and their attention to him and his work ! 

This is our mission at home. Brother LeGrand Richards said: 
"It is a great privilege to sit with these young men as they begin to study 
the scriptures, and see how marvelously the truth of the Gospel as it 
has been committed to us by the prophets and restored in these latter 
days unfolds, and how their minds are able to grasp the truth." And 
that is true, too, but is it not an indictment against us to have it said 
that young men go to the mission field to study the scriptures and to 
gain a testimony? Brethren, if we were living in harmony with the 
Gospel principles, if we were teaching our young men by example and 
precept, they would go out into the mission field under the influence of 
the Spirit of God and with a testimony, and it would no longer be said 
they go to the mission field to gain a testimony. 

I pray that the day will soon come when we will take upon us fully 
this responsibility, and see to it that every young man who goes out in 
the world to preach the Gospel knows the meaning of the Gospel prin- 
ciples, and is living them every day of his life. 

God help us to understand and engage in this work in the spirit 
which he is willing to give to us, and without which we cannot accom- 
plish his purposes, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have decided, as there is not sufficient time left for another 
speaker at this meeting, to read the report of changes in Church .officers

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are very grateful to the Singing Mothers for their splendid 
singing this morning, and also to our brethren and sisters of the German 
Choir who have furnished the music this afternoon. 

There are approximately 120,000 blind people in the United States, 
a large proportion of whom read Braille. The Church has authorized 
the publication of the Book of Mormon in Braille for the benefit of our 
people. 

Elder Stephen L. Chipman offered the closing prayer. 
Conference adjourned until 9:30 Sunday morning, October 6. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, April 6. 

As a prelude to the fifth session of the Conference a program of 
choral and organ music was rendered by the Tabernacle Choir and Organ 
from 9 :30 to 10 :30 a. m., which program was broadcast by radio through- 
out the United States and Canada, over the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 
tem, originating over Station KSL, Salt Lake City. 

When the time arrived for commencing this service, the Tabernacle 
auditorium and galleries were crowded with people, every available space 
being occupied. In addition, thousands of people gathered in the large 
Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle, and on the grounds, 
where, by means of amplifying equipment, they listened to the musical 
program and the Conference proceedings as they were broadcast from 
the Tabernacle. 

The following program was broadcast by the Choir and Organ : 

"Glorious things are sung of Zion" (Daynes) — Choir. 

"Pilgrim's Song of Hope" (Batiste) — Organ. 

"How lovely are the Messengers" (Mendelssohn) — Choir. 

"Finale" from the First Organ Symphony (Vierne) — Organ. 

"Recessional" (DeKoven) — Choir. 

"The King of Glory" (Parks)— Choir. 

"Deep River" (Arranged by organist) — Organ. 

"Holiness becometh the House of the Lord" (Stephens) — Choir. 

"March Solonnelle" (Lemaigre) — Organ. 

"O say, What is Truth?" (Jacques-Melling)— Choir. 

"O My Father" (Arranged by organist) — Organ. 

"Hallelu j ah " ( Beethoven ) — Choir. 

The Tabernacle Choir was conducted by J. Spencer Cornwall. Organ 
accompaniments and organ solo presentations were played by Frank 
W. Asper. 

After the conclusion of the national broadcast, the Tabernacle Choir 
and the congregation joined in singing the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

Elder George D. Pyper, General Superintendent of Sunday Schools, 
offered the opening prayer. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brothers and sisters, it is again a great pleasure to be with you 
and to enjoy the spirit of this conference. 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PAYS TRIBUTE TO CHURCH MUSIC AND MUSICIANS 

Once more I wish to pay tribute to the music of our Church. Dur- 
ing this conference we have had nothing but music wonderfully rendered, 
beginning with the Summit Stake choir, a choir from one of our smaller 
stakes, singing the songs of Zion in beauty and in melody ; then with the 
Singing Mothers, who sang, as it seems to me, with all of the love and 
beauty of motherhood; and then with the great German Choir singing 
with that clarity and resonance which marks the minds and the habits of 
the great Germanic nations; and lastly with our own choir here today, 
singing sermons to us. 

I want to pay a tribute to Brother Tony Lund, whose benign 
countenance we miss today, who served us so long and so faithfully, who 
was devoted to his work. We must pay tribute to his musical culture, to 
the breadth of his musical view. It was his lot to follow a man of 
outstanding ability, and he does not suffer by the comparison. We need 
men, and need them badly, of the devotion of Tony Lund. 

And to Brother Cornwall who takes his place, with our full and 
entire confidence, we welcome him, and it is no treason to those who 
have gone before that we wish him well and hope that the choir, under 
his leadership, will go ever onward. May I say that whether Brother 
Spencer Cornwall knows it or not, he now stands at the head of the 
greatest choir in the world, a choir with a greater potential power for 
righteousness than any other choir in the world. 

THE PATH TO PEACE 

"How lovely are the messengers that preacheth the Gospel of 
peace !" And we, my brothers and sisters, are those messengers. Men 
may cry, "Peace, peace," but there will be no peace until men and women 
put out of their hearts all greed, all lust, all passion, all thirst 
for power and earthly riches, all unholy ambitions.' It is the duty 
of this people of ours to be the leaven that shall leaven the lump, 
in all of these things. Until we, this people, can eliminate from our 
minds and our hearts all the baser passions of humanity there is little 
hope for peace, either among us or in the world. 

With these things put out of our hearts, and with us living lives of 
peace, of good will, of brotherly love, of kindness, no one knows what 
the influence might be, and God, I am sure, intends that when we shall 
reach that point we shall assume the moral leadership of the world. God 
grant that that day is not far distant. 

AS THE LORD WOULD HAVE US LIVE 

"Clean hands and pure hearts," was a sermon sung this morning. 
Clean hands — clean of defilement of our fellow men, clean from the 
goods of our fellow men, clean from the blood of our fellow men ; that 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 91 



must be the cleanliness which must be ours. Pure hearts — pure before 
the Lord ; greed and lust and covetousness banished from our hearts, 
standing pure before God, that he may look therein and see there nothing 
which would cause him pain, and nothing which would make us blush. 

I have often said: "I wonder how we would all stand, and indi- 
vidually how I would stand, if I were told that God was yonder in the 
mountain and I could go to him if I wished." I wonder if my life has 
been such that I could go and stand before the Being who could look 
me through and see my secret thoughts and hopes and ambitions. Un- 
less and until, my brothers and sisters, we could stand that test, we are 
not living as the Lord would have us live. 

OBEDIENCE TO LAW NECESSARY 

My brothers and sisters, we have been told that we are governed by 
law. There are some of us who seem to fail to understand that fact. 
Read the 88th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and see what 
there it says about law, and the necessity that we shall live the law, if 
we shall be what God wants us to be, and if we shall inherit those bless- 
ings and those glories which God has provided for us if we do but live 
the law. 

LAWS OF PUNISHMENT AND LAWS OF BLESSING 

To my mind the law may be easily resolved into two categories: 
first, the law of command, and to that law of command there are added 
punishments, and those punishments come when we violate the law. All 
the great laws of nature are of this type, and there are certain great 
spiritual laws — the commission of the unpardonable sin, the commission 
of adultery, and other things — which carry with them their own punish- 
ment, whether or not we like it. 

Then there are the great laws of blessings. The Lord has given to 
us some such laws ; sometimes he has taken them away. They are the 
laws only of blessing, there being attached thereto only the punishment 
that we fail to receive the blessing — and great enough is that punishment 
at times. 

You will recall that in the time of Moses the Lord tried to per- 
suade the people that they should accept the Melchizedek priesthood. 
They were unable to do so. They failed to receive the blessing. 

In our time the Lord tried to establish among us the United Order. 
We were not able to live it. We failed to receive the blessing. 

There come readily to mind other laws, other privileges which the 
Lord has given to us, which we failed to live, and which he has been 
obliged to take away from us. 

DESTRUCTIVE DOCTRINES 

There are abroad among us, men, and women also, who are preach- 
ing doctrines that are destructive of the very fiber of our civilization. 
I hear now and again, and here and there, the doctrine of "free love." 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



There are those among you who would teach your children that the 
sexual desire is like any other biological desire, as hunger and thirst, and 
should be indulged in with as little restraint and control as we eat and 
drink. Nothing baser has been conceived by Satan than this doctrine. 

Brothers and sisters, watch your families, your children. Teach 
them, honor them, lead them away from this terrible sin. I was taught 
by my parents that they would rather carry me to the grave than that I 
should lose my virtue, and I thank God for that teaching. Until we 
come to that teaching, until that is the feeling and the thought of the 
Latter-day Saints, lust will stalk among us and take his toll. 

THE LAWS OF GOD IMMUTABLE 

There is sometimes a cry among our young people for a loosening 
of our standards. They tell us that our standards are too high, and the 
Church must abate them. My brothers and sisters, my young people, the 
Church cannot change the laws of God. They stand immutable. We 
may change the rules ; we may say that a drunkard may go into the 
temple ; we may say that a blasphemer may go into the temple ; we may 
say that he who drinks tea and coffee may go into the temple. These 
rules we may change. But we cannot change the biological law that he 
who uses narcotics must pay the penalty somehow, somewhere, some- 
time — he himself or his children or his children's children. And this is 
the tragedy and the curse of disobeying nature's laws and God's laws. 
Remember what Brother Salzner said yesterday: In that great institu- 
tion in Germany sixty-five per cent of the epileptics owe their epilepsy 
to the use of alcohol by some of their forefathers. 

My brothers and sisters, let us awaken. Let us bring into our hearts 
the Gospel. Let us live it, for if we do God will surely bless us. 

ONE GREAT EVIL MASTER MIND AT WORK 

It seems sometimes as if the darkness that surrounds us is all but 
impenetrable. I can see on all sides the signs of one great evil master 
mind working for the overturning of our civilization, the destruction of 
religion, the reduction of men to the status of animals. This mind is 
working here and there and everywhere. May we hope and may we 
pray that this is the darkness before the dawn, and that soon the light 
will come in the east, that the darkness will fade out, that a sun of right- 
eousness will rise and touch the peaks and flow down and fill the valleys, 
fill our hearts and fill our lives, until we shall be the people which God 
wishes us to be. 

May this come to us, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I pray the Lord humbly and prayerfully that he will give to me of 
his Holy Spirit, that I may appreciate, if it is possible for us to appre-

ciate, the great honor and blessing conferred upon us in holding the 
holy priesthood. I feel it a great honor to be called upon, on this 
occasion, with so little time for the President of the Church to have all his 
brethren honored and privileged in speaking of the Lord. 

You all know by this time that I have a calling in the ministry which 
if I honor and live up to, makes of me a special witness of the Lord to the 
nations of the earth. I have always been ready and willing to go forth 
among God's children and testify of these great truths. 

I have a friend on Main Street who is a lawyer. He said of me : 
"Uncle Golden seems to be very desirous of checking out and going on 
to the other side and finding out if he has told the truth." I am here 
today, not to resent that statement, for it was said in the greatest kind- 
ness and with some humor, but I am here before you good people to tell 
you that I have the same testimony that I had fifty years ago when I 
began my ministry. I may not live up to all the principles of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, I think there are few of us that seem to be able to do so, 
but under the influence of the Holy Ghost, I can testify before you in 
humility that this is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Claude Richards printed a book, called "A Biography of J. Golden 
Kimball." I am not here to sell the book. I haven't got a nickel in it; 
I wouldn't take a chance on the investment. But you will find forty 
talks in that book and it will do you good to read them if you have any 
time to waste. When I have felt blue and despondent I have picked up 
that book and read it, and I was somewhat surprised at my own testi- 
mony which I have never failed to bear. I would not do honor to my 
father, my sire, if I had not faith enough to believe that this is the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is God's church. 

I met quite a prominent man on the street — that is where I generally 
have my conversations — and he was "digging" at the Church. He was 
wondering why we do not have revelations. He was putting all those 
things up to me. I said : "Look here, my friend, I want to be kindly with 
you. You haven't got the same spirit and testimony I have. I still 
retain my testimony that this is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. God is our Father, the Creator of the world, the Giver of all 
good gifts. Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world. I am 
willing for the Lord to run this Church, but I wouldn't take a chance 
on it if you had anything to do with it." 

That is the way I feel. I sustain President Heber J. Grant with 
all my heart. I seem to understand in a way the great responsibility 
that is resting upon him and upon his counselors and upon the Council of 
the Twelve. 

I pray God with all my heart and soul that I may never do anything, 
in the short space of my life that remains, that will show any evidence 
that I have lost my faith in this Church, in this people, and in the 
general authorities. 

"raying God to bless you, I am your humble servant, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I should not have felt at all neglected if President Grant had 
passed me by this conference, to make place for others whom we 
should like to hear from, and who have not had the opportunities 
that I have always had on these occasions. However, I welcome 
the opportunity to give you a few thoughts which have touched 
me deeply during the conference and for a long time past. 

INTELLIGENCE REQUIRED IN SPIRITUAL THINGS 

I believe that as high an order of intelligence is required to 
understand and interpret the things of the spirit as is required to 
comprehend the truths of science and other secular matters. I 
believe that accomplishments and achievements in the field of 
religion are just as worthy and commendable and great as are 
accomplishments in the field of science, in the domain of business 
and commerce, and in all other worldly affairs. 

I also believe that a great many people in this world do not 
believe this thing. I am convinced that the people of the world 
have so deprecated, in their own estimation, the real place and 
value of the spiritual life and of religious activity that they have 
been weaned away from allegiance to religious institutions, spiritual 
concepts, and this great world that is out beyond the so-called 
natural world. To me it is the greatest misfortune that can over- 
take the human family, and I believe that the youth of our Church, 
unfortunately, are not free from the influence of this worldly phil- 
osophy that has so engulfed the minds and thinking of men. 

When I contemplate the beauties of this great conference — 
I have sat under its spell now for more than two days, rejoicing in 
the good things that we have heard, participating in a spirit that 
defies description, being renewed in faith and in determination to 
do my duty — I have thought, during all this period, of those who 
have not been here. 

WORLDLY PHILOSOPHIES AFFECTING YOUTH 

I have looked into the faces of good men whom I know, whose 
acquaintance I have made as I have been around through the stakes 
of Zion. I have seen good women here, whose lives and endeavors 
are given to the extension of our worthy cause ; I have looked in 
vain however, for the hordes of youth who have not been here. I 
am very happy to think that many thousands of them are sym- 
pathetic with our work ; very happy indeed to know that many are 
willing to respond to the calls that are made of them, going on 
missions, participating in the organizations and agencies of the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



95 



Church, and many, indeed, are studying the great principles of life 
and salvation which our organizations seek to teach. But I am also 
painfully aware of the fact that thousands upon thousands of them 
have been subjected and exposed to these worldly philosophies 
which deny the existence of the spiritual world. 

Their education has contributed in no small measure to this 
situation, not purposely perhaps, but nevertheless truly, for I have 
but little doubt that there are to be found many young men and 
women who have lost faith and departed from the old practices and 
the old traditions, because those things have not only been omitted 
but they have been purposely ignored and ofttimes deprecated by 
the educational systems and influences under whose tutelage the 
youth have come. 

INFLUENCE OF TEACHERS 

I do not mean to impugn an express and predetermined pur- 
pose on the part of many teachers in the country to undermine the 
faith of their pupils. I think that relatively few would have at heart 
such a sinister purpose. I cannot believe that they would be so 
inclined. But I feel certain that in the determination that is in the 
minds of that great body of men and women who constitute the 
public school system of the country to keep completely separate, as 
we should always keep separate, church and state affairs, there has 
been the neglect of some perfectly legitimate opportunities to foster 
the best things that can be given to the youth of America. 

I have been pleased to note that an effort has been and is being 
made to utilize our school system for the teaching of character and 
those principles that go to make for honesty, for virtue, depend- 
ability, and other worth-while characteristics. But I feel certain 
that a careful study and consideration of these very items would 
convince those engaged in that endeavor that there is nothing so 
potential, so effective for its accomplishment as to encourage the 
youth to abide by the faith, the time-honored traditions, the morality 
and the spirit of their fathers. 

I believe that as I make appeal to the teachers of the country 
to encourage their students to keep open minds on all these ques- 
tions that affect the faith of their fathers, I not only speak the 
sentiment of our own Church but likewise the sentiment of all good 
religious people who seek to bring to the youth of their churches 
the spirit, the theology and the traditions which they foster. 

It is such an easy thing to discourage faith in this world of 
materiality, in this world of science, where we have laid so much 
emphasis on all the scientific processes and developments that have 
been so much in evidence the last few decades. It is so easy to 
say a word to undermine faith. I wish that those who have within 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



their power the formation of the views of youth, the cultivation of 
their character, I do wish that they would be careful. 

As a tax-payer and a supporter of the public school system, 
which I admire, which I regard as one of the greatest factors for 
the civilization of the race, which I have always regarded as being 
an essential constituent of a democracy and on which my children 
are dependent for education, I have always entertained the view 
that there is no right on the part of those to whom that education 
is entrusted to in any way say one single word or promote one 
thought that will tear down the faith of my children and lead them 
from the .philosophy of faith. 

Now, our youth are especially susceptible to influences that 
lead them away from faith because, in my opinion, they do not 
always have an adequate and proper understanding of the Gospel 
of Christ. Sometimes I fear they seem to feel so much concerned 
about the injunctions and the inhibitions and the proscriptions, that 
they fail to appreciate the positive, beautiful, life-giving, joyful 
message of the Gospel of Jesus. 

SIGNIFICANCE OF LAW 

Just as President Clark has told us, the laws that have been 
given to us are inexorable and immutable. We cannot change 
them. We do not want to change them. No one does, who 
understands them in their comprehensive application to the lives of 
men and women and the world. Only those would do away with 
them who really do not grasp their true significance. 

I wish that it were possible for us to teach our youth that all 
the enduring satisfactions they ma)' ever hope for, all the real joys 
and pleasures of life, are to be had in pursuance of and not in 
contravention of Gospel principles. I wish they could feel what 
we here feel today. I wish they could know the warmth of church 
companionship. I wish they could feel the spirit that emanates 
from on high to mellow our hearts, to make us truly love one an- 
other and love God. I wish their ears could be attuned to hear the 
lovely things of truth, as the ears of these musicians hear the 
melodies and the sounds that some of us cannot hear. If they 
could be made to realize that these great blessings are to be had 
through compliance with the laws of God, through application, 
activity, diligence and loyalty, I am persuaded that many more 
would now be amenable to the influence of our organizations, many 
more would derive the joy and satisfactions which relatively few 
of us enjoy. 

THE GOSPEL A MESSAGE OF LOVE 

To that end I think that a great obligation rests upon you men 
and women to carry the message in its beauty, in its appeal, in its 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



97 



invitation, — the message of Christ to those who have not received 
it, even among- our own. 

I never regard the message of Christ as being harsh. Some- 
times it sounds a little harsh and rigorous, but I never regard it as 
being harsh. I always regard the message of Christ as being 
kindly, persuasive, forgiving and loving. I can't picture our Lord 
and Savior in any atmosphere other than that of love and kind- 
ness. I have always regarded the condemnations and penalties of 
which we sometimes speak as being largely in the nature of depri- 
vations and retardations in our progress, for we are told, in what 
seems to me to be the very genius of the Gospel according to 
modern revelation — in the vision of the glories — that every one is 
to receive even more than he anticipates, but that the highest and 
the most perfect and the lovely blessings of the future are in store 
for those who live the Christly life upon which those blessings are 
predicated. 

So I would make the Gospel inviting if I could. I would not 
moderate any of our standards, but I would, if I could, make all 
the youth know that there is no happiness except in goodness, and 
that the way to trouble is through sin. 

God help us to give the true message of Jesus Christ to those 
who are not here, to the children we love, without whom we cannot 
be happy when our associations are renewed in the life to come, 
Amen. 

The Tabernacle Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Guide us, 
O thou great Jehovah."

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

CHANGELESS TRUTHS IN A CHANGING WORLD 

Commenting upon the unjustifiable attempts of strong nations to 
subdue weaker nations, one of our leading popular contributors to syndi- 
cated newspapers said yesterday: 

Out of all history you will find but one world conqueror who came 
with clean hands, and those hands the soldiers pierced with iron spikes 
as they nailed the Nazarene to the cross. 

It was this same clean world conqueror who said: 

Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, 
I will liken unto a wise man * * * ; and whosoever heareth these sayings 
of mine, and doeth them not, I will liken unto a foolish man. 

We are living in a changing world, and some of us are becoming 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



somewhat confused by the accumulation of theories, suggestions, pro- 
posals and the expressions of doubts that seem to be filling the air. 

Recently I overheard some young men talking about the results of 
infractions of the moral law, and one of them expressed this sentiment : 
"I think we must take a broad view of this matter and look at these 
things in the light of the year 1935." I cite his remark merely because 
I think it is the expression of an attitude which has more or less general 
acceptance. I answered him quietly : "If you put your finger in the fire 
will the burn be any less intense in 1935 than it was in 1835 ?" The law 
of compensation and the law of retribution are eternally operating. 

As every thinking person knows, the principles of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ are just as applicable to the conditions of the world today 
as they have ever been in the history of mankind. Today, perhaps, as 
seldom if ever before the rock foundation built upon Christ's teachings 
is needed in the political as well as in moral and spiritual realms. Men 
and women are being swept from their old moorings by unsound theories 
and untried schemes, but before abandoning tried principles for seem- 
ingly attractive theories, they would do well first to sink their shafts 
deeper in search of the bed-rock of truth. The sooner this theory-smit- 
ten world gets on a sure foundation, the better it will be for humanity. 

A GLORIOUS AGE 

Now, please do not think me a pessimist. I love life. I think it is a 
joy to live in this age. Every morning, as I greet the sun as he ushers 
in these unexcelled autumn days, I feel the joy of living. I realize 
the accomplishments, to a certain degree, of this wonderful mechanistic 
age. Today time and distance are practically annihilated. Fifty years 
ago neighbors fifty miles apart were comparatively strangers. Today 
you can go to your telephone and in a few minutes talk to a friend 
seven thousand miles away. When Charles Lindbergh reached the 
American Embassy in Paris, after having flown from New York to 
Paris in thirty-six hours, he went to the telephone and within an hour 
told his mother that he had reached his destination in safety. If we 
were in tune at this moment we could hear Big Ben striking over 
Westminster Abbey. 

Millions of people in the world heard Admiral Byrd at the South 
Pole. Men are penetrating the stratosphere, and hoping for the nearby 
day when they will eat breakfast in New York and luncheon in Paris. 

THREATENING DANGERS 

Yes, it is a glorious age in which we live, but no thinking man will 
doubt that this age is fraught with limitless perils as well as with 
untold possibilities. It is because of threatening dangers that the world 
should become anchored in the eternal truths of Jesus Christ, and 
realize that there are eternal verities in this changing world. "Today, 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 99 

as seldom before," writes Dr. Haydn, "human society is threatened with 
disintegration, if not complete chaos. All the ancient evils of human 
relationships, injustice, selfishness, abuse of strength, become sinister 
and terrible when reinforced by the vast increase of material power. 
The soul of man cowers, starved and fearful in the midst of a civiliza- 
tion grown too complex for any mind to visualize or control." 

And Charles Foster Kent, commenting upon the "chaotic state," of 
our civilized world says : 

Political organizations and ideals that have both fortified and handi- 
capped us have been thrown into the discard. Long accepted social 
theories have suddenly been rejected, and new ones are being adopted. 
Many of the moral standards of our fathers are being set aside in theory 
as well as in practice. The rising generation has no fear and little 
respect for elders. The elders, recognizing what a wreck they have made 
of civilization, question their own infallibility. Religious dogmas, long 
regarded as the corner stones of religion and the church, are being dis- 
proved' or supplanted by the discoveries of modern science. It is not 
strange, that the majority of the men and women in this war-shattered 
world are unhappy, because they feel the foundations beneath them are 
tottering. 

I think the realization of the position of our so-called civilized 
countries may be deeply sensed when I call your attention to the fact that 
at this moment, while we are here worshipping, if we could tune in 
properly we could hear the guns booming that are now blasting out 
the lives of young men, old men, women and children in Ethiopia. 

MORAL IDEALS AND SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS LACKING 

The world needs fundamentals, eternal verities that never change. 
They need to adopt the teachings of the man into whose hands the 
soldiers drove the iron spikes, "the only world conqueror who came 
with clean hands." 

Commenting upon world conditions that cry out for something 
better and more definitely uplifting, J. William Hudson, Professor of 
Philosophy, University of Missouri, says : 

The very heart of the .present unrest in America is not merely of 
unrest of dissatisfied wants. It is that much more serious thing, the unrest 
of not knowing what is wanted. It is the unrest of the man who craves 
something to satisfy his palate, but knows not just what it is he craves. _ 
The appetite is normal enough. It simply has not defined itself sufficiently. ' 

And another, commenting on the same condition, says: 

The standards of the home, even the criteria for the rearing of chil- 
dren have broken down. The leisure occupations of youth, always symp- 
tomatic in any age, are not only unguidedly and frankly hedonistic, but 
across the borders of what was once considered decorous, not because 
of a new and liberalizing moral standard, as we sometimes pretended, 
but because of the lack of any. The popularity of certain recent dances, 
formerly forbidden even in the "red-light" districts, is typical. So is much 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of our periodical reading matter, and any number of movie plays, over 
the edge of the decadently errotic, with a censorship that does not censor 
because of moral and financial doubt. 

He mentions the fact that dishonesty is permeating public and 
private life alike, tainting the administration of justice, tainting our 
legislative halls, tainting the conduct of private business, polluting at 
times even the church itself. In the same utterance he averred that a 
source of infinite evil in every modern society is impurity of word and 
act. 

He goes on to assert that "if there is to be social and political 
regeneration in the republic and in the rest of the world, it must be by 
tremendous regeneration of moral ideals." 

What are the moral ideals and the spiritual teachings of the Man 
of Nazareth? Down through the centuries there have come ringing 
these words : 

I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in . 
darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Do Christians really believe this ? If so, they are hearing his other 
ringing words : 

Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness ; and all these 
things shall be added unto you. 

His teachings are simple, and sometimes they seem so simple that 
we toss them aside. 

FUNDAMENTALS TAUGHT BY JESUS 

Last evening I had the privilege of calling attention of the Priest- 
hood to the little simple principle of kindness. That is a principle the 
world lacks. We rather go to backbiting, talebearing, gossiping, and in 
some cases lying about one another. All these are un-Christlike, un- 
christian. They spring from the source mentioned by President Clark, 
the power that is seeking to destroy Christ's principles and Christ's 
church. 

The principles of honesty, just simple honesty, and fair dealing are 
fundamental principles that never change. 

THE EXISTENCE OF A PERSONAL GOD 

But there are other comprehensive principles to which I wish to 
call your attention. The first fundamental truth advocated by Jesus 
Christ was this, that behind, above and over all there is God the Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth. This universe, therefore is not left to the 
guidance of an irrational, random chance, but on the contrary is ordered 
and controlled by a marvelous intelligence and wisdom. 

Because Science says to you young men that it has not found a 
divine, personal Being, nor the soul of man, are you justified in con- 
cluding that these realities do not exist ? "There is not a single scientific 
specialist of repute," says Dr. Hudson, "who has attempted to prove by 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



101 



scientific method that what science cannot demonstrate is thereby dis- 
proved." On the contrary, hear ringing these glorious words : "God and 
the unseen world are not merely objects of surmise. We know them in 
experience." 

Far more direct and impressive are the words of the one in this 
dispensation who saw God and His Son : 

When the light rested upon me I saw two personages, whose bright- 
ness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of 
them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other : 
"This is my beloved Son. Hear him." 

There is an unchanging truth in an unchanging world, that should 
be an anchor to the soul of every person in it. 

SACREDNESS OF HUMAN PERSONALITY 

A second I am going to name is the sacredness of personality. The 
least child was sacred to Jesus. "It is not the will of your Father in 
heaven that one of these little ones should perish." That simple truth in 
the world, what would it mean? 

Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my 
brethren, ye have done it unto me. 

And in this modern day he said : 

Remember the worth of souls is great. 

A proper conception of this divine principle would change the 
attitude of the world, to the benefit and happiness of all human beings. 
It would bring into active operation the Golden Rule : "Do unto others 
as you would have others do unto you." 

What a different world this were if men would accumulate wealth, 
for example, not as an end but as a means of blessing human beings and 
improving human relations. A Christian conception of the right and 
value of a human soul, even though his skin be dark, would have pre- 
vented, the slaughter that at this moment is being perpetrated in Ethiopia. 

SPIRITUAL COMMUNION A REALITY 

And a third fundamental truth is this, that direct communion be- 
tween the Spirit of God and the spirit of men may be a reality. With all 
my soul I echo the appeal of my brother, Stephen L. Richards, that we 
may lead the youth into that realm in which they will sense that com- 
munion. The promise of the Lord to his apostles is a reality: 

I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that 
he may abide with you for ever. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from 
the Father, even the spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, 
he shall testify of me. 

And again : 

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 

Who are the pure in heart ? Those who let no selfishness or hatred 
or vile thought becloud their spiritual vision. ■ 

FREE AGENCY 

And the fourth is this, that man has the inherent power to do right 
or to do wrong. In this he has his free agency, to choose the right and 
obtain salvation, or he may choose evil and learn abominations. 

These are eternal verities, as applicable in the year 1935 as they were 
when Jesus first promulgated them, and they will remain fundamental 
and essential elements in man's progress and happiness as long as life 
and being last. 

Associated with these are eternal truths that constitute the plan of 
salvation ; faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly 
kindness, godliness, charity ; "For if these things," we are told, "be in 
you and abound, they leave you that you shall be neither barren nor un- 
fruitful in a knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. To know whom, and 
God the Father, is eternal life." — man's greatest blessing. 

In the questioning days of early boyhood I first felt a kinship with 
Christ, our Lord and Savior. I know his love and his divine guidance. 
He is the sinless Son of Man. "He is the first and the last and is alive 
forevermore." Only by obedience to his teachings can man find happi- 
ness and peace. Truly whosoever heareth his sayings and doeth them 
shall be likened unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock ; and 
the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat 
upon that house ; but it fell not ; for it was founded upon a rock. 

God help us all to walk in the light as he is in the light, and thereby 
avoiding the unhappiness, sinfulness and misery of a misguided world, 
find joy and peace and beauteous life here in this probation and in the 
life to come, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I believe that for the first time in my administration as the President 
of the Church I shall occupy the remaining time. One reason that I do 
this is because there are about twice as many people here today as there 
were when I delivered my address Friday morning. 

SHOULD NOT DISCOURAGE BELIEF IN BIBLE 

I want to say that I know, from personal testimony to me, that in 
the University that I have contributed of my means to assist in its sup- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



103 



port, some teachers have been guilty of asking questions that they have 
no business to ask. Men who are drawing salaries are asking questions 
that create a disbelief in the Bible. If they would just control their 
tongues and teach what they are paid to teach, I for one would be grateful 
to them. When teachers stand before their classes and ask students to 
hold up their hands in answer to a question whether they believe some- 
thing that is in the Bible, such instructors are doing that which I think 
they should refrain from doing, because that is not what they are paid 
for. Let the Bible alone, and not attempt to get a "ha-ha" out of those 
who do not believe its teachings. 

THE BIBLE IS WHAT IT PURPORTS TO BE 

In my youth I read a book entitled, "The Cause and Cure of Infi- 
delity," and I became converted, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the 
Bible is exactly what it purports to be. The man who wrote the book 
sperit eighteen years of his life trying to turn people from infidelity to a 
belief in the Bible, and he announced that at the end of that time, with 
two exceptions, he had converted to a belief in the divine authenticity of 
the Bible all who would read eight books that he would place in their 
hands, and read them twice. One of the exceptions was a lawyer who 
said, "If I were a juryman and had taken an oath to render a verdict 
according to the evidence, I would have to say that the point was proven." 
Dr. Nelson said : "Whether he continued his studies or not I do not know, 
because he subsequently lost his mind." 

The other man whom he failed to convert was a young man who 
came to him with a serious face and said : "Dr. Nelson, I acknowledge 
freely and fairly that every argument that I ever raised against the Bible 
as being from God has been met and answered and fairly overturned by 
the books that you have placed in my hands. Furthermore, I do acknowl- 
edge that I have found arguments so strong and so momentous in favor 
of the divine authenticity of the Bible that I am una.ble to meet or to 
answer them, and yet I do not and cannot believe in the Bible." 

If they read them only once, they became greater infidels generally 
than they were before, because they found many arguments against the 
Bible that they had never heard before and they accepted them. 

Richard W. Young (who was my nearest and dearest friend) and I 
listened to a half dozen lectures, as I remember, by David McKenzie, a 
returned missionary from Scotland, first in one ward and then in an- 
other ; we followed him around. In his concluding lecture he said : "Now, 
if you want to know more about the things concerning which I have been 
talking to you, buy Nelson's book, 'The Cause and Cure of Infidelity.' 
All that I have said I learned out of that book, and you will find a whole 
lot more than I have said." 

Not only did we hear the lectures, but we read the book aloud 
twice, taking turns in reading, and there came into my heart, into the

eternal part of me that will live on after those who ridicule the Bible are 
dead and buried, an assurance that that book is just exactly what it pur- 
ports to be, and that prophecies recorded in it uttered hundreds of years 
before their fulfilment have come to pass. 

THE GOSPEL HERE TO STAY 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was referred to 
in prophecy centuries ago. It was stated that "in the last days the moun- 
tain of the Lord's house should be established in the tops of the moun- 
tains," and here it is, and it is here to stay. The promise has been made 
that it shall not be given to another people. That promise was never 
made regarding any other dispensation of the Gospel. 

We do not need to fear, but I do complain absolutely against any 
teacher who says to his class : "You have always had a prayer here in the 
past. If we knew there is somebody to pray to, we would have a prayer 
in the future, but as we do not know, we will not pray." All I ask of him 
is that he just keep his mouth shut and not pray. 

FORMERLY ABSURDITIES, NOW DEMONSTRATED FACTS 

They talk about not teaching infidelity — they teach it by asking such 
a question as: "Do you believe in the flood?" I do, and I have no doubt 
of it. There is no need of any such question. Just be honest. And it is 
not honest to draw money to teach people that which we are not asked to 
teach, and that which is calculated to destroy faith, just as was the case 
with the doctor who ridiculed me for believing that there were cement 
buildings in the early days among the Nephites. Ridiculous ! Absurd ! 
But in the providences of the Lord that absurdity has been demonstrated 
to be a fact. He ridiculed me for believing that the voice of Jesus was 
heard all over the land. "You know that is a lie, young man," said he, 
"because if you get up on top of a house and shout, your voice can be 
heard only a short distance." Thank God I have heard the voice of 
Admiral Byrd all the way from the South Pole ! Thank the Lord for 
demonstrating thousands of things that used to be ridiculed by the infidel ! 

God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The 
Bible teaches that he should come and that he should be the Redeemer, 
and it teaches that his Gospel should be established in the last days. And 
that Gospel is here, and we defy all the professors that walk the earth to 
change it. 

God bless you. Amen. 

The Tabernacle Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "O ye 
mountains high." 

Elder Franklin S. Harris, President of the Brigham Young Univer- 
sity, offered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



THIRD DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock 
p. m., Sunday, April 6. 

Once more the great Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, and thou- 
sands of people congregated in the Assembly Hall and on the Tabernacle 
grounds, where they listened to the proceedings of the meeting as they 
were broadcast by radio from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir rendered the music for this session. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Now let us rejoice in 
the day of salvation." 

Elder Leo J. Muir, President of the Los Angeles Stake, offered the 
invocation. 

An anthem, "God of Israel" (Stephens), was sung by the Choir. 

PRESIDENT PvUDGER CLAWSON 

President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am looking into the faces of a multitude of people. This great 
tabernacle is crowded to the limit, every seat is taken and many are 
standing. I sympathize with those who are standing. Assembled here 
is a representative body of the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints — people from 114 stakes of Zion, and among them 
presidencies of stakes, high councilors, bishoprics of wards, presidencies 
of quorums of priesthood and of auxiliary organizations. 

When I came into the Council of the Twelve, thirty-six years ago, 
there were less than fifty stakes of Zion. Today there are 114 stakes. 
Verily Zion is growing. 

MUSIC APPRECIATED 

Brethren and sisters, I have been thrilled with the spirit of this 
conference, with the splendid singing we have heard all through, and 
now, today, the singing of the great Tabernacle Choir. To me it is mar- 
velous and inspiring. 

Pardon me if I digress just a moment to speak a word of praise for 
the fine work accomplished by the Tabernacle Choir, under the direction 
of Professor Albert J. Southwick, at the San Diego Fair. It wasn't my 
good fortune to be there, but I have read about it in the newspapers 
and heard it mentioned by a number of people and know that they ac- 
complished a great and a good work. 

OPERATION OF LAWS INESCAPABLE 

I was thrilled with the testimony and exhortation of President Heber 
J. Grant in the opening address of this conference and with that which 



* 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was said in all of the addresses that have been delivered thus far. 
We have had quite a variety of instructions but they have all been ap- 
propriate and fitted together very beautifully. President Clark rather 
emphatically emphasized the power and influence of law, saying that 
we are living under a reign of law. How true that is ! Wherever we 
go, or whichever way we turn, we are confronted by the glorious prin- 
ciple of law. Throughout the Church, in all the stakes and wards of 
Zion you will meet it. As citizens of our great American republic, of 
Utah, of Salt Lake City, and all the other cities in the land you will be 
confronted by the operation of law. We cannot escape it. From the 
moment we are born until we die we will be under the influence of law. 

LAW OF FINANCE 

Let me remind you, brethren and sisters, that the Latter-day Saints 
are a practical people. If it is said that they have to do with spiritual 
things it may be said with equal truth that they also have to do with 
temporal things. The line that divides the temporal from the spiritual — ■ 
if such a line there be — has never been discovered. And as touching 
the temporal, in the beginning of this work the Lord foresaw with clear 
vision that his Church could not be restored upon the earth and built 
up upon this land except by and under the principle of law, for indeed 
he gave to the Church two great and important laws, — the law of Finance 
and the law of Health. Great and important as is the law of finance, 
or tithing, as we call it, it was given in brevity and couched in terms so 
simple that even a child could comprehend it. The language of the law is, 
in part, as follows : 

And they [meaning the Latter-day Saints] shall pay one-tenth of 
all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing iaw unto them 
forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord. 

Very simple, very direct, very much to the point. The observance 
of this law of finance has in many instances brought temporaf salvation 
to the Church. In times of prosperity? Yes. In times ot panic and 
depression? Yes. It is in constant operation under all conditions. It 
never ceases, because it is to be a standing law to the Church forever, 
and there is something of spirituality in that thought too. Any member 
of the Church who has an income and refuses to pay his tithing is not 
loyal to the cause. The Lord plainly says also in connection with this 
important law that it is by and through this law that the land ot Zion 
is to be sanctified. And should the people of the Latter-day Saints 
fail to observe it, it would not be a land of Zion unto them. 

Now this law, upon investigation, has elicited the admiration of 
many Christian churches and some pastors have desired to introduce 
it into their communities, but for some reason they cannot succeed ; they 
do not seem to be able to do it, from a lack perhaps of union and cohesion. 
Brethren and sisters, we should regard it as a privilege as well as a duty 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



107 



to ^observe this holy commandment. The best time to pay tithing is 
when revenue comes into our hands, whether by the week, or the month, 
or the season. Then we will be very happy at the end of the year to 
find that our tithing is paid and that our credit with the Lord is not 
impaired. 

RELIEF FROM BONDAGE OF DEBT 

Let me beseech of you, brethren and sisters of this great congrega- 
tion and of the Church, do not forget the Lord and the Lord will not 
forget you. I apprehend that there are perhaps many in this congre- 
gation, and many throughout the Church, who would like to be relieved 
of the bondage of debt, for it exerts a terrible pressure upon many 
people. All we have to say in that respect is, pay an honest tithing to the 
Lord, punctually and regularly, and he will bless you and help you get 
out of debt, and if that occurs, brethren and sisters, let me say in the 
language of the late President Joseph F. Smith, "Keep out of debt." 

I have been in debt myself, and I am now out of debt, thank the 
Lord, and I wish to assure you that it brings a very comfortable feeling 
and is a happy condition to be in. 

THE LAW OF HEALTH 

Now in respect to the Law of Health. Is it not wonderful that 
the Lord was so thoughtful in the beginning as to consider the import- 
ance of the health of his people. It appears that he looked ahead and 
with his prophetic eye saw that there was danger, and consequently in 
his great mercy he gave to us the law of health. We have already heard 
during the conference some things in regard to this law, but many of 
you were not present. I will now repeat a paragraph from a revelation 
on the Word of Wisdom mentioned by President Grant in his address, 
which is as follows : 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in 
the last days, I have warned you and forewarn you, by giving unto you 
this word of wisdom by revelation. 

Then it was that the Lord declared the nature of this law and the 
requirements that are made by it, and said that strong drinks are not 
for the use of man, but for the washing of the body; and that hot 
drinks — meaning tea and coffee — are not for the body nor the belly. 
Further, that tobacco is not good for man, neither for his body nor his 
belly. The Lord also points out the things that are good for man, but 
not all of them. And in respect to these things that are pronounced as 
being evil, he does not tell us in the revelation why there is evil in 
them, but time has determined this question. Scientific men have told 
us that in tobacco there is a deadly poison, and in tea there is a poison 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



called tannin, in coffee a poison called caffeine. And we know that such 
must be the case, because these forbidden things are really and sub- 
stantially narcotics, arid a narcotic is something that is habit-forming. 
The things that are good for us are not habit-forming. We can take 
them up or put them down, but these bad habits very often and in most 
cases become masters of men ; the habit is greater and stronger it ap- 
pears than the individual. 

WOMEN SMOKE PUBLICLY 

One very serious phase of this matter relating to the use of tobacco 
is the fact that women and young girls are taking up the habit through- 
out the nation, and may I say throughout the world, it is marvelous 
how rapidly the practice has spread, and it is a most serious thing for 
the Latter-day Saints to consider. Whenever you go in the world at 
large, in the hotels, in the eating places, in the theatres, and in the lobbies 
of ballrooms you will find women joining with men in smoking tobacco. 
And might I be pardoned if I take just a moment to call your attention 
to the. evil effects of tobacco, because of these poisons that I have 
mentioned, the tobacco poison is the most dangerous. It is called nicotine 
and is a deadly poison. 

A LADY MISSIONARY'S INFLUENCE 

I might here remark that one of the mission presidents reported in 
our meeting with the mission presidents Wednesday that in one of the 
cities of his mission a lady missionary was conducting an M. I. A. class 
with a membership of some eight young men not members of the Church, 
and they appeared to be very enthusiastic in the study. They greatly 
appreciated the opportunity and thought it was wonderful what was 
being done by that young woman from Zion. One of them said to her: 

"We understand that your Church counsels its members against 
the use of tobacco. Is that true ?" 

She said: "Yes, that is true." 

They then said: "All of us use tobacco, but we wish you would 
help us to overcome the habit." 

And she helped them by referring them to the law of health, or 
Word of Wisdom of our Church, and it was reported that they are suc- 
ceeding in their effort to overcome the habit. Let me again call to 
your attention that these young men were non-Mormons. Think of it, 
reflect upon it. 

NOTED OUTSIDERS' VIEWS ON SMOKING 

In New York City a certain magistrate said emphatically : "Ninety- 
nine out of one hundred boys between the ages of 10 and 17 who have 
come before me charged with crime have their fingers disfigured with 
yellow cigarette stains." 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



109 



This is what the famous Dr. Jordan says: "The boy who begins 
cigarette smoking never enters the life of the world. When other boys 
are taking hold of the world's work he is concerned with the sexton and 
undertaker." 

A thirteen-year old boy, who looked to be about nine, was taken 
to a hospital for treatment. He was stunted physically, mentally and 
morally, and the nurse in pity asked, "Who taught you to smoke ?" 

"My brother." 

"He should be in jail." 

"He is," replied the lad. 

Elbert Hubbard went down in the sea on the great ship Lusitania. 
He said : "Never advance the pay of a cigarette smoker ; never promote 
him; never depend on him; never again will he be as much of a man 
as he is now. His future lies behind him." 

Thomas A. Edison : "No man or boy who smokes cigarettes can 
work in my laboratory. There are enough degenerates in the world with- 
out manufacturing more by means of cigarettes." 

Dr. Mayo : "I do not smoke, do not approve of smoking, the ablest 
surgeons, men at the top, do not smoke." 

Dr. Kellogg was consulted by a man suffering from a bad case of 
tobacco heart. He said : "Brother, you must help me, I have just opened 
business, have thousands of dollars of my friends' money invested, and 
must make good." The doctor informed him that it was too late. In 
frantic despair the man cried : "Why didn't I know this before ; why 
didn't someone tell we what tobacco will do to a man ?" 

We are telling our congregations and all of our people just what 
tobacco will do to a man. 

TOBACCO AFFECTS MIND 

The superintendent of one of our large insane asylums makes the 
statement that fully fifty per cent of the patients there have lost their 
intellects through the use of tobacco. 

Dr. Poulson tells this story : "A little woman came into my office 
followed by two strong men, who held a wild-eyed insane youth of 
seventeen. His mother asked me to investigate and see if there was any 
hope for the boy. I told her there was none. She broke down and 
sobbed as if her heart would break. I asked her what had brought her 
son to that condition? Cigarettes — he smoked more and more until he 
got to fifty cigarettes a day; then his mind gave way." 

I submit to you brethren and sisters that these two great laws, the 
law of Finance and the law of Health, are essential to the welfare and 
prosperity and success of this great people, the Latter-day Saints. 

May God bless you and us in our efforts to put down these evil 
things and to uphold the good things in life, is my prayer, and. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am grateful for my membership in the Church, for I know that it 
is true and divine — that it is the work of our Eternal Father and his 
Son, Jesus Christ. I rejoice that through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
divine authority has been restored to the earth f'or the preaching of the 
Gospel and the administration in the ordinances of the same. I am 
appreciative of the splendid service that is being rendered by the stake 
presidencies and ward bishoprics, by the mission presidents and the 
traveling missionaries, and by all the other officers throughout the 
Church. I rejoice in the faith and devotion of the Latter-day Saints. 
It is also gratifying to note the fine work of those who have talents, and 
who impart of those talents for the benefit of others. The inspirational 
character of the music that has been rendered in the different sessions 
has been very pleasing. I congratulate the Tabernacle Choir, the 
director and the organists for the splendid service they are giving, 
which is creating such a wonderfully favorable impression for this 
people throughout the United States and throughout the world. 

SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AIDS GOSPEL SPREAD 

I realize the fact that with the wonderful development in a scientific 
way, in communication, in transportation, and in other fields, the world 
is hurrying swiftly onward, that means are being developed whereby 
this work will be enabled to use the facilities available to go forward 
with even greater rapidity than it has in the past. It is our responsibility 
and our opportunity to keep pace with the times in the use of these 
facilities for the spread of the Gospel message. 

TELEVISION NEAR AT HAND 

I think we may expect within a year or two, at the latest, not only 
to hear the voice of the President of the Church over the radio, but that 
those who live within a radius of 25 or 30 miles of this city will be able 
to see his visual image by means of television. During the summer I 
had the privilege of visiting the television laboratories of a Utah man 
in Philadelphia, — Philo T. Farnsworth, — and there saw a demonstra- 
tion of the development of a new principle, different from any that has 
heretofore been employed, so far as I know — the electronic principle, — 
whereby the visual image is produced by electrical rays. The day 
before I was there the radio editors of New York newspapers had been 
there and seen that demonstration, and one or two papers had written 
accounts of the same. The statement was made that, within six months 
or a year at the latest, receiving sets for television would be available 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 111 

at fairly reasonable prices and that transmitting equipment would be set 
up so that people could receive visual images by television. 

THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER 

The eyes of the world are upon this work and upon this people as 
never before. The principles taught by this Church are recognized by 
thinking men and women as generally outstanding. We shall be judged 
by our observance of those principles. You remember the parable of 
the sower, one of the great parables taught by the Savior. The sower 
went forth sowing seed, some of the seeds fell by the wayside, and the 
fowls came and devoured them ; some fell upon stony places, where there 
was not much soil, and at once the seeds sprung up, because there was 
no depth of earth ; and when the sun was up, the plants were scorched, 
and withered away because they had no roots. Some fell among thorns, 
and the thorns sprung up and choked them. But others fell in good 
ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred fold, some sixty fold, 
and some thirty fold. 

GOD IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS 

When the Apostle Peter, a Jew, was led by revelation to Cornelius, 
a Gentile, a believer in the Gospel, and he saw the evidences of the 
power of the Holy Spirit in Cornelius, he declared, "Of a truth I per- 
ceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that 
feareth him and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him," I realize, 
after my trip east this past summer, that a much more favorable and 
friendly attitude is in evidence toward this people by intelligent men 
and women. In fact, in some respects, their attitude is so favorable 
and their appreciation of our principles so strong that we are under a 
great responsibility to endeavor to measure up to the standards which 
they have set up for us. If we sense the meaning of this attitude and 
have the love of the Gospel in our hearts, we shall endeavor to exemplify 
the Gospel principles in every respect in our lives. If we fail to do this, 
we shall, in larger or smaller measure, bring reproach upon the Church. 

OBSERVANCE OF COMMANDMENTS BRINGS BLESSINGS 

We receive blessings according to our observance of divine c'om- 
v mandments. Every promise and blessing is conditioned upon the 
observance of certain requirements. So it is with the observance of 
natural laws. If people choose to transgress divine laws, they will fail 
to gain the advantages of such principles. Everyone of us will be judged 
according to his actions. Occasionally members- of the Church fail to 
follow the counsel of Church leaders as to the observance of Gospel 
principles. They have, of course, the right to do so. But they fail to 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



realize that these leaders are unselfishly concerned for the welfare of 
every member of the Church. Only to the extent that the Gospel seed 
finds root in their hearts and is properly nourished will they be able to 
produce the fruits of the same. 

PEOPLE WHO SEEK "LOAVES AND FISHES" 

There are people who would join this Church or any church in 
order to get any material benefits that might accrue therefrom. They 
are the type referred to by the Savior on one occasion as those who 
seek the "loaves and fishes." I think there is danger in public pronounce- 
ment that the Church will take care of any in need who hold member- 
ship in the Church. Certainly it is the Church policy to see to it that 
no Church member suffers for lack of the necessities of life. But this 
should not necessarily mean that the Church alone should carry this 
load. Of course, those who are faithful, who have brought forth fruits of 
righteousness deserve Church assistance when in need. Others who 
are indifferent and seek the "loaves and fishes" should be cared for 
through public agencies. All who are able-bodied should be provided 
with employment. But in such times as these, when private employment 
is lacking, it is reasonable and proper that they should obtain employ- 
ment through public undertakings. In normal times, when private in- 
dustry is functioning properly, employment is largely available for 
practically all workers. 

EFFORTS TO BECOME SELF-SUSTAINING 

All Church members should realize the importance, and cultivate the 
aim, of endeavoring to support themselves and those dependent upon 
them, but also of contributing to the great work of the Church with their 
time and means. It is the aim of the Church to help those in need to help 
themselves. Various conditions cause distress. The causes must be 
determined — whether unemployment, sickness, disability, education or 
other causes. As far as possible the remedy should be applied to enable 
the distressed to become self-supporting. 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHURCH 

It must be remembered that this Church has a great mission and 
a great responsibility : to preach the Gospel in all the nations, — to build 
up the Church groups in the branches, wards and stakes, — to provide 
the necessary facilities for worship, spiritual and recreational develop- 
ment, — to advance the work of salvation for the dead, — and to promote 
the temporal as well as the spiritual welfare of its members. All these 
things require much means as well as voluntary service. Every member 
of the Church is expected to do his or her part to help in these various 
respects. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



113 



IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRY 

Everyone who is a member, or who is interested in the Gospel, 
should be encouraged to exemplify the spirit of the beehive. The com- 
bined efforts — both spiritual and financial — of all Church members are 
needed in order that this work may best fulfil its destiny. President 
Brigham Young declared on one occasion : "The non-producer must live 
on the products of those who labor. There is no other way. If we all 
labor a few hours a day, we can then spend the remainder of our time in 
rest and the improvement of our minds." The Lord declared: "Thou 
shalt not be idle, for the idler shall not eat the bread nor wear the garment 
of the laborer." 

ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY IN CHURCH AFFAIRS 

It appears to me, that, in order to accomplish all the many things 
with which the Church is charged, there must be practiced economy and 
efficiency in all of the various responsibilities, — missionary work, facil- 
ities for worship and spiritual, educational and recreational development, 
and temporal relief. To promote the temporal welfare of the people of 
this intermountain country, I think we should go back to the principle 
of practical cooperation, — in productive as well as in consumptive enter- 
prises. They will provide local employment, use local materials, keep 
money at home and furnish profitable returns. I am told that, if all of 
us would become home industry minded and patronize local industry as 
far as local production is feasible, employment would soon be available 
for practically all unemployed. Likewise, I think we should encourage 
and promote more practical training in the various trades and vocations 
adaptable to the local conditions. Also, if those engaged in farming 
suffer repeatedly from lack of water and land fertility, they should 
have the opportunity and counsel, if necessary, to re-locate on projects 
where such requisites are practically assured and where the Church 
organizations can be established. 

I pray that all of us as Church members may strive continually to put 
ourselves in a position to be most helpful in the advancement of this 
work, as well as to be abte to take care of ourselves and those who are 
dependent upon us. 

May the Lord bless us to this end, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My brethren and sisters, very naturally you will not expect me to 
occupy this position very long this afternoon as the hour is well nigh 
spent. I, however, appreciate the opportunity of mingling my voice 
with those of my brethren in testimony of the truth. 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Brother J. Golden Kimball has called attention to the fact that in 
the position we occupy we are supposed to be special witnesses of 
this great truth, and that we endeavor to be to the fullest of our capacity 
in all soberness. 

We have heard many references here this afternoon to the Prince of 
Peace and his mission in the earth. We name ourselves the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that to me means much. Jesus 
Christ we accept as the Son of God, our Redeemer. We believe that it 
was through him that our greatest opportunities were vouchsafed to us 
in the earth. We believe that he came into the earth and labored in our 
behalf and gave us a wonderful body of doctrine that we might follow, 
and laid down his life for us, becoming the first fruits of the resurrection. 
We believe that resurrection to be a fact and it opens up to us the very 
greatest possibilities that man could ever desire, I am sure. If it is not 
a fact that he was resurrected, then we are a deluded people. The 
scriptures have borne that testimony to us, a testimony so well proven 
that any court at law would accept it, and it is refreshing at times to find 
men who even delve into the sciences that we are partly familiar with 
who are willing to accept the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ as a 
demonstrated fact. 

I call your attention to the article that appeared in the Deseret 
News supplement some time ago from the pen of Apostle Joseph F. 
Merrill who is presiding over the European Mission. I say it is re- 
freshing when men such as he refers to will testify to this fact in the face 
of the many questions that are constantly being asked regarding it. We 
accept that fact as an actuality and a verity. Our faith rests upon it, 
and Christ himself told Peter and his disciples that upon the testimony 
which he had received, and which we might receive from God our 
Heavenly Father that that is true, he would found his church. We rest 
just as firmly upon that testimony in this day as they did in that. 

The resurrection, being an accomplished fact and a possibility 
with us, opens up to us wonderful opportunities. Perhaps there is no 
more sublime thought in all our teachings and all our doctrines than the 
possibility of eternal and perpetual progress that the human soul is 
capable of. Remove from our philosophy the thought and possibility 
of a resurrection and we lose that wonderful thought of eternal progres- 
sion. With it goes the thought of our mutual association in family 
relationships we so much cherish as a people. They to me are crucial 
and fundamental beliefs. If we cannot accept them it becomes a sad 
clay for us, but we do accept them wholeheartedly as they are perhaps 
the most wonderful thoughts in all of our philosophy. Along with this 
thought we accept another, the fact that testimony of this was borne to 
our generation. I mean the generation in these modern times, if we can 
extend it over a hundred years or more. That same testimony that 
Christ is a resurrected being, and a testimony as to the personality of God, 
his Father, came to us through a modern prophet. That tact and its 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



115 



succeeding important events were commemorated just recently by the 
erection and unveiling of a monument on the Hill Cumorah. 

Those to me are the chief cornerstones of the foundation upon 
which we base our faith — the actual Sonship of Jesus Christ, his resur- 
rection from the dead, and the restoration of the knowledge of this 
wonderful thing through the Prophet Joseph Smith. If we accept them, 
and we do, then we are in very deed Latter-day Saints, provided that we 
are able to live approximately at least according to the teachings involved 
in their doctrines.. 

That is the testimony that I want to leave with you. I believe these 
things sincerely. I believe them to be true. I am willing to accept the 
responsibility of advocating them, and I am going to try to the best of 
my ability to live in accordance with them. 

I pray that our Heavenly Father will grant to me and my colleagues 
and all the officers of this Church the power to live that doctrine and live 
it so as to be an example to every member of our flock, so that no man 
who looks at us can say, "He teaches one thing but does another." That 
to me is the saddest thing in the world, to have a man go out and talk 
and talk and talk a truth, and never live it. If we can live our teachings 
there is no question about our future. I pray that God will bless us with 
this strength, that every officer in this Church may be an example, that 
every member in this Church may equally be an example to those with 
whom he associates in the world at large ; and when the time comes that 
our example may measure up to our teachings and to the things we know 
to be right, then we will be the power in the earth that the Lord has 
desired and destined this great organization to become. 

May God bless you all, Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, 
for a prophet." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I think I echo the sentiments of every member of the Church present, 
that this conference has been one that will be remembered as long as we 
live. Never before have I felt the inspiration of God to such an extent 
as I have during this conference. 

I anticipated referring somewhat in detail to what I find in a book 
entitled, "Twelve Modern Apostles." It was published in 1926. There 
were selected from twelve denominations one person to speak for each. 
I was selected at that convention held in Chicago to speak in behalf of 
what they termed the Mormon Church. As I took the book from the 
shelf the other day — having forgotten all about it — I looked it over and 
turned to the article prepared by myself, to remind me of what I said 
upon that occasion. I haven't the time now, to discuss it in detail but I 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



want to say to you that the first sentence of the article that I prepared 
at that time reads as follows : 

"In the first place I was born one." 

LIVING UP TO PRINCIPLES WE BELIEVE 

I was born one, and while years passed before 1 could stand before 
a congregation of Latter-day Saints or otherwise and state that I knew 
this was God's Church, that I knew that the Presidents of the Church 
from the beginning had received revelations from God, and that this 
Church was directed not by the wisdom of man, but by the inspiration 
of our Heavenly Father, I would rather die than lose my testimony, 
and I have never been ashamed of it no matter where I have been. I 
have never occupied a position that man or woman could point to me 
and say, "He doesn't live up to the principles professed by him." In all 
of the gatherings of the men of the nation that I have attended, the 
great dinners given by the wealthy in Washington, where liquors were 
served at every banquet, never have I tasted a drop of their liquors or 
wines. At the first great banquet I attended, given by the wealthiest 
woman in the world, there were at every guest's place at the table 
glasses for the three different wines that were served. At the close of 
the dinner the hostess noticed that I had not taken a drop of these wines, 
and she said to me : "Senator Smoot, wasn't my wine good enough for 
you?" 

I had a chance to explain to her the Word of Wisdom as under- 
stood by us. I begged of her to take no offense, for none was intended. 
It was not long until everyone in Washington — for I did the same at 
every dinner, at the embassies of foreign countries, or whatever the 
occasion might be — knew that I did not drink liquor. I thank God that 
I had strength enough to act as I professed, and as my religion taught me. 
God never requires of his people anything that he does not provide a 
way for its accomplishment. I think sometimes that our growth is slow, 
perhaps conversions are not so fast as we think they ought to be, but 
they are just as fast as people are prepared to keep the word of God 
and listen to his commandments. 

AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

I hope the time will never come when a change will be made of that 
which has been in vogue, as far as the White House is concerned, for 
nearly a hundred years. No liquors of any kind are served at public 
dinners given there by the President of the United States. It has given 
me unbounded pleasure to explain to all the Presidents of the United 
States, from Theodore Roosevelt down, our attitude, our belief In the 
Word of Wisdom. On two occasions I have lived at the White House, 
I have slept there, and taken part in all the exercises that were held, 
and I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that there never was 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



117 



a morning or a night that I did not bow before my Heavenly Father in 
that place and thank him for the knowledge I had of him and his great 
work. 

VISIT WITH THEODORE ROOSEVELT 

The last time I visited Theodore Roosevelt he was a very, very sick 
man. It was some time before his death. In our conversation he ex- 
pressed the opinion that the time was near at hand when he would be 
taken to the Beyond. He said : "I have tried to live a Christian life, I 
believe in God, I have tried to wrong no man. I expect to continue my 
work beyond." He was strong enough to rise from his chair after a 
two hours' visit, and I had to leave to catch a train from New York to 
Washington. He arose with a great deal of energy, and putting his arm 
around me he said : "Reed, there are trying times coming for our country. 
I expect you to defend the rights of the people and the constitution of 
the United States as long as you live." I promised him upon that occa- 
sion that I would do my best. 

PRAYER FOR COUNTRY AND CHURCH 

I love my country. I have watched her growth, I have seen her 
mistakes, as I judge them, but I have absolute confidence that there 
shall no harm come to our nation as a nation. We will revere the 
Constitution, live by its principles, even though at times it may seem 
that we are violating them. God bless America. God bless the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. God bless the Presidency of the 
Church, and give them the revelations, O Father, of thy mind and will, 
that they may at all times direct the affairs of this Church in a way that 
thou wilt approve of all that is done. And, O Father, grant unto thy 
servants power to defend thy cause here upon this earth in a way that 
will be convincing unto the honest in heart. May we grow in numbers 
as thou seest best we should, no faster, no slower, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

May the Lord bless me that I may be helpful to you, my brethren 
and sisters. The ways of the Lord. are those of simplicity. They are 
effective because of the intelligence, wisdom, and love back of them. 
It seems to be more difficult to live the simple life and the principles of 
the Gospel than it is to live a more complex life with a religion that has 
as a part of its motivation, artificial and ornate things as well as 
numerous rites and ceremonies. The statement has been made that it is 
needful for us, in order to hold our people, to introduce, at least in a 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

small measure, some of these ornate attractions and additional cere- 
monies. 

What we need is real faith. I was encouraged in my faith because 
of President Grant's attitude regarding the questions which in his youth 
were unanswerable from an intellectual or scientific standpoint. I am 
quite certain that today we have other questions which are unanswerable 
from the viewpoint of science or learning. Our only safety, when it 
comes to the revealed laws and words of God, is to hold to that type of 
perfect faith that President Grant had as a young man. If we do not, 
and if we are not capable of developing that degree of faith, eventually 
we will lose our faith in the revelations of God. Our schools of educa- 
tion in the Church, our auxiliary associations, and even our meetings, 
should be so imbued with the spirit of the Gospel and should so interpret 
the doctrines of the Church, in accord with our standard works, that 
no student, no parent, none of us, would have cause for any criticism. 
Those who teach us from the pulpit and in our organizations or our 
schools should be men and women of whom there is no question as to 
their faith towards the revealed word of God. Correctness of doctrine 
and spirituality are our safeguards. They are absolutely necessary if 
we shall make progress and maintain our faith in the revealed principles 
of the Gospel. 

May we be blessed by the Lord that our faith shall increase; that 
we will be able to live beautifully the simple things of God, the Eternal 
Father, so that he will be pleased with us, I humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I rejoice with you in the 
spiritual feast that we have enjoyed during the last three days. 
Reference has been made to the music furnished by the various 
organizations. To me it has been inspiring. From each of the 
speakers we have received suggestions that have been highly 
beneficial. The teachings of the Master have been so beautifully 
set forth that a stranger to this Church would certainly be impressed 
with the fact that we believe in and earnestly advocate the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ as the only plan for salvation in the celestial king- 
dom. 

BELIEVING THEIR PROFESSIONS 

When we realize that those professing Christianity are often 
arrayed against their fellows selfishly and unkindly I am not 
surprised that there are many in the world who are unable to 
accept the various interpretations of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
When we see the manner in which many men and women who 
claim to be Christians are deporting themselves it has a tendency 
to destfoy the faith of those who do not differentiate between the 
effect of living and just pretending to live the Gospel of our Lord. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



119 



OUR BELIEF IS IT DEMONSTRATED BY OUR CONDUCT t 

I am assuming today that I am looking into the faces of a 
group of men and women, and the same is true of those who have 
been here the last several days, who are here because they believe 
that there is a God. We believe that he is the author of our being. 
We believe that he created this earth and placed our parents upon 
it. We believe that he sent his only begotten Son into the world 
to establish the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe that he gave 
to us the Holy Bible, known to us as the Old and New Testaments. 
We believe that he gave to us the Book of Mormon, the history 
of the ancestors of the American Indian. We believe that he 
revealed himself to the prophets of old and to the Prophet in oui 
day who organized this Church under the direction of the Redeemer 
of mankind. We believe that the Church has been guided by those 
whom the Lord has sustained as his prophets since then. I say, 
we believe that, but are we demonstrating to the world that we 
believe it? Are we willing that this Church should be judged by 
our personal conduct? Are we willing to stand in the presence of 
our Maker and say : "With the knowledge that thou gavest me, I 
have been worthy of thy truth," or are some of us in the position 
that we would be compelled to say: "Because of our selfishness and 
our sinfulness we have failed"? 

BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO HEED ADVICE 

When I think of the harm that is being done to the youth of 
this Church because men and women belonging to it, contrary to 
the advice of our President, were willing to legalize the thing that 
has been a curse to humanity from the beginning, I ask myself the 
question, "What will they say when they stand in the presence of 
the Heavenly Father of these sons and daughters who are being 
destroyed?" If the Lord were not more merciful to us than some 
of us are to our fellows, I fear that we would not enjoy the blessings 
that we enjoy. But he is long-suffering and patient, although he 
had told us plainly that he will not always be so, that he will not 
always overlook our mistakes ; but he has helped us by giving us 
counsel and advice, informing us what we ought to do. 

VIOLATING THE SABBATH 

Ten commandments were given to ancient Israel. Do we 
believe that they were given by our Heavenly Father? If we do, 
then we know that they are binding upon latter-day Israel. Let 
me read : 

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work : 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou 
shalt net do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within 
thy gates : 

For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
that in them is, and rested the seventh day ; wherefore the Lord blessed 
the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 

This very day upon which we meet here to worship, viz, the 
Sabbath, has become the play-day of this great nation — the day 
set apart by thousands to violate the commandment that God gave 
long, long ago, and I am persuaded that much of the sorrow and 
distress that is afflicting and will continue to afflict mankind is 
traceable to the fact that they have ignored his admonition to keep 
the Sabbath day holy. Where are your sons and daughters and 
mine today? If they are observing this commandment of our 
Heavenly Father then they are entitled to his blessings. If they are 
failing, then sorrow and not blessings may be theirs. I want to 
say to this body of men that it is your duty and mine, not in an 
indifferent way, but in the majesty of the priesthood of the living 
God, to set our own houses in order, to teach our sons and daughters, 
to exercise our influence in the communities in which we live as 
fully as we have ever done, and if we have failed in any particular, 
that we increase in our desire to bless mankind. 

OTHER COMMANDMENTS VIOLATED 

The Lord said further : 

Honor thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon 
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 

Do you believe that he said that? Are we honoring our fathers 
and our mothers? Is the Christian world honoring father and 
mother ? 

Thou shalt not kill. 

The roar of the artillery of a supposedly Christian nation may 
be heard in Ethiopia while we are here in worship. Human beings 
are violating that commandment, "Thou shalt not kill." 

Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

Do you believe that the Lord said that? Do you believe that 
he meant what he said? I say to you that this world is suffering 
from the very fact that they ignore that loving, kind advice, and 
there is sorrow and disaster abroad in the land because men and 
women refuse to observe the moral law and earn the blessings that 
result from obedience to the same. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



121 



Thou shalt not steal. 

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 

Are we guiltless or are we among those, who, when we stand 
in the presence of the great Judge will be humiliated when Ave 
realize that because of our avarice and deceitfulness we have 
wronged these children of his of whom he has said : "Inasmuch 
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye 
have done it unto me." 

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy 
neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, 
nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's. 

Do you believe that the Lord said that ? Do you believe that 
he meant what he said? If we only understood how near we are 
to the Judgment Day there are men and women in the various 
communities of this world who would now be on their knees in 
sack-cloth and ashes ; but they think that time is so far off that the}' 
procrastinate the day of repentance. 

Not only did the Lord reveal his will to ancient Israel but he 
has spoken to latter-day Israel and warned us against the sins and 
bad habits of the .world. Read prayerfully Section 89, Doctrine 
and Covenants. Read it all. It is called the Word of Wisdom. 

NEED FOR REPENTANCE 

Do you believe that the Lord gave to us the Word of Wisdom ? 
Do you really think that he knows what is good for us? Do you 
think it would please him if we would observe that law? He says 
it would. Do you think he meant it? There is need for repentance 
in Israel. There is need for the men and women of this Church to 
gather their loved ones around their family shrines and say to our 
Heavenly Father, If you will forgive us for our past foolishness we 
will be better in the future. We need to do that and until many 
homes are set in order the blessings of our Heavenly Father can- 
not be there. He will not be mocked. He has told us so and he has 
given to us w r hat he has given to no other people. All that the 
people of the world have that is really precious we also have, and 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in addition. Do you believe it? I 
marvel when I see how careless some of our Father's children are. 
When the world is aflame from one end to the other with jealousy 
and wickedness, I marvel that we are so . complacent and self- 
satisfied and go on day by day indifferent as to the condition of our 
fellows, almost saying by our conduct, "Are we our brother's 
keeper?" 

OBSERVANCE OF COMMANDMENTS NECESSARY 

God gave to us a wonderful blessing when he gave to us the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. He gave to you and me a marvelous privi- 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lege in that we can associate with good men and women who are 
desirous of keeping the commandments. But in return for that gift 
and that blessing he holds us responsible not only to say that we 
believe, but to live that we may be blameless before him when we 
stand there at the last day. 

You will pardon me if I have talked with intense earnestness. 
It is not because I am angry — I am hurt; my feelings are wounded 
at the indifference, the carelessness, yea blindness, of many who 
belong to this great Church, because I know what the result will be. 
The Lord himself has spoken. Now let us go to our homes and 
wherein they are not in order, let us set them in- order, get the 
Spirit of the Lord and keep it, observe the commandments of God 
that we may obtain his blessings, and let us demonstrate day by 
day by loving kindness and charity, and consideration to one an- 
other in these trying times, that we do know that God lives. 

NOT ASHAMED OF TRUTH 

I know that he lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord. I have never been 
anywhere that I have been ashamed to say that. I do not know 
why a man should be ashamed of knowing the truth because some- 
body else does not know it, especially when it pertains to the ever- 
lasting Gospel, the power of God unto salvation. Let your light 
so shine that men and women everywdiere observing your good 
works may be constrained to glorify our Father which is in heaven. 

our father's work 

Sustain the constitution of the United States. The Lord him- 
self has said that he raised up the very men who prepared it to 
the end that it might be an example to all the world. Do you 
believe it? If you do then sustain it and don't let your voice be 
among those that shall deride and break down the things that are 
so important for us. This is our Father's work. We are his 
children, heirs to all blessings. All that any man or woman ever 
enjoyed in all the wide world will be ours if we keep the com- 
mandments and we will obtain it in no other way. That we may 
be worthy of the welcome home, "Well done thou good and faithful 
servant," when our day's labor is completed, I humbly ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Presidency desires to hold a meeting tomorrow morning of all 
the general authorities, the presidencies of stakes, high councilors, 
bishops, bishop's counselors, and stake and ward clerks, and if any of the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 123 

other brethren want to come, they are welcome. The meeting will be 
held at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning in this Tabernacle. 

AUTHORITIES ABSENT 

We regret the absence of Elders John A. Widtsoe and Joseph V. 
Merrill. Brother Merrill, as you know, is presiding over the European 
Mission, and Elder Widtsoe is doing something that we hope and pray 
will have a wonderful effect upon the people of the United States. Not 
only is Brother Widtsoe engaged in this work, but ministers of other 
denominations are being permitted to teach and preach the Gospel as 
they understand it to the students of the University of Southern Cali- 
fornia. Wonderful ! May that same privilege be afforded to all univer- 
sities. I agree with Roger W. Babson that what the people of America 
need more than anything else is religion. 

PAYS TRIBUTE TO FORMER CHOIR LEADER 

I wish to echo my appreciation of the labors of Brother Anthony C. 
Lund as the leader of the Tabernacle Choir. He was a man of deep love 
of the Gospel, and his spirituality was demonstrated in his labors as our 
musical director at the Brigham Young University, and as conductor of 
the Tabernacle Choir. He was so full of jokes and humor that many 
people did not know the strong spiritual character of the man. Many 
people not of our faith have expressed to me their appreciation of the 
spirituality of the singing of our choir, and also of the spiritual messages 
by our announcer. 

I am very grateful for these beautiful flowers which have been 
provided by Brother and Sister J. P. Fugal of Pleasant Grove — I am 
very partial to Pleasant Grove, I got my wife there. 

I wish to thank our new Choir leader, Brother Spencer Cornwall, 
the organist, and the members of the Choir for the splendid music we 
have had, and I wish to thank all who have furnished the music during 
this conference. 

An anthem "Worthy the Lamb," was sung by the Choir, after which 
the Choir and congregation joined in singing "Doxology." 

Henry H. Blood, President of the North Davis Stake end Governor 
of the State of Utah, offered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The Summit Stake Choir, under the direction of Judith Anderson 
Beard, furnished the music at the Friday morning and afternoon sessions 
of the Conference ; the Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direc- 
tion of Charlotte O. Sackett, at the Saturday morning session ; the 
German Latter-day Saint Choir, under the direction of Otto Michaelis, at 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Saturday afternoon session; and the Tabernacle Choir, under the 
direction of J. Spencer Cornwall, at the Sunday sessions. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank W. Asper and Wade N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 
Clerk of the Conference.

A Few of the Books that will 
Help You to Understand 
"Mormon ism" 



The Book of Mormon

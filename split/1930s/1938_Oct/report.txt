FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the Conference convened Friday morning, 
October 7, at 10 o'clock. 

When the time arrived for the opening of the Conference the large 
Tabernacle auditorium and galleries were rilled with people who had as- 
sembled from the various Stakes and Missions of the Church. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced that the Relief 
Society Singing Mothers, Wade N. Stephens, Conductor, would furnish 
musical numbers for this session. 

The opening song, "High on the Mountain Top," was sung by the 
congregation and the Singing Mothers. 

Elder Marion G. Romney, President of the Bonneville Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

"The Lord's Prayer" (Music by B. Cecil Gates) was sung by the 
Singing Mothers. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very happy indeed to meet with the Saints again in General 
Conference. I hope and pray that the prayer which has been offered 
will be heard and answered and that the Lord will bless us during this 
session of our conference. 

SELECTIONS FROM "TREASURES I WOULD SHARE" 

I have a little book in which I have recorded from time to time for 
many years items that have very profoundly impressed me. Last Christ- 
mas I wrote a little note to friends and had it printed, and sent a very 
small part of this book of several hundred pages to over 6,000 of my 
friends — Bishops of wards and others — and I have decided to read here 
today a part of what was in my Christmas greeting. I wish that all 
that is in my greeting might be read by all of the Latter-day Saints. 
As our conference proceedings are to be published, that is my excuse for 
reading a portion of this book entitled, "Treasures I Would Share," 
which was distributed by me for Christmas of 1937. 

J. G. Holland, one of the fine poets of our country, was born in 
1819, and passed away in 1881. These are two verses from his writings : 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

GOD GIVE US MEN 

God give us men. A time like this demands 

Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands. 
God give us men. Men whom the lust of office does not kill ! 

Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy ; 
Men who possess opinions and a will; 

Men who have honor; men who will not lie; 
Men who can stand before a demagogue 

And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking. 

Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog, 

In public duty and in private thinking. 
For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds, 

Their large professions and their little deeds, 
Mingle in selfish strife — lo ! Freedom weeps ; 

Wrong rules the land and waiting Justice sleeps. 

—J. G. Holland (1819-1881). 

"Nicholas Murray Butler has figured that money spent for the 
World War could have built a $2,500.00 house, placed in it $1,000.00 
worth of furniture, put it on five acres of land worth $100.00 an acre and 
have given this to every family in the United States, Canada, Australia, 
England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, France, Belgium, Germany and 
Russia ; could have given to each city of 20,000 or over in each of these 
countries a five-million dollar library and a ten-million dollar university ; 
and could still with what was left set aside a sum at 5 per cent that 
would provide a $1,000.00 yearly salary for over 125,000 teachers and 
a like number of nurses." 

The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is 
founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner ; it is, to all those 
who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades 
and refreshing waters of a great rock in a weary and thirsty land. It is 
like a great tree under whose branches men from every clime can be 
shielded from the burning rays of the sun. — Joseph Smith. 



AGE 

Age is a quality of mind : 

If your dreams you've left behind, 

If hope is cold, 
If you no longer look ahead, 
If your ambition's fires are dead, 

Then you are old. 

But if from life you take the best, 
And if in life you keep the zest, 

If love you hold ; 
No matter how the years go by, 
No matter how the birthdays fly, 

You are not old. 

WORK A BLESSING 

Work is what keeps people young. Loafing is what starts to weaken 
them from the time they stop working. President Young was in active,

vigorous life when he passed away, but appendicitis ended his life. His 
successor, John Taylor was seventy-three years of age when he was 
made the President of the Church. John Taylor's successor, Wilford 
Woodruff, was eighty-odd years of age when he became the President 
of the Church, and according to some, he ought to have retired over 
twenty years before that time, and then been supported on somebody else's ' 
money. Lorenzo Snow came to the presidency of this Church as active 
as any young man, and with matured judgment, at eighty-five years of 
age, and when the Church was in a slough of despond financially, from 
which he rescued it. During his three years of administration, until he 
was eighty-eight years of age, his mind was as clear and active as that 
of any man who ever presided over this Church. 

Joseph F. Smith, according to many people, was two years past the 
age when he should have retired, when he became the President of this 
Church, and the same is true of me. Next month, according to some 
people, it will be twenty-two years since I should have retired and been 
supported on someone else's money. 

INCIDENT REGARDING PRESIDENT PENROSE 

There is nothing truer than that "Age is a quality of mind." When 
I was nearly fifty years of age Brother Charles W. Penrose arrived in 
Liverpool to take my place as the president of the European Mission. 
The shipping firm with whom we had done business for over fifty years 
sent us four tickets to the Shakespeare Theater. Brother Penrose had 
worked as hard that day as I had. Also a large group of missionaries 
had come with him and there were a lot of them going home, also more 
than a hundred emigrants were going to America. 

I turned to my wife when these tickets came and said : "I would 
not go to the finest theater on the face of the earth. I am tired, I am 
going to bed to sleep. Take one of the missionaries with you to bring 
you home, also two of the daughters and use these tickets." 

Brother Penrose spoke up and said: "Sister Grant, let the old man 
go to bed, I will take you to the theater." 

He was only ( ?) twenty-five years older than I. He lacked a few 
weeks of being seventy-five, and I lacked a few weeks of being fifty. 

The following morning I took him to see the fine home that Presi- 
dent Smith had authorized us to buy. Somebody asked the man who was 
moving the furniture out to guess our ages. He guessed me to be 
sixty-five, and Brother Penrose sixty. I said : "I have heard that a man 
was no older than he felt," and there is a world of truth in that, don't 
forget it. "I felt so old that I went to bed last night to sleep and this 
old gentleman twenty-five years older than I took my wife and daughters 
to the theater." 

When I was up in Scotland just a few weeks before Brother Penrose 
arrived, a good old sister asked me : "How old are you, Brother Grant?" 
I told her that if I lived so many weeks I would be fifty. 
She said: "Ah, nay, nay, never see sixty-five again." 
The next Sunday I thought I would get those three "dabs between

the eyes" corrected, so I asked the president of the Birmingham Branch, 
as I remember it, who he thought was older, Brother Penrose or myself. 

He said: "The idea of asking such a ridiculous question. Any- 
body can see that you are very much older than Brother Penrose." 

I hit the table and said : "That settles it. No old man shall ever take 
my wife to the theater again." And they never have. 

Oliver Goldsmith (The "Deserted Village") : 

111 fares the land to hastening ills a prey, 
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay : 
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade ; 
A breath can make them, as a breath has made 
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, 
When once destroyed, can never be supplied. 

A time there was, ere England's griefs began, 
When every rood of ground maintained its man, 
For him light labor spread her wholesome store, 
Just gave what life required, but gave no more : 
His best companions, innocence and health ; 
And his best riches, ignorance of wealth. 



THRIFT 

The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages for 
awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy land or tools for himself, then 
labors for himself another^ while, and at length hires another new beginner 
to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which 
opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and improve- 
ment of condition to all. — Abraham Lincoln. 

When a man like Henry Ford starts out with a few tools, and 
finally employs 125,000 people who support probably a half milliorr 
people, he ought not to be penalized because of the marvelous work he 
has done for the benefit of humanity. 

MY CREED 

To live as gently as I can ; 
To be, no matter where, a man ; 
To take what comes of good or ill, 
And cling to faith and honor still ; 
To do my best, and let that stand 
The record of my brain and hand ; 
And then, should failure come to me, 
Still work and hope for victory. 

To have no secret place wherein 
I stoop unseen to shame or sin ; 
To be the same when I'm alone 
As when my every deed is known ; 
To live undaunted, unafraid 
Of any step that I have made; 
To be without pretense or sham 
Exactly what men think I am. 

To leave some simple work behind 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



To keep my having lived in mind; 
If enmity to aught I show, 
To be an honest, generous foe; 
To play my little part, nor whine 
That greater honors are not mine. 
This I believe is all I need 
For my philosophy and creed. 



You will never get me to support a measure which I believe to be 
wrong, although by doing so I may accomplish that which I believe to 
be right. — Abraham Lincoln. 

And now there is one more lesson for us to learn, the climax of all 
the rest; namely, to make a personal application to ourselves of every- 
thing which we know. 

There is no need of your reading the Word of Wisdom unless you 
make application of it to your lives. 

Unless we master this lesson, and act on it, other lessons are virtually 
useless and thus robbed of their essential glory. The only living end or 
aim of everything we experience, of every truth we are taught, is the 
practical use we make of it for the enrichment of the soul, the attuning of 
the thoughts and actions, the exaltation of life. When we DO [and "do" 
is in capitals and ought to be underscored in addition] "what we KNOW" 
[that is also in capitals] then first does it put on vital luster and become 
divinely precious. — William Algers. 



For several years before his death, Mr. Daniel S. Ford, the pro- 
prietor, editor and builder of the Youth's Companion, because of delicate 
health, did his work and managed his mammoth business from a little 
room in his home in one of the beautiful parks of Boston. When loving 
hands cleared the plain but convenient desk, there was found in a con- 
spicuous place, much worn with frequent handling, the following poem. 
If the poet had intended to describe Mr. Ford's daily words and actions, 
he could not have done so in more appropriate language : 



The bread that bringeth strength I want to give, 
The water pure that bids the thirsty live ; 
I want to help the fainting day by day; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I want to give the oil of joy for tears, 

The faith to conquer crowding doubts and fears. 

Beauty for ashes may I give alway; 

I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I want to give to others hope and faith ; 
And into angry hearts I want to pour 
The answer soft that turneth wrath away; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 



— Edgar A. Guest. 



I SHALL NOT PASS AGAIN THIS WAY 



I want to give to others, hope and faith, 
I want to do all that the Master saith ; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



1 



<I want to live aright from day to day; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 



Not what we give, but what we share, 

For the gift without the giver is bare ; 

Who gives himself with his alms feeds three — 

Himself, his hungry neighbor and Me. 

— James Russell Lowell. (From "Vision of Sir Launfal") 

THREE LESSONS 

There are three lessons I would write, 

Three words as with a burning pen, 
In tracing of eternal light 

Upon the hearts of men. 

Have faith, though clouds environ round, 

And gladness hides her face in scorn. 
Put off the darkness from thy brow : 

No night but hath its morn. 

Have hope, where'er thy bark is driven, 

The calm distorts the tempest's mirth, 
Know this, God rules the Hosts of Heaven, 

The inhabitants of earth. 

Have love — not love alone for one, 

But man as man thy brother call, 
And scatter as the circling sun 

Thy charities on all. 

— Fredrick Schiller. 

I repeated that poem in nearly every speech that I delivered while I 
was the chairman of the Utah Liberty Loan Drive at the time that 
America raised six million dollars during the World War, in one cam- 
paign ; and I said : "The Kaiser of Germany ought to read that poem by 
one of his great poets — especially, "God rules the hosts of heaven, the 
inhabitants of earth". I felt sure that -he would go down to defeat as 
God does rule the world and He was not on the Kaiser's side. 

FAVORITE HYMNS 

Years ago I suffered intensely from insomnia. I have been ordered 
to leave town within twenty-four hours or I might go crazy for lack of 
sleep. I have been to California time and time again in early days and 
could sleep there three or four nights in succession, twelve hours at a 
time without waking up. I learned while in England to take a nap after 
my lunch. Nearly every day of my life now I sleep an hour in the middle 
of the day. I have had only two severe attacks of insomnia since I re- 
turned over thirty years ago from Europe. 

I learned to sing a song or two, or three, or four, or five, as high as 
ten when I would wake up, and then to get up and take some physical 
exercises, and take some in bed, and try to go to sleep, and failing, sit 
up and talk to a dictaphone for an hour, and then go back to sleep. This 
morning I woke up at half past one, took exercises for three-quarters of

an hour and was still wide awake. Then I sang ten songs. I have sung 
them hundreds and hundreds of times, and I never sing them when I 
do not think of what the Lord said in a revelation: 

For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart ; yea, the song of the 
righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing 
upon their heads. 

So in song I prayed ten times this morning. I think that I cannot 
deliver a more valuable sermon here today than to read these songs to 
you. 

THE TIME IS NIGH, THE HAPPY TIME 

The time is nigh, the happy time 
That great, expected, blessed day, 
When countless thousands of our race 
Shall dwell with Christ and Him obey. 

The prophecies must be fulfilled, 
Though earth and hell should dare oppose; 
The stone out of the mountain cut, 
Though unobserved, a kingdom grows. 

The blended image soon shall fall — 
Brass, silver, iron, gold and clay; 
And superstition's dreadful reign 
To light and liberty give way. 

In one sweet symphony of praise, 
The Jews and Gentiles will unite; 
And infidelity, o'ercome, 
Return again to endless night. 

From east to west, from north to south, 
The Savior's kingdom shall extend, 
And every man in every place 
Shall find a brother and a friend. 

—Parley P. Pratt. 

President Wilford Woodruff called for this song that I am now 
going to repeat, at least once a month in the meetings of the First Presi- 
dency and the Council of the Twelve held in the Temple: It was his 
favorite. 

GOD MOVES IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY 

God moves in a mysterious way, 
His wonders to perform; 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 
And rides upon the storm. 

Deep in unfathomable mines 
Of never-failing skill 
He treasures up his bright designs, 
And works his sovereign will. 

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take, 
The clouds ye so much dread 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Are big with mercy, and shall break 
In blessings on thy head. 

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 
But trust him for his grace ; 
Behind a frowning providence 
He hides a smiling face. 

His purpose will ripen fast, 
Unfolding every hour. 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 
But sweet will be the flower. 

Blind unbelief is sure to err, 
And scan his works in vain; 
God is his own interpreter, 
And he will make it plain. 

— Cowper. 

No man had more perfect faith than did Wilford Woodruff. He 
acknowledged the hand of God in everything. 

COME LET US ANEW 

Come, let us anew our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 

And never stand still till the Master appear. 

His adorable will let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve, 

By the patience of hope and the labor of love. 

Our life as a dream, our time as a stream 
Glides swiftly away, 

And the fugitive moment refuses to stay. 
The arrow is flown, the moments are gone, 
The Millennial year 

Presses on to our view, and eternity's here. 

that each in the day of his coming may say, 
"I have fought my way through, 

1 have finished the work thou didst give me to do." 
O that each from his Lord may receive the glad word : 
"Well and faithfully done; 

Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne." 

COME, COME, YE SAINTS 

Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 

Though hard to you this journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

'Tis better far for us to strive, 

Our useless cares from us to drive, 

Do this, and joy your hearts will swell — 

All is well ! All is well ! 

Why should we mourn, or think our lot is hard? 
'Tis not so ; all is right ! 

Why should we think to earn a great reward. 

If we now shun the fight? 

Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Our God will never us forsake; 
And soon we'll have this tale to tell — 
All is well ! All is well ! 

We'll find the place which God for us prepared, 
Far away in the West; 

Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid ; 

There the Saints will be blessed. 

We'll make the air with music ring, 

Shout praises to our God and King ; 

Above the rest these words we'll tell — 

All is well ! All is well ! 

And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day ! All is well ! 

We then are free from toil and sorrow too. 

With the just we shall dwell. 

But if our lives are spared again 

To see the Saints their rest obtain, 

O how we'll make this chorus swell — 

All is well! All is well! 



I was told by a doctor that one of his patients came to him and sold 
to him some securities that he owned. Then he gave his home to one of 
the members of the family, he gave other things to other members of his 
family, and then he retired on a pension for someone else to support him. 
The doctor said that during the two years that this man has been drawing 
a pension doing nothing he has aged five or six years at least, and has had 
to consult him, his doctor, time and time again, more often than he ever 
did in the same length of time before. Work — labor — is what gives 
people strength and power, and loafing aids in destroying their lives. 



SHOULD YOU FEEL INCLINED TO CENSURE 

Should you feel inclined to censure 
Faults you may in others view, 

Ask your own heart ere you venture. 
If that has not failings too. 

Let not friendly vows be broken; 

Rather strive a friend to gain ; 
Many a word in anger spoken 

Finds its passage home again. 

Do not, then, in idle pleasure, 

Trifle with another's fame, 
Guard it as a valued treasure, 

Sacred as your own good name. 

Do not form opinions blindly ; 

Hastiness to trouble tends. 
Those of whom we thought unkindly. 

Oft become our warmest friends. 



O MY FATHER 



O my Father, thou that dwellest 
In the high and glorious place ! 



When shall I regain thy presence, 
And again behold thy face? 



PRESIDENT IIEBER J. GRANT 



11 



In thy holy habitation, 

Did my spirit once reside ; 
In my first primeval childhood, 

Was I nurtured near thy side? 

For a wise and glorious purpose 

Thou hast placed me here on earth, 
And withheld the recollection 

Of my former friends and birth. 
Yet ofttimes a secret something 

Whispered, "You're a stranger here" ; 
And I felt that I had wandered 

From a more exalted sphere. 

I had learned to call thee Father, 

Through thy Spirit from on high ; 
But until the Key of Knowledge 

Was restored, I knew not why. 
In the heavens are parents single? 

No; the thought makes reason stare! 
Truth is reason, truth eternal 

Tells me I've a mother there. 

When I leave this frail existence, 

When I lay this mortal by, 
Father, Mother, may I meet you 

In your royal courts on high ? 
Then, at length, when I've completed 

All you sent me forth to do, 
With your mutual approbation, 

Let me come and dwell with you. 

— Eliza R. Snow. 

I have read only six of the ten. I see the time is flying, and I have 
perhaps read enough. One of the songs I sang this morning was "The 
Flag Without a Stain," and one of them was that lengthy song of seven 
full verses which was sung by John Taylor in Carthage Jail at the time 
the Prophet was martyred. One of them was Brother Francis M. 
Lyman's favorite hymn, "School thy feelings, O my brother, train thy 
warm impulsive soul," written by Brother Charles W. Penrose after giv- 
ing ten years of missionary service without purse or scrip. He was 
accused of taking the second-hand furniture out of the London confer- 
ence house and selling it to help him to emigrate to Utah. He had given 
them the use of this furniture for -ten years, and of course the young 
Elders from the "wild and woolley West" would not handle it very gently 
during that time. He was broken-hearted, and went home and wrote 
that wonderful song, "School Thy Feelings," for his own consolation. 

(The other songs that the President sang, but which he did not 
repeat in his address are as follows:) 

A POOR WAYFARING MAN OF GRIEF 

A poor wayfaring man of grief 

Hath often crossed me on the way, 
Who sued so humbly for relief 

That I could never answer, nay. 
I had not power to ask his name 

Whither he went or whence he came, 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

Yet there was something in his eye 

That won my love, I knew not why. 

Once, when my scanty meal was spread, 

He entered, not a word he spake, 
Just perishing for want of bread, 

I gave him all, he blessed it, brake. 

And ate, but gave me part again; 

Mine was the angel's portion then ; 
For while I fed with eager haste, 

The crust was manna to my taste. 

I spied him where a fountain burst 

Clear from the rock; his strength was gone, 

The heedless water mocked his thirst, 
He heard it, saw it hurrying on. 

I ran and raised the sufferer up; 

Thrice from the stream he drained my cup, 
Dipped and returned it running o'er; 

I drank and never thirsted more. 

'Twas night ; the floods were out ; it blew 

A winter hurricane aloof ; 
I heard his voice abroad and flew 

To bid him welcome to my roof. 

I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest, 

And laid him on my couch to rest, 
Then made the earth my bed and seemed 

In Eden's garden while I dreamed. 

Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death, 

I found him by the highway's side; 
I roused his pulse, brought back his breath, 

Revived his spirit and supplied 

Wine, oil, refreshment — He was healed ; 

I had myself a wound concealed, 
But from that hour forgot the smart, 

And peace bound up my broken heart. 

In prison I saw him next condemned 

To meet a traitor's doom at morn; 
The tide of lying tongues I stemmed, • 

And honored him 'mid shame and scorn. 

My friendship's utmost zeal to try, 

He asked if I for him would die; 
The flesh was weak, my blood ran chill, 

But the free spirit cried, "I will !" 

Then in a moment to my view, 

The stranger started from disguise; 
The tokens in his hands I knew, 

The Savior stood before mine eyes. 

He spake, and my poor name he named ; 

"Of me thou hast not been ashamed, 
These deeds shall thy memorial be, 

Fear not, thou didst them unto me." 

— Montgomery. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



YE MOUNTAINS HIGH 

O ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow 

How I've longed to thy bosom to flee. 
O Zion! dear Zion! land of the free, 

Now my own mountain home, unto thee I have come — 
All my fond hopes are centered in thee. 

Though the great and the wise, all thy beauties despise, 

To the humble and pure thou art dear ; 
Though the haughty may smile and the wicked revile, 

Yet we love thy glad tidings to hear. 
O Zion ! dear Zion ! home of the free, 

Though thou wert forced to fly to thy chambers on high, 
Yet we'll share joy and sorrow with thee. 

In thy mountain retreat, God will strengthen thy feet ; 

On the necks of thy foes thou shalt tread ; 
And their silver and gold, as the prophets foretold, 

Shall be brought to adorn thy fair head. 
O Zion, dear Zion ! home of the free, 

Soon thy towers shall shine with a splendor divine 
And eternal thy glory shall be. 

Here our voices we'll raise, and we'll sing to thy praise, 

Sacred home of the prophets of God; 
Thy deliverance is nigh, thy oppressors shall die, 

And the Gentiles shall bow 'neath thy rod. 
O Zion ! dear Zion ! land of the free, 

In thy temples we'll bend, all thy rights we'll defend 
And our home shall be ever with thee. 

— Charles W. Penrose. 



SCHOOL THY FEELINGS, O MY BROTHER 

School thy feelings, O my brother, 
Train thy warm, impulsive soul; 

Do not its emotions smother, 
But let wisdom's voice control. 

School thy feelings, there is power 

In the cool, collected mind; 
Passion shatters reason's tower, 

Makes the clearest vision blind. 

School thy feelings, condemnation 

Never pass on friend or foe, 
Though the tide of accusation 

Like a flood of truth may flow. 

Hear defense before deciding, 

And a ray of light may gleam, 
Showing thee what filth is hiding 

Underneath the shallow stream. 

Should affliction's acrid vial 

Burst o'er thy unsheltered head, 

School thy feelings to the trial, 
Half its bitterness hath fled. 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

Art thou falsely, basely slandered? 

Does the world begin to frown? 
Gauge thy wrath by wisdom's standard. 

Keep thy rising anger down. 

Rest thyself on this assurance, 

Time's a friend to innocence 
And the patient, calm endurance 

Wins respect and aids defense. 

Noblest minds have finest feelings, 
Quivering strings a breath can move, 

And the Gospel's sweet revealings 
Tune them with the key of love. 

Hearts so sensitively moulded 

Strongly fortified should be, 
Trained to firmness and enfolded 

In a calm tranquility. 

Wound not wilfully another; 

Conquer haste with reason's might; 
School thy feelings, sister, brother, 

Train them in the path of right. 

— Charles W. Penrose. 



THE FLAG WITHOUT A STAIN 



For years and years I've waved o'er my people, 

O'er land and sea, o'er church tower and steeple; 
Foremost in battle proudly I reign, 

Triumphant now o'er thee, without one stain. 
O, how I trembled when called alone to stand, 

But brave hearts sustained me to wave o'er the land. 
O, my America! O my America! 

Proudly I wave o'er thee, Sweet land of Liberty. 

No flag on earth shall insult this nation, 
Justice and right shall e'er be our relation. 

No creed or sect shall here ever reign. 
While floats the Stars and Stripes, without one stain. 

Stars that were blotted are shining once again, 
The Angel of Peace has wiped out the stain. 

THE WORD OF THE LORD 

In addition to singing these songs this morning I repeated from the 
121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, commencing with the words 
"How long can rolling waters remain impure," to the end of the section: 

33. How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall 
stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to 
stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as 
to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven 
upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints. 

34. Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why 
are they not chosen? 

35. Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this 
world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one 
lesson — 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



15 



36. That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with 
the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled 
nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

37. That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we 
undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, 
or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the 
children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens 
withdraw themselves, the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is 
withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man. 

38. Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against 
the pricks, to persecute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

39. We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and dis- 
position of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they 
suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

40. Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

41. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness, and by love unfeigned ; 

42. By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the 
soul without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

43. Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward 
him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy ; 

44. That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the 
cords of death. 

45. Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and 
to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly ; 
then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the 
doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from 
heaven. 

46. The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy 
scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy domin- 
ion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it 
shall flow unto thee forever and ever. 

This is one of the most marvelous revelations that God has given to 
man, and it was given to the Prophet while he was imprisoned in Liberty 
Jail. 

THANKFUL FOR KNOWLEDGE 

How I do thank the Lord that I have an abiding and absolute knowl- 
edge that He lives, that He is my Father, that He hears and answers my 
prayers ! How I do thank the Lord — it is beyond my ability to express 
my gratitude — for a knowledge that His Son is my Redeemer and yours ; 
that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ visited the boy Joseph 
Smith, and that Moroni delivered into his hands the plates from which 
the Book of Mormon was translated ! I thank the Lord that when I read 
the Book of Mormon there came into my soul a testimony that it is 
exactly what it purports to be. I fell in love with Nephi, and more than 
any other character, except my Redeemer, in the Bible or the Book of 
Mormon he has been my guiding star. 

IDLENESS CONDEMNED 

We should have an ambition, we should have a desire to work to the 
full extent of our ability. Work is pleasing to the Lord. "The idler shall 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

be had in remembrance before the Lord." I reached my office this 
morning at 8 :30 o'clock, and generally get there at 8 o'clock. As a rule 
I do not leave the office before 5 :30 or 6 :00, and at noon I go next door 
to the Lion House Cafeteria, where I get a quick lunch. Once in a great 
while, when I have not been able to sleep as well as usual, I have brought 
to my office as many as eight cylinders of letters. Working eight or nine 
hours a day has never injured me, and I do not believe it has ever injured 
anyone else. The Lord says : "Men should be anxiously engaged in a 
good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass 
much righteousness." 

May the Lord bless us in this conference. I leave with you my 
abiding testimony that I know as I know that I live that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the true and the living God, the instrument in the hands 
of God of establishing again upon the earth the plan of life and salvation 
— the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

May God help you, my dear brethren and sisters, every one of you 
who has the same knowledge which I have, to live the Gospel, to do that 
which is right, and then we are sure of the reward of life eternal in His 
presence. This is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of our 
Redeemer and Savior. Amen.

22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Behind the powerful and faith-promoting testimony of our beloved 
President, Heber J. Grant, is a power more than man's. 

PEACE A BLESSING 

Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of 
God. 

When the Son of Man was betrayed, Peter drew his sword and 
struck the servant of the High Priest. But Jesus said: "Put up again 
thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with 
the sword." 

This was an ominous and prophetic declaration concerning the 
Jewish and the Roman states. These nations lifted up their swords 
against Jesus Christ and both nations perished by the sword. The man 
who takes the sword of animosity and hate with evil intent to injure his 
neighbor and besmirch his character shall himself fall a sacrifice to the 
weapons he has used. For they who sow the wind shall reap the whirl- 
wind. 

THE STORY OF NINEVEH'S REPENTANCE 

By command of the Lord, Jonah went to the great city of Nineveh. 
He walked up and down a whole day, crying out, "In forty days Nineveh 
shall be destroyed." Humbled by God's awful message the Ninevites 
appointed a public fast.. They were on the verge of destruction. They 
had almost filled up the measure of their guilt, and they were ripe for 
judgment. The people from the meanest to the greatest followed the 
example of their king and covered themselves with sackcloth. 

God was moved with compassion by the depth and sincerity of their 
repentance; therefore he did not execute the sentence he had pronounced 
upon them. I think it was Victor Hugo who, speaking of the Deity, 
said : "Of all thy names, Compassion is the most beautiful." 

God spared that city of one hundred and twenty thousand inhabi- 
tants. But this displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry. 
He was vexed that his prediction was not going to be fulfilled. He ap- 
peared to care little whether innocent children and defenseless women 
would fall victims in that great judgment. But the Lord stayed the exe- 
cution of that sentence. He said to Jonah : 

And should I not spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than 
six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand 
and their left hand; and also much cattle?" 

Even the dumb beasts are objects of his compassion. 

There was a reason in this stay of execution — if I may be permitted 
to use that phrase. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



23 



To men and likewise to nations the promises and threatenings of 
God are always conditional. In the wisdom and goodness of God good 
behavior, sorrowful repentance and conversion can stay the approach of 
judgment, or at least secure a respite. People are given time by the 
Almighty to return to him through repentance. There is forgiveness 
with Him. Thus the Lord turns aside his judgments for a while at 
least. Nineveh's people were rescued. They were granted an extension 
of time. Judgments are conditional. The people themselves are re- 
sponsible for the calamities that befall them, but when they repent and 
turn unto the Lord, he hears their prayers. 

RESPITE THROUGH PRAYER 

A few days ago the world beheld a majestic spectacle. Millions of 
people entreated the Lord in humble prayer ; they knelt in cottages and 
palaces, in mines and on farms, in workshops and in churches and pleaded 
with the Almighty to avert what seemed to be a certain terrible war. The 
people appealed from earthly rulers to the Lord Jesus Christ, and their 
appeal was heard and granted. A putting off was secured. God 
grant that the nations may lengthen out by righteousness that respite 
unto an endless state and come unto Him, the Prince of Peace. 

PROPHETIC WORDS 

In that historic dream, the dream of the ages, which God gave to 
Nebuchadnezzar, a dream divinely given and divinely interpreted, the 
Lord showed unto that great statesman, that mighty king, "what shall 
be in the latter days." He revealed unto him the kingdoms that would 
exist in our day. There were a few words spoken by Daniel when he 
interpreted that dream which makes it clear that kings and rulers should 
rise, but no king or ruler should ever establish a universal empire in 
Europe. These are the words — referring to the nations — "They shall' 
not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay." They are 
the words of God. 

Hosea said: "And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of 
Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved." 

JOSEPH smith's statesmanlike word 

It is part of a prophet's work not only to foretell and warn of 
impending conflicts and calamities, but also to show the means of escape. 
Joseph Smith was a prophet-statesman. He predicted the war which 
would terminate in the death and the misery of many souls; but this 
great prophet had a peace offering to give to the people. He told them 
of ways and means to avoid war. Unlike Jonah, he had rather have 
his prediction, mighty and certain as it was, lie dormant if the people 
would turn unto God. 

In 1844 the Prophet Joseph Smith gave the following counsel with 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

respect to a coming event which was soon to cast its black shadow over the 
land, and which was of great and general concern. "Pray Congress to 
pay every man a reasonable price for his slaves out of the surplus rev- 
enue arising from the sale of public lands, and from deduction of pay 
from the members of Congress, break off the shackles from the poor 
black man, and hire him to labor like other human beings, for an hour 
of virtuous liberty on earth is worth a whole eternity of bondage." The 
Prophet continued, "The southern people are hospitable and noble. They 
will help to rid so free a country of every vestige of slavery whenever 
they are assured of an equivalent for their property." And, by the way, 
in the same declaration the Prophet Joseph makes the recommendation, 
which is applicable to nations and states today, that more economy be 
practiced in the national and state governments. 

The scholarly Josiah Quincy writing about the message Joseph Smith 
delivered to the nation, says : 

It may be worthwhile to remark that Smith's plan was publicly ad- 
vocated eleven years later, by one who has mixed so much practical shrewd- 
ness with his lofty philosophy. In 1885, when men's minds had been moved 
to their depths on the question of slavery, Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson de- 
clared that it should be met in accordance with the interest of the South and 
with the settled conscience of the North. It is not really a great task, a great 
fight for this country to accomplish, to buy that property of the planter, as 
the British Nation bought the West Indian slaves. . . . We, who can look 
back upon the terrible cost of the fratricidal war which put an end to slav- 
ery, now say that such a solution of the difficulty would have been worthy 
a Christian statesman. But if the retired scholar was in advance of his time 
when he advocated this disposition of the public property in 1855, what 
shall I say of the political and religious leader who had committed himself, 
in print, as well as in conversation, to the same course in 1844? If the 
atmosphere of men's opinions was stirred by such a proposition when war 
clouds were discernible in the sky, was it not a statesmanlike word eleven 
years earlier, when the heavens looked tranquil and beneficent? (Figures 
of the Past, by Josiah Quincy, p. 335.) 

Lincoln's plan to end war 

Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, probably knew Joseph 
Smith very well. During a political campaign he wrote a letter in which 
"he gives a long list of names to which he wants documents to be sent," 
and in the same letter he tells a candidate "that Joseph Smith is an ad- 
mirer of his, and that a few documents had better be mailed to the Mor- 
mon people." Abraham Lincoln was familiar with the prophetic mes- 
sage that Joseph Smith delivered and the means of escape that the 
Prophet opened up to the nation to save the people from the dreadful 
calamity which bathed the land in the blood of human beings. 

Just two months before the war closed the famous Hampton Roads 
Conference was held. Lincoln appealed to Alexander Stephens, Vice 
President of the Southern Confederacy. "Stephens," said he, "Let me 
write the word 'Union' at the top of this page, and you may put under 
it what you please, for," continued President Lincoln, "there are men 
in the North, the mention of whose names would surprise you, who are 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 25 



in favor of paying for the slaves. I, too," he said, "am in favor of giv- 
ing the southerners a fair equivalent for the loss of their property." 

When he returned to Washington, Lincoln wrote, in his own hand, 
the joint resolution to be presented to Congress, providing an appropria- 
tion of $400,000,000 to be paid to the owners of the slaves if war should 
cease immediately. He laid this proposition before his cabinet, but it 
was unanimously disapproved. The great and lonely Lincoln, the best 
friend the South had, turned away sadly. "I see," he said, "you are all 
against me. The war is costing us $3,000,000 a day, and think of the 
lives being lost." (Abraham Lincoln, a History, by John G. Nicolay and 
John Hay, Volume 10, Chapter 7, pages 132-139.) 

Oh, if the words of Joseph Smith, the prophet-statesman, had been 
heeded, what an effusion of blood would have been prevented ! Those 
young men buried in soldiers' graves would have walked the earth in the 
full vigor of youth and splendid manhood if the nation had accepted 
the means of escape which Joseph Smith pointed out to them. Among 
the noblest words that General Grant ever uttered were these: "Let us 
have peace." 

In faith we'll rely on the arm of Jehovah 

To guide through these last days of trouble and gloom, 

And after the scourges and harvest are over, 

We'll rise with the just when the Savior doth come. 

Then all that was promised the Saints will be given, 

And they will be crowned as the angels of heaven, 

And earth will appear as the garden of Eden, 
And Jesus will say to all Israel, Come home. 

May Christ come quickly. In the words of John the Revelator, 
"Even so, blessed Lord Jesus, come quickly." Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Six months ago I was deprived of the opportunity of being here 
with you. I had been called, with President Rufus K. Hardy of the 
First Council of Seventy, to visit the missions in the South Seas and to 
divide with our brothers and sisters down there, and with those who are 
not members of the Church, some of the glorious truths that our Heavenly 
Father has given to us. 

OUR EARLY HYMN BOOKS 

This morning when we were singing the hymn "High On the 
Mountain Top" I turned to the flyleaf of the hymn book as it was first 
published and found this introduction : 

The saints in this country have been very desirous for a hymn book 
adapted to their faith and worship, that they might sing the truth with

an understanding heart, and express their praise, joy and gratitude in 
songs adapted to the New and Everlasting Covenant. 

In accordance with their wishes, we have selected the following 
volume, which we hope will prove acceptable until a greater variety can 
be added. 

With sentiments of high consideration and esteem, we subscribe our- 
selves your brethren in the New and Everlasting Covenant. 

Manchester, England. 1840. Brigham Young, 

Parley P. Pratt, 
John Taylor. 

This was in the first edition of the hymn book. The next'page con- 
tains the following : 

PREFACE TO THE FOURTEENTH EDITION. 

The demand for the hymn book has been so general that it has been 
concluded to issue another edition, making the fourteenth which has been 
published. 

This edition is the first published in Utah Territory, and possesses 
one distinctive peculiarity — it is not only printed and bound at the Church 
Printing Office, but the type in which it appears has been manufactured 
here. This issue differs from the two which precede it in one respect only, 
there have been fourteen hymns added to the collection; they, however, 
are placed in the last part of the book, so as not to interfere with the use 
of the other editions in common with this. 

That this little work may accomplish the object for which it is 
designed, and prove a source of joy and consolation to the saints, is the 
earnest prayer of 

Your brother, 

Salt Lake City. George Q. Cannon. 

Utah Territory, March 21, 1871. 

A PROPHETIC HYMN 

I now call your attention to the prophetic statement contained in 
this hymn : 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled, 
Ye nations now look up, 

It waves to all the world 
In Deseret's sweet, peaceful land — 
On Zion's mount behold it stand! 

For God remembers still 

His promise made of old, 
That he on Zion's hill 

Truth's standard would unfold ; 
Her light should there attract the gaze 
Of all the world in latter days. 

His house shall there be reared, 

His glory to display; 
And people shall be heard 

In distant lands to say, 
We'll now go up and serve the Lord, 
Obey his truth, and learn his word; 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

For there we shall be taught 

The law that will go forth, 
With truth and wisdom fraught, 

To govern all the earth ; 
Forever there his ways we'll tread, 
And save ourselves with all our dead. 

Then hail to Deseret, 

A refuge for the good, 
And safety for the great 

If they but understood 
That God with plagues will shake the world 
'Till all its thrones shall down be hurled. 

In Deseret doth truth 

Rear up its royal head; 
Though nations may oppose, 

Still wider it shall spread ; 
Yes, truth and justice, love and grace, 
In Deseret find ample place. 

How interesting that a hymn published in so early a day should be 
sung by us today with a realization of the fulfilment of the promises con- 
tained therein! 

MISSIONARY WORK IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS 

In the South Seas we have had missionaries of this Church for 
many years. The first were sent by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Elders 
Noah Rogers and Benjamin Grouard went to the Tahitian Islands. Hun- 
dreds of missionaries have followed and preached in the other South Pa- 
cific Island groups since that time. They have continued to proclaim the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ until today more than thirty thousand members 
of the Church are found among the natives of the South Seas, in ad- 
dition to those who are of European extraction. 

The Gospel has been taught to those people down there and the Book 
of Mormon has been published in most of the languages of the Polynesian 
race. It has not yet been translated into Tongan, yet in Tonga there are 
approximately thirty thousand of the finest people to be found in the 
world, members of the Polynesian race. 

I have heard the hymns of Zion sung in Hawaii, in Tonga, in New 
Zealand, in Australia, in Tasmania, and in both British and American 
Samoa. They were sung with the same spirit that they have been sung 
here, and it was most satisfying to know that this wonderful Tabernacle 
Choir -and the great organ, by means of radio, contribute to the joy of 
worship down there. Thousands of people living south of the equator 
who do not belong to the Church listen in and enjoy the programs that 
go out from this tabernacle. The first choir of Singing Mothers that 
sang here was heard over the radio down there. The idea was adopted 
and we now have choirs of Singing Mothers among the natives of the 
South Seas. 

Not only does the spoken word touch the hearts of the children of 
men, but our Heavenly Father, knowing the importance of appropriate 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

singing in worship, called Emma Smith and appointed her to select the 
hymns that were published in the first hymn book of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. They have been added to from time to time, 
until today the songs of Zion are sung in many lands, and the words of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ have been interpreted in many lands, not only 
by the spoken word, but by the hymns that are sung from the hearts of 
those who accept the Gospel of our Lord. 

We do not amount to very much in point of numbers when compared 
with the multitude of our Father's children but we are intended to be the 
leaven in the religious world. As I looked into the faces of those good 
people in the South Seas I was moved in my soul to thank the Lord that 
his servants were sent down there, not only to teach them the Gospel by 
preaching it, but that this Church was wise enough to establish schools 
to train its youth, for out of those schools have come some of the best 
trained and most efficient men and women that are to be found in the 
islands where the Polynesian people live. 

AMONG THE MAORIS 

I wish I could satisfactorily describe some of the fine groups that 
we met down there. One was the Maori race. Brother Hardy went for 
the fourth time to visit them but they were deprived of a part of the joy 
that they had anticipated because he became ill just prior to the great 
Hui Tau, where more than three thousand members of the Church assem- 
bled at the lovely Pa of the Princess Te Puea Herangi, situated on the 
shore of the beautiful Waikato river, that flows through her property. 
We held a conference lasting three days there and everybody had a de- 
lightful experience and a real uplift. 

Brother Hardy was only able to attend part of the last meeting of 
that great celebration. If you could have seen the people weeping when 
he came into the meeting and when he talked to them and bore his testi- 
mony, you would have realized how fortunate one is who goes from this 
part of the world to minister among that humble happy people who have 
in their veins the blood of Israel, and you would better appreciate how 
their hearts are moved with affection for those who have served them 
as Brother Hardy and many of our brothers and sisters have. They 
are delighted to have Matthew Cowley back again after seventeen years. 

PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN AUSTRALIA 

Australia was tremendously large and interesting. It is a great field 
for missionary activity and we could use every Elder that we have in all 
the mission fields on the earth in that island continent. A wonderful 
race of Anglo-Saxon people dwells there. Ninety-two per cent of all 
the people are of British extraction, the race that has sent to us not only 
from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales some of the most capable 
men and women that the Church has enlisted in its ranks, but from 
Australia have come to us those who have performed splendid service 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



29 



for mankind. The man who created this wonderful tabernacle organ 
came from Australia. He was an organ builder and knew the inspira- 
tional value of organ music. In the city of Sydney, Australia, there 
still stands the old organ after which I think this organ here may have 
been patterned. 

We received a warm welcome from the Lord Mayor, recently 
elected, when we visited the town hall in Sydney. He knew about our 
organ and choir. They listen in when there is a great broadcast. Not 
all the broadcasts reach them, I am sorry to say. There are seasons 
of the year when they cannot hear, but at other times they enjoy listening 
to the great choir and organ and the announcements that are made by 
Brother Richard L. Evans and others. Those people are becoming 
friendly to the membership of this Church because of the singing of our 
brothers and sisters and the glorious sacred music that goes out from here. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is not only taught by the written word 
and by the spoken word, but I say to you and I say to the Tabernacle 
Choir, that we all so much admire, that their part is one of the most im- 
portant in allaying prejudice and disseminating the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and giving people a desire to hear what a church has to say that 
sings as these our brethren and sisters sing. 

ILLNESS OF BROTHER HARDY 

Our missionary work is wonderful. We found your sons and your 
daughters in the various islands of the South Seas and we are proud of 
them, as you must be. Brother Hardy was unable to go to Tonga to do 
any missionary work. He was seriously ill. He held on just as long 
as he could in New Zealand but finally had to go to the hospital. The 
Lord was good to him and he gained sufficient . strength to continue 
working and return home. After we had visited Australia, Tasmania 
and New Zealand, spending two months there, I went to Tonga for a 
month accompanied by a native — Elder Alex Wishart. Brother Hardy 
later joined us at Nukualofa, Tonga, and we together spent a month in 
Samoa. 

I regret that our beloved Brother Hardy is not able to be with us 
today due to an illness that overtook him some three weeks ago, but we 
have promise that in a few days he will be out again. I hope that his 
strength will be renewed unto him, because there are thousands of people 
in the world who love him and who love his wife for their devotion to 
the Maori race and to mankind generally. 

FRIENDLINESS MANIFESTED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 

It may be of interest for you to know that down in those South Seas 
the government officials in many places speak of the work of this Church 
with commendation. In Australia complimentary reference was made to 
our Church by two men who hold the positions of Lord Mayors. They 
were friendly; they had been here in Salt Lake City and had seen what 
had been accomplished. 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

At Wellington Brother Hardy and I went to see the men who have 
charge of the Government program for the Maori race in New Zealand. 
The Judge and a Commissioner of the native court told us "We believe 
you have accomplished with the Maoris what the other people have not. 
We want to try out a new program for the betterment of the Maori race. 
We would like to cooperate with one of your groups at Korongata in 
testing our plan. We would rather experiment with them because we 
believe that they can succeed and if we can do it with your people there, 
then we are willing to try some of the others." 

Korongata — near Hastings — was where our Agricultural College 
was located that was wrecked by the earthquake many years ago that de- 
stroyed the cities of Napier and Hastings. The school had to be aband- 
oned because the building was so damaged that it was not usable. But 
the effect of the school on that little community had been such that they 
were selected from among all the Maori groups in New Zealand as out- 
standing to try out the program of improving their opportunities for 
education and by developing their farms, etc. 

When the Government officials learned that we were planning to 
replace our old chapel with a new one they said : "If you want to build 
a chapel among those people and will work with us, we will furnish you 
the men to build the chapel if you will supply the material." Not mem- 
bers of the Church these men saw the benefits that came into the lives 
of our people because they kept the commandments of the Lord. They 
said : "Your people do not drink ; they do not smoke ; they are not care- 
less morally as are some of the other natives of this country." I hope 
you will remember that, my brethren and sisters — "Your people do not 
smoke; your people do not drink" — and I want to say to you that real 
Latter-day Saints neither smoke nor drink nor profane. We may make 
a pretense of worthiness but we are not Latter-day Saints when we vio- 
late the commandments of our Heavenly Father in that particular. He 
said that the Word of Wisdom is "adapted to the weak and the weakest 
of all saints who are or can be called Saints." So He Himself has in- 
dicated that we should not be called Latter-day Saints unless we observe 
that law. 

We found the people down there clothed in their native costumes, 
the "Lava Lava" in the Samoan Islands, and the "Vala" in the Tongan 
Islands. 

NATIVE CLOTHING 

Both men and women were simply but modestly attired at our con- , 
ference at Pesega, Apia, Samoa, where we celebrated the 50th anniversary 
of the arrival of our missionaries on those islands. There was an audi- 
ence of over twelve hundred native members of the Church, not one of 
them dressed in European cloth but attired in native material. Two 
hundred of the sisters of the Relief Society wore cream colored dresses 
of tapa cloth that they themselves had made from the bark of trees. 
First they stripped the bark and reduced it to pulp, using a large log for 



Elder george albert smith 31 



a table. Then they pounded the pulp with a club, something like a rolling 
pin until they flattened it out like paper and made it of such a texture 
that they could fashion clothing from it. Those women were really 
dressed in garments of their own make and design. Each wore a purple 
and white Ula around their necks, this decoration also made by them- 
selves. The dresses were generally one piece, nicely fitted like an Ameri- 
can dressmaker might have made them. Most of the people had fine 
physiques and were modest and dignified in bearing — hair and eyes 
black, skin brown, teeth pearly white, all bareheaded and barefooted. 
They came in a group to greet us along with two thousand other people 
when we landed in Apia. It was an impressive welcome. They are a 
credit to the Relief Society of this Church. They are faithful and de- 
voted to their society and are seeking to keep the commandments of the 
Lord. If our Relief Society sisters at home are as faithful as those na- 
tive women I know that the Lord is pleased with them. 

MEN OF WISDOM AND ABILITY 

It was a joy to find among that dark-skinned people men and women 
who bore their testimony with power and with wisdom. One of the 
finest interpreters I have ever seen in my life was Fitsemann Malietoa, 
a Samoan Elder, who weighed three hundred and fifty-four pounds, was 
four feet eleven inches tall in his bare feet. He stood beside us and 
interpreted the messages of Brother Hardy and myself and others who 
spoke in English with a power and a dignity that was inspiring and 
made me feel more than grateful that such people identify themselves 
with the Church. Our interpreter is also the interpreter for the Governor 
of the Nation in the native court. 

Governor and Mrs. A. C. Turnbull attended the first conference 
meeting of the celebration where more than a thousand people sat on 
the floor on mats with their limbs curled up under them for two hours, 
yet at the end of that time they did not indicate that they were weary. 
First one group and then another from the various branches of the 
Church sang hymns, and the harmony and volume delighted everybody. 
The Governor said: "This is wonderful. Where do these people all 
come from ?" I think he had never seen anything like it, yet he had been 
Governor there for many years. 

FOR THE BLESSING OF MANKIND 

The work of the Lord goes forward in the South Pacific. The 
Polynesian people are all the children of our Heavenly Father. It is 
your privilege and mine to divide with them the Gospel of our Lord, and 
to carry the message of life and salvation to them not only for their 
benefit but to earn our own exaltation. 

We will attain our exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom only on the 
condition that we divide with our Father's other children the blessings 
of the Gospel of our Lord and observe the commandments that will en- 
rich our lives here and hereafter. 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

I am grateful to be back with you again. I have never been more 
kindly treated or more courteously received as a servant of the Lord in 
any part of the wide world than I was down there in the South Seas 
among those fine descendants of Father Lehi. 

I pray that we will be loyal to the President of this Church and his 
associates and to our Heavenly Father. It is just such a group as this 
that will leaven the lump, and radiate such an influence among the children 
of men that they will be compelled to listen. With our sweet singers and 
our eloquent preachers and with our desire to bless mankind the time is 
not far distant when people everywhere will join in singing praises to 
the man who communed with Jehovah, — he who gave to us the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, by direction of our Heavenly Father, in this latter day. 

I bear you my testimony that I know this is God's work ; I know 
that Jesus is the Christ ; I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the 
Lord ; I know that the authority of the Priesthood is with this Church 
and knowing it I bear witness of it unto you in humility and in the name 
of Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We were very grateful for the splendid attendance at the Elijah 
oratorio last night. I was greatly disappointed at the attendance the night 
before. When I thought of the thousands and tens of thousands of hours 
that our good brethren and sisters of the choir have devoted without 
financial reward, I was humiliated with the first night's attendance. These 
tabernacle choir and organ broadcasts are the greatest advertisement for 
Utah that could possibly be given, and the Choir gives its services free. 
Every time the Choir gives a concert here we should come and support 
it, and if we would buy some additional tickets and give them away it 
would be a good thing. 

URGES CARE BE EXERCISED ON STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 

I would like to warn each and all of you to be careful. To the 
utter disgrace of Utah we lead the whole nation in automobile 
accidents. It is a shame, we should be the most careful and the 
most considerate people. I hope that we will be very careful in 
crossing the streets. I have been traveling time and time again at 
twenty-five miles an hour, when that was the speed limit, and have 
had people pass me like I was hitched to a post. 



The Singing Mothers sang the anthem, "O Bread of Life." 
Elder H. Fred Egan, President of the South Summit Stake offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference convened promptly at two 
o'clock p. m., with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The musical exercises for this session of the Conference were 
furnished by the Woodruff Stake Choir, under the direction of Elder 
John Nielson. The Choir sang as an opening number "The Song of 
the Redeemed." 

Elder Spencer Kimball, President of the Mt. Graham Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The Choir sang "In Our Redeemer's Name (Stephens). 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I feel that I would like to bear my testimony 
to this congregation of Latter-day Saints. It seems to me that it is our 
duty, if we have a testimony of the Gospel, to bear that testimony, not 
only occasionally, but frequently, and if we fail to do this we are "hiding 
our light under a bushel." 

A testimony of the Gospel is very precious. There are millions of 
people, children of God, on this planet that have no such testimony, and 
that perhaps have never heard a testimony such as we have, and such as 
many of our children have received. 

JOSEPH AND HYEUM SMITH 

I have been laboring fifty years in the ministry. I did not know the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, but I am acquainted with 
the stupendous work that they accomplished under divine help, and to 
me that is a testimony of the truth of the Gospel, because I do not 
think it is humanly possible for any individual to accomplish the work 
that Joseph Smith, the Prophet, accomplished without divine help, and 
I feel as if I know the Prophet and his brother Hyrum about as well 
as if I had lived in Nauvoo at the time of their martyrdom. 

BRIGHAM YOUNG A PROPHET 

I was acquainted with President Brigham Young. I rode with him 
by invitation on a trip through Southern Utah and felt that it was a 
great distinction to ride with the prophet of God. I was deeply im- 
pressed with the importance of myself on that occasion. 

He was a great man ; he was a leader of men ; he was a pioneer, but 
above all he was a prophet of God, a servant of the Almighty, and I am 
happy to say that I knew him fairly well, and knew of his work and of 
his life, and that is a testimony to me. 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 



First D*f 



FIVE OTHER GREAT LEADERS 

I was acquainted with President John Taylor who is designated 
as a champion of the truth. He was a valiant man, an able president, 
a man of great firmness of purpose, and who exerted an influence for 
good throughout the Church and throughout the world. 

President Woodruff won great distinction in the mission field. He 
was certainly an energetic man and a successful missionary. He found 
the field white and ready for harvest, and brought many, many souls 
into the Church, both in the east and in the west, as also in Great Britain. 
He was a humble man, but that rather added distinction to his great- 
ness. I always admired President Woodruff. His life was a testimony 
to me. 

President Lorenzo Snow, under the inspiration of the Almighty, 
brought the Church out of financial difficulties and stress. He was a 
cultured man ; he was a wise counselor, a great leader and prophet. To 
me his life and labors are a testimony of the truth of the Gospel. 

We are all acquainted with the life of President Joseph F. Smith, 
a man of great strength of character, a man who stood firm and steadfast 
to the truth. He advocated powerfully the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Though dead he lives in his testimony and his writings. He was much 
beloved of the Latter-day Saints, and I loved him. 

And now we come to our living prophet and leader, President Heber 
J. Grant. You are as familiar with his life and testimony as I am. He 
is a very active man and has already accomplished a great work. 

EXPERIENCES IN THE MINISTRY 

In my ministry during the past thirty-nine years I have traveled 
601,000 miles preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and bearing testi- 
mony of its restoration to earth. I speak of this modestly because my 
experience is simply the experience of the Twelve. They are all just 
as active, perhaps more so, than I have been. They may not have noted 
it down, but it is so recorded in their behalf. 

Now, you see, my brethren and sisters, by my experience, that the 
Twelve are a traveling high council. They are so designated in a reve- 
lation given to Joseph Smith, the Prophet. They are constantly upon 
the road, so to speak, and are contacting presidents of stakes and coun- 
selors, high councilors, bishoprics of wards and other prominent officials 
in the various Stakes of Zion and throughout the United States, Canada 
and Mexico. They are contacting to some extent the missions on the 
isles of the sea, and also have contacted to a greater extent the European 
missions. That is our life's job, that is the responsibility that is upon 
us. In addition to all this we have many home duties and many meetings 
at headquarters. Well, I pause to say we have time to eat a little and 
sleep a little and then we are on the go again. 

My experience among the members of the Church and the officials 
in the Stakes of Zion has been very happy and my testimony of the 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



35 



Gospel has been strengthened by having made these contacts and by 
observing the good works and faith of the Latter-day Saints. 

TESTIMONY OF THE HOLY GHOST 

Now, brethren and sisters, the greatest testimony that has come 
to me in all my life time is the testimony of the Holy Ghost, the gift I 
received at the time of my baptism. That will be an unfailing testi- 
mony as long as I am faithful in magnifying my calling and in keeping 
the commandments of God. I will have that testimony in my very soul, 
and it is my solemn duty to bear it before the saints of God and before 
the people of the world. 

There may be some young people among us who haven't got the 
testimony that I speak of. They may say, "I do not know the Gospel 
is true, but I believe it is true." That is a good testimony. It is a fine 
thing if they believe it. There are hundreds and thousands and millions 
of people who do not believe it. So if our children believe it is true we 
surely should be thankful for that, and if they will hold on to their 
belief and cultivate the Spirit of the Lord in their hearts the testimony 
will come later. With some young people in the Church and perhaps 
with some older ones too, they know the Gospel is true, but they do not 
know that they know it. They have not yet made the discovery, but 
they feel it in their hearts. They are almost afraid to testify to that 
effect, but let them cling to their belief and be faithful, and the Lord 
will give them a testimony. 

Now, I would like to say in conclusion, that what I am and what 
I may have accomplished in the world is what the Gospel has done for 
me, and what you are and what you have accomplished the Gospel has 
done for you. What is the Gospel of Jesus Christ ? It is the power of 
God unto salvation, and if we persist in that testimony and magnify 
that power in our callings it will be our salvation. Much more might 
be said upon this subject of salvation. To obtain salvation in the pres- 
ence of God is the very aim of our life in mortality. By that I mean 
we shall triumph over all our enemies and put them under our feet and 
reign with the Lord Jesus Christ. That is an end much to be desired ; 
that is a consummation that can be accomplished and will be accom- 
plished by the Latter-day Saints. 

CONTACT WITH THE ADVERSARY 

The Lord bless you. I might add a word or two respecting my 
testimony which has been greatly strengthened by some personal experi- 
ences. I have contacted the enemy, I have met the adversary under 
peculiar circumstances. I realize that he is a very shrewd fellow. He 
is seeking our destruction. I have met him when he was operating 
through the spirit of mobocracy, and have been placed in some rather 
uncertain and dangerous situations. I was, however, preserved and 
delivered from the power of the evil one, and I attribute this to the 
mercy of God. I have come to the conclusion that, in life or in death, 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 7 First Dag 

I must cleave to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved, 
and I'm sure that is the conclusion of every faithful Latter-day Saint. 
"What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and in the end 
lose his own immortal soul ?" 

So the Gospel should be everything to us. It is most precious 
indeed. I humbly pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will con- 
tinue to bless me and qualify me for the work that he wishes me to do, 
and I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will rest upon each one, 
that you will strive to do His will, that in the end you may have this 
precious gift of salvation, because, as the Lord says, "there is no greater 
gift" 

May the Lord bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters : It is my privilege in standing before 
you to present a very old doctrine and one that has come down through 
the ages, but one that has not been very well observed and is not being 
observed today. To fortify my position I am going to present my 
authority. 

THE COMMAND TO REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY 

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 
Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. 

But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man- 
servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is with- 
in thy gates : 

For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that 
in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the 
Sabbath day, and hallowed it. 

That is the law, a law that was pronounced by Moses, but it is much 
older, it was in existence from the beginning of the earth. 

THE LAND TO OBSERVE THE SABBATH 

Again, the Sabbath for the land was to be observed as well as for 
man, and also for the beasts. You will find that recorded in the 25th 
chapter of Leviticus. 

Again, failure to observe this law would bring suffering, the people 
would be scattered, and the land would then observe its Sabbath. You 
will find that in Leviticus 26th chapter. 

The Lord says : And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will 
draw out a sword after you; and your land shall be desolate, and your 
cities waste. 

Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 37 



and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy 
her sabbaths. 

As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest : because it did not rest in your 
sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. (Leviticus 26.) 

Thus saith the Lord, keep ye judgment, and do justice; for my salva- 
tion is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. 

Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold 
on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand 
from doing any evil. (Isaiah, 56:1-2.) 

If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure 
on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honor- 
able; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine 
own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words : 

Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord ; and I will cause thee to 
ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of 
Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. (Isaiah, 
58:13-14.) 

Thus saith the Lord : take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden 
on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ; 

Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, 
neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded 
your fathers. 

But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck 
stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 

* * * * 

But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not 
to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath 
day; than will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the 
palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. (Jeremiah, 17:21-27.) 

Thus saith the Lord God : In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up 
mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known 
unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, 
saying, I am the Lord your God ; 

In that day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth 
of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with 
milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands ; 

Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of 
his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I am the Lord 
your God. 

But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me ; they 
did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did 
they forsake the idols of Egypt ; then I said, I will pour out my fury upon 
them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of 
Egypt. 

But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted 
before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself 
known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt. 

Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and 
brought them into the wilderness. 

And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which 
if a man do, he shall even live in them. 

Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sisn between me and 
them, that they may know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. (Ezekiel, 
20:5-12.) 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 7 



First Da- 



I have a good many more passages of scripture here, but I am not 
going to take time to read more from the Bible, for this will suffice. 

THE COUNSEL OF LATTER-DAY LEADERS 

On the 25th day of July, 1847, the day after the pioneers entered 
this valley, it being the Sabbath day a meeting was held, President 
Brigham Young spoke to the assembly as follows: 

He told the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that they 
would lose five times as much as they would gain by it. None were to hunt 
on that day ; and there should not any man dwell among us who would not 
observe these rules. They might go and dwell where they pleased, but 
should not dwell with us. 

The same day President Heber C. Kimball, first counselor in the 
Presidency said : 

I advise you to keep the sabbath day holy, whether others do or not. 
If you wish to go hunting or to see the country, seek a week day for that 
purpose. Do not let us get giddy and light-minded, as the Nephites did of 
old, but strive to work righteousness in the beginning. 

And on other occasions these brethren spoke on this subject. Again 
from President Brigham Young, this time at a conference of the Church, 
April 7, 1850: 

There is not the first man who has gained by laboring on the sabbath 
day; necessity does not drive a man to do it, no such thing, but it is their 
own dispositions, and the spirit that is in them. There is no more necessity 
to go to the canyons or to hunt your cattle on the sabbath day, you might 
as well plow. But some feel that they cannot spare the time on a week 
day. We have tried it in traveling since we left Nauvoo, and not one time 
having traveled on that day have we gained by it, but we have lost a day 
or two the next week to pay for it. What is the harm? It proves that we 
treat lightly the rules of the God of Nature — the God we serve. The God 
that organized the elements knows that we can endure. He said to man, 
When you have labored six days, rest one. To refresh your bodies ; let 
your horses and cattle rest ; your men and women, let them rest * * * Now 
you gain nothing by transforming the ordinances of nature to your own 
desires. Let them all rest, and when the earth has brought forth six years 
let it rest the seventh. You will not make anything by transgressing any 
rule of the God of nature. 

Much has been said by the brethren in the day in which we live. I 
have a quotation here from President Joseph F. Smith that I want to 
read to you, mainly because it has never been put in print. I copied it 
from a letter that he wrote to one of his daughters who was out in the 
mission field : 

All things should be done with prudence and in moderation — [and then 
he quotes from the book of Exodus, and comments, as follows] : This is 
the command. It is binding upon all. There are sound religious reasons 
for it and physiological reasons not less sound. Indeed it is a physiological 
as well as a divine law. Those who heed it will reap the reward of obedi- 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



39 



ence to divine law, and enjoy the benefits of the physical law. It is not less 
needful to the human being than sleep — although not so speedily felt. No 
one can live without sleep, neither can anyone survive long without rest. 
The result of sleep is no more potential to prologation of life than the 
sabbath rest, although we may survive longer without the latter than the 
former, speaking from a physical point of view. From a spiritual point 
of view the wilful violation of the law of sabbath rest is as deadly to 
moral growth and faith, as is the sleepless eye to the mortal being. But 
the great point is, God has said it ! and not for his own but for man's well 
being; he therefore should obey. If he does not he will have to abide the 
consequences both temporal and spiritual to himself. 

Again : 

For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, 
and to pay thy devotions unto the most high. (Doctrine and Covenants 
59:10.) 

We learn to do by doing. Never can we learn to do by not doing. 
One who closely shuts his eyes, is more blind than those who are blind 
indeed. The things of God are discovered by the Spirit of God, not by 
the spirit of man or of the world. Those who seek shall find, and to 
those who knock at the door it shall be opened, and those who ask shall 
receive, and not otherwise. He that has the spirit discerns by the spirit 
and loves the works of the spirit, for they give delight and joy. Who 
gives himself to good works finds beauty and reward in them ; and he 
who sows to the wind will reap the whirlwind. Not now, perhaps, for that 
which we sow must first take root, then spring forth and leaf and then 
bear fruit. The fruit will be after the kind of it sown seed. We learn 
a principle by coming in close contact with and studying it, and admitting 
it into our minds and hearts. There is no house that was not built, no 
tree that did not grow, no knowledge that was not or is not acquired. But 
truth is eternal — it was not created or made, it is as a precious gem. It 
lies hidden from us and we must find it, and apply it, and make it ours. 

To those who love human pleasures and pursue them, the duties of 
life, the essential parts of life, are irksome, dry, pleasureless, seemingly 
valueless. But their pleasures will fade away, and their joys will perish 
and leave them but the ashes of their treasure, with hopeless regrets. 
"Honor the sabbath day and keep it holy," and you will know more about it. 

This letter was written May 10, 1897. 

At the October General Conference in 1912, President Smith said : 

"Thou shalt honor the sabbath day and keep it holy." Do we do it? 
Is it necessary to do it? It is absolutely necessary to do so in order 
that we may be in harmony with God's law and commandments, and 
whenever we transgress that law or that commandment we are guilty 
of transgressing the law of God. And what will be the result if we 
continue? Our children will follow in our footsteps, they will dishonor 
the command of God to keep one day holy in seven, and will lose the 
spirit of obedience to the laws of God and his requirements, just as the 
father will lose it if he continues to violate the commandments. 

PRESENT DAY CUSTOMS DECRIED 

Now, I am going to be bold enough to say something. In the Mon- 
day newspaper I found this : 

The fifty-eighth annual exhibit of the Utah State Fair association — 
popularly known as the state fair — proved a magnet Sunday to draw 
thousands of visitors and home folks to the exposition grounds. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Dan 



Apparently anxious to get a close-up of the production picture pre- 
sented in the thousands of exhibits displayed in the score of fair depart- 
ments, men, women, and children kept the turnstiles clicking from early 
morning until late at night. The stream of visitors from 3 p. m. to early 
evening indicated a close-to-record Sunday crowd. 

That was the Sabbath day. Judges of horses, cattle, sheep and swine 
predicted that it would require additional days in which to pick the 
winners, and so on. 

In that same issue the same day another report said : 

Stunt and exhibition flying, accompanied by educational explanations, 
Sunday, graphically demonstrated progress in air transportation to a 
crowd of 10,000 assembled at Salt Lake City's municipal airport. 

The program, including a talk by Governor Henry H. Blood, marked 
the opening day ceremonies locally of National Air Travel week and 
set in motion a daily round of events calling attention to speed and safety 
of plane travel. 

Particularly attracting attention of the huge crowd were the antics 
of three United Air Lines army birdmen, who put their ships through 
rolls, loops, and dives and brought gasps from watchers. 

Now, this is not the only evil ; there are many others, but time will 
not permit me to speak of them. Brethren and sisters, where are we 
going? I think it is a disgrace to the State of Utah, the home of the 
Latter-day Saints, the home of Brigham Young, who gave the counsel 
the day after we came into this valley that we should observe the Sab- 
bath day, and now today the authorities in State and city and village 
everywhere throw the doors open for the violation of the word of God. 
How many of us were guilty of being there ? We have got to repent and 
turn from this evil lest the same troubles come upon us that came upon 
old Israel, as I have read them to you. 

Time will not permit me to say more. May the Lord bless the 
Latter-day Saints, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



I am pleased, my brethren and sisters, to stand before you this 
afternoon in the semi-annual conference, and to add my testimony to 
those to which you have already listened. 

I want to tell you that I miss some familiar faces, especially the face 
of President J. Golden Kimball whom we had with us so long. We were 
told this morning that he had passed away. We shall miss him in our 
Council for a long, long time, I am sure, because his counsel was wise 
and good, and we had learned to love him. We wish also to welcome 
a new member into our quorum whom you voted this morning to support. 
I assure him that he will have our love and confidence and that we expect 
to be able to work together in peace and harmony in the furtherance of 
the work of God. 

I am glad that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



Of the First Council of the Seventy 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



41 



Latter-day Saints. I am glad that this Church was established by our 
Lord and Master. We are told in the third Article of Faith: 

We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be 
saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

Some of our mission presidents, in reporting their Missions in the 
temple the other day, said that in their districts there are some people who 
refuse to take their literature and read it because they say they are already 
saved, and they have no more to do. They are sure that they are saved 
and will be glorified in the presence of God. I suppose that gives them 
some comfort, but really I am rather glad that I do not have that assur- 
ance. I think it would be rather a bad influence in my life if I could sit 
supinely by and feel that I am saved. 

I remember one time that on a trip my wife and I made between 
San Francisco and Honolulu a certain minister in conducting Sunday 
services on the boat told us how sorry he felt for his friends when he got 
back from divinity school to realize that they were not saved, and how 
glad he was that he was saved. 

Now the atonement of Christ has done a wonderful thing for us 
because it has opened the door to salvation. Through that atonement a 
certain debt and obligation was paid and the door was opened, Christ 
himself being the first man to go through, and giving us all the privilege 
of following. Now, the door is not a widely opened door, in a certain 
sense, and in another sense it is wide open, because every man and 
woman of us should be able to pass through that door, and then if we 
do certain things and live in a certain way we shall be able to go on far 
past that door to an exaltation in the presence of God. 

Salvation has more than one meaning to me. It is general in the 
sense that all of us will be raised from the dead and be judged by our 
Heavenly Father. Exaltation means more than that; it means that if 
we live as we should, in harmony with the teachings of the Gospel, we 
shall not only be resurrected, but we shall be resurrected to the privilege 
of exaltation in the presence of God. 

The other day I had occasion to look into this third Article of Faith 
just a little, and was very much interested in what I found. In the first 
place I find that the word "atonement" which is the crucial word in that 
Article, only occurs once in the New Testament, that while the life of 
Jesus Christ was devoted to that especial purpose, those who labored 
with him did not quite understand it in its fullest meaning, at any rate 
they did not talk a great deal about it, or if they did the translators of the 
Bible did not see fit to translate his remarks into the word "atonement." 
That word, however, occurs many times in the Old Testament. I found 
it in forty-seven different places where it was translated into Spanish. 
I have found also, of the places where it occurs in the Old Testament, 
twenty-three had been translated into Spanish by the word "reconcilia- 
tion"; twenty-two by the word "expiation"; one by the words "to 
cleanse" ; and one "to appease." 

Now they have a very interesting significance to me, that while God 
did expiate the sin of Adam, and gave us access to the presence of God, 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

there is a sense of reconciliation in that ; he opened up the way for us to 
reconcile our lives to Him and to his service. I like that word reconcilia- 
tion very much because that depends very much upon us and the things 
we do. 

I find that in the New Testament the men who testified of Jesus 
Christ and his mission did use the word "reconciliation" a good many 
times, and some of the very finest of the references there to the life of 
Christ are to the effect that he did reconcile us to God, he gave us that 
wonderful opportunity. I wonder, then, if the atonement of Jesus 
Christ does not depend for its efficacy very largely upon our own actions, 
our own lives. 

I remember one time in the Mexican Mission that a certain very 
excellent brother who pretended to some rather intimate and inside 
knowledge of the workings of the Church because he had been baptized 
here in Salt Lake City and had lived some time under the droppings 
of the sanctuary, insisted that we are saved by the grace of God, and 
that alone. I had occasion to look into the scriptures and search out a 
few instances where they insist that we are judged according to our 
works, and I found three or four long pages of closely type-written quo- 
tations, which I submitted to him, all stating that man is to be judged 
according to his works. 

Now, if we insist on limiting salvation to the word resurrection, 
then we must all admit that by the grace of God we are saved, and it is 
also true that it was a very gracious act on the part of Jesus Christ to 
give us the privilege of working out through good deeds an exaltation 
in the presence of God. And if we limit it to those two senses, then by 
the grace of Jesus Christ alone, we are saved; but I have never felt 
like limiting it to that significance alone. I feel that salvation moves 
over into the realm of exaltation, and that before a man is completely 
saved he must be exalted in the presence of God, and to be exalted his 
deeds must justify that exaltation. 

Then, brethren and sisters, am I not justified in assuming that the 
atonement of Christ for its efficacy depends somewhat at least upon us 
here, and that we are able through good deeds to make that full and 
complete, or through bad deeds to make it fail in its ultimate purpose. 
I believe it, and that is the testimony that I would like to leave with you 
this afternoon, that what we realize out of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
depends upon us very largely, and that if we insist on saying that we 
do not gain salvation for ourselves we must grant that our exaltation does 
depend very largely upon our acts. We cannot expect to attain the 
highest glory if we go through this life in petty bickerings, in jealousy, 
and selfish acts. Love is the genius of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
love and jealousy are hardly bedfellows. We must, before we can love 
our neighbors, take them into our confidence, eradicate from our souls 
the jealousy that we may feel towards them. If we are jealous of our 
neighbor and of his success, how can we fully love him, and vice versa ? 
If we love our neighbor as we should how can we be jealous of his 
success, and if we love him we will not be too jealous of our own pre- 



ELDER CARL F. EYRING 



43 



rogatives, and our own relationship with him. We will be willing to 
grant to that friend and that neighbor a part of the privilege that is ours, 
if by doing so we can benefit him and bless him and carry him on to 
a more perfect state of service. 

That to me is the greatest principle in the Gospel — the love of one 
for another. The love that Jesus Christ had for us impelled him to come 
to earth to go through the trials and the troubles of mortality, to lay 
down his life, and walk through the door of the resurrection into eternal 
life, holding ajar for us that door, that if we love him and if we keep his 
commandments we may follow through after him into eternal life and 
exaltation in the presence of God. And that this may be our happy lot, 
is the prayer I ask for all of us, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 



The Choir sang an anthem, "Grant Us Peace" (Stephens). 

ELDER CARL F. EYRING 

President of the New England Mission 

My beloved brethren and sisters : Once more I am back to General 
Conference as a mission president. Once more I feel the grandeur of 
your presence. Our congregations in the mission field are small, and 
to come here where crowds throng into this spacious building makes me 
feel that I have truly come from the outer fringe to the very center of 
Mormonism. 

More than you may realize, we of the missions look to you for our 
standards and patterns. As we come home we find you zealous for the 
cause of righteousness. We find you struggling with your might against 
forces which debase the young and old. We find the various organiza- 
tions within the Church alert to their duties and responsibilities. We 
rejoice that your religious life is so dynamic and real. 

But we are interested in the stakes of Zion not only because we 
belong to the same great organization, but because these stakes are the 
nurseries in which our missionaries are reared. You furnish us mis- 
sionaries who have been reared in true Latter-day Saint homes, who 
have been active in all the classes in the Sunday School from the cradle 
roll to the missionary training department, who have moved steadily 
through the Primary and Mutual organizations from the beginners in 
Primary to the M Men and Gleaner Girls in the Mutual Improvement 
Associations ; who, through their mothers, have had a real contact with 
the Relief Societies ; who have faithfully attended sacrament meetings ; 
who have studied in Seminaries, Institutes and Church schools ; who 
have had teaching experiences in Sunday Schools, Primaries, and Mutual 
Improvement Associations, and finally you send us missionaries who 
have a love of humanity in their hearts, and a real desire to give of their 
talents in service. When you do this, you send trained missionaries, 
missionaries with the type of training most needed in the mission field.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Friday. October 7 First Dtg 

To your training we add the laboratory for missionary service and addi- 
tional help in the Mission Home and the mission field. But we cannot 
do our best without the years of background which you furnish — you 
the parents, you the ward and stake officers. 

As parents and officers in the Church do we fully sense the power 
of our system of religious education, the unique religious environment 
in which our children may grow up? Many students, the world over, 
recognize the uniqueness and strength of this phase of our Church. Let 
us truly appreciate the value of our ward and stake units as instruments 
for religious training. 

The restored Gospel is more than a set of theological doctrines, 
printed with patches of lifeless printer's ink in some gilt-edged book. 
The Gospel becomes enlivened only when its principles operate in human 
living, and then not completely animated till these principles operate in 
the life of a community. Too often we forget the community aspect of 
religion, and overlook the difficulty of putting dynamics into the restored 
Gospel without the Mormon community life. Mission presidents soon 
sense the difference between wards in the stakes and tiny branches in 
the missions. The difference is not one of doctrine, nor lack of faith- 
fulness in the living of the principles of the Gospel, but the Mormon 
community life is absent, the religious education program of a completely 
organized stake is missing. 

In the early days of the Church we gathered the converts to Zion, 
and here we built the world-famous Mormon community. With forty 
per cent of the membership of the New England Mission scattered as 
isolated families, we sense the need of a Church-wide gathering suitable 
for this day, a sort of nucleation which centers throughout the world. 

In Section 29 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "And ye 
are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect 
hear my voice and harden not their hearts; wherefore the decree has 
gone forth from the Father and they shall be gathered into one place 
on the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and be prepared in all 
things against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth 
upon the wicked." 

I am pleased to report that your sons and daughters, the mission- 
aries of the New England Mission, are safe and well. With very few 
exceptions the members of our Church passed through the hurricane 
and floods of New England without loss. For all this we are indeed 
grateful to our Father in Heaven, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER FRANK EVANS 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

I am much pleased to be here again after another very busy six 
months period — and it has been indeed a busy period. I know that every 
mission president can testify to that, so far as his work is concerned. So 
could all others who are engaged in promulgating this Gospel, for there 



ELDER FRANK EVANS

is such need in this day for what the Church has to offer that those who 
are carrying the responsibility of this message find plenty to do. How- 
ever, an observation of George Klingle reminds us that, 

God broke our years to hours and days, 
That hour by hour and day by day, 
Just going on a little way, 
We might be able all along to keep quite strong. 

Should all the weight of life 
Be laid across our shoulders, and the future rife 
With woe and struggle, meet us face to face 
At just one place, 
We could not go ; 
Our feet would stop; and so 
God lays a little on us every day, 
And never, I believe, on all the way 

Will burdens bear so deep 
Or pathways lie so threatening and so steep 
But we can go, if by God's power 
We only bear the burden of the hour. 

We have had in our mission some very interesting experiences of 
late, some of which I would wish might be known by the strong and vali- 
ant men who have gone before us. We are endeavoring to teach the same 
things they taught even a century ago, (for our mission is more than a 
hundred years old) but their teachings are being differently received to- 
day. Truths that our predecessors offered were rejected and ridiculed, 
and for their offerings they were persecuted. The same truths are today 
being received with favor. That is not to say that more converts are 
being made, for not all are interested as yet in the spiritual phase of our 
message, but they are interested in us and in the fruits of our doctrines. 
Principles do not change. We shall continue to teach these century-old 
doctrines. Our health standards are the same as those given to the world 
when the Word of Wisdom first came forth. The Book of Mormon has 
not changed. In the early days it was accepted on faith. Today it is read 
and praised even by those not of the Faith. Often times this praise comes 
from the distinguished and the learned. A short time ago a man who is 
well known throughout this nation and abroad, speaking not from our 
standpoint but addressing himself to the subject, "Books of the 19th 
Century," said in part that, 

Of all the religious books of the nineteenth century it seems probable 
that the Book of Mormon was the most powerful. 

The Doctrine and Covenants is the same as of old. Our interpreta- 
tions of the Bible, I imagine, are the same as those learned and taught by 
our grandfathers in the School of the Prophets. We are taught the same 
principles of thrift as of old, that thrift is not mercenary, that although 
it has to do with material things, it has a moral and even a spiritual aspect. 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Day 

We have always been taught this doctrine which involves prudent giving 
and judicious spending as well as intelligent saving. It is the wise ap- 
plication of resources, whether they be energy or talents, or material 
means ; it is the antithesis of waste. We have always been taught that it 
is evil to commit waste. 

Our social standards are very much the same as when the Articles of 
Faith were first published to the world, and we are practicing those prin- 
ciples which are expressed in that remarkable Thirteenth Article of Faith. 
Only a short time ago a man whose opinion carries much weight in his 
own community (in the city of New York) said to me: "I have been con- 
tacting your Elders for many, many years," and he turned to his card 
index and pointed out the names of many whom he had seen and talked 
with, particularly upon business matters, and said : "In all those inter- 
views I have not heard one word, nor have I seen a single act that was 
not in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and good morals." 
And what interested me more was his statement that "There is some- 
thing behind it all." 

"Yes," I said, "there is something behind it. Men do not gather 
grapes of thorns nor figs of thistles. A good tree bringeth forth good 
fruit, it cannot bring forth evil fruit. An institution which has made 
history may be approached by the investigator to determine upon its 
validity from two sources, first, by an examination of its fundamental 
principles. That is the approach that our fathers had to make. It is the 
spiritual approach, if you please. It is the approach which requires faith. 
We may all be thankful that they made that approach. If they had not, 
there would have been no Church history. The other approach is to ex- 
amine into its achievements, to determine what it has done. Many peo- 
ple are doing that today. As to how many of them go farther than that 
remains to be seen." But this we do know, that the Church is being ac- 
cepted as never before. We have seen the period of birth, of youth and 
of maturity. We have seen the period of resistance and persecution. I 
sometimes wonder if we are not now approaching a period which may 
sometime be known as a period of expansion. 

We are thankful that some, even though they may be humble, even 
though they may be unlearned, some still have the faith to appreciate the 
first principles, to approach this great body of truth from the first view- 
point, that of faith in its divine origin. You know when the disciples 
said to Thomas, "We have seen the Lord," he wanted a physical demon- 
stration of the fact, he would not believe it, and he said, "Except I shall 
see in his hands the prints of the nails and put my finger into the print of 
the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe." He was 
making his approach from the second standpoint. Later, when the Lord 
appeared again and said, "Thomas, reach hither thy finger and behold 
my hands, and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not 
faithless, but believing," Thomas answered, "My Lord and my God." 
Then Jesus said unto him, "Thomas, because thou hast seen me thou hast 
believed, blessed are they who have not seen yet have believed." 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS

My brethren and sisters, I believe we feel the responsibility of the 
message which we are endeavoring to carry to the world. I appreciate 
those of your sons and daughters who are in my care for a time. I praise 
them for their sincerity, for their energy, for their obedience, and I bring 
this message to you, that they are doing well and that we are making 
progress. 

I pray that we may be able to uphold the high standard of those vali- 
ant men who have gone before us, who never compromised, and who 
knew no surrender or defeat. This I do, in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, in standing before you 
today. I am grateful for my membership in this Church ; I am grateful 
for the opportunities of service which I have enjoyed. I am grateful 
for a testimony, and that there never comes into my mind the shadow of 
a doubt as to the divinity of this work, and that the Spirit of God is 
directing its destiny. 

A MARVELOUS WORK 

When this work was first instituted the Lord had in mind the 
achievement of great things. The prophets had seen and foretold them 
many, many years before, and when the Prophet Joseph was called in 
his youth, the Lord made a great assignment unto him, and he was told : 
"Now, behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men." On the first visitation of the Angel Moroni to the 
Prophet Joseph he quoted many passages of scripture, among others 
the eleventh chapter of Isaiah where Isaiah said : "And he shall set up 
an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and 
gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the 
earth." And Joseph was told that this day was at hand. 

Two years after the Church was organized in a revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph, the Lord said : 

For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness ; her borders must 
be enlarged ; her stakes must be strengthened ; yea, verily I say unto you, 
Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments. 

THE POWER OF GOD MANIFEST 

The Lord, as I have said, had a great work to accomplish, and he pro- 
ceeded to set up an organization to accomplish that work, and it has been 
my experience and my observation, because I have been privileged to 
work in all the organizations of the Church, in the mission field, and in 
the wards and stakes of Zion, that those who are on the inside and know 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 7 First Dag 

what is actually being accomplished know that the power of God is in the 
organization and direction of this Church. 

This morning we voted to sustain the Presidency, the Quorum of the 
Twelve and the acting Presiding Patriarch as prophets, seers and revela- 
tors, and I want to bear testimony to you today that they are that, so far 
as my faith is concerned. The evidence of divinity in this work is in the 
accomplishments of the Church, that which is being done by the organiza- 
tions the Lord has set in the Church to bring about the things which he 
had in mind, and when we analyze this inspired organization it would not 
be consistent to attribute to mortal man that which has been brought forth 
for the achievement of these things. 

When we think of the general organization — the General Authori- 
ties, the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Seventies, the 
Presiding Bishopric — when we think of all the auxiliary boards, and fol- 
low the same organization through in the stakes with the stake presi- 
dencies and high councils, a similar organization, and then into the 
wards, with the bishoprics and their helps in government, the auxiliary 
organizations, and then when we think of the work that is being accomp- 
lished by these organizations, we must admit that the power of God is in 
it. It is not an uncommon thing for people who come into our midst to 
tell us that our Sunday Schools are superior, that our Relief Society ex- 
cels other such organizations. It is not an uncommon thing for people 
to comment on the work of our Young Men's and Young Women's Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations and recognize in their achievements, the 
leadership of youth, the like of which cannot be found elsewhere in the 
world. 

A CHURCH FOR THE YOUTH 

A short time before I left Los Angeles a prominent minister of that 
city, in delivering a radio address, said : "What we need today is a church 
for the youth of the land. We have been preaching to the old folks and 
letting the children go to the devil. That is why our churches are empty 
today" (and, incidentally, there are some twenty thousand empty 
churches in the United States today.) 

I could not help but thank God that we have a church that has a pro- 
gram for the youth of the land. We entertained in our beautiful taber- 
nacle in Los Angeles, the Deseret Club from the U. C. L. A., and Mr. 
Evans, the man who was in charge of all the religious clubs on the cam- 
pus was there, and while some several hundred couples were engaged in 
the dance he turned to me and said: "Mr. Richards, I wish the other 
churches of Los Angeles could see what I can see here tonight." 

Then following these auxiliary organizations we have the great or- 
ganization of the Priesthood quorums, and I shall not take time to name 
them, but from the time a boy is twelve years of age right through until 
men are laid away in the grave they share with God divine authority, the 
right to officiate in his name, the right to speak for him, the right to direct 
as officers in the Church. 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 



49 



I was greatly impressed by a statement made by one of my boys when 
he was twelve years of age. He came to me one day and said : "Daddy, 
I have more authority than the President of the United States, haven't 
I?" 

I said : "You surely have. The President of the United States re- 
ceives his authority from the people, and when his term of office ends his 
authority is gone, but the authority you have is from God, and if you live 
properly you will enjoy it forever and ever." 

OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL 

What a glorious thing when one understands the great organization 
of this Church, to know that instead of a community of a thousand peo- 
ple in which one man is selected to do all of God's work, every boy and 
every man who is willing to bear responsibility is given the opportunity 
if he will only live for it. 

I have come to believe that only those who bear the burdens of the 
Church, those who labor in the Church, know how to appreciate it, and 
know of its worth and its value. 

ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGH GOSPEL'S RESTORATION 

Then we have other great achievements that have come to us from 
the restoration of the Gospel — the Book of Mormon, to which Brother 
Evans has referred ; the Word of Wisdom ; the law of tithing ; the law of 
Fast offerings. Nowhere in all the world can you go and find an institu- 
tion so marvelously sustained as this Church in financial and other ways. 

I attended a service in Atlanta, Georgia, where a minister of the 
Gospel was attempting to introduce the law of tithing, and after the 
service I was introduced to him by a member of his congregation, and I 
said to him : "I would like to bear testimony to you that you are on the 
right road, but instead of asking your people to pay tithing for ten months, 
why don't you ask them to pay their entire lifetime ?" 

He said : "Oh, Mr. Richards, we cannot go that far yet." And he 
probably could not in a man-made institution. But when you are in an 
organization that has been fashioned by God the" Eternal Father, there is 
life, there is power in it, just like there is life in the human body. 

POWER OF REVELATION CONTINUES 

Some among us today say that there is no more revelation in the 
Church, that all revelations came in the beginning. It may be true that 
the major revelations that were to be written to be a guide to this people 
and to this Church came in the days of the Prophet Joseph. If you go 
into the orchard and plant a tree, the planting of the tree may be more 
demonstrative than gathering the fruit, but as long as that tree remains 
alive it yields its harvest, year after year, without replanting. When 
God organized this great Church and put his power in it, the power of the 
Holy Priesthood and the power of the Holy Ghost by which we might 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 7 First Dag 

know the truth of all things and by which he makes manifest unto his 
servants all things, things which were, things which are, and things which 
are to come, it was not necessary that he should continue to reveal himself 
from heaven. The program had been revealed and a living organization 
established for its accomplishment. 

I want to bear testimony to you today that the power of revelation 
is with this Church, that these men whom we voted this morning to sus- 
tain as prophets, seers and revelators, are prophets, seers and revelators. 
If there is one thing I know as well as I know that I live, it is that God, 
the eternal Father, has sustained me and blessed me with power of leader- 
ship far beyond my ability, in the positions of presidency I have held in 
this Church. I know it so well that I would not assume to undertake the 
responsibilities that are mine at present if I did not know that the spirit 
of revelation and inspiration and divine guidance were in this Church. 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WELFARE PROGRAM 

I have only mentioned a few of the things that the Church has ac- 
complished. Since our appointment as the Presiding Bishopric six 
months ago yesterday, we have had the privilege of meeting the executive 
officers of eighty of the stakes of Zion. We have met in a regional capa- 
city and in these meetings we have had the executive officers, the presi- 
dents of stakes, their counselors, the high councils, the bishoprics of 
wards, and the men upon whom the responsibility of the leadership of 
this Church rests, and we have felt impressed by their power. In a few 
instances we have felt that there was a lack of understanding, we have 
felt that some of our leaders were on the outside and had not a full grasp 
of the importance of their work. These meetings have been held par- 
ticularly in the interest of our Welfare Program, and I want to bear 
testimony to you today that it is my conviction that this Welfare move- 
ment that has been introduced by the leaders of this Church is one of the 
great undertakings of the Church, and the further we get into it and the 
clearer our vision becomes the more important we will realize this to be. 
It will do more than feed the hungry and clothe the naked. It is bring- 
ing together in a common cause the hearts of men and women so that 
should the time come that shall be darker than we have yet known they 
will know how to stand shoulder to shoulder. We have heard some fine 
reports, we have seen some fine work being done. We learned in one 
place that in a ward of 200 people 65 of them turned out one day to thin 
a beet patch. In another place so many turned out that they were through 
before the day was over, and turned to weeding the streets of the city. 
We learned in our last meeting at Idaho Falls that in one stake each 
quorum of the Priesthood consisting of eleven quorums of Elders, four 
quorums of Seventies, one High Priests quorum, and the High Council 
and Stake Presidency — each had a work project for the welfare of this 
new movement, and the thing about it that impressed us was the type of 
men who are turning out to work shoulder to shoulder in the field. Repre- 
senting the Stake Presidency and the High Council, were the mayor of 



ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 



51 



the city, the city land appraiser, the editor of the Journal, the president 
of a college, a seminary teacher, a probate judge, a college professor, 
chairman of the county commissioners, two high school teachers, two city 
councilmen, a rural mail carrier and the State water master. Now, can 
you imagine what it is doing for that type of men when they are out in 
the field together as a quorum, bearing the Priesthood of God, and labor- 
ing together for their less fortunate brethren and sisters ? 

EFFECT ON CHURCH MISSIONARY SYSTEM 

No doubt one of the great benefits of this movement will be the effect 
it will have on the missionary system of the Church. I was in the mis- 
sion field when the "March of Time" was shown and I know some- 
thing of the value that it will be to our missionaries. I said to the mis- 
sionaries in the South that I was convinced that in the not far distant 
future we would cease to ring door bells and ask the privilege of deliver- 
ing our message, but we would go to the doors to answer the calls that 
would come in to know more about our people. Incidentally, in closing 
may I add, that of all the great achievements of this Church that are far 
beyond the wisdom and the power and the ability of mortal man, that 
would indicate that the Spirit of God is in this work, is the great mission- 
ary system of the Church. 

I pray God to bless us, and to enable us to use the means that are 
ours, to press on to the end, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

Through the kindness of our great-hearted and benevolent Presi- 
dent, many of the mission presidents are permitted to come to General 
Conference, to bring their problems here, to discuss ways and means of 
promoting the missionary work, and of course to be inspired to a renewed 
dedication to the great task which is theirs. 

You will pardon me if I make some reference to missionary work. 
Before I left for a mission I talked with a man in this city of reputed 
wisdom, who argued that if the Church continued to maintain its mis- 
sionary system it would become impoverished, broken down, and driven 
into bondage. The answer I made to him then was in broad terms some- 
thing like this: If this Church or any other organization can, by some 
process, translate money into character and manhood and build faith in 
the hearts of people, and establish in their minds the great ideals that go 
with a settled faith in God, they have done something that will per- 
petuate them in the earth. 

I asked a man today how many years he and his family had given 
to the missionary work — and he is not an old man. He said: "Forty 
years, and members of my family have labored in sixteen different mis- 
sions." If the men who are before me were to compute the years they 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 7 Firtt Day 

have given to missionary service, and the money it has cost them, it would 
in the aggregate amount to something colossal. I am safe in saying that 
no other people of like number have ever made a contribution of this 
kind to the world. I do not believe the people who have done it are 
distinguished for their poverty. I do not believe the men and the women 
who have contributed to the great missionary cause walk as inferiors 
among their neighbors. 

It may seem as if the cost per baptized convert is great, and it is. 
But the missionary service has contributed to the Church much more 
than numerical strength. It has added numbers. There are people sit- 
ting in front of me who owe a debt of undying gratitude to some humble 
missionary who visited their homes or the homes of their parents, per- 
haps in a far-off land, and brought the Gospel to them. 

I should like for a moment to refer to one other phase of this work : 
What does it mean to the missionary ? Much in many ways. He very 
soon discovers that it is impossible for him to answer the demands of 
his mission unaided and unsupported by the Almighty, and in great sin- 
cerity and deep humility he seeks Him, and he finds Him. When the fire 
of the Holy Ghost blazes on the altar of a boy's heart it shines in his 
eyes, rings in his voice, purifies his life, refines and elevates his thoughts. 
A great transformation takes place in his soul. Under these circum- 
stances he learns that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, just 
as Peter learned it, and he comes to know it with the same certainty that 
Peter knew it. 

Fundamentally, this is the chief contribution which missionary work 
makes. It plants in the missionary's soul an implicit faith in the living 
God, which is the great principle upon which this Church is built, and 
the source of its enduring achievements. This faith in God is the foun- 
dation upon which the peace and perpetuity of society rests, and mis- 
sionary work makes this contribution as nothing else in this Church 
makes it. 

This is my testimony, and I bear it to you in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I would like again to call your attention to automobile accidents. Be 
careful, please. Do not try to go unless you have the right to go accord- 
ing to the signals. I hope that this building will be crowded tonight at 
the performance of Elijah. It is one of the finest things that has ever 
been here. If it were given in New York, you would have to pay about 
$5 to see and hear it, and you would not complain, either. 

I have heard some people complain that we ought to have a twenty- 
five cent price. It is mighty hard to give a $5 entertainment for twenty- 
five cents. 

If this were a picture show, you could stand it two hours and a 
half, but being a religious service, I suppose you are tired. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

THE MISSIONARY SYSTEM AS AN EDUCATOR 

But I want to say a word or two in confirmation of what Brother 
Bryant S. Hinckley has said. A man who had been around the world 
a number of times, to whom I referred in my remarks here once, his 
neighbor's boy was called on a mission to Germany. This man was 
living at the time in Soda Springs, Idaho. He laughed and laughed 
at the idea of that "clod-hopper" as he called him, being called on a mis- 
sion to preach and to learn another language. "Why, it is a joke," he 
thought. 

After the boy had been away a year and a half, a letter came from 
the boy saying: "I have found some of your relatives living here in 
Berlin. I did not tell them that I used to work for you. Kindly send 
me a letter of introduction." This man told me that when he received 
the letter, he laughed and said to his wife : "My dear, that young man 
won't know how to behave himself in polite society. I am not going 
to humiliate him by giving him a letter of introduction." But he said : 
"After I had slept on it, I thought it was none of my aflair if he wanted 
to be humiliated. So I sent him the letter." 

"Some time later I received a letter from my relatives saying, 
'Your young Mormon friend called on us. He is a very intelligent 
young man, and we have thoroughly enjoyed our visit with him.' An- 
other year and a half rolled round, and I heard that he had returned 
home and was going to preach in the ward. I thought it would be a 
joke for that boy to preach a sermon, so I went to hear him, and I heard 
one of the cleanest-cut, finest arguments in favor of your Church and 
its doctrines that I had ever heard. Why, Mr. Grant, your missionary 
system through which you call young men to perform missions is the 
greatest educator and the greatest developer of young men of any 
system. It is superior to any university, or college, or seminary."! 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 



The Choir sang the "Hosanna" anthem, the congregation singing 
in connection therewith "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I personally thank this choir for singing Evan Stephens' anthems. 
I think they are full of spirit, as well as music. 

Benediction by Elder Levi S. Udall, President of the St. Johns Stake.

o'clock.

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am sure it is pleasing to the Lord, as it is to his servants, the 
Presiding Authorities of the Church, that so many of the Latter-day 
Saints and their friends have come from far and near, and assembled 
in a General Conference of his Church, to be fed upon the bread of life, 
to be renewed in their faith and determination to serve the Lord. 

As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, and a special witness for 
him in the earth, I conscientiously, humbly, and sincerely testify that I 
do know that this work in which we are engaged as Latter-day Saints is 
the work of God. I would like, if I could, to bear this witness to all the 
world. 

FRUITS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE WORK OF THE LORD 

The Savior said on one occasion, "Beware of false prophets which 
come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
Ye shall know them by their fruits." 

The fruits of the Prophet Joseph Smith, of those who associated 
with him in the early days of this Church, and of those who have suc- 
ceeded to the Presidency of the Church, from the days of the Prophet 
Joseph to the present time, are evidences that should be convincing and 
conclusive that this work is the work of the Lord, that those who are at 
its head are divinely inspired, for no mortal man, or men, could have 
accomplished what is being accomplished and has been accomplished in 
this Church up to the present time. 

TESTIMONY AS TO DIVINITY OF LATTER-DAY WORK 

I do know that the story told by Joseph Smith, that the Father and 
the Son appeared to him, is a true statement; that the world's greatest 
need was supplied by that visitation, for the people of this world are 
in gross spiritual darkness pertaining to the existence, the personality, 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



55 



and the power of God, the Eternal Father, and the relationship which we 
sustain to him. 

I do know that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, the Son of 
God. I think I know it as clearly and as fully as did Peter of old ; and 
that a belief in him and the efficacy of his atoning blood is necessary to 
a man's salvation ; that in this work in which we are engaged there are 
all the principles, ordinances, power and authority, in connection with 
the atonement of our Lord and Savior, to effect the eternal salvation and 
exaltation of mankind, by being obedient unto the principles and ordi- 
nances of the Gospel. And I know that this cannot be truthfully said 
of any other organization in this world, for this is God's plan, instituted 
in the council of heaven before the world was. 

LEADERS OF CHURCH HAVE CARRIED ON THE WORK 

The organizations of this Church, as we find them today, were not 
in existence in the days of the Prophet Joseph. True, he established the 
Church, and the Lord through him made provision for its growth and 
development. But it remained for Presidents Brigham Young, John 
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, and Heber 
J. Grant, as the Lord's mouthpieces unto this people, to carry on this 
work and give direction thereto, with the assistance of those men who 
associate with them. And the work has grown and developed, as we are 
the witnesses ; and the auxiliary organizations of this Church have won 
the admiration of men and women who have given proper consideration 
to these organization and their accomplishments. 

There was but one auxiliary organized in the days of the Prophet 
Joseph — that of the Relief Society for our sisters. In the days of Presi- 
dent Brigham Young the Church school system was inauguarated, the 
Sunday Schools of the Church, the Young Men's and Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement Associations of the Church; and under later ad- 
ministration — that of John Taylor — came the Primary organization, in 
itself a wonderful organization, of wonderful accomplishments, as in all 
these other organizations. And these are evidences that those who 
succeeded Joseph Smith as the presidents and leaders of the Church 
were inspired of God. 

I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, 
and that those who have succeeded him in the presidency have been and 
are prophets of God, including our present President. And under his 
administration other wonderful organizations have been inaugurated — 
that of the welfare work of this Church, the stake missionary work, added 
stakes and wards, etc. And the work will continue, of this I am also as- 
sured. 

And I want to say to this large congregation and to the world, that 
to me the witnesses whom God our Father raised up to the Book of 
Mormon, the Three and the Eight witnesses with Joseph Smith, the Pro- 
phet, associated are witnesses of all these truths of which I have been 
speaking. 

The Gospel has been revealed in its fulness ; the Church and king- 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

dom of God established in preparation for the coming of our Lord, the 
ushering in of the millennial reign of peace upon the earth, when Christ 
our Lord shall be the King of kings and Lord of lords, and all powers, 
kings, and dominions will be subject unto him. 

If we as members of this Church will just live up to the precepts 
the teachings and the standards of this Church, the favor of heaven will 
be upon us in life, and we will attain to the blessings of eternal life and 
exaltation, and no mortal man can comprehend the magnitude and the 
greatness of the blessings in store for us. 

At the beginning of this conference, in the opening prayer offered 
by President Marion Romney yesterday morning, he told the Lord that 
we had assembled in General Conference to learn his will concerning us. 
It is one thing to know the will of the Lord, and another thing to do the 
will. The Lord has said : 

He that knoweth the will of the Lord and doeth it not shall be 
beaten with many stripes. 

Christ's part in the rebellion in heaven 

And we read in the Pearl of Great Price, how that in the contro- 
versy in heaven, before the world was, Christ our Lord stood upon 
the platform of principles. "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be 
thine forever." A war was waged against sin and rebellion, and a third 
of heaven's host were cast out. 

We have reason to believe that we fought in that battle with our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as our captain, and with Michael and other 
great characters, and that we kept our first estate through being valiant 
in that fight. We are here upon the earth with a promise of the Lord 
that if we will be likewise valiant here and keep this, our second, estate, 
we shall have added unto us glory and honor forever and ever. The 
Savior's declaration that whatsoever the Father desired of him, his will 
should be done, referred not only to the spirit life, but to the life here 
upon this earth, for when he came here upon many occasions he made 
the declaration that he had come to earth because he had been sent by 
the Father, that he came to do the will of the Father, and he did the will 
of the Father under all circumstances and at all hazards, even to the 
laying down of his life, and all that He endured in life, in fulfilment of 
his mission. 

And after his resurrection he appeared to the people on this Ameri- 
can continent, and addressing them upon the principles and plan of sal- 
vation, he made the declaration that he had come to the earth, having 
been sent of the Father, to do the will of the Father. 

Proceeding further, he said, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" 
And answered it for them, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am." This 
is found in the 27th chapter of Third Nephi, in the Book of Mormon. 

To me that means that not only those Nephites, but all the children 
of men are here upon the earth because we were sent, and we are here 
to learn what our Father's will is concerning us, and to do his will under 
all circumstances and conditions. 



ELDER MARVIN 0. ASHTON

THE WORD OF WISDOM GIVEN AS THE WILL OF GOD 

He has given us the Word of Wisdom as a revelation to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, whom he raised up to be the mighty prophet of this dis 
pensation, and in that revelation he has said that it is his will that w* 
abstain from the use of tobacco, intoxicating and strong drinks, and 
some of our people have taken the ground that it is no commandment 
of God, therefore they are not under the obligation to observe it as they 
would be had it been a command. 

I want to call your attention to what we find in the 89th Section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord by direct revelation to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith said that we are to live by every word that 
proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. And that is given as a com- 
mandment ; the Word of Wisdom did proceed from the mouth of God 
to us as a people, and as the will of the Lord, and therefore we are under 
command to observe it. 

Some of our people quibble over the matter of tea and coffee, and 
say there is no mention of tea and coffee in the Word of Wisdom. I 
want to say to you that from the beginning of this Church, in the days 
of the Prophet Joseph, down to the present time, the leaders of this 
Church have interpreted that Word of Wisdom to include tea and coffee 
and all drinks that are habit-forming because of the caffeine and drugs 
they contain. We, as Latter-day Saints, who by our uplifted hands 
sustain the prophet in our day and time, President Grant, are under 
obligation to accept the interpretations that are made by him and by his 
predecessors with respect to this matter, that the Word of Wisdom that 
has come to us from the Lord includes tea and coffee among- those things 
which we should not partake of. This is the will of the Lord. 

Brethren and Sisters, may God help us to live by the word and will 
which he has expressed in various revelations, then will we be happy, 
and we will be saved and exalted, and what more can the Lord say, what 
more can he offer us as inducement. 

God bless us, brethren and sisters, and help us to be faithful I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MARVIN O. ASHTON 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I do not think I feel as calm as a summer's morning as I occupy 
this position. If humility were the only requisite at this particular moment, 
I would not be worried at all about what I was going to say. The fact 
of the matter is that when I thought of this responsibility I mentioned 
to President McKay that I thought there were certain meeting houses 
that should be examined and that it was very important that the inves- 
tigations, be made the latter part of this week. He reminded me of what 
took place with Jonah when he disobeyed and failed to be in the proper 
place. 

I want to repeat in part what has been said by Bishop Richards, 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second £>ay 

and that is, that I have appreciated very much the last few weeks of 
visiting the different stakes, in a regional capacity, if you please, through- 
out the Church. And lest I forget, I want to express my deep apprecia- 
tion for the kindness which has been bestowed upon us brethren who 
have been visiting in the Bishopric capacity. I want to say further, I 
have appreciated very much the faith of these people. By your outward 
expressions I know what you want to think of us, and the courtesies 
given; but I want to emphatically say to you that we appreciate your 
kindness. Your faith and your integrity builds us up. I am not for- 
getting, by any means, the good sound judgment of you men who are 
leaders in the stakes of this Church. And I do not want to forget for 
one minute the kindness of the wives of these men, who open their 
homes, let their other work go while we are entertained. 

I believe that sometimes to test anything you must have something 
happen of an unusual character. Now I think that peculiar thing has 
happened to the Church so far as this welfare work is concerned. I think 
that this thing coming upon us has been the means of testing us. 

One man wrote this little story : A certain king years ago stretched 
some wires over his castle, and the only time that the tunes would play 
and the chimes sound on those wires was in times of storm. I believe 
that we play the best tunes individually and collectively when the storms 
come. This storm has not been as severe as it might have been, or maybe 
as severe as we may face later, but it has been a test to us. I wonder 
sometimes — and I am not forgetting the fine work that has been done 
by the bishops and by the presidents of stakes, and people of the wards, 
and I am not forgetting by any means, last but not least, the Relief 
Society and what valiant people they have been in this work,— but I have 
noticed this, that some of our people have not taken this thing as seriously 
as they might. They simply have not functioned. 

When we were going up to Canada we noticed on the road that a 
certain washout had hit a mountain side, and there was, hanging from 
the air, a telegraph pole suspended by the wires of the system. I said 
to Bishop Richards, pointing to the pole hanging up there : "I wonder 
if some of us are not just like that pole, instead of sustaining we are 
being suspended." I have thought of that many times since. 

I am afraid sometimes we get in ruts and some of us who have 
been the most valiant sometimes are most susceptible to ruts. Some one 
has said the only difference between a rut and a grave is that one is a 
little deeper than the other. Now I say this respectfully, but sometimes 
men who have won their spurs, who have cut their furrows, rest while 
the world goes on. The Church is of such a nature and such magnitude 
that whether you do your duty or not, it pretty near sustains you. And 
you stay there, and you just hang on by virtue of the tremendous system 
that is over your head. 

Now I believe this : We play our best tunes when the storms rage, 
but we ought to be vary careful that the storms do not get under us and 
lift us up so that we hang there. I believe that some men get it into 
their heads that they ought to be original, and they can not be original

unless they stand off and criticise. It reminds me of a story that I 
learned in Scotland of a man speaking on the street to some people. He 
said : "The only trouble with you is that you are like the fellow who is 
running a relay several times around the race track. You actually get 
so far behind at times that you think you are ahead." 

You often hear the expression, especially by the Genealogical 
Society people — and by the way, I saw this particular phase dramatized, 
and it impressed me very much — you hear them speak of people as being 
in prison, and the doors will not be unlocked if someone fails to do his 
duty. I wonder sometimes if there are not thousands and thousands 
of living people here on the earth who are locked up and cannot get 
through because somebody lacks leadership. It is the saddest thing in 
our Church sometimes to go to a ward or stake and find a lack of lead- 
ership. People are behind the bars, trying to get through, — and I am 
not forgetting our young people at all — and because of lack of leader- 
ship they simply do not get through. 

Now, as far as I am concerned, somebody has something to answer 
for in leadership. I do not care if a man has won his spurs or who he 
is, if he is dead on his feet, it is just a sad situation. Sometimes you can 
go to a ward or a stake and just as soon as you step over the threshhold 
you can feel that death, or slumber, or something of that nature, stalks 
thereabouts, because they are standing on a reputation, and fail to func- 
tion as they should. No truer philosophy is in the scriptures than that 
you cannot put new wine into old bottles. 

One of the most notable things in our Church as I see it — -it has 
been mentioned many times before — is the dilapidated condition of our 
buildings, not forgetting our meeting houses and not forgetting our 
homes. It is a sad situation. We sometimes speak of the "outward 
signs of an inward grace." Now, if our homes are the outward sign of 
an inward grace, we are in awfully sad shape, it seems to me. Now, I 
am not losing sight of the people who are struggling to keep out of debt, 
and building a shanty temporarily to bridge over. I think we ought to 
respect them ; I take my hat off to that kind of people. But I am not 
taking my hat off to the people who through laziness and indolence 
live in a shabby, barn-like abode until "kingdom come." We must 
not be too severe, but people who come into our midst notice these 
things, and we are judged accordingly. I am not overlooking the item 
of charity and kindness to others who are making a struggle. It seems 
to me the biggest thing in our lives is charity. "Though you give your 
body to be burned, if you have not charity, it availeth you nothing." 

I want to say here that I hope in this system of welfare work where 
it is our purpose to organize ourselves, rather intensely, a little pocket 
for this situation, a little "pigeon hole" for that circumstance, that in all 
this setting up of a system we do not forget honest-to-gaodness 
charity and kindness to one another. That man is still taking a trip from 
Jerusalem to Jericho. That man may be sitting next to you right now. 
He may pass you as you go out. You may meet him on the street, but 
he is still here. We need charity in our souls. He is begging for a tear 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE

of sympathy and a kind expression from you — not altogether your 
money, but the milk of human kindness. Some people who build up 
nice bank accounts and shake hands with themselves for the wonderful 
position they are in financially ; the ray of charity sometimes fails to get 
through for them. I wonder sometimes (to play on someone's expres- 
sion) if that same fellow who always wants the spiritual blessings to 
come to the other fellow, how he would appreciate it if, when he got 
around the table Thanksgiving Day, he would have a spiritual turkey, 
that was "without body, parts, or passions." 

Some of us are just naturally — as one man puts it — "tight." Our 
pores are closed, and we do not let charity break through. 

I must not say very much more. But I do want to say this in closing. 
Across the street from here to the east some of those men who are 
sweeping up the leaves in these paths are executives. I have yet to be 
convinced that all the virtues are inside of a white collar. Just as often 
they are in a flannel shirt as they are in a white shirt. Sometimes a 
man who has been a clerk or an executive will come on his hands and 
knees and beg for a job at three or four dollars a day. He may bring 
his little kit of clothes in a satchel lest he meet some of his friends in 
his overalls. He will go through this humiliation and live on bread and 
water to keep a boy or girl on a mission. This is something some of 
us do not dream about, and we forget all about the man's sacrifice. 

May the Lord help us to keep charitable and kind, to be on our 
toes, and as someone has expressed the "eleventh commandment," — '"If 
there is anything going on, be thou in it." May the Lord bless us. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

If there is anything that I am grateful for it is for my standing in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that I have fellowship 
with the Saints of God, that I have part in this glorious work which the 
Lord has established for the salvation of mankind. I am always con- 
scious of the fact that the Lord is carrying on a great work, that he has 
stretched forth his hand to perform a marvelous work and a wonder, 
and that we are among his chosen people, the chosen people of God. 

I rejoice in this fact. The people who have embraced the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, who have been members of his Church in the various 
dispensations of the past have always been designated "his covenant 
people." Why should we be called a "covenant people?" For this reason : 
That we have entered into covenant with God, in the new and everlast- 
ing covenant. 

The everlasting covenant has been so frequently referred to in the 
scriptures that I marvel that people do not interest themselves suffi- 
ciently to find out just what that covenant is. Have we made a covenant 
with the Lord ? Has he made a covenant with us ? What is a covenant ? 
If we will examine our dictionaries we will find that a covenant is "an 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



61 



agreement entered into between two or more persons or parties." When 
we enter into a covenant with our fellow men, we draw up an instru- 
ment setting forth the obligations and promises of the contracting parties 
to the covenant. We sign it in our own handwriting, and seal it in the 
presence of witnesses, and then go before a notary public or a justice of 
the peace and make oath to the same. 

If so much formality is deemed necessary in the ordinary affairs of 
life which men make with their fellow men, what must we think of a 
covenant where God himself is the party of the first part ? 

When we enter into a covenant with the Lord will it be any less 
formal or binding on the parties to the covenant? The Lord has made 
just such a covenant with his children ; but does he sign it with pen and 
.ink, or do we subscribe it in our own hand-writing? No! indeed! The 
Lord has a much better and more impressive way for us to enter into 
covenant with Him. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is 
the formality of entering into the covenant. We do not need to sign it 
with pen and ink. We do not need to go before a notary public or a 
justice of the peace. But when we enter into the waters of baptism, we 
go in company with a servant of the Lord who has been commissioned 
of Jesus Christ to perform that sacred ordinance. In performing this 
ceremony the duly authorized servant of God will take the candidate's 
hands into his left hand, and raise his right hand to the square, saying 
this: 

Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ I baptize you in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 

He then immerses the convert in the water in the likeness of the 
burial of our Lord and Savior who died upon the Cross, and then raises 
him up out of this watery grave in the likeness of His glorious resurrec- 
tion. What could be more impressive than this ? 

This is the formality of entering into the covenant with God. And 
those who do thus enter into that covenant do so with a full understand- 
ing that they are to keep his holy commandments, that they are to walk 
in the light, that they are to "do all things whatsoever the Lord their God 
shall command them." Brother George F. Richards in his conference 
talk referred to a certain event that took place in the heavens before the 
world was made. It was here, in Heaven, that the covenant was first 
made. This is undoubtedly the circumstance to which the Lord referred 
when he asked his servant Job : "Where wast thou when I laid the foun- 
dations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding When 

the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy." 
(Job 38:4-7.) 

This event was made known unto Abraham in a glorious revelation 
which I find recorded in the Book of Abraham — Let me quote : 

Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was ; and among all these there were many 
of the noble and great ones ; 

And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst 
of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers-; for he stood among 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good ; and he said unto 
me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast 
born. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space there, 
and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; 

And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they 
who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom 
with those who keep their first estate ; and they who keep their second estate 
shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. ( Abr. 3 :22-36.) 

In these paragraphs the terms, and obligations required of us as 
the children of God, and the glorious promises or agreement which the 
Lord makes if we will only do our part are clearly stated. This covenant 
relates to both estates. We who now live upon the earth, or ever have 
lived upon it, or ever will live upon it in bodies of flesh and bone have 
kept our first estate in heaven before our coming to live upon the earth, 
and hence we have been added upon, or in other words there have been 
or will be added to our immortal spirits these bodies of flesh and bone, 
and although we shall all surely die we shall all be made alive again, and 
thus the Lord fulfills his agreement to all who keep their first estate. 
God keeps his covenant. 

What concerns us now, however, relates to our present or mortal 
life, our second estate, wherein we are to be proven the second time, and 
if we enter into this covenant or agreement with the Lord through the 
holy waters of baptisms and keep it inviolate, then the Lord is bound 
under the terms of the covenant to add glory upon our heads for ever 
and ever. This means a never ending glory in the Celestial Kingdom— 
the power of eternal increase — to become the sons and daughters of God, 
and heirs of God, even joint heirs with Jesus Christ, and with him to 
inherit all things that the Father hath. 

In this revelation we see just why the children of Abraham are 
known as the chosen people of God, for Abraham was one of the great 
and noble ones among God's spirit children — one of the Morning Stars 
that sang together and was chosen before he was born. 

The carrying out of' this Covenant involved the creation of this 
planet and the sending of someone with almighty power to create the 
earth and establish the covenant with the children . of men in all the 
various dispensations of this world's career. And the Lord said : 

"Who shall I send?" 

"And one answered like unto the Son of Man, Here am I. Send 

me." 

And He also said : "Father, thy will be done and the glory be thine 
forever." 

This was our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the First Born in the 
spirit. 

And another one arose, a mighty spirit, but an evil one, and he said : 
"Here am I. Send me. I will be thy son, and I will redeem all man- 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



63 



kind, that one soul shall not be lost. And surely I will do it. Therefore 
give me thine honor." This was Lucifer, or Satan, or the Devil, as he is 
severally, known. * 

He proposed to abolish the free agency of man. He proposed to 
save every soul, no matter what they might do. And he arrogated unto 
himself the honor which belongs to God alone. And when God said : 
"I will send the first," Satan became angry and rebelled against God and 
many followed after him, even one-third of the hosts of heaven. 

Here, then, is a very comprehensive and satisfying explanation of 
the everlasting covenant — first made in heaven before the world was 
made and then established on the earth in each dispensation of God's 
providence beginning with Adam after his expulsion from the Garden 
of Eden. 

The two parts in this everlasting covenant are made so plain that 
"the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein." (Isa. 35 :8.) 
Namely : 

First: Our part is to do all things whatsoever the Lord, our God, 
shall command us. In other words, keep his commandments. This we 
can do and the Lord expects us to do it. 

Second : The Lord's part is to add glory upon our heads forever 
and ever if we do our part. 

In other words, it means salvation. We cannot save ourselves. 
All this is the Lord's part in the everlasting covenant. 

It will therefore be seen that our souls must needs be sanctified from 
all unrighteousness that they "may be prepared for Celestial glory." 
(D. & C. 88 :18.) Obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ provides the 
necessary preparation and if we render this obedience by "doing all 
things whatsoever the Lord our God commands then he is bound under 
the terms of the everlasting covenant" to save us and bring us back to 
God. All this, of course, we are utterly unable to do. All we can do 
about it is to prepare ourselves to receive it. Hence we need a Savior. 

Salvation in the presence of God comes to persons as a gift of God 
to those who keep their second estate. May the Lord help us, then, to 
be faithful in our second estate by keeping his commandments, by walk- 
ing in the light, and by so living that we may call down his blessings upon 
our heads, I pray, in the name of Jesus, Amen.

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

THE ARTICLES OF FAITH 

Ninety-six years ago, the editor of a Chicago paper asked the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith for a brief sketch of the history and beliefs of the 
Church he had founded. The Prophet complied. His statement of 
beliefs he compressed into thirteen one-sentence paragraphs, except for 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Dtg 

the tenth which contained three sentences and the thirteenth which com- 
prised two. These succinct paragraphs have since come severally to be 
called articles and collectively they are known as the Articles jof Faith. 
From the thirteenth Article I take as my text this declaration : "We be- 
lieve in being honest." 

HONESTY A REQUIREMENT 

It will at once be said that there is nothing distinctive about that. 
Everybody believes in being honest. But by the very implication of this 
profession of belief we are required to be honest, and so is everyone 
else who makes a like profession, for a profession of belief which does 
not manifest itself in terms of actual performance is of negligible if any 
value. 

It was Jesus who likened the man who heard his sayings and did 
them to a wise man who built his house upon a rock and because thereof 
it withstood rain and flood and tempest. 

BUSINESS MEN'S OPINION 

I am influenced in my selection of the text by the report that a 
prominent minister in an eastern city had submitted to twenty large 
employers of men this question : "What is the greatest need of the busi- 
ness world today?" Each of the twenty gave the same answer: "Personal 
honesty." If these men were right in their conclusion (and their sur- 
prising unanimity weighs heavily in favor of the correctness of their 
opinion) then personal conduct lags lamentably far behind profession, 
if we assume that substantially everyone as a matter of profession be- 
lieves in being honest. 

From the nature of the discussion consequent upon receipt of their 
answers, , I assume that the business men whose opinions were asked 
were thinking of honesty in terms of the eighth commandment. As used 
in our text, the word comprehends far more than that. To restrain 
one's self from taking property which belongs to another is only to evi- 
dence the quality of honesty in one of its most rudimentary stages. I 
should like to persuade you that honesty is as all-inclusive of the virtues 
as the Golden Rule, or as the commandment to love your neighbor as 
yourself, upon which commandment, together with the love of God, 
Jesus said, the whole law hangs. 

But let us for the moment consider our text in terms of the com- 
mandment, "Thou shalt not steal." 

COVETOUSNESS THE CAUSE OF DISHONESTY 

Why does one steal ? Obviously to get what one desires and might 
otherwise have to do without. Stealing has its inception in covetousness 
which is altogether an unlovely trait. If men did not covet they would 
not steal. If there were no violation of the tenth commandment, there 
would be no violation of the eighth commandment. 

The gratification of the covetous impulse betokens such lack of self- 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 



65 



control and such weakness of will as renders the unbidden appropriator 
of other men's goods incapable of denying the demands of his own desire. 

The impulse to gratify personal desire is yielded to without any re- 
gard to the consequence to the one whose property is appropriated, who 
may be either greatly inconvenienced or forced to the abandonment of a 
projected endeavor, or even exposed to downright suffering and distress. 
The thief is indifferent to the suffering of others. 

Altogether he presents a sorry sample of qualities. He is covetous, 
lacking in self-control, indifferent, cruel. These are deep-seated flaws 
in character of which stealing is but one manifestation. For after all, 
basically honesty is a matter of character. Honesty and the highest 
ideals of manhood are bound up inseparably together. 

But harmful as thieving may be to the victim, it is vastly more de- 
vastating to the perpetrator of the theft. 

He robs himself of his own self-respect, which is one of the most 
nearly irreparable losses anyone may sustain. A man may lose the 
esteem of his fellows and survive the loss if supported by the conscious- 
ness of his own rectitude. It is not so important what others think of 
him but what he knows about himself is of transcendent importance. 

He practices of necessity the art of deceit and becomes in conse- 
quence devious in his ways. His mental processes are sinuous. He does 
not trust and is not trusted. 

Even though he has not been found out and moves freely in society, 
he knows himself to be something other than what people take him to be. 
To that extent he knows that he is an imposter and a fraud, which 
destroys his self-reliance and makes him uncertain, vacillating and in- 
capable of realizing the fullness of his talents. 

CONSEQUENCES OF DISHONESTY 

Dread of discovery and exposure fills his soul with fear, which is 
one of the greatest enemies of man. It breaks his courage, it weakens 
and wears away his power to launch into bold and lofty endeavor. It 
circumscribes and limits the field of his vision and is a barrier to his 
pushing out to new horizons. It conjures up for him torments. It 
haunts his waking hours and visits his sleepless pillow in the darkness 
of the night. 

KEEPING OF COMMANDMENTS BRINGS PEACE 

Observance of the eighth commandment, on the other hand, never 
brings remorse. Instead of begetting fear it inspires confidence and 
courage. It preserves self-respect, encourages forthrightness and dis- 
counts deceit. It does not weaken the will. It causes no injury or suffer- 
ing to another. It provides an armor against covetousness, fosters kind- 
ness jand is not cruel. Like all God's commandments it takes cognizance 
of the conditions necessary to a man's peace and happiness and ad- 
monishes him in the way of life that brings their realization. 

When Moses heard the voice of God declaring out of the clouds 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Day 

on Sinai, "Thou shalt not steal," he was listening not only to the promul- 
gation of a law fundamentally important to the progress and stability 
of the individual, but he was hearing at the same time words of great 
social wisdom. Honesty lies at the very root of any stable society. If 
all were thieves, no society could exist. If a man should arise in the 
morning with the purpose of plowing his field, his plan would be defeated 
if he went out only to find that someone else had appropriated his team 
and his plow. Should he then decide to cut his hay instead, he again 
would be thwarted if someone had taken away his harvesting equipment. 
And so alternate plans might one after another go awry and his day be 
rendered barren of results. As the number of members in the society 
increased the confusion would multiply. Orderly processes would be 
impossible. There would be no security and no dependable means of 
planning action. 

A society can endure only if the great majority of people in it do 
not steal. 

But men were intended to live together. It is only in relationship to 
his fellows that man grows and develops. The very existence of the 
Church itself, its teachings, its hope and its promise assume the existence 
of that relationship and the living of life under its conditions. If there 
were but a solitary, single inhabitant on the earth, there would be no 
need for the eighth commandment nor for any of the others. He would 
know nothing of the virtue of honesty, just as he would know nothing 
of moral courage, honor, fidelity, loyalty, love, for these derive their 
whole meaning and significance out of the interrelations of men. These 
are the qualities which elevate a man and impart to him the estate of 
goodness. 

Honesty demands fidelity to promises. 

CIVILIZATION BASED ON HONESTY 

It has been said that on that day when someone at some inconven- 
ience to himself, determined to keep a promise, which he was not com- 
pelled to keep, civilization was born. The statement of course is in- 
tended to make clear that the relationships inherent in civilization could 
not exist nor civilization itself endure if people as a general rule did not 
keep their promises. Certainly the business world would collapse at 
once if this practice fell into decay. Almost all the vast and complicated 
intricacies of trade and exchange are carried on on the basis of promises. 

You plant your sugar beets because the processor has promised to 
buy them. You put your eggs in a car destined for New York because 
the railroad company has promised to deliver them there. The grocery- 
man delivers the food you eat for dinner because you promise you will 
pay for it. Lights are installed in your home and permitted to serve you 
because you promise that you will pay the service charge. You promise 
to pay the service charge because you are working for someone who has 
promised to pay you for your labor. You live in the landlord's house 
and he buys the coal to heat it and the food he eats and the clothes he 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 



67 



wears because you have promised to pay the rent, which he in turn has 
promised to pay to the coal dealer and the clothier and the grocer. 

If there were a wholesale repudiation of promises, the first man 
disappointed would be compelled to disappoint those to whom he had 
given his word. And so it would go round the circle. There would be a 
total collapse. Our organized lives could not go on. So important is it 
that promises be kept that the f ramers of the Constitution of the United 
States wrote into it a provision that no state could pass a law relieving 
people from their obligation to keep them. While the law is .here to 
enforce fulfillment against the unwilling, it is powerless to do anything 
but take away from the one who has violated his promise enough prop- 
erty to discharge his obligation. If he has no property, the law can do 
nothing, and so we have a whole host of petty little devices and intrigues 
conjured up to circumvent the law. The only security lies in individual, 
personal honesty. The law cannot make people honest. 

Men sometimes excuse their failure to pay debts upon the pretext 
that the creditor is a rich and strong institution and is perfectly well able 
to bear the loss. Frequently it is not the rich nor the strong who bear 
the loss but the widow and the orphan whose patrimony has been in- 
vested in these institutions. 

But whether the creditor can afford to sustain the loss or not is 
quite beside the point. The debtor, for the effect upon himself, for the 
sake of the honor of his name and his own self-esteem cannot afford to 
refuse payment of his debt so long as he has anything left to apply to the 
purpose. 

Back in the dim recesses of my earliest childhood memory there is 
lodged the code that a Mormon's word must be as good as his bond. 
Debts simply had to be paid. That made us extremely careful about 
contracting them. 

Incurring obligations beyond a reasonable expectancy of the ability 
to meet them is a fruitful source of ultimate dishonesty. Men who would 
scorn to steal and who would be highly incensed at the suggestion of 
thievery, nevertheless do not hesitate to make engagements which they 
have no chance of meeting. When the day of reckoning comes they will 
covertly put their property out of reach and otherwise preserve what they 
have to the deprivation of those to whom they have given their word. 
It puts a heavy strain upon character to see the accumulations of years 
of toil appropriated to the payment of debts incurred. One sees charac- 
ter crack under the strain. 

Buying on credit with no reasonable prospect of payment resembles 
taking outright what belongs to another in that both come about through 
uncontrolled desire to possess. The same kind of resistance is necessary 
in each case if desire is to be denied. The time to avoid the unpleasant 
consequence is before incurring the obligation. There is character-build- 
ing strength in resisting. 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOLDEN RULE 

I have said that honesty embraces the principle of the Golden Rule. 
This principle forbids interference by one with the rights of another. 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Dag 

It requires that every man be privileged to pursue his lawful calling in 
his own way and in peace, without restraint or hindrance. The em- 
ployer must give an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. The 
employee must give an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. 
Honesty condemns falsity in all its forms. It does not permit the bear- 
ing of false witness. It banishes from out its pale the demagogic art 
of vilifying and misrepresenting one person or class for the purpose of 
arraying another person or class against the first. It does not sow dis- 
sension. Trust, confidence, assurance and peace are the offspring of 
honesty. 

War, the disputes of nations, class conflict, the bitterness and hatred 
that threaten the peace of the world would dissolve by the simple pro- 
cess of observing these principles of honesty. 

Honesty embraces truth and requires fidelity to principle. In this 
realm lies what we might designate as honesty in public life. It requires 
that men in public office should not graft even within the law. They 
must set principle above expediency and the public welfare above con- 
siderations of personal fortune. The scandals that rock our large cities 
to their foundations could not occur if those trusted with official au- 
thority practiced the simplest principles of common honesty. Fidelity 
here often calls for a high order of moral courage. One hears of legis- 
lators in state and nation who talk one way and vote another. Among 
friends and in confidence they condemn policies and the laws projected 
to effectuate them, yet officially they vote the passage of those laws 
merely because they fear the course of right, as they see it, might not 
be popular and to follow it might terminate their official careers. They 
would rather violate their consciences than lose the glamor and power 
of official position. Such men constitute a far greater menace to our 
country'^ safety than do all the propagandists of alien philosophies put 
together. We need fear no invasion from without so long as we are 
sound to the core within. 

Nearly one hundred years ago in a stirring appeal to France, Victor 
Hugo said : "Sovereignty is not in dynasties, it is not in princes, it is not 
even in the people. It is higher; * * *. Sovereignty is in truth!" 
Sovereign truth demands undiluted honesty. Every act of our lives; 
every concept of our intellects ; every yearning of our souls, to be worthy, 
must be impregnated with the quality of honesty — -that quality which 
gives integrity to the internal structure of a man and fits, him for every 
trust. 

ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I sincerely trust, my brothers and sisters, that I might enjoy a por- 
tion of the Lord's Spirit in the endeavor to speak to you this morning. 
It is needless for me to say that I have a feeling of gratitude in my heart 
for the testimony that the Lord has been kind enough to give to me of 
the divinity of this great work. I know that Jesus of Nazareth is the 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



69 



Redeemer of the world, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and 
that through him the Gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth 
in its simplicity and purity. 

I am grateful for the parents that are mine ; grateful because they 
have exemplified in their lives the principles of virtue, integrity and 
faith. I am grateful to the Lord that he has again established upon the 
earth the Church organizations, for the Melchizedek Priesthood brought 
back by Peter, James and John ; the Aaronic Priesthood, restored to the 
earth through the instrumentality of John the Baptist. I am grateful 
for the fact that I have a standing and membership in the Church of 
Jesus Christ. 

I think all the achievements we have made as a people have been 
possible through the fact that we have had in our midst the power of the 
Priesthood. Brigham Young said: 

Much has been said about the power of the Latter-day Saints. Is it 
the people called Latter-day Saints that have this power, or is it the 
Priesthood? 

He said it is the Priesthood, and if they live according to that 
Priesthood, they could commence their work here and gain many victor- 
ies, and be prepared to receive glory, immortality, and eternal life. He 
made another statement. 

The Priesthood of the Son of God which we have in our midst 
is a perfect order and system of government, and this alone can deliver 
the human family from all the evils which now afflict its members, and 
insure them of happiness hereafter. 

So Priesthood to me is more than the power of God delegated unto 
us, whereby we may act as his representatives, it is a perfect system 
and order of government given to us -through which we may help the 
human race to solve the problems that now afflict it. One of the greatest 
differences between this government and the government of men is that 
we have no desire to take away land or natural resources from any nation 
or people, but we have a desire to help the human race, teach them the 
ways of life and righteousness as they have been revealed to us in this 
day and age. 

This government of the Priesthood has departments or divisions 
through which the work of the Lord is accomplished. One of the most 
important ones we might call the Department of Education; we find 
inscribed over the portals of this great department these words: "The 
glory of God is intelligence." In this department we find many work- 
ers. One of the most representative groups of workers is the great 
missionary corps that goes out into the world preaching the Gospel to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and people. 

There are other workers and teachers, for we are essentially a 
teaching Church. The great commission given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith was to teach the world of the ways and of the principles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Among our own people we have, another corps of 
teachers whose duty it is to go among the Saints once a month, to exhort, 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Dag 

to admonish, and stimulate them to greater activity in this work, and to 
protect them from the snares of the adversary. 

Through the auxiliary organizations of the Church we find a great 
educational project being carried out, the teaching of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ to the boys, girls, men and women of this great Church. 

There are other departments in this government of the Priesthood. 
There is the department of health, the fundamental law of which is the 
Word of Wisdom, revealed to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
that we might live in accordance with the atmosphere that is created 
by the Holy Ghost as he comes to dwell within us. 

There is the finance department. Finances are just as essential for 
the carrying on of the work in this kingdom as they are in any other gov- 
ernment or kingdom. The Lord has given us a law whereby we can accum- 
ulate the finances to carry on this great work — the law of tithing, a most 
equitable and just law. He has also given us another law, a law that is 
necessary for the taking care of our brothers and sisters who find them- 
selves in destitute circumstances, namely the law of fast offerings. 
Through this law the Lord expects us to provide the means whereby we 
can carry on the great assignment that has come to us in connection with 
the Church Welfare program. A law, too, that is fair and equitable 
when you stop to think that all the Lord asks of us is the value of the 
two meals we abstain from on the first Sunday of each month. 

There is another great department in the government of the Priest- 
hood, a department that we may now call the Welfare department, a 
department that has been organized for the purpose of taking care of 
our brethren and sisters who may be in the vale of poverty and need. 
We have two objectives in this great department : first, to accumulate 
enough food and fuel, and provide shelter for all of those who may be 
in need of these necessities. And the other objective in connection with 
this plan is to provide every man with the right to earn his bread 
by the sweat of his own brow. As we listened this morning to the reports 
of some of the stake presidents in relation to the projects that have already 
been provided for those who need work it was most inspirational, when 
you stop to think that not far distant from here three Elders quorums 
went to work on a project comprising some three thousand acres of land. 
They cultivated some nine hundred acres of it, produced a crop of six- 
teen thousand bushels of wheat, and in addition to that broke up another 
six hundred acres which are to be used in 1939. All this is being done 
for the purpose of providing the necessities of life and labor for our 
brethren and sisters who are in need. 

There are other projects in connection wih this Welfare depart- 
ment. Projects to rehabilitate our people in their attitude toward the 
government, in their attitude toward work, and in their attitude toward 
the Church. In this great government of the Priesthood we find that 
there is a recreational department represented by the Mutual organiza- 
tions, that provides wholesome recreation for the people of the Church. 

We could go on and mention many other departments in connection 
with this great Priesthood government. But there are two relationships 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



71 



that I should like to draw to your attention. The first is the relationship 
which we have in connection with the business world. Brother Albert E. 
Bowen has already mentioned something in relation to it. Those of us 
who are members of the Priesthood government, who hold the Priesthood 
of God, should remember that in all of our dealings with the business 
world we should be honest, fair and square in our dealings. Brigham 
Young said upon one occasion : 

Men who are vessels of the Holy Priesthood, are charged with 
words of eternal life for the world and have tried continually in their 
words and actions and daily deportment to do honor to the great dignity 
of their calling and office as ministers and representatives of the Most 
High. ' 

It would seem to me that members of the Priesthood of God are 
servants and officers in this government, and should remember to live 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in our shops, in our stores, in our factories, 
and on our farms, and every day of our lives as well as on Sunday. 

Then there is another relationship that we have, the relationship 
with the governments of the earth. We believe in obeying the laws of 
all governments. May I say that one of our Articles of Faith points 
out to us : 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magis- 
trates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. 

We believe that, and this is the relationship that should exist 
between us and all nations, regardless of where we may live; as the 
Priesthood and the government of the Lord Jesus Christ we have a 
definite responsibility in connection with the Constitution of these United 
States. I am sure if there is a people in all the world that appreciates the 
Constitution it is this people, for under this divine instrument it was 
possible for Joseph Smith to bring into existence the Churcli of Jesus 
Christ, in a nation where there are equal rights, the right to worship 
God according to the dictates of one's conscience. 

We should at all times be willing to sustain the great Bill of Rights 
in our own country, to sustain and uphold the laws here. I firmly believe 
that Brigham Young was a prophet of Almighty God. I think that he 
spoke under the inspiration of the Lord's Spirit. I want to read to you 
an excerpt from one of his sermons, wherein he laid upon the shoulders 
of the Priesthood of this Church some very definite responsibilities 
relative to the fundamental law of our country. He said : 

I expect to see the day when the Elders of Israel will protect and 
sustain civil and religious liberty, and every constitutional right bequeathed 
to us by our fathers. 

He said these rights would go out in connection with the Gospel 
for the salvation of all nations, and added : 

I shall see this whether I live or whether I die. I do not lift up 
my voice against the great and glorious government guaranteed to every 
citizen by our Constitution, but against those administrators who trample 
the Constitution and just laws under their feet. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



We see from this prophecy, uttered by a prophet of God that there 
will yet devolve upon the Priesthood of this Church the responsibility 
of protecting the rights and the Constitution of our great country. 

This Priesthood government, this perfect system of government, 
as Brigham Young calls it, is headed today by a prophet of God, a man 
who has the right, the authority and keys to receive from our Heavenly 
Father his mind and will in relationship to his Church here upon earth. 
He in turn is surrounded by Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, who have 
the same rights and privileges as the Apostles of old, so that the leader- 
ship of this great Church comes under the immediate and divine direction 
of our Heavenly Father. 

What does all of this mean to you and to me? Do we appreciate 
the Priesthood ? I would say to you that it is the greatest gift that God 
has ever given unto mankind, and if we have appreciation in our hearts 
let us render that appreciation in deeds of service. When the Bishop 
calls upon us to go block teaching let us consider that it is a high call, 
be glad to go and admonish, counsel and exhort the Saints. It matters 
not what our call in the Priesthood may be, whatever it is it comes to 
us because we are servants of God, and we should receive the call with 
gladness, and with the thought in mind that after the work has been 
finished we will be recipients of great blessings. 

Therefore, let us approach our Priesthood activities and responsi- 
bilities with willing hearts and without any reservations. The Lord 
Jesus Christ has made a promise to those who will serve willingly and 
gladly, for he said : 

Verily I say unto you, that there is no man that has left home, or 
parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the Kingdom of God's sake 
who shall not receive manifold more at the present time and in the worlds 
to come, even life everlasting. 

May we appreciate the Priesthood of God ; if we do leave our homes 
and our businesses for the kingdom's sake, let us remember that our 
blessings will be life everlasting, which I hope will be the blessing of 
each and every one of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



I labor with my associates in a land made holy by the sufferings and 
the labors of our people in the early history of the Church. We have a 
great many visitors come, particularly in the summer season, wanting to 
see the points of interest through which our people passed, and where 
they lived. 

We try, as far as we possibly can, to give them proper direction and 
correct information, I have observed that after they have been to these 
points of interest in the State of Missouri, if they do return they invari- 
ably come back definitely impressed with the sacredness of these spots of 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 



President of the Central States Mission 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF

ground. There comes into their hearts a great reverence for the deeds of 
their fathers, and I sometimes wish that every member of the Church 
could have the privilege of going to Liberty, and Richmond, Far West, 
Adam-ondi-Ahman, and Haun's Mill, on their way east or west, as they 
come through the Central States Mission, for the impression that it gives 
them, for the increase in their faith and their reverence for the work that 
has been performed in this Church by its founders and leaders. 

One cannot stand upon the hill overlooking the valley of Adam-ondi- 
Ahman without being very deeply impressed with the sacredness of the 
place. When we go there we take Brother Joseph Fielding Smith's book, 
The Way To Perfection and read the fortieth chapter, . which tells 
how that before he died our father Adam came with his generation 
of descendants, all the righteous, and blessed them, and where he will 
eventually return when the time comes for him to present to the Savior 
his children, and to turn over the kingdom to the Lord. 

At the present time the hill upon which the old monument stands — 
apparently an old Nephite look-out station — is covered with large weeds, 
and is very difficult of ascent. Nevertheless, it is quite worth the climb 
up the hill to see it. I have sometimes wondered whether or not I should 
urge that we attempt to acquire some piece of ground there that would 
include the hill and part of the valley, and make it easier and more accep- 
table for people to look upon that valley and to attain that eminence on 
the hillside. 

Those spots in Missouri are very very sacred, and it is a pleasure to 
go there. I think our people who read the history of the Church, if I judge 
them by myself, do not adequately understand just what occurred or how 
it happened. It is a new revelation to again read the history of the Church 
in Missouri after you have visited those points of interest. I believe that 
the time will come in Missouri, as it is now fast coming in the State of 
Illinois, when the people of the State will become more cognizant of the 
tourist value of these points of interest. 

I am happy to note that in Illinois two of our cities — that is, Nauvoo 
and Carthage — -have become two of five points of interest to which tour- 
ists are directed who wish to see the interesting and historic parts of the 
State of Illinois. That feeling is growing in the State of Missouri. A 
number of men in Independence have stated to me at times that when it is 
convenient they would like to go with me and see those places. It will 
be a pleasure for me, of course, to take them. 

I can report to you that the work of the mission is going along, and 
we feel very much encouraged, because the Lord does bless us and his 
power is manifest as we proceed with our labors. The missionaries re- 
spond to the influence of the Holy Spirit; they try to teach the Gospel 
under his influence ; they are prayerful and humble, and we feel that the 
Lord does direct our efforts, does guide us to the homes of the honest in 
heart, does give us utterance when we try to speak, does magnify us in 
the hearts and minds of people, and gives us influence as his servants, to 
teach them and to persuade them in the ways of righteousness and faith. 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Dag 

I am grateful for the opportunity of reporting this mission to you. 
I am deeply grateful for the opportunity of laboring in the mission field. 
I trust that I may be ever found worthy, as long as it is the will of his 
servants that I shall remain there, to discharge my duties acceptably. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my brethren and sisters, that you may 
have reverence and respect for the traditions of the past, as well as con- 
tinuing to look forward, as Bishop Marvin O. Ashton has so delightfully 
pointed out to you, and not live in the past, but look to the future. But 
the past is glorious and sacred to us. It inspires us, and has something to 
do with an increase of our faith. 

May God add his blessings to you, and magnify this conference to 
our good, I humbly ask, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER THOMAS D. REES 

Former President of the Australian Mission 

I am very happy to be present at these services of this conference, 
happy to meet my friends and loved ones again. For three years I have 
been presiding in the Australian Mission, and I am constrained in the 
few minutes I have to report of the conditions in that far-off land. 

The members of our Church in that section of the world are a fine 
class of people. As a rule they are educated, courteous, and polite. 
Courtesy and politeness are the characteristics of the Australian people. 
Our Saints live in comfortable homes. Those who need employment 
have employment. Australia today is a very prosperous land. They 
have no depression, as far as I was able to see. Our Saints are faithful 
to their duties. They attend their church services. They pay their 
tithes. They look to us, hoping always to be led by the spirit of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I am happy to report the wonderful work that is being done by our 
Elders in that far-off land. I wish to endorse the words of President 
Bryant S. Hinckley ; there is nothing that can come into a boy's life or 
a girl's life as fine as a missionary experience. Two years in the mission 
field can teach them much, and bring to them a richness of life that can- 
not be found in any other two years of life. 

I am happy to state that the people of Australia are very demo- 
cratic in their attitude towards our Elders. There is no hate, there is 
no animosity. They seem to invite our Elders to explain the Gospel. The 
mission covers a great territory, and after an Elder has gone across the 
great Pacific nine thouand miles, he lands in Sydney, a city of a million 
and a quarter people, all of whom are of British descent. He comes to 
the headquarters, he is given his instructions, and is surprised, some- 
times, at the distance he is required to travel after he reaches his head- 
quarters. If he is to go to an adjoining district, it is practically as far as 
from here to San Diego. Sometimes we tell him : "The mission district 
where you are to work is fifteen hundred miles away." One of our 



ELDER W. AIRD MacDONALD 



75 



branches is as far from headquarters as Hawaii is from Salt Lake City. 
To find these young men carrying on in these great districts gives you 
such a thrill that you feel the wonderful privilege it is to be in the mission 
field with them. 

Those young men carry the spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
with them, and I feel sometimes in their humility they approach very 
close to their Father in heaven. The question is ofttimes asked : "Why 
do you come to us? We are a Christian people, we believe in Christ, 
we have beautiful churches, we have our ministers, we have the Bible, 
what have you got that is different ?" This is an opportune time for an 
Elder to begin telling them the things we have that are different. He 
whom they call their head, even Jesus Christ, who walked by the Sea of 
Galilee, and preached the wonderful Sermon on the Mount, that same 
King has come in this day to the prophets of the living God and declared 
himself as Jesus Christ the Redeemer of the world. It is that message 
that we have that is different, and we carry it to the world, and when an 
Elder has that testimony in his heart he is not afraid to step up to 
any door; he is not afraid to speak to any man. We have the words of 
the Lord Jesus Christ; it is the answer in this day as to the principles 
he wishes the people of the world to know and live. 

It is a glorious thing when we can say in expressing our message, 
"We are giving you the word of the Lord Jesus Christ," and that should 
take precedence of the opinion of the wisest of the wise, the most learned 
of the learned, for thus saith the Lord to his people in this day, and that 
should be sufficient to end all controversy as to what the Lord means. 

My brothers and sisters, those Elders go forth with that testimony 
in their hearts, glorious in their belief, happy in their faith in a living God, 
and in humility serving him. It is the most glorious thing that can come 
into their lives. Ask an Elder — it makes no difference how long it has 
been since he has been home — about his mission, and you will see his face 
brighten and his eyes begin to sparkle as he tells you of his missionary 
experiences. 

I want to bear you my testimony that the three years that I was in 
the mission field gave me a richness of years that I will never forget. 
May God bless us and help us to understand that our Advocate, even the 
Lord Jesus Christ, is at the head of this work. God bless us, is my 
prayer. Amen. 

ELDER W. AIRD MACDONALD 

President of the California Mission 

I am grateful, my brothers and sisters, for this opportunity of 
bringing to you and to this conference a report of the California Mis- 
sion. I bring to you the greetings of your sons and daughters who are 
serving as missionaries in that great mission. They are well ; after some 
sickness which has prevailed with us during the past few months, I am 
happy to report that all the missionaries are enjoying the best of health, 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Dag 

and are prosecuting their work with diligence and energy in carrying 
forward the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I want to endorse the remarks that have been made here by Presi- 
dent Bryant S. Hinckley and President Thomas D. Rees, as to the value, 
to these young men and women, of this opportunity that has come to them 
to serve in the mission field. This splendid group who form this choir 
that has rendered so beautifully for us today, I hope that in each of 
their lives, it shall be their plan and program to serve in the mission 
field. There is no experience that can come to a young man or woman 
that shall be of such value and interest to them throughout their lives 
as the experiences gained in the mission field. 

We came to this earth for experience, and that is all we will take 
out of it. So I hope it shall be the ambition of every young man 
and woman in the Church to go on a mission. I hope you mothers 
and fathers, you presidents of stakes and bishops of wards, will see to it 
that those under your care, (you who are stewards over them) shall 
have this privilege. See that they are not cheated out of this golden op- 
portunity. 

I am glad to report that the work in the California Mission is 
progressing and growing. Nine thousand four hundred Saints in that 
mission, which embodies three states, send greetings to this conference. 

We are grateful to the presidency of the Relief Society for the 
opportunity that was given our mission to bring our Singing Mothers to 
the Relief Society conference. Out of the scattered branches of that 
mission there have come to this conference more than two hundred 
of these Singing Mothers who have been trained by Sister MacDonald. 
We are grateful also to Sister Evangeline Beesley, for her capable 
leadership and direction in the singing of these women. 

I have not time to give to you the remarkable experiences and 
sacrifices made by these splendid Latter-day Saint women who came at 
great sacrifices and for long distances. They are thrilled with this op- 
portunity of attending a General Conference of the Church, and of 
participating in the blessings that belong to Latter-day Saints. 

The baptisms in the California Mission have increased sixty per 
cent over last year, which is evidence of the energetic work of your boys 
and girls in the mission. More than twelve thousand copies of the 
sacred record, the Book of Mormon, have been distributed this year. 
I am happy to bring you the indication that the people of the world are 
seeking after the very things that make the Mormon Church different. 
One of the interesting things that are attracting attention and unlock- 
ing the doors to the missionaries is the Church Welfare program. The 
fundamentals, the temporal things, about which our Church is concerned, 
plus the fine standards set by our people, are attracting intelligent men 
and women. 

I believe that we should be more concerned, and be prepared so we 
shall be ready to receive the good men and women when they come to 
accept the Gospel. There is such an indication of interest among the 



ELDER W. AIRD MacDONALD 



77 



people who are now seeking after the finer things that the Gospel em- 
bodies, I tremble sometimes lest we shall not be qualified to uphold our 
standards. I would like to exhort Latter-day Saints to a re-reading of 
the forty-second Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which, at 
one of the first conferences of this Church, when the missionaries had 
been called in, and with the Elders assembled together, the Prophet 
Joseph stood before them, and in the majesty and power that was given 
him, spoke this great message. The Lord spoke to the Elders of the 
Church and outlined their duties, and then he said : "Now I speak unto 
the Church." Orson Pratt, that great missionary Apostle, tells us that 
he sat there in that great audience and wrote that great revelation as it 
fell from the lips of the Prophet. 

The Lord there tells the Saints what is necessary for them to do ; 
to be true ; to be honest, as has been outlined here by Apostle Albert E. 
Bowen today. They shall not steal and they shall not lie, they shall not 
commit adultery, they shall love their wives and cleave unto them and 
none else. The Lord here outlines the fundamental virtues that are 
necessary in the process of making Latter-day Saints out of converts 
to this Church. 

So I submit, brothers and sisters, the re-reading again of the Lord's 
admonition to Latter-day Saints. 

I bring you the announcement that the Book of Mormon has now 
been translated into the Armenian language, and that under the direction 
of Apostle John A. Widtsoe, Brother N. K, Sheranian, one of . our mis- 
sionaries, has completed the first printing and publishing of the book 
into this language. The Nephite record is now to be given to the scat- 
tered Armenian people. 

I am happy to say that in all the organizations of the Church in 
the California Mission the work is being carried on in our small branches 
as nearly as possible as it is outlined by the General Authorities of the 
Church. I bear testimony that this is the work of the Lord, that Joseph 
Smith was in reality a prophet of God. I sustain wholeheartedly, and 
I bear record, that our leaders today are inspired men. They have the 
inspiration of the Lord to direct this work. I pray that the Lord will 
bless us as a people, that we may stand firmly together and uphold the 
principles that have been given us ; that by our lives, and the works we 
do, we shall preach the Gospel to the children of men ; and that the honor- 
able men of the earth seeing our good example may be led to investigate 
and be brought to a knowledge of the truth. 

May the Lord add his blessings to us, I pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



An anthem, "Sing for the Fallen Brave" (Wheeler), was sung by 
the Choir. 

Elder Joseph Anderson, Clerk of the Conference, offered the closing 
prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Satardag, October S Second Dag 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock, with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The musical exercises for this session were furnished by the 
Moroni High School Choir. 

The Choir and congregation sang as an opening number, "We 
Thank Thee, O God, For a Prophet." 

Elder Arthur C. Brown, President of the Millard Stake offered 
the opening prayer. 

The Choir then sang the anthem, "Inflammatus." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are very thankful indeed to the Moroni High School Choir for 
coming here and singing for us. We enjoyed very much their singing 
this morning. Considering the small population of the town of Moroni 
we certainly feel to congratulate the people there on their fine choir, 
their good singers, and their school. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters: As all of you know, this is an extremely 
important position to hold at this time. None of us come here do so 
without carefully thinking of what we may have to say, what we would 
like to say or what we ought to say, and we dread a good deal about it. 

You brethren and sisters who are here, and the many more who 
are listening come because you want comfort, you want encouragement, 
you want strength, you want instruction relative to your duties as they 
appear at the present time, and those of us who occupy this position 
have a great deal of responsibility in that connection. 

I have committed to writing a few things that it occurred to me I 
might say. I hope that any words I may say will give no offense, be- 
cause it is my thought only to say things that are helpful without com- 
plaint or without fault-finding. 

BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM 

In the early beginning of this dispensation, speaking by revelation to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said: "Hearken and hear, O ye 
inhabitants of the earth. Listen ye elders of my Church together, and hear 
the voice of the Lord ; for he calleth upon all men, and he commandeth all 
men everywhere to repent." D. & C. 133 :16. 

In a former day when the Master lived on the earth, among other 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



79 



things in his great sermon on the Mount he said : "Wherefore by their 
fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto me Lord, Lord, 
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my 
Father which is in heaven." Matt. 7 :20, 21. 

As an illustration of the meaning in these sayings of Jesus, the Apos- 
tle James wrote : "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he 
hath faith and have not works ? Can faith save him ? . . . . Yea, a man 
may say, thou hast faith, and I have works; shew me thy faith without 

thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works Wilt thou 

know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead ?" James 2 :14, 18, 20. 

And so may we not think of the gospel, the gospel the elders of the 
Church are called to preach, as being a gospel of faith, repentance, and 
work? Certain is it that work — an application in our daily lives of the 
principles we teach — is an essential of our religion. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS SHOULD LIVE UP TO PROFESSIONS 

The thirteenth article of faith proclaims that "we believe in being 
honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. 
. . . ." Hence a faithful and worthy Latter-day Saint must be character- 
ized by the virtues named in this article of our faith. Our doctrine of 
work as an essential of salvation makes this imperative. 

Now, to believe, to profess a faith, may be easy; to do, is always 
more or less difficult, so difficult at times that none of us is perfect in all 
things. 

SATAN SEEKS TO OVERCOME SAINTS 

Our theology makes clear to us why mortal man fails to reach per- 
fection. Satan is here and ever more or less near each one of us. 
Further, none of us has entirely succeeded, as Jesus did, in putting 
Satan completely behind him. In the Middle Ages when knighthood 
was in flower, fighting men encased themselves in metal armaments. 
When in combat they would try to strike opponents in the weakest parts 
of their armor. Satan tries to do the same thing when attempting to 
overcome us : he tempts us in our most vulnerable places. In other words, 
he tempts us in ways that are hardest for us to resist. 

Satan and his hosts were cast out of heaven after the great rebel- 
lion and came down to earth where they have since lived. In conse- 
quence, evil is in the world. The devils are here to bring pain and sorrow, 
distress and suffering, misery and death to the human family. They 
are here making efforts to thwart and overcome the work of the Lord. 
This could be most readily done by destroying the Saints of God. Hence 
wherever the Saints are Satan is not likely to be far away. 

To keep these thoughts in mind may be helpful. The situation is 
sueh that each one of us must ever be on his guard ready to ward off the 
attacks of the angels of darkness. 

And now another point: our theology teaches us that we once all 
lived in a pre-mortal spirit world. We are spirit children of God, our 
Father in heaven. A law of creation in the realm of life is that like begets

like. Since intelligence is the glory of our Father, we his children pos- 
sess at least in embryo a spark of this glorious attribute. We were 
favored with the high privilege of coming to earth as a necessary step 
in the long path of eternal progression. But the rate of advancement 
depends upon us. There is from heaven no compulsion in the matter, for 
the principle of free agency given by the Father to all his children, oper- 
ates in the premises. But to please God we must try to develop our 
intellects and grow in knowledge and understanding, wisdom and power, 
and cultivate our wills by resisting evil and doing good. 

THE GOLDEN RULE NOT OPERATING IN WORLD STRUGGLES 

What do I mean by the expression "doing good ?" The Master made 
the meaning clear when he gave us the Golden Rule, the rule that applies 
and makes visible in our lives the observance of the two great command- 
ments, the keeping of which will ornament any human life and render it 
saintly. 

But the chaos existing in the world today is abundant proof that the 
Golden Rule plays little or no part in the affairs of men or nations. 

Looking out into the world, what do we see ? Struggle, struggle and 
still more struggle — men everywhere striving for position, for mastery, 
for power, for rule — to get into a position to dictate to their opponents 
the terms of settlement. So fierce and general have the struggles become 
that chaotic conditions prevail everywhere — at home as well as abroad. 

Overseas it is the struggles of nations that fix our attention. In our 
own fair land we are disturbed by myriads of strikes and lockouts, indus- 
trial disputes, struggles of class against class, groups against groups, 
parties against parties, etc., in great number. In all of these cases clever 
propaganda, accompanied by some type of force, are the weapons of the 
struggles. 

To see all of these things makes us fear and tremble for the morrow, 
for it is evident that a mighty revolution is in progress the end of which 
will be a profoundly different America from the historic country we 
received from the founders of the Republic. In those days the patriots 
fought against taxation without representation, the fight being the spark 
that set the revolution aflame. Today we fight for representation without 
taxation. We struggle for all the advantages of a benevolent government, 
set up by ourselves, made rich by the strong arm of the law seizing what- 
ever it can from him who has. 

We fight against being taxed, but demand more and more of the 
benefits that taxes provide. Is this not a struggle to get something for 
nothing, at least to get more and more for less and less ? 

We listen to smooth-tongued demagogues, accept as truth their wild 
vagaries and enthusiastically follow their cunning and selfish leadership. 
Why? Is it not in the hope of getting for ourselves more and more 
for less and less ? We become adherents of various groups, pay member- 
ship dues, sometimes participate in disturbances, and. engage in various 
other kinds of activities. Why? Is it not in the hope of getting more 
and more for less and less ? 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

In all of these things do we stop to ask ourselves if our conduct 
squares with the thirteenth article of our faith ? We profess to hate com- 
munism and fascism and stoutly deny that we would give the slightest 
support to either of these isms. Do we ever stop to think that in many 
respects these isms have much in common and that many of the things 
we do are heartily supported by communists who see in them an applica- 
tion of communistic principles? We are willing to overthrow some of 
our established methods and institutions, apparently without realizing 
that in so doing we take step after step that brings us nearer and nearer 
to communistic objectives. 

Our moral standards appear also to be changing, in many respects 
becoming weaker and lower. This is perhaps more apparent in our group 
and national conduct than in our individual actions. Of what group or 
nation can it be longer said it's word is as good as its bond? During 
recent years we have seen nations default on their pledges, fail in their 
promises and entirely ignore their solemn commitments. The situation 
has become so bad that nations today put little or no trust in each other's 
commitments. The United States, China, Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, 
many private investors, and others have learned this to their sorrow. 

Two years ago a great industrial disturbance of the Pacific Coast 
began about this time of the year. It continued for 98 days, and cost, 
it was said, about seven hundred millions of dollars. What came out 
of it? Ill-will, misery and hatred. What was the weapon used in the 
struggle? Force. And force is, and always has been, the weapon of 
Satan and his helpers. It was the weapon he proposed in the great 
council in heaven that he would use to save all the Father's children. It 
is the weapon still used by all the Father's children who permit themselves 
to be influenced by this crafty enemy of all righteousness. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I refer to these things because I think our 
attention should be called to them. To me the outlook is anything but 
pleasant. If I see aright, we are traveling towards more and more 
chaotic conditions. Selfishness in the individual and in his group rela- 
tions appear to be getting more and more pronounced. And where 
selfishness is strong love is weak. These two qualities cannot be boon 
companions nor dwell together in harmony. 

Needless, almost, to say this to Latter-day Saints. We readily grant 
it is true. But do we profess love and practice selfishness ? Few people 
among us today sympathize with communism, an ism of selfishness. But 
does this not make the situation all the more dangerous, when what we 
do establishes communistic principles? 

I said selfishness — that quality of character that demands more and 
more for less and less — and love cannot dwell together in harmony. I 
mean of course that type of love that finds application in the Golden 
Rule. Neither can love and injustice go hand in hand. The great 
Welfare Program of the Church seeks to exalt love and subdue selfish- 
ness. Would that this Godly plan were more widely in operation ! 

Force as an instrument in human relations is absolutely banned by 
the teachings of the Master. Satan's proposal to use it to bring back to

heaven all the earth-children of the Father was rejected and the* doctrine 
of free agency proclaimed. In Christ's Church compulsion of the human 
will is unknown. 

DUTY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I have used the word selfishness in 
its most general sense, not as applicable to you fine men and women who 
are here, the cream of the Church, the officers of the Church, the leaders 
in all the departments of the Church. In your lives you are as a light 
set upon a hill, but I am speaking of conditions in general, and what would 
I have us do, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ? I would have us do what I think we ought to do. 

Now I use that word "think." The Lord has given us intelligence, 
as his spirit children we possess it for a purpose, and I think he has 
given it to us to be used. I think, brethren and sisters, in this chaotic 
world in which we are living that it behooves each one of us to use all of 
the intelligence that God has given us ; study all propositions that come 
to us ; study every appeal that is made ; study everything that is proposed, 
and with God's help, on our bended knees, seeking his guidance and the 
inspiration of his Spirit, try to find out what he would have us do, and 
when we can determine that conscientiously, to the; very best of our 
ability, act accordingly. But in our actions we may, if we care to, get 
some guidance if we will look to the head of the Church. We held up 
our hands here the other morning to support President Grant as a 
prophet, seer, and revelator. Are we willing to follow him, and to fol- 
low his advice, and to take his suggestions, or will we let them pass into 
one ear and out of the other? Not you, brethren and sisters, who are 
here, but some members of the Church who are not here, some possibly 
who may be listening at this moment to what is being said here. 

I think, my brethren and sisters, we ought to be consistent. I think 
the Lord expects us to be consistent. We are to be sincere in the profes- 
sions of our faith and make our conduct square with our professions. 
If we do that, brethren and sisters, the people of this Church will stand 
up and we will be a light to all the world. There will be, so far as we are 
concerned, a peace and a security, there will be a love among us, there 
will be no class distinction, we will all be brothers and sisters, we will all 
be devoted to each other's interests, and we will be loyal and true to the 
leadership of this Church. 

May God help us to be that, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very sorry that we shall have to limit our Mission Presidents in 
the length of their remarks. We should really like to hear them speak 
fifteen or twenty minutes each, but we have to ask them to stay within 
the limit of ten minutes. Our conference is just half through, and we 
have not heard from half of this body of speakers. 



ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT

ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

Former President of the Mexican Mission 

My dear Brethren and Sisters : I assure you of my humility in at- 
tempting to utilize part of your time again. I realize the responsibility 
involved in taking part of the time of this great congregation, and I shall 
not speak long this afternoon. I merely wish to thank you and the lead- 
ers of the Church and our Heavenly Father, in your presence, for the 
opportunity of service that has been mine in the mission field. 

During the past nearly five years it has been my privilege to serve 
in the Mexican Mission among a people that I love. It has been my op- 
portunity during that time to labor with many of your sons and daugh- 
ters, a privilege that I esteem above everything else. I feel that my life 
has indeed been enriched. 

I endorse heartily the remarks of President Hinckley and of Presi- 
dent Rees with regard to the benefits reaped by your sons and daughters 
through service in the mission field. I exhort you, as did President Mac- 
donald this morning, to look toward the sending of your sons and daugh- 
ters into the mission field. No finer experience can come to them, I as- 
sure you. I appreciate fully the advantage and the progress that the 
missionary has in the mission field. I realize what this missionary system 
means to the Church, the advancement and the growth that come to the 
Church through the experience and the progress of the individual mis- 
sionaries as they return to the Church, but I wish to sound one note of 
warning : Let not this be our purpose in sending out missionaries. 

The Master said : "He that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that 
loseth his life for my sake shall find it." Let this be our guiding spirit 
in sending forth our missionaries. Let them go forth not so much for 
the benefit that they may reap, or the benefit they may bring home to us 
as an organization, but let them go forth rather to serve the Master, and 
in serving him serve their fellow men ; to take the Gospel, which is the 
power of God unto salvation, to those who are yet in darkness. I assure 
you that if they go forth in that spirit, reaping the benefit that they them- 
selves will reap, and reaping the benefits that we as an organization in 
sending them forth shall reap, we will all be greatly blessed. 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I know that 
God lives, that Jesus the Christ was sent by the Father and gave his life 
that we might live again. I know that his Gospel has been restored 
through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and I bear 
you my solemn testimony before my Heavenly Father that I know that 
the present leadership of the Church is truly inspired, that it is authorized 
to lead us in the path of righteousness. 

Let us take seriously the advice that we are receiving at this con- 
ference, and .go forth with a renewed determination to practice the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel and to live in accordance with the advice of our in- 
spired leadership. 

May this be our lot, I pray in Jesus' name, Amen. 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Dag 

ELDER LeGRAND P. BACKMAN 

Former President of the South African Mission 

My beloved brothers and sisters, I deem this a real privilege, to 
stand before you this afternoon, and I pray that the inspiration of my 
Almighty Father may be with me on this occasion. 

I bring to you the greetings of the members of the Church in the 
farthest mission of the whole world, with headquarters just fifteen 
thousand miles away. I can assure you, my brothers and sisters, that we 
have some of the finest people in the whole Church in the South African 
Mission. 

As I sat here today my heart went back to my mission field, and I 
thought of the many hearts that yearn for the privilege of coming here, 
to be here in the Tabernacle, to see the Temple, and to hear the inspired 
words of our leaders. Oh, how our people down there long for that, be- 
cause up to the present time they have had no General Authorities of the 
Church visit that great land. I realize that South Africa is a long, long 
ways away from headquarters, and we only have a little over two million 
white people in the whole of the country, but nevertheless in our work " 
with the white people in that land we have found them the finest people 
that I think we can find anywhere in the world. 

It seems that the people of South Africa are filled with the spirit of 
pioneering. They are open-minded. They are free to hear the truth, and 
I believe that we are showing wonderful progress in that great land. 

Just a little over a year ago I was in Rhodesia, near the great battle 
fields where conflicts between the British and some of the Kaffir tribes 
took place not so many years ago. On a little farm called "Fern Creek 
Farm," away up in that Rhodesian country, we have two families of 
members. We went to one of their homes one night, and there held a 
meeting. They had no electric light. We held our meeting by candle- 
light. There were just the four members of the Church and Sister 
Backman and two of the missionaries and myself. 

The old man and old woman, Brother and Sister Viljoen, could 
not speak a word of English, and so Brother Jubber acted as interpreter. 
After Sister Backman and the two missionaries spoke, he interpreted to 
them what had been said, and then I got up and spoke, and talked for 
some time, and as I noticed their faces I could see them light up 
with understanding, and they knew what I was saying. When I got 
through Brother Jubber said : "Shall I interpret what Brother Backman 
has said ?" They said : "No, we understood every word the President has 
said to us." 

I am just mentioning this, my brothers and sisters, to let you know 
that in the farthest outposts of the Church our people are blessed with 
the same spirit and the same inspiration that we have throughout the 
world among those that are true Latter-day Saints, and indeed we have 
true Latter-day Saints in that land. 

I have had the great privilege of seeing a wonderful progress of the 



ELDER 0. F. URSENBACH 



85 



Church in South Africa, because in 1915, when I went out to South 
Africa on my first mission, I was held prisoner on a boat in Durban Har- 
bor for three days because I was a Mormon missionary, and now, when 
I returned again to preside over that mission, after an absence of sixteen 
years, I saw that most of the prejudice had been done away with. The 
people were willing to listen to our message. In February of this past year 
we had the privilege of taking our chorus from the headquarters in Cape 
town and appearing in the City Hall of Capetown with the Cape Town 
symphony orchestra, and several of the outstanding artists in Cape 
Town assisted us in a fine program. 

I am just bringing this to your attention to let you know that as far 
as South Africa is concerned, prejudice is almost done away, and we are 
meeting some of the finest and some of the best people in that land, and 
they are willling to hear our message, and they are willing to give us of 
their hospitality, for which they are so well known. 

I thank God with all my heart for the wonderful privilege that has 
been ours during the last three and one-half years, to labor in that land. 
I love Africa because I know that is where I learned to know my God, 
where I learned to gain a testimony of this wonderful Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

I come back from the firing line of missionary work, filled with en- 
thusiasm for the work of the Lord. I know it is the grandest and the 
greatest philosophy in life, and I only hope and trust and pray that I 
might be able to continue to live as I know my Heavenly Father would 
have me live. I thank Him for this privilege. I thank the Presidency of 
the Church and the Authorities for the wonderful privilege that has been 
mine. 

The missionaries that have been with us have been all noble, wonder- 
ful boys. Forty of them have passed through our hands in the past three 
and a half years, and I can truthfully say not one of them has given us 
the slightest concern, and I am sure that that is a remarkable record. 

May God's choicest blessings be with us all, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER O. F. URSENBACH 

Former President of the French Mission 

My beloved brethren and sisters : I am exceedingly weak in standing 
before you. May I be a beneficiary of your faith. 

It gives me great joy to report briefly the French Mission, which, 
by the way, geographically I think is the largest mission in Europe, yet 
we have a membership of a little less than one thousand, about fifty-five 
per cent in Belgium, about thirty-five per cent in Switzerland, and about 
ten per cent in France ; but we have very lovely people, who have made 
sacrifices for the Gospel of our Lord, and are very devoted. In the mis- 
sion there is a group of young men and women missionaries that are 
very excellent. Many of them went into the mission fields not having a 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Day 

testimony of the Gospel burning in their hearts, and if they didn't find 
God in the wards and stakes at home, they have and are finding him in 
that field of labor. 

We have tried to inoculate into the hearts of these young people that 
they are ambassadors of life and salvation, representing the First Presi- 
dency of the Church and the Twelve Apostles, their stake presidents, 
their bishops, and their parents at home, and as such, putting them on 
their honor, we have expected them to be the missionaries that those who 
trust them think they are. It is surprising how this has worked in giving 
these young people a superstructure and a solidarity in presenting our 
Gospel message to the world. 

We are happy to report that in the last two years I think we have 
doubled baptisms of any preceding period of time in the history of the 
French Mission. We have done this following what we called a seven- 
point program that we presented to the Church, that it might be appro- 
priate here for me to review briefly. 

There have been too many people baptized in the missions who did 
not know what they were baptized for. We have found plenty of them, 
many of them, who have wondered why they were baptized members of 
the Church, and it is no wonder some of them don't remain. 

In the seven-point program the qualifications that we presented were, 

First : Do you accept, unreservedly, God the Eternal Father, a per- 
sonal being and Father of the human family ? 

Second : Do you accept the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ as 
being full and complete, and that when a man or a child is baptized for 
the purpose of removing from him the stain of Eden, the act automatical- 
ly denies the efficacy of the atonement of Jesus Christ? 

Third : Do you accept the doctrines and principles of faith, repen- 
tance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost? 

Fourth : Do you accept the fact of a universal apostasy in the Primi- 
tive church, necessitating a restoration of the Gospel? 

Fifth : Do you accept the fact that God and Jesus Christ appeared 
to Joseph Smith, and that later he was ordained to the Holy Priesthood 
and authorized to establish the Church of God on the earth in this dis- 
pensation ? 

Sixth : Do you unreservedly accept the law of tithing, as revealed 
from heaven for the upbuilding of the Lord's church in this dispensa- 
tion? 

Seventh : Do you accept the missionaries as being here with divine 
authority to preach the Gospel, to baptize for the remission of sins, and 
lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost? 

There was one Catholic family who, after thus being qualified, 
answered affirmatively and whole-heartedly to every question. I said to 
them : "Why have you not asked me for baptism ?" "Because," said they, 
"we have been waiting for you to ask us." I said : "That will not hap- 
pen. When you are ready for baptism you will ask me." The next Sun- 
day they applied for baptism, and they are good members of the Church. 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



87 



In this way of qualifying members, when we bring them into the 
Church we know they are coming in with a knowledge of what they are 
doing. 

I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the privilege of having 
served these four years in Europe. I am grateful for these young mis- 
sionaries who are over there representing some of you parents. I am 
grateful that the brethren have seen fit to send lady missionaries into the 
French Mission. I wish I had time to tell you just what these ladies are 
doing. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ, my brethren and sisters, is true. The 
Lord said, through his prophet: 

How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bringeth 
glad tidings and publisheth peace, and saith to Zion : The Lord reigneth ! 

I wish the world could accept this, the gospel of peace that we are 
proclaiming to the world. If they would accept Jesus Christ and his 
plan of peace, we would have no war and contention in the nations. 

Completing the passage : 

Thy watchmen shall lift up their voices, and together shall they sing ; 
for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord has brought again Zion. 

Go the length and breadth of the earth and see if the Latter-day 
Saints do not see eye to eye. I have had the privilege, my friends, of 
visiting groups of Latter-day Saints in nine different nations, and we 
see that they do see "eye to eye" — the same hopes, the same aspirations, 
the same principles of the Gospel, the same things that are characterized, 
as President Clawson said yesterday, by the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

I am going to close by quoting from the thirty-fifth section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. That will apply to us all. The Lord said to 
Joseph Smith: 

Keep all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; 
and I will cause the heavens to shake for your good, and Satan shall 
tremble, and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish. 

I wish we could take this to our hearts and know in our minds that 
we were keeping all of the commandments of the Lord, and not only 
part of them. If we would do this as a people I don't know what power 
and glory would come to us in excess of what we enjoy today. 

I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I bear my testimony to 
you of its divinity. It is the greatest thing in my life. 

May God bless you. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

Former President of the Canadian Mission 

I am indeed happy to have this privilege of speaking just a word to 
you at the conclusion of the mission from which we have returned so 
recently. The past three years have been one of the happiest periods of 
our lives, speaking of myself and family. I am convinced that the mis- 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

sionary system of the Church is one of the finest institutions in our Church 
for building the testimonies of our young people, and keeping burning 
alive that testimony in the homes from which those missionaries come. 

When I think of the many young men and women who came to the 
Canadian Mission and served while we were there, and saw their devo- 
tion to the work, the progress they made, the struggle many of them had 
to make to adjust to the new surroundings, and yet their willingness to 
go and do whatever was asked of them, and then to see the development 
made, the acceptance of responsibility, and the love that grew in their 
hearts for the cause they represented, and for the people among whom 
they labored, I say I am more convinced than I have ever been in my life, 
before, that this institution is of God. 

I enjoyed Canada and the Canadian people, a cultured, refined peo- 
ple. Bringing with them traditions from the Old World, they have been 
pretty well set in their ways. It is not infrequent that we would hear 
people who became interested in the Church say: "My folks have be- 
longed to this or that religion for generations and generations, and I feel 
that I should remain where my ancestors were." With those well set ideas 
it has been most difficult to get the Gospel clearly before them. Those 
who have been converted in the Canadian Mission are honest, true, de- 
voted. 

It is one of the oldest mission fields in the Church. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith himself went through part of eastern Canada, and when 
he departed from that mission I recall that he had a prayer in his heart 
that God would bless those people, that all may have their minds en- 
lightened and their understandings quickened, that they may be led to 
accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Followed by the Prophet were Brigham Young and his brother, 
Joseph Young. Then later Parley P. Pratt and many others of the stal- 
wart leaders of the Church went into that field, and they found many 
people receptive to the Gospel. It was in Toronto where a whole group 
joined the Church, and many of them came to Utah with the Saints. As 
nearly as I can discover, a large group joined the Church in Halifax and 
emigrated while the first companies of Saints were on the way to the 
West. Yet left behind in that country are scattered Saints here and there, 
with many pretty well organized branches of the Church, that are carry- 
ing on the work and finding joy and happiness in it. 

I enjoyed very much going through the mission with President 
David A. Smith, who has been recently appointed to preside over 
that mission. I was happy when he came, because of his understanding, 
and because the people loved him, and he loved them and'loved that work, 
for I love those people, and I am sure that the work will grow and pro- 
gress in that part of the vineyard. 

I am very grateful that during the past three years we have been 
privileged to build the first meeting house in the Canadian Mission. Many 
of those Saints who have been in the Church for thirty years, or more, 
have never been inside of a Latter-day Saint meeting house, and when 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



89 



we were told that we might build a meeting house, with a recreational hall 
and class rooms, I cannot explain to you people the joy and happiness that 
came to those people over the prospects. I understand that it is just about 
,completed now, and it will be the first time that those people will have the 
privilege of meeting in class-rooms, where they are not disturbed, and 
meeting in a meeting house where clubs and other kinds of meetings are 
not being held ; and I am sure that it will turn many peoples' attention to 
the Church. 

During the past summer we had the privilege of receiving a number 
of short-term missionaries, some of our school teachers, and they formed 
a wonderful addition to that mission. As they went about their work so 
earnestly and efficiently I could not help but think what a wonderful 
vacation it would be for many of our people, to go into the mission field 
for a short-term mission. If we had doctors and lawyers, business men, 
and school teachers, each would be able, possibly, to meet people in the 
profession to which he belonged, meet them on ground that he would be 
able to explain the Gospel to them. For it is not sufficient only to have 
the truth, but we must have the ability to explain that truth, and we must 
'in some way have the ability to remove the prejudice from the peoples' 
minds, in order to get them to see the truth as we have it for them. 

I believe that each man may meet those people of his own profession, 
in such a manner that the Gospel will be preached more efficiently than 
could be done by some one of another profession. It seems to me that 
some day it may be the case, that this work will become so prominent and 
so popular that all our people will desire to go and spread the Gospel to 
the world. 

We do have a wonderful thing, brothers and sisters, in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. When we have grown up in it, and have had all these fine 
conveniences, these beautiful buildings, with the Authorities of the Church 
' here to counsel with us, we sometimes fail to appreciate just what all these 
blessings are. If you go into the world and see people — just a little hand- 
ful of them, not enough to make the great program of the Church active 
as we have it here at home — and see the faithfulness and the devotion 
and the love of those people, I believe it creates within our hearts a greater 
love for the work and a greater appreciation of it. 

I shall be grateful all my life to my brethren who saw fit to let me 
fill this mission in the world. I am deeply grateful also for the com- 
panionship and for the support of the Authorities of the Church, of the 
missionaries, and of you parents, and for your fine attitude in this great 
missionary work. 

I sincerely pray that our Father in heaven will bless this great Church, 
that we may stand unitedly together, working for the upbuilding of it, 
and that we may receive the blessings that the Lord has promised to us, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Dag 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 



Of the First Council of the Seventy 



It seems that the usual radio technique is grossly inadequate for such 
a time as this. By the forewarning of a chance meeting with President 
Grant last Thursday evening, I thought that perhaps the shock of what 
has befallen me would have been somewhat alleviated yesterday morning, 
when it was announced here, and also this moment, but such seems 
not to be the case. 

I spent a sleepless night Thursday night, burning old bridges and 
building new ones. I think that perhaps this call would have come easier 
to me a little later in life, after I had had a better opportunity to make 
substance of more of my dreams, but perhaps this is not so. Perhaps I 
must just exchange old dreams for new dreams. 

It is less than three weeks, during a nation-wide Tabernacle choir 
broadcast, that I read from this pulpit as follows : 

There are two things that enter into the life of every man : Those 
things which we plan for ourselves, and those things which enter into 
our lives in spite of all our plans. Sometimes, happily, we fare better 
than we had honestly hoped, and sometimes, unhappily, we find we fall 
far short of achieving those things for which we have striven. But no 
matter how well we seem to control those elements which affect our lives, 
there are always to be considered things unlooked for. Surely it must 
be better that way. It would be difficult to imagine a more unsatisfactory 
existence than the life of a man into which nothing unexpected ever came. 
Furthermore, it is all part of a great plan. The Lord still chasteneth 
whom he loveth, and all those things which come into our lives in spite 
of our best laid plans, are part of the education and enriching experience 
of every child of God who walks the earth. We may think what we would 
like for ourselves, and then, in the spirit of that resignation born of faith, 
we must reconcile ourselves at one time or another, to say as in the words 
of the hymn about to be sung, "I'll go where you want me to go, dear 
Lord ; I'll be what you want me to be." 

I knew, when I sent out these words to a nation-wide radio audience, 
that they were true, but I did not know that they would return home so 
quickly. It is a conclusive thing for a man to stand convicted by his own 
words, and I now so stand before you. 

My association with the General Authorities of the Church dates 
back to about eleven years ago, perhaps a little more, at which time I did 
not have a speaking acquaintance — with one exception, I think — with any 
of the General Authorities. At that time I found myself in the British 
Mission as a young man under twenty-one years of age and was aware 
of the penetrating eyes of Dr. James E. Talmage looking at me during my 
first meeting with him at a conference of the Norwich District, shortly 
after which I was called into the European Mission offiice at Liverpool 
and became associated with him in the editorship of the Millennial Star. 
Under his tutelage I found myself squirming at times, but nevertheless 
greatly benefited by his rigid scrutiny and exacting requirements. It 
was a good experience. And I love and honor the memory of the man 
who so painstakingly troubled himself to train me in ways of precision 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS

and exactitude, when of ttimes it would have been much less trouble for 
him to have done the task in hand himself. 

That was followed by the coming of Dr. John A. Widtsoe, and I 
learned more from him. The rapidity with which he worked, the breadth 
of his knowledge and abilities, his power to use other men and to help 
them realize themselves were a source of constant inspiration. 

Under him I later became secretary of the European Mission and 
visited countries from the Mediterranean up to beyond the Arctic Circle, 
and my heart is filled with thanks to him also for his. belief in a young 
man. 

Since that time it has been my privilege to become acquainted with 
all of the General Authorities of the Church, and their lives have been 
a testimony to me, because I know that they would not be doing the things 
they are doing, and would not have left the things they have left, to do 
the things they are now doing, except that they know of a surety that this 
is the work of the Lord, and must go forward. 

I have been very grateful for the opportunity of engaging in the radio 
activity that it has fallen to my lot to be engaged in. One of the greatest 
satisfactions of my life is to read the letters that come in every day, 
week after week, from people who listen to the nation-wide program 
from the Tabernacle each Sunday morning, and who find their lives 
touched by the spirit of it, and find cause to inquire further. 

I have known of some conversions that have come directly from this 
program, resulting in baptisms into the Church, which is an experience 
that I did not have the joy of observing in the mission field as a direct 
result of my own efforts. 

I know that tens of thousands more, from the character of the mail 
that comes in, must be deeply touched by the things that go from here 
each Sunday morning on the Tabernacle Choir broadcast. The music 
of the choir and the organ prepares the hearts of those who listen for 
the reception of the spoken messages, and it is very encouraging to me 
to realize that a truth does not need to be shouted to be appreciated — - 
that a truth quietly spoken has much greater effect than an untruth 
shouted from the housetops. 

It has been a gratifying experience to me to be associated in the 
editorship of The Improvement Era. I struggled with myself for more 
than six months from the time the Presidency first called me over and 
suggested that I take the editorship of this magazine, until the time that 
it was actually undertaken. They did not make their request in the 
nature of a call. They left it entirely to my judgment, and it took me six 
months to reach the conclusion that they would not have called me over 
there if they had not wanted me to do it ; but this realization finally settled 
upon my consciousness and I made the change — for what reason I did 
not know at the time. I was very grateful that the Presidency have left 
me some radio activity, because it has meant much to me and I feel that 
the results are gaining. 

I spent a good part of the day yesterday trying to find sympathy 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

from some of these my brethren, the General Authorities, who are sitting 
around me here. I found none, so I decided to like what has befallen 
me. President Clark told me yesterday morning that they had all been 
through it, and I might just as well cheer up. I reminded him that he 
had not been called into the work at my age, and President McKay, sit- 
ting by him, reminded me that he had ; and President Grant reminded 
me also that no one who ever wanted one of these positions ever got one. 
So with all these unanswerable rebuttals, and finding no sympathy, I have 
sincerely decided to like my lot. 

At an annual testimony meeting of the General Board of the Young 
Men's Mutual Improvement Association some months ago, I stated that 
the two paramount immediate ambitions I had were to assist in the editing 
of the best Church magazine in the world, and to assist in the production 
of what I hoped to be the best Church radio program in the world. So far 
as I am aware, my immediate ambitions have not changed. My remote 
ambitions will either have to be abandoned or await the direction of 
these my brethren, in whose keeping I find myself, and whose associa- 
tion I love, and whose judgment I trust. 

I keep in my desk a comment by Abraham Lincoln to the effect that 
he who molds public sentiment does more than he who enacts laws or 
hands down decisions. I find that to be true ; I believe it to be true, and 
I believe that we in this Church must use every means that is available 
for molding public sentiment for truth, both within and without the 
Church. That is why I have been particularly happy with both my radio 
activity and editing experience, because I believe the press and the radio, 
combined, are the greatest and most effective means today of molding 
public sentiment, and we must use them to the utmost, because we must 
keep in mind that the same facilities that are being used to build public 
sentiment for truth are also being used to build public sentiment for 
untruth. 

I have often pondered, in my own mind, the reasons why our mis- 
sionary results have not been comparable to those of the early missionaries 
to Great Britain, into which history I delved at some length in the im- 
mediate past. When I learned of penniless missionaries converting 
whole communities and baptizing thousands of souls, I was worried and 
puzzled in some respects, wondering what was lacking in that we are not 
doing the same today. I have subsequently concluded that there are at 
least two partial explanations. One is that the Lord advised the Prophet 
in that day that the field was white and ready to harvest, and indeed it 
was. Another is that our advantages today are comparatively not as 
great, or not as much greater than theirs, as it would seem, because we 
must keep in mind that every means that is being used for the promulga- 
tion .of the truth is also being used for the promulgation of untruth. 

That is why we must not be found sleeping at any time. That is why 
we must be diligent with every means at our command, to use all 
modern facilities with greater intelligence, with greater foresight and 
with greater effectiveness. This we will do increasingly, I feel sure.

Those who were close to my feelings yesterday morning before 
the announcement of my appointment to the First Council of Seventy 
was made at this conference were aware that if there had been any way 
to turn back in honor I would have done so, but I do not know to what 
point I would have turned back, and I realize keenly that there was no 
turning back — that turning back would have been turning away. 

If I had been of a mind to turn back I should have done it at my 
mother's knee. I should have done it before she taught me to pay out 
my first few pennies in tithing. I should have done it before her firm 
and gentle hand directed my steps into the ways of truth. I should have 
done it before I came up through the auxiliary organizations of this 
Church ; before I went on a mission ; before I went into the service of 
the Mutual Improvement Association and The Improvement Era. It 
was only necessary for me to think quietly for a few moments to see 
that there is no turning back for a Latter-day Saint, and he who thinks 
there is, finds himself not turning back but turning away. I think that 
lesson may well come into the lives of all of us. 

I am grateful for the opportunity to serve. I have appreciated the 
kindness, the fatherliness of President Grant, President Clark, Presi- 
dent McKay, Dr. Widtsoe, Brother Bowen, and all these brethren. They 
have all been kind, considerate and helpful to me. My own father died as 
the result of an accident when I was ten weeks old. My mother reared a 
family of nine children, all of whom at that time were under eighteen. 
With a meager and unreliable income, she immediately sent my eldest 
brother on a mission. Such faith as that in the home in which I was reared, 
could only produce one result, and the result is that all of my nine brothers 
and sisters have come up through the program of the Church to be a 
credit to my mother and to all that this Church stands for. 

I am very grateful for all of these things, and with your confidence 
and the help of the Lord and the advice and encouragement of these my 
brethren, I hope that I shall not be an unprofitable servant. 

;I know, as well as I know any of the facts of life, that Jesus was 
the Son of God, the Redeemer of this world ; that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the Lord, as have been all his successors ; and that this is the 
work of the Lord. 

The young men of the Church are my friends. They belong to my 
generation. I know them. They have their difficulties, their problems, 
their struggles, economically and otherwise, but I have no fear for their 
integrity or their ability. I have no fear for their willingness to serve 
as the years roll along. I know that they say in chorus : "Our hearts 
are not turned back, neither have we departed from thy way," and that 
is my expression also, in their behalf. 

I ask the blessings of the Lord upon all of us, and I do it in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Associate to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a source of joy to me, my brethren and sisters, to be with you 
in this conference, to participate in the exercises, and to partake of the 
spirit of the meetings we have held. I endorse the remarks that have 
been made and the testimonies and instructions that have been given. 

I sense the sacredness of the important calling that has come to me 
in the past six months. You may realize that this call was as unexpected 
to me as it was to you. It was farthest from my thoughts. A large part 
of my life has been spent, so far as church work has been concerned, in 
the practical and temporal affairs of the Church ; and it means quite 
a change to devote myself primarily to spiritual and Gospel advance- 
ment, and, more directly, to the preaching of the Gospel. 

MISSIONARY EXPERIENCES 

I have spent five years of my life in the preaching of the Gospel 
abroad, and I may say to you that they were among the happiest years 
of my life. I was sent on my first mission some thirty-nine years ago, 
and about one and one-half years after my arrival there, when I was 
presiding over the Netherlands-Belgium Mission, I had the pleasure 
and privilege of meeting with President Francis M. Lyman of the 
European Mission, and many of the missionaries of the mission over 
which I was then called to preside. At that time President Lyman 
invited us to pledge ourselves anew to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, not only while we were on our mission, but through- 
out our lives, that we would undertake to be true to the Gospel, and 
active in its service throughout our lives. That was a very remarkable 
pledge, in many ways, and I took it seriously. I made the pledge and I 
have endeavored to live in accordance with that covenant and to give of 
my best efforts from that time to the present. In the thirty-nine years 
that have passed from that time to this I have had responsibilities placed 
upon me in the stake presidency for twenty-one years and in the Pre- 
siding Bishopric for thirteen years. During that entire time I have 
been happy in giving my best efforts to advance the interests of this 
Church, and to seek to promote the welfare of all the people of the Church. 

TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH 

I sustain my brethren of the First Presidency, the Council of the 
Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric, all the 
stake presidencies, ward bishoprics, mission presidents, and all the 
members of the Church. I have great love for all of you. I realize that 
this work is the greatest cause in the world. It is the truth and it will 
endure and will accomplish its purpose, which is to bring about right- 
eousness and truth in the earth, and to bring to pass the'preparation for 
the reign of peace which is to come. 

I have great joy in these things. My testimony has increased from 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



day to day and from year to year. I have seen many evidences of the 
blessings of the Lord upon me and upon the people of this Church. I 
have had many answers to prayer. I have seen manifestations of the 
power of the Priesthood. I know that this work is divine. I testify 
to you that the Gospel has been restored through the revelation of our 
Eternal Father and his beloved Son Jesus Christ to Joseph Smith, 
followed by other divine revelations, and the restoration of the Holy 
Priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. I know that this 
divine authority to direct all the work of the Church, to perform all the 
ordinances of the Gospel, and to lead the Church in righteousness, has 
been given to men upon the earth, and that the men who have been 
called to preside over this Church from the beginning have been and are 
the Lord's anointed. 

I have had the pleasure of knowing five of the seven men who have 
presided over the Church. As a very young boy, I knew President Tay- 
lor. I had the pleasure of knowing him and seeing him in my father's 
home, of having him bless me because I was not very strong and vigorous. 
I have known every one of them to be inspired, to be fiilled with the 
power and ability that comes through the ordination of men to leadership 
in this Church. I sustain President Grant with all my heart, as I do all 
my brethren. I desire to be one with them in advancing every interest 
of this work. My heart is in it and I deire to be active and faithful 
and to qualify in largest measure for the responsibility that has come to 
me. 

EUROPEAN VISIT TO EXAMINE INTO BUILDING PROBLEMS 

As you realize, I have just returned, with Sister Cannon, after a trip 
of some nine weeks abroad in visiting the ten missions in Europe. I was 
called, under instructions of the First Presidency, to examine into the 
condition of the buildings in the various missions, and building prob- 
lems, and so I spent the time largely in doing that work. There are some 
difficult but important building problems that need prompt solution. I 
found that there are some thirty-three branch buildings owned by the 
Church in Europe. They are in varying conditions as to repair and suit- 
ability. None of them, I may say, has been designed or built in accor- 
dance with the standardized procedure we have adopted in the past few 
years in the work of the Presiding Bishopric's office in the wards and 
stakes. Half of the branch buildings in Europe are in Great Britain. In 
addition to the branch buildings in Europe there are four Church-owned 
buildings occupied as mission offices and homes in various missions. 

UNIFORM BUILDING POLICY NEEDED 

There are requests being made for additional buildings. In order to 
save unnecessary expense, and to secure the best results at minimum cost, 
there needs to be a uniform, definite, supervised policy established for 
the erection of buildings in the mission fields, which may be somewhat 
different from that in the wards and stakes, and yet will require great 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

care and planning and proper budgeting in order that such construction 
as may be undertaken will provide the most effective results and be with- 
in the available funds of the Church for that purpose. 

EFFICIENT EXPENDITURES OF TITHES 

I realize, as you do, that a large proportion of the funds of the 
Church comes from the tithes. The faithful membership of the Church, 
who are paying their tithing, realize that not only are they observing the 
commandment of the Lord in this respect, and enjoying the blessings that 
come through this commandment, which is a commandment with a 
promise, but they realize that in all the divisions and departments of the 
Church, the expenditures made from the tithes are being accurately, eco- 
nomically and efficiently handled. They appreciate the fact that well de- 
signed, appropriate buildings are being erected in the various wards at 
minimum costs and a maximum of economy, consistent with the condi- 
tions required. Naturally, in order to care for all the demands made up- 
on the Church, in every department, in its steady growth, there must be 
the greatest efficiency and economy possible to promote the greatest wel- 
fare. There should always be an attitude and feeling on the part of those 
who preside in the various wards and stakes and missions that they are 
willing to accept the advice, the suggestions and plans of those who have 
the responsibility therefor, in carrying out the work that needs to be done 
in all of these various divisions, and to avoid any extravagant or unneces- 
sary costs. 

I am sure that there can be considerable work done in the various 
missions in Europe, in addition to the missions in the United States and 
other parts of the world, that will enable us through proper planning and 
supervision, to obtain better results than we have had heretofore, and to 
maintain all buildings in such a way that they will be a credit and a pride 
to the Church. 

MISSIONARIES, OFFICERS AND MEMBERS FAITHFUL 

We had the pleasure of meeting with the mission presidents and with 
some of the missionaries in all the various missions. I attended some 
twenty public meetings while abroad, and also had the opportunity of 
counseling with the mission presidents and some of the missionaries in 
some of the missions. I wish to say to you that they are happy, and, with 
very few exceptions, are in perfect health, full of faith and courage and 
going forth to perform their duties and responsibilities. In my mission- 
ary experience I have found that, in general, the missionaries who spend 
the least money and accept the simple hospitality of the people, accomp- 
lish the most work, develop the greatest faith and obtain the greatest re- 
sults. This is in harmony with the word of the Lord : "Behold, I send 
you out to prove the world, and the laborer is worthy of his hire. . . And 
he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise 
lose his reward." (D. & C. 84 :79, 90.) 

I have been delighted also to find among the membership of the 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



97 



Church — the local brethren who bear the Priesthood — -an appreciation 
of their responsibility, a willingness to labor in humility, faith and devo- 
tion, and to become established in the duties, labors and responsibilities 
of the Priesthood. That is true in many of the branches in the various 
missions. 

In Berlin I had the pleasure of visiting three branch meetings one 
Sunday evening, and of partaking of the fine spirit. There were men 
there who were called as a district presidency — local men who have be- 
come established in the Church — and they are an upstanding, fine quality 
of men. 

In Belgium, about which President Ursenbach has spoken, where 
my first missionary labors were begun thirty-nine years ago in 1899, to- 
day they have three pleasant, suitable meeting houses ; and they have a 
district presidency and the presidency of each branch composed of local 
men, all of whom are measuring up in a fine way. I was greatly delight- 
ed to see the caliber and quality of these men who are doing the work. 
They are fulfilling the responsibility splendidly. 

GENERAL CONDITIONS IN EUROPE 

The conditions, of course, as you realize, in Europe are variable. In 
some of the nations there is perfect peace. The people are going about 
their business contentedly. Generally speaking, the agricultural, indus- 
trial and economic conditions are rather favorable. While, of course, 
there is considerable unemployment in most of the nations, still they are 
providing ways and means for those who are unemployed. Relief is 
generally handled entirely through Government sources. 

Holland and Denmark are exporting extensively food and dairy pro- 
ducts. Czechoslovakia has a variety of manufactures. The Czechs are 
called the "Yankees of Europe." Belgium has probably the greatest 
variety and extent of manufactures of any country in Europe. Switzer- 
land has made remarkable hydro-electrical developments. 

In Sweden, particularly, I may say that conditions look very satis- 
factory and prosperous, from an economic standpoint. The country of 
Sweden is being largely developed hydro-electrically from the extensive 
facilities available there. All of the railroads are operated electrically. 
They have a great resource in the fine quality of iron that is to be found 
in that country. Stainless steel is being manufactured in large quantities. 
They have developed, with very great success, both producer and con- 
sumer cooperatives, which are beneficial to the people generally. Their 
managed currency system has helped to stabilize prices. 

In Germany the people are actively engaged, under the direction of 
the German government, in various activities. Of course, a great deal 
of work is done in the service camps. All are occupied and busy. 

TWO MAJOR INFLUENCES AT WORK 

In visiting Europe and reflecting upon conditions there and else- 
where, I am reminded of the fact that there are two major influences at 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

work in the world of men. They are the influences of Good and Evil. 
They are diametrically opposite in character. The one is characterized 
in the highest degree by righteousness, justice, unselfishness, kindliness, 
love and peace. The other is evidenced by greed, selfishness, hatred, 
strife and lust of power. The first is personified by the Lord Jesus 
Christ, the second by the adversary of mankind. Under present condi- 
tions among mankind, the latter influence is more in evidence. As the 
Lord declared by revelation : "Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth 
forth deceiving the nations." (D. & C. 52 :14.) When Jesus was finish- 
ing his earthly minstry, he said : "Hereafter I will not talk much with 
you ; for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me." (John 
14:30.) Those two influences are manifest in the conditions which pre- 
vail in government, in industry, in business and in religion. 

TEMPTATIONS OF THE SAVIOR 

You remember the temptations which the Savior encountered at the 
hands of the adversary, after He had been baptized and had received the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, after he had fasted in the wilderness. 

And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was after- 
ward an hungered. 

And when the tempter came to him, he said : If thou be the Son of 
God. command that these stones be made bread. 

But he answered and said, it is written, Man shall not live by bread 
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 

Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a 
pinnacle of the temple, 

And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; 
for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee ; and in 
their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot 
against a stone. 

Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the 
Lord thy God. 

And then the last, and I think probably the greatest temptation, that 
which comes to mankind in large measure today and throughout the ages, 
as it came to the Savior : 

Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and 
sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them : 

And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall 
down and worship me. 

Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, 
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 

Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered 
unto him. 

TEMPTATIONS OF MANKIND 

It appears to me that these same temptations are being placed be- 
fore mankind today ; and to many they are too alluring to resist. Essen- 
tially, they are the temptations of the appetities, of pride and vanity, and 
of the lust of power. When men and women give themselves over to be 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



99 



influenced by their carnal desires, they can scarcely overcome the influ- 
ence of evil. Yet, every human being has within himself the power to 
walk in righteousness, if he will only give heed to the upright influence 
within him. All mankind have within them a spark of divinity. We are 
told that "the spirit of Christ giveth light to every man that cometh into 
the world." Again, "by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds 
are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and 
daughters unto God." It is important to be able to discern between right 
and wrong, and between good and evil. The observance of Gospel princi- 
ples enables the Latter-day Saints to enjoy the Spirit of truth, which 
serves as a guide to righteousness. 

HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS 

Now, it has been remarked here that one-third of the hosts of heaven 
rebelled against the Lord and stood with the adversary, in the pre-exis- 
tent state ; but the two-thirds remaining were either valiant in the cause 
of truth, in those pre-existent times, or they were neutral. At least they 
did not rebel, and so, all are heirs to this earthly existence. Every one 
of us inherits something of the characteristics of our earthly parents. At 
the same time we inherit something of the divine attributes. We have 
within us the opportunity to choose which we will do, which qualities we 
will develop — the positive, splendid, fine qualities of righteousness, jus- 
tice, love and kindliness, or the negative, degrading qualities of greed and 
lust of power. We should learn to be able to discern and select these 
finer qualities. As Latter-day Saints, it is our opportunity to exemplify 
these high principles, through obedience to the Gospel. So we should 
overcome greed or selfishness or the spirit of domination, and thus set 
the example to our fellowmen. Then we can put forth every endeavor 
to promote these same principles throughout the world, and thereby strive 
for peace and unity among men and nations. 

WHICH INFLUENCE WILL PREVAIL 

Which of these influences will triump in the earth ? Shall it be the 
spirit of justice and persuasion, or the spirit of domination and force ? 
Well, for the present the latter, but eventually, the former will prevail. 
We are told, in a revelation given by the Lord in 1831 : "The hour is not 
yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and 
the devil shall have power over his own dominion. . . . And also the Lord 
shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst." So that 
war is constantly in the air. While there are millions of people in Europe 
and in the United States and elsewhere throughout the world, who have 
in their hearts a desire for peace, and who exemplify, in some measure, 
at least, the qualities of righteousness and justice, yet there are those 
who dominate and bring about dictatorships such as we see in Europe 
today in some of the nations. 

• While the German people, as a whole, are a very fine people, and 
love peace, yet there are influences there which are stirring them up to 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 8 Second Day 

promote war and strife. The people of Czechoslovakia, so far as I have 
been able to observe them, are people who love peace ; but they are full 
of courage and they have a certain pride of race which in their situation 
leads them on to be prepared to defend themselves, if necessary, even in 
case of war. 

\ 

OUR PRIVILEGE AS LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

What is our privilege as Latter-day Saints ? First, to exemplify in 
our lives righteousness, justice, love and consideration for all men. Then 
to practice that instruction which the Savior gave to his Apostles : "What- 
soever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." 
Further, to encourage our fellowmen everywhere to live in conformity 
with these principles, and thereby promote peace, good will and pros- 
perity. Finally, to seek constantly the light and influence of the Holy 
Spirit, which leads to perfect unity. 

Now, as men bearing the Holy Priesthood, it is our responsibility 
to harmonize our lives and actions with these instructions, referred to by 
President Grant yesterday morning, that "no power or influence can or 
ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only by persuasion, 
by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, by love unfeigned; by 
kindness and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul with- 
out hypocrisy, and without guile. . . . Let thy bowels also be full of chari- 
ty towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish 
thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the 
presence of God ; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy 
soul as the dews from heaven." 

May the Lord help us to walk humbly, to deal justly, and to love 
mercy, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Brother Merrill remarked that each one who comes up here to speak 
has something thought out and prepared. I have been thinking pretty 
hard for two days, and I will have to confess that when I stand here be- 
fore you, whatever I have thought of leaves me. 

In the last April conference that the Prophet Joseph Smith ever at- 
tended, April, 1844, he made this significant remark : 

"I have received instructions from the Lord that from henceforth, 
wherever the elders of Israel shall build up branches and churches unto 
the Lord in the states, there shall be a stake of Zion." 

These words have been my inspiration since I have been in the mis- 
sion field. When I went out to succeed Brother Joseph Quinney, Jr., 
twenty months ago, I found a great many branches in the Northwestern 
States, and I found that about ninety per cent of the people out there had 
moved into that section from Utah and Idaho, and that they were pre- 
pared to govern themselves, 



ELDER PRESTON NIB LEY

I am happy that the President of the Portland Stake is here on the 
stand today, Brother M. L. Bean. The Portland Stake was organized 
out of our mission in June, under the direction of President David O. 
McKay and Brother Melvin J. Ballard, and the Seattle Stake was or- 
ganized out of our mission in July, under the direction of our honored 
President, President Grant, and Brother Ballard. 

We now have in process of growth probably five more stakes com- 
ing along in that mission, and I hope we can fulfill the words of the 
Prophet Joseph, that wherever the Elders of Israel shall build up 
branches unto the Lord, there shall be a stake of Zion. 

We continue to find many people in our mission who have not 
affiliated with the Church for years, and during the twenty months that 
I have been in the Northwest we have located forty-four groups of Latter- 
day Saints, numbering all the way from ten to one hundred, in forty-four 
different cities, where we have organized Sunday Schools and branches. 
These people had moved out in to that section, and had remained dor- 
mant until our missionaries found them. 

I want to say that your missionaries in the Northwestern States 
Mission are very fine young people. As far as I know, they all have a 
testimony of the truth of the Gospel. I saw some figures in the paper 
computing the cost of missionary labor, but brethren and sisters, although 
it may seem hard on you to send that money to your boys and girls, I 
want to tell you that it is money well spent, because they come home from 
their missions with a sound, solid testimony that this is the kingdom of 
God, and that the work they are engaged in is the truth. 

President Brigham Young once made this statement regarding a 
testimony : 

"The world, with all its wisdom and power, with all the glory of its 
kings and potentates, sinks into perfect insignificance compared with the 
simple, unadorned testimony of a servant of God." 

I glory in the work that is going on in our mission. I know that we 
are building up the kingdom of God, and I know that these troubles Bro- 
ther Sylvester Q. Cannon has been telling about will all be overcome by 
this great kingdom as it grows and progresses. To that point I want to 
cite you a statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith, made May 2nd, 1844 : 

"I calculate to be one of the instruments in setting up the kingdom 
of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that 
will revolutionize the whole world." 

And in the same sermon : 

"It will not be by sword or by gun that this kingdom will roll on. The 
power of truth is such that all nations will be under the necessity of obey- 
ing the Gospel." 

Brethren and sisters, our future and the future of this kingdom is 
very great. Our missionary work is prospering, and everything looks 
good, and we are all happy in the Northwest. 

May God bless you, Amen. 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 8 Second Day 

ELDER EL RAY L. CHRISTIANSEN 

President of the Texas Mission 

I pray, my brothers and sisters, that our Heavenly Father may con- 
descend to inspire me for the few minutes that I occupy here, that I may 
say something that will be worthy of your valuable time. 

I am thankful that I was endowed with the power to appreciate and 
be moved by good music. I want to commend those who have offered 
music during these sessions of conference ; those Singing Mothers the 
other day, the choir from Evanston, and these young people from 
Moroni. I have always been proud of the fact that I was born in San- 
pete County, and I thrill whenever any one from Sanpete County pro- 
duces something worth while. I am proud of these young people behind 
me. 

I am happy to report that your boys and girls in the Texas Mission 
are at this time well and happy, that their work seems to become more 
efficient and more effective from day to day. They have been instru- 
ments in the hands of the Lord in preparing more than twice as many 
converts for baptism this year as was the case in the same period of time 
last year. We are grateful to the Lord for his blessings in our behalf, 
and we feel that he is indeed blessing us in our work in that mission. 

I want to pay tribute to you mothers and you fathers who are so 
anxious that your boys and girls serve the Lord in honor; so anxious 
that they diligently go about their work from day to day ; and you wives 
— for we have a few Elders who are husbands of wives that were left at 
home. We have one very efficient man, nearly seventy years of age. He 
is there on a two-year mission. He reported in conference not long ago 
that at one time he felt a little bit blue, and wrote home to his wife and 
said : "Mother, I believe I am a little lonesome tonight." In a few days he 
got word back, a brief letter saying : "Dad, if you are lonesome you had 
better get to work." I want to meet that wife of that fine man. She is a 
champion. 

We find that thinking people are becoming intensely interested in 
the things that our Church is doing, and in the doctrine that it promul- 
gates. I am happy that we are able to contact people of concern, people 
in positions of responsibility, of leadership, executives, professional men, 
who are anxious to learn more of what we are doing here. 

The broadcasts that have come from this building have done a great 
deal to break down prejudice, as you have already been told. 

People want to know how it is that our Church has been able, in 
such a comparatively short period of time, to do the things that it has 
done. "Why is it," they ask, "that you Mormon people seem so confi- 
dent, seem to be so undisturbed ? What is wrong with my religion ?" My 
brothers and sisters, the answer is simple. We are guided by the light of 
the restored Gospel. You and I have the blessing and the privilege of 
hearkening to the counsels and admonitions and advice of the prophet of 
God and of his associates. We have inspired leaders with us today, just 



ELDER EL RAY L. CHRISTIANSEN 103 



as Christ's church has always had. We believe that the Lord meant what 
he said when he declared that, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but 
he revealeth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." It seems to me 
that unless the prophet of God is on earth today, His Church cannot be, 
for in all dispensations of time he has used his servants, the prophets, to 
carry on his work. 

I am proud to belong to a church and to be actively engaged in a 
church which is patterned after the Church of Christ in all dispensa- 
tions when it has been upon the earth. We think sometimes it would 
have been wonderful to have walked with Peter, and to have preached 
alongside of Paul, and to have been built up by their great spirit and 
their great testimony ; but I rejoice in the fact that we have that privilege 
just as surely today as we would have had, had we been with them in 
those days. 

We have received counsel and have been advised today and yester- 
day by the servants of God. I am glad that I can say that I am in whole- 
hearted support of that admonition and those counsels. "Where there 
is no vision," we are told, "the people perish, but he that keepeth the law, 
happy is he." 

My brothers and sisters, we should take that sound advice and put 
it into our lives. After what we have heard today I think we would be 
much like the man, as some one put it : "He who learns and learns, and 
never acts upon what he knows, is like the man who plows and plows 
and never sows." We would be foolish indeed, we are deceiving our- 
selves, if we know these things to be true, if we know that this admoni- 
tion and this counsel are of worth and are the means of our salvation, if 
we leave this building not having determined in our own minds to hearken 
unto them. 

Some one said : "Why is it that we need to be told to repent con- 
tinually?" There is only one answer, and that is that we are found in 
too much sin and waywardness. 

The belief in eternal progression of the individual is a thing which 
urges Latter-day Saints (who are true Latter-day Saints) to strive up- 
ward and onward at all times. The true Latter-day Saint knows that 
there is only one way to salvation. He knows that "there is a law, irre- 
vocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, up- 
on which all blessings are predicated, and when we obtain any blessing 
from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated," and 
we cannot get those blessings in any other way. 

They ask us why we are so undisturbed. That is the reason. We 
have the light of the Gospel, and we believe those things. Every Latter- 
day Saint believes that this is the time to prepare to meet his God. He 
believes that we are now in eternity. He knows that we don't have to 
wait until death and the resurrection, to enter eternity ; that we are now 
on that great long road, preparing ourselves to meet our God. He be- 
lieves, as Paul said, that "Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Dm} 

God dwelleth in you. If any man defile the temple of God, him shall 
God destroy." And he knows, as Nephi promised : 

"But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, 
they who believed in the Holy One of Israel, they who have endured 
the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they shall inherit 
the kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation 
of the world, and their joy shall be full forever." 

The answer is simple, as to why the Latter-day Saints seem undis- 
turbed in times like these. 

May God bless you and me to rise to the occasion and to honor the 
Priesthood, and to honor the Church, and to honor and love these wonder- 
ful men who are so inspired to lead us, I pray, in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There is one thing I want to say, and that is, do not forget to ob- 
serve the Sabbath day and keep it holy. 

Once more I express my appreciation of the singing that we have 
had here today, and also for the marvelous audience at the Elijah oratorio 
last night. 



The Choir sang an anthem, "Beside Still Waters," (Hamblen). 
Elder M. L. Bean, President of the Portland Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday, October 9 at 10 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Sunday rnorning, October 9. 

Every seat and available space in the great Tabernacle auditorium 
and galleries was occupied far in advance of the time to open the fifth 
session of the Conference. In addition, thousands of people who could 
not find accommodation in the Tabernacle congregated in the large Assem- 
bly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle, and on the Tabernacle 
grounds, where they listened, by means of amplifying equipment that 
had been installed, to the Conference proceedings as they were broadcast 
from the Tabernacle. 

President Heber J. Grant, who presided, called the meeting to order 
promptly at 10 o'clock. He announced that the. Tabernacle Choir with 
J. Spencer Cornwall conducting, would furnish the musical numbers 
for this session, and that the Choir and congregation would sing as the 
opening number, "How Firm a Foundation." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered \>y 
Elder Alexander Brown, President of the Seattle Stake. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

WORLD WAR BROUGHT HOPE 

Twenty-one years ago our fathers, brothers and sons were enlisting 
in the great struggle of the World War ; they were responding to the 
appeal that we were going to make the world safe for democracy, and we 
were led to hope and believe that it was the last great war, and the war 
to end war. 

When the war was over we saw nation after nation abandon their 
monarchial forms of government and become republics, patterned after 
this nation, and our hearts were full of joy at the prospect that at last 
democracy and peace were going to reign. 

QUICK RETURN TO WORSE CONDITIONS 

Since then we have been greatly disturbed to see nation after nation 
abandon its democracy and go back to a condition some of us think worse ' 
than the condition under the czars, the kaisers, and the rulers, into a 
dictatorship. Today we witness the nations of the earth spending more 
money than in any other time in their history in building equipment upon 
the sea and the land for future wars. It is a sad picture, and yet I sup- 
pose that our wish was father to our thought, and we had hoped to see 
the end of the struggle and strife in this world. 

GOSPEL ALONE CAN BRING PEACE 

But the Lord knew that there could be no peace only upon certain 
principles; peace could not come through treaties filled with hatred, 
malice, greed, and selfishness. Peace could not come through the might 
of armies, it can only come in one way. He offered that way one hundred 
years ago to the world, and more than sixty thousand missionaries of the 
Church have carried the message to the nations of the earth, offering 
them peace through the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, that makes for 
genuine real brotherhood. 

The Lord knew there would be only a few who would accept that 
message. The majority would reject it. He provided for the few a 
refuge of peace; but so far as the world is concerned he said — (I am 
reading from the 1st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants) : 

And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth : I the 
Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh ; 

For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know 
that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, 
when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power 
over his own dominion. 

And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign 
in their midst. 

Peace taken from the earth, and the devil having power oyer his 
dominion. During the last one hundred years, or since these words were 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

spoken, more light and knowledge has come into the world in the realm 
of science, through the laboratory, and otherwise, than in all the ages 
that have preceded it, and if this were all used for the alleviation of 
human suffering, peace and prosperity could be here, and poverty 
abolished. 

But when we see men and nations spending their wealth to use the 
gas engine, the laboratory, the air plane, as means of human destruction, 
surely the devil has seized the blessings and privileges the Almighty in- 
tended to use to bring about peace, and is using them to destroy that 
which he presently shall lose the right to rule over. If the devil is not 
in the character of warfare that goes over the front line trenches, swoops 
down upon the poor helpless women and children, drops its deadly bombs 
and. assassinates them, then I do not know anything that has ever hap- 
pened in this world that is so like the work of the devil as that. He is 
ruling in the midst of men. 

But it is not a picture that we need to be discouraged with. Hope 
is only to be deferred, for the promises shall be realized. 

PERILS TO OUR COUNTRY WILL COME FROM WITHIN 

I read again another word of warning, this from the 45th Section 
of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord said, con- 
cerning this nation or land of America, (reading from the 68th and 69th 
verses) : 

And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that 
will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion 
for safety. 

And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven ; 
and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another. 

Thank the Lord for that promise. I am not afraid of any foreign 
foe disturbing this nation. Our perils will all come from within. It 
is true the Prophet saw even the Constitution hanging as by a thread, 
but, thank the Lord, he never saw the thread break. He saw this people 
play a conspicuous part, to be a balance of power with others to preserve 
it. For after all, it is destined, according to the word of the Lord, to 
become the savior and blessing of all flesh, not only the peoples of the 
United States. And after the experiments with dictatorships and other 
methods, they will, at last, when they have learned their lesson and are 
prepared for it, be willing to receive the Lord's offering, after much 
suffering. 

They could have saved themselves all this, for if all the nations of 
the earth had received the message of the Gospel, as your fathers did 
who came from those foreign nations, would there be peace in the 
world? Yes. If the spirit that is in the hearts of you Germans, you 
Scandinavians, you English, you Scotch, who are irj this Church, were 
ip the hearts of all your people living in these foreign lands today, there 
could not be war. There would be brotherhood and there WQuld be 
peace. 

I am, I say, therefore disturbed only aver the problems, that, may 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



107 



arise here with us. You students of history know well that the adverse 
circumstances, the poverty, the want, the unemployment and the deple- 
tion of the value of the currency of the various European nations laid 
the foundation for dictatorships; unknown dictators arose who offered 
security against want, against poverty, against need, and like drowning 
men grasping at straws, the nations of the earth accepted the proffer, and 
sold their liberties for bread. 

That is not the spirit of one of the founders of this republic who said : 
"Give me liberty or give me death." Liberty, one of the most precious 
things, must be preserved. I have said in many places to our Latter-day 
Saint brethren and sisters who are converts from abroad: "I cannot 
blame you for being proud of your English ancestry, your Scotch ances- 
try, or your German ancestry, but when you joined this Church and 
came to America you should have kissed that all goodbye, and it is not 
my business to glorify the dictators who now reign, no matter how good 
I may think their services are to that nation from which I came ; it is 
not my business to glorify them, but to become loyal to the government 
of the nation in which I live." I hope we shall not find any Latter-day 
Saint members glorifying the conditions that are in their Old World 
homes. 

PROMISES MADE BY THE LORD REGARDING ZION 

Again the Lord said, in the 115th Section of the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, that he had provided for the security of the membership 
of the Church even in this land. I read as follows : 

The gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, 
may.be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath 
when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth. 

Here is the place of refuge — America. When I read the story 
last week of the people leaving London, and Paris to go into the rural 
districts, digging trenches on their front lawns, and gas chambers being 
built in every home, everybody being prepared to put on gas masks 
suddenly, as in a few hours these cities might have been engulfed in a 
terrible raid such as modern war provides, I said : "Thank God for 
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that separate us, (at least from the 
immediate danger,) from these perils. There is no place on earth so 
secure as in these United States, and it is the business of every Latter- 
day Saint to be loyal to this government. 

That is why the Church is undertaking this relief program, to 
win everybody off from the back of the Government, and off from the 
back of the State, who can stand on his own feet. Many, of you aged 
people may feel somewhat offended that you have been asked if you can 
support yourselves and not be a burden upon the State or the Nation, 
for we can lie down upon our Government to the extent that we may 
imperil its credit and produce the very conditions that would bring the 
same revolutions and the same troubles that engulf the Old World. 
God bless us that we may not come to that day, and Latter-day Saints, 
show the way ! 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

There is another message found in the 103rd Section of the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, which was given in the darkest hour of the 
Church, at a time when the Saints had been exiled from Missouri. 
They were in dire distress, many had turned away, and then the Lord 
said : 

Verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people 
shall realize — ■ 

How wonderful the promise ! It is all conditional. I want to focus 
your attention upon the conditions : 

I have decreed a decree which my people shall realize, inasmuch as 
they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel which I, the Lord their 
God, shall give unto them. 

Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine 
enemies from this very hour. 

And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their 
God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the 
kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given 
unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever. 

THE LORD'S PLAN MUST BE FOLLOWED 

These conditions we must comply with ; we must adhere to the 
appeals that have been made during this conference ; we must adhere to 
the word of the Lord as given to this people, to observe to keep the 
commandments, to keep the Word of Wisdom. You young people, we 
are not asking you to give up your tobacco, your liquor, and your other 
evil practices, immorality, just to punish you or deny you what you 
think are privileges you ought to have. We see your destiny, but we 
know you cannot go forward to that destiny, to carry the work of the 
Almighty to the triumphant victory over the nations of the earth, unless 
you adhere to the Lord's plan. If you do subscribe to it, if you do pay 
your tithes and offerings, if you do adhere to the Word of Wisdom, 
if you adhere in loyalty to this Church, there is no power on earth nor 
in hell that can stop this people from marching on to their glorious 
destiny, to be the light of the world, and to win the world ultimately to 
Christ. 

When that day comes — for only through him can peace come — 
then will swords be beaten into plowshares, and spears into pruning- 
hooks. God help us to realize our tremendous responsibility, not only 
for ourselves and the Church, but for the whole world, and for the 
kingdom of the Redeemer that shall be triumphant in the earth. God 
speed that glorious day, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

TABERNACLE CHOIR AND ORGAN BROADCAST 

During the period from 10 :30 to 1 1 :00 a. m., the following pro- 
gram of choral and organ music was presented by the Tabernacle Choir 
and Organ as part of the proceedings of the General Conference, and 
was broadcast by radio throughout the United States and Canada 
by the courtesy of the Columbia Broadcasting System, originating over

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." 
(Mark 16:15). This was the final injunction of Jesus the Son of God. 

JOY IN MISSIONARY WORK 

Sixty thousand Mormon missionaries have heeded this admonition. 
And nearly sixty thousand have declared that the years they spent in 
the mission field were the happiest years of their lives. 

When the religion of a people evolves full, useful, joyous living, 
when their religious philosophy extends unbounded promise of eternal 
progression, when it points the way to that righteousness which fills 
men's hearts to overflowing with joy and gratitude, then the call for 
them to share these experiences with their fellowmen is regarded as a 
privilege rather than as a duty or a command. 

The interest of the members of the Mormon Church in missionary 
work, from its very inception in 1830, has gone forward with ever-in- 
creasing intensity and Church members are continuing to give to this 
great cause a surprisingly large percentage of both their time and their 
money. 

SACRIFICE REQUIRED 

Approximately 2,000 young men and women are maintained in the 
mission field all the time. Their parents, their friends and these young 
people themselves pay the entire cost of their maintenance while they 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Day 

labor as missionaries. The actual necessary cash outlay is roughly $1.50 
per day per missionary. This means a daily cash expenditure of 
$3,000.00, or an annual cost in cash of $1,095,000.00. If on an average 
the missionary's time is worth $3.00 per day, this means an additional 
sacrifice of $2,190,000.00 per year, or a total annual expenditure of 
$3,285,000.00. This sum, which faithful members of the Church con- 
tribute for the good of their f ellowmen must be acknowledged as a mighty 
gift from a Church membership of but 750,000. 

The sacrifices made are often very great. Widows, in many cases, 
toil to maintain their sons in the mission field. Many young women 
struggle at various kinds of labor in order to help pay the expenses of 
their brothers or their young husbands. Priesthood quorums, wards and 
other Church groups contribute to missionary funds and sometimes the 
well-to-do open their hearts and open their purses and maintain as mis- 
sionaries some worthy and capable Church members who are not able 
financially to pay their own way. 

There is scarcely a family anywhere in the Church that has not 
borne, and borne gladly, a share of this burden. Many families have sent 
more than one missionary into the field at the same time, and many have 
also sent one after another until all their sons have rendered service. One 
father has performed four different missions himself and his wife has 
performed one. Together they have sent all of their five sons and three 
of their four daughters into the mission field and in addition they have 
given assistance to two other missionary relatives. This family therefore 
has to its credit the equivalent of maintaining one missionary in the field 
for a period of more than forty years. The value in money of the mis- 
sionary service contributed by this one family on the basis above explain- 
ed is $65,700.00. Such sacrifices made by people who never have had a 
dollar they did not earn by honest effort tend to prove that when people 
are genuinely converted to the cause of the Master there appears to be 
no sacrifice they will not make for its advancement. 

Those having in their souls a testimony and conviction that the 
original Gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored "in these last days" 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that it must be preached in all the 
world "to every nation and kindred and tongue and people," as the scrip- 
tures say, feel a personal responsibility for carrying out the instructions 
of Jesus the Son of God. 

LIVING THE GOSPEL BRINGS TESTIMONY 

Mormon missionaries devote themselves faithfully to a study of the 
Bible and other inspired literature and they struggle to live in accordance 
with the high standards and ideals set forth therein. By their efforts to 
teach to others the fundamentals of righteous living, they strengthen and 
fortify themselves in their own high ideals and standards. The teaching of 
Christian virtues has impressed on the missionaries themselves the im- 
portance and the value of living in conformity with the ideals and stand- 
ards of the Church, and the high degree of spirituality found in the mis-

sion field has brought into their hearts a satisfying knowledge, testimony 
and certainty concerning the restored Gospel message which only the light 
and inspiration of Heaven can bring. 

Our missionaries have been humble men and humble women. They 
have not, except in very rare instances, been trained theological scholars. 
Perhaps their conduct, their ideals and their standards of living have 
been more effective in some cases as factors of conversion than have the 
words which they have spoken. The simple, straightforward manner 
in which these missionaries live, teach and preach you must admit is the 
method of Christ himself. And furthermore, that message has not 
changed. The Gospel today is the same Gospel which the Savior taught. 
Being the truth it will endure unchanged forever. 

BRIEF REPORT OF EUROPEAN MISSION 

The European Mission of the Church, whose affairs in a general way 
I have directed as its president during the last two years, consists of 
twelve separate and distinct missions which are located in sixteen differ- 
ent nations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The geographical area it covers 
is bounded by and includes South Africa on the south, Palestine and 
Czechoslovakia on the east, Norway on the north and Ireland on the west. 
Each of these twelve different missions has its affairs carefully directed 
and its work carefully supervised by an able and experienced mission 
president who has had years of effective training in the different branches 
of Church activity. Mission presidents are called from ordinary pursuits 
and give three or more years of service without compensation other than 
payment of mere expenses. 

In general our Elders are kindly received and fairly treated in all of 
the sixteen different countries included in the European Mission. Old pre- 
judices have largely disappeared. 

Last year President Heber J. Grant, world-wide head of the Mor- 
mon Church, visited all of the missions in the European Mission except 
South Africa and Palestine. He was greeted everywhere by the people 
and by the press with hearty words of welcome. Members of the Church 
and their friends came out in large numbers to see and to hear him. 

The missionaries live in accordance with that great fundamental 
teaching and practice of the Church appearing in our twelfth Article of 
Faith, namely: "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, 
and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law." They 
refrain from discussing governments or governmental policies and they 
are all instructed positively not to participate in the politics of the coun- 
tries where they labor. They are sent forth to give purpose to living, to 
improve the conditions of the present and to inspire in the hearts of the 
people hope for the future. 

LIVES OF CONVERTS TRANSFORMED 

The Gospel transforms many from an aimless life into a life of pur- 
pose ; it teaches thrift and industry to those who are poor ; to those who.

are rich it brings the blessed unselfishness of sharing ; it teaches to the 

indolent the gospel of work ; it brings courage, hope and ambition into 
the souls of those who are cast down ; it fills the heart of the sinner with 
the glorious gospel of repentance ; it brings joy, happiness and satisfaction 
into the hearts of men and women by instructing" them how to live in ac- 
cordance with the unselfish and satisfying ways of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

■ While large sums have been expended in both time and money and 
great sacrifices have been made to maintain our many missionaries in 
their fields of labor, rich and rare compensation for this expenditure has 
been realized again and again in many different ways. The great spiritual 
development and uplift these Elders have received has brought into their 
souls, and into the lives of Saints and converts also, as the scriptures 
say, that "peace of God which passeth all understanding." (Phil. 4:7.) 



BLESSINGS OF MISSIONARY WORK FAR REACHING 

But not by any means do all of the blessings that come as a result of 
missionary effort come to the Elders themselves, to the Saints in the mis- 
sion field or to those who have been converted. As a result of the rich, 
broadening and deepening experiences missionaries get in the mission 
field, the homes of the communities which send them forth receive from 
these missionaries, after their return, the advantage and benefit of the 
experience, judgment, richer personalities, culture and polish which 
worldwide travel lends. 

Boys from the country, from the field, and from the herd acquire 
that education and refinement which extensive travel and contact with 
great historic centers and metropolitan life always seem to bring. And 
on the other hand, young men who have been brought up in the city are 
often times given that broadening experience and training which those 
are sure to get who participate in the rigors of primitive life to which 
many missionaries are subjected. It is certain that in no other section 
of the country is the percentage so great of those who have traveled and 
have seen the world as in Mormon communities. 

While enlarged information, experience and polish are important, at 
the same time, at most, these are but secondary. The outstanding feature 
of missionary work is the great exhilarating spiritual uplift, inspiration 
and ambition which it brings, combined with that stabilized character 
which it produces in the manhood and womanhood of the Church. 

Imagine the extent, importance and effectiveness of this missionary 
training and experience when we have, as at present, missionaries labor- 
ing in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Den- 
mark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hawaii, India, Japan, Mexico, 
The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palestine, Syria, Samoa, South 
Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Tahiti, Tonga, and all of the States of the 
United States. 

These workers of righteousness scattered as they thus are all around 
the world learn not only to respect the many different kinds and classes 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



113 



of people with whom they live and labor, but they acquire for them gen- 
uine admiration and affection and for them they have hearts filled with 
praise and commendation. They have learned that great fundamental 
principle that in general one needs only to know his neighbor in order to 
like him. 

Our returned missionaries are found in practically every large city 
of America, yes, in every section of the nation. With their deep interest 
in and their genuine affection for humanity, they are invariably ambas- 
sadors of good will from the various countries in which they have labored, 
and they therefore tend to create a sympathetic feeling for and a deep 
interest in the various people with whom, as missionaries, they became so 
intimately acquainted. Thus these young men and women create an im- 
pression for good. They play an important part in influencing public 
opinion. Two-thirds of them are college graduates or university stu- 
dents. After their return, many of them take front rank in civic, edu- 
cational and religious affairs. Some become mayors of our cities, gov- 
ernors and legislators in our States, judges on the bench, and influential 
and powerful national congressmen and senators. They hold professor- 
ships in our seats of learning and become distinguished men of science. 
With one thousand of these returning annually from the various coun- 
tries of the world, they are sure to wield an influence that will be an im- 
portant factor in helping advance the great cause of good will among 
men and nations. 

PROPHECIES BEING FULFILLED 

It is the belief and conviction of our Church that as a result of our 
missionary work the mountain of the Lord's House, which prophets said 
anciently was to be established in the top of the mountains, is here built. 
It is our conviction that the kingdom spoken of by Daniel to be established 
by the God of Heaven, which is never to be destroyed but which is to 
stand forever, is the Church here established in these modern times, "in 
these last days," under the direction of and in accordance with the reve- 
lations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

In spite of the fact that practically every nation in the world is pre- 
paring for war, or for defense, at a rate and at a cost unknown and un- 
equaled before in all histroy, it is our conviction that the last days are 
here in which, as the prophets say, the God of Jacob is to judge among 
many nations and rebuke strong nations afar off ; that the day is coming 
when nations are to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears 
into pruning hooks, when nation shall not lift up sword against nation and 
when nations shall not learn war any more, "but they shall sit every man 
under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : 
for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it." (Micah 4 :4.) 

For the mighty and important work which the ancient prophets said 
would come to pass "in these last days," it is our conviction that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will pave the way, and that 
in bringing about that great final international understanding, that peace 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

on earth, and good will to men which Christ himself came to bring, the 

missionary activities of the Church will play a most important part. 

And it is our further conviction that the Kingdom of God is here 
established, that the Gospel will be preached to all the people in all the 
world, and that then will come again the Lord of Lords, the King of 
Kings, the Prince of Peace, to reign as King forever and forever. May 
we do well our part to speed his corning, I humbly pray. 

(End of Church of the Air Broadcast) 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Do What is Right." 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I wish to speak for solidarity in the Church. By this I mean simply, 
— standing together, — all striving to promote the common cause. I 
scarcely need point out the results of unity. They are many and they 
are apparent. I will name but two. The first is individual and collective 
happiness. 

FRIENDLY TIES IN PRIESTHOOD 

Association within the Church is of such a nature as to promote 
pure friendship. Next to family ties, the bonds of the Holy Priesthood 
which are by revelation said to be "stronger than the cords of death," 
and other companionships we enjoy in the Church, knit the souls of men 
and women together more perfectly than do any other relationships. I 
have known a man to travel across the continent to renew friendship with 
a missionary companion with whom he had spent but a few months 
in the service of the Master. Since all Church service is cooperative, we 
must be congenial to enjoy it. A man is neither happy nor effective in 
the cause if he is not one with his fellows. The Savior said, "Except ye 
are one, ye are not mine." 

A COMMON PURPOSE NECESSARY 

Another result of unity is efficiency in achievement. Discord and 
dissension are the wrenches thrown in the machinery. Concord is the oil 
which smooths the operation of the plant and immensely increases the 
output. A careful study of the history of the Church will disclose the 
fact that while it has suffered tremendously from persecution and oppres- 
sion from without, yet a large part of all its difficulties has been attribut- 
able to dissenters and traitors within its own ranks. The driving of the 
Saints, particularly from Nauvoo, the revocation of the Nauvoo Charter 
and even the martyrdom itself may be laid largely to disaffection and 
betrayal. Perhaps the most potent enemies of God's work have always 
been, ostensibly at least, within it. Internal unity is indispensable to 
success. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



115 



In the present day we are not wont to look for enemies and traitors 
within the camp. And if we did I am sure we would not find them as 
in times gone by. There are no overt acts of treachery, for which we 
must all be grateful. But can we feel assured that there are not other 
things, of less gravity, perhaps, which militate against the unity and 
common purpose of our people? It is of these things I wish to speak. 
Undoubtedly I shall not be able to enumerate all of them but I will men- 
tion a few which have occurred to me. 

PRIVATE INTERPRETATIONS OF DOCTRINE HARMFUL 

First. I point out a growing tendency toward private interpretation 
of scripture and doctrine and this I do not regard as particularly serious 
in point of perverting the general doctrines of the Church. It is with 
reference to the status of the individual that I feel concerned. For 
instance, I hear people, young and old, contend that the Word of Wisdom 
does not prohibit tea and coffee, certain commonly sold drugs and modern 
beer, claiming that these items are not specifically prescribed in the 89th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants. I find people, also, sometimes 
officers in the Church, attempting to justify a private interpretation of 
the law of Tithing, particularly with reference to a deduction of debt, 
living expenses, losses through speculation and other items from sal- 
aries and personal income before tithing is computed. I am sure there 
are hundreds attempting to persuade themselves that going to picture 
shows, playing baseball and golf and participating in other commercial- 
ized amusements are not infraction of God's law commanding that we 
keep the Sabbath holy. There are people in the Church, far too many, 
who are at variance with the President of the Church and his associates, 
the General Authorities, in the interpretation of our Temple ordinances 
and ceremonies and some of their requirements. These are what I call 
private interpretations of the doctrines of the Church as contra-distin- 
guished to the long established interpretations of these items by the 
General Authorities. Perhaps I should brand these variances as attempted 
justifications of individual weaknesses, but I do not wish to be harsh 
or inconsiderate of anyone who has sincerely convinced himself that his 
own interpretation is right. 

PRESIDENCY INTERPRETERS OF GOD'S LAWS 

Now who is entitled to interpret the doctrine of the Church, 
granting that some items are susceptible of different constructions? I 
am sure that upon serious reflection there is no real difference of opin- 
ion on this question among the members. It is so well established by 
the revelations which we have received and the practice of the Church 
that the President and his Counselors are invested with this authority 
that I cannot believe any member will seriously dispute it. In the 
language of the revelation they, the Presidency, are constituted "a 
quorum .... to receive the oracles for the whole Church." They are the 
supreme court here on earth in the interpretation of God's law. 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

In the exercise of their functions and delegated powers they are 
controlled by a constitution, a part of which is written and a part of 
which is not. The written part consists in authenticated scripture, 
ancient and modern, and in the recorded utterances of our latter-day 
prophets. The unwritten part is the spirit of revelation and divine in- 
spiration which are appertinent to their calling. 

In formulating their interpretations and decisions they always con- 
fer with the Council of the Twelve Apostles who by revelation are 
appointed to assist and act with them in the government of the Church. 
When, therefore, a judgment is reached and proclaimed by these officers 
it becomes binding upon all members of the Church, individual views 
to the contrary notwithstanding. God's Kingdom is a kingdom of law 
and order. He is the Lawgiver and the Supreme Judge but he has 
delegated authority and conferred the keys of the Kingdom upon these 
men whom he has chosen. They act for him and, thank the Lord, we 
accept them. It is the only safe thing to do. 

There are some, perhaps who may feel that it is subversive of in- 
dividual freedom of thought and expression to be controlled by the 
interpretations of our leaders. I wish to assure them that any feeling 
of contraint will disappear when once they secure the genius and true 
spirit of this work. Our unanimity of thought and action does not arise, 
as some suppose, from duress or compulsion in any form. Our accord 
comes from universal agreement with righteous principles and common 
response to the operation of the Spirit of our Father. It is actuated by 
no fear except one. That is the fear of offending God, the Author of 
our work. 

THOUGHTLESS CRITICISM UNPROFITABLE 

Now the second contributing factor which I would mention which 
militates against unity in the Church is the proneness of men to criticize 
and condemn. I am not here today to contend that everything is perfect. 
I know nothing about the Church that is perfect, excepting only the plan 
itself which is God-given. Things that men do will never be perfect 
until they themselves reach the perfection of Christ, the Perfect One. 
I suppose none of us realizes his own imperfections, at least not to their 
full extent. It is probably salutary to be told of them occasionally. We 
may reform if we are told. But I have never felt that much good came 
from telling others of my weaknesses. 

President Grant is one of the most democratic men ever to come to 
the Presidency. Some of us feel that his office is too open and that he 
permits too many impositions upon his time and patience for the good of 
his health. I believe that there is not a man or woman in the Church, 
or out of it for that matter, from whom he would not courteously re- 
ceive a constructive criticism or helpful suggestion. 

With such a disposition, what a cowardly and mean thing it is for 
members of the Church to attempt criticism behind his back and thus 
undermine his influence and reputation. Fortunately there are but few 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



117 



who are so mean. I do believe, however, there are many who are 
thoughtless, who speak lightly and carelessly and disrespectfully of 
leaders and principles and sacred phases of this Church. I think it is 
a shame to jest about sacred things and sometimes it is as blasphemous 
as taking the name of God in vain. I rebuke those who do it and I 
call upon them to stop and think. If they will but think, I believe they 
will realize the incalculable harm they do, the faith they destroy and 
the unhappiness they bring. 

I cannot pass this point without importuning some of my brethren 
to stop swearing. No man can love God and damn him anymore than he 
can love his wife and damn her. Think again, please. Think of the 
utter futility of this vulgar habit. Think of its effect in youth. Men 
teach boys profanity. It is not congenital with the race. It is the nature 
of man to love God and not to damn him. 

This proneness to criticism and careless judgment I must carry a 
step beyond its chief victims, — the authorities and officers of the Church, 
to the relations among the people themselves. Someone has said that the 
supreme charity of the world consists in simple obedience to the divine 
command, "Judge not." Certain it is that a large part of the unhappiness 
of the world results from inconsiderate judgment. Many a pillow is 
wet with the sobs of those who are its victims. We cannot read the hearts 
of man. We may not know their good intentions. We often judge them 
only by their failures, and we are unkind enough to circulate our judg- 
ment in the form of rumors and gossip and thus do irreparable damage. 
Every man who is a man prizes his good name, for, as the immortal 
Shakespeare said, "He who steals my purse steals trash, 'twas mine, 
'tis his; but he who robs me of my good name filches from me that 
which enriches not himself and makes me poor, indeed." 

God grant that we, the disciples of the Master, who bade us forgive 
all men and love even our enemies, may be' free from adding to the 
burdens and the unhappiness of our brethren and sisters by inconsiderate 
judgment. 

ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS BRINGS UNITY 

I wish now to mention the third and last factor in my brief sum- 
mary of causes contributing to disunity within the Church. It is the 
indifference to and poor attendance in the regularly established meetings 
provided for the people. My observation has taught me, and I believe 
all will agree, that no person can regularly go to the meetings of the 
Church and mingle with his brethren and sisters without catching the 
spirit of the work and developing within him a warmth of affection and a 
fervor of devotion which will tend to make him one with his fellows. 
The sacrament meeting which was given of the Lord by revelation is 
designed specifically to promote unity. We are even admonished not to 
partake of the sacrament if we entertain unkindly feelings in our hearts 
toward others. 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 



TRUE BROTHERHOOD IN QUORUMS 

The quorum meetings, too, in this respect have a vital purpose to 
conserve. A quorum is three things : first, a class ; second, a fraternity ; 
and third, a service unit. Within it the men of the Priesthood learn of 
the principles of the Gospel, establish true brotherhood, and carry for- 
ward the work of Christ. It is a God-given association from which they 
derive more of lasting advantage than from any other fraternal organ- 
ization in our society. Its prime purpose is to encourage and safeguard 
the individual. You can't tell me that men can absent themselves from 
their quorum meetings without losing something vital to their own well 
being and that of the Church also. 

I fear we have some men who have received the Holy Priesthood 
who feel themselves too big and too important to associate with their 
brethren in the quorum. I am sorry for them. They are making a 
great mistake. For it is they, chiefly, who are retarding the progress of 
the work of God. I am certain that I am right when I say that if all of 
the men of the Priesthood would be loyal to their quorums the work of 
the Church would be accelerated beyond anything we have ever known. 

In our concept of the Kingdom of God, every individual shares 
responsibility. We have no priests as distinguished from the laity. We 
are all priests in the kingdom, that is, we men folk, and the women, too, 
are priestesses therein. Every member either helps or hinders. There 
is no middle ground. 

So I present these items which I have mentioned,- — private and 
ofttimes perverted interpretations of our doctrine, ill-considered criti- 
cism, and non-attendance upon meetings and duties, as among the chief 
factors contributing to disunion within the Church. In so doing I hope 
I have given no offense. My sole purpose has been to assist in rectifying 
conditions that militate against our success. 

UNITY BRINGS SUCCESS 

And what success we could have with complete unity and harmony 
in the Church ! How effectively could we demonstrate the efficacy of 
applied Christianity if all our people stood together as one man behind 
our leaders ! When we consider the things we might accomplish, the 
impressions that we might make, what a pity it seems that our progress 
should be stayed by those of our own membership who are not one 
with us in purpose and deed. 

I know that to many it seems a very insignificant thing to smoke 
cigarettes, to take a drink, to gamble a little, to swear moderately, and 
to make the Sunday a holiday. I do not deem it my province, nor is it my 
desire, to condemn to purgatory those who are guilty of such infractions 
of our standards but I do appeal to them with all the fervor of my soul 
to stop these discordant practices and come in line with the great proces- 
sion of their Church. It is such a little thing to endure a slight depriva- 
tion in personal desire or appetite as compared to the success and triumph 
of a mighty cause that would soon envelope the whole earth if we were 
all faithful to it. 



ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, JR. 



119 



So in kindness I plead for solidarity, union, and love in the Church 
of Christ. God is forgiving. We all have need of repentance. No 
one has strayed so far that he cannot turn back. It is a strong man who 
will acknowledge his mistakes. We need each other's help and we need 
God's help. With unity and his aid we can bless this troubled world 
as it never has been blessed before. May he grant us this high privilege, 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. • 

ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, JR. 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I do not know that I have ever recognized the truth of the statement 
of King Benjamin to the ancient Nephites more fully than I do at the 
present time, wherein he told them to. remember the greatness of God 
and their own nothingness. 

I feel very humble and very weak in this great work that I am called 
to perform in the East Central States Mission. I feel that we have re- 
ceived, this morning, help for us as we return to the mission field. I am 
sure that if other mission presidents are as I am, we often sit in with our 
own individual thoughts; we wonder, we think and meditate, we pray 
and consider the plans and the methods of procedure in the mission field. 
We are alone, only as we consult with our Heavenly Father and receive 
his inspiration in the things we are to do. 

Coming to these wonderful conferences we meet, as it were, in a 
great clearing house of ideas, doctrine, and principles. I think now of 
St. Paul's admonition in the scripture wherein he said : 

All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for 
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 

Why all of these things ? 

That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto 
all good works. 

I rejoice in the fact that we can meet together in these conferences 
and hear scripture from our living prophets, our living leaders, who 
speak under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. To me it is scripture, 
even though it is orally expressed. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, 
Luke, and John, were oral gospels for many years before they were 
committed to writing. Why should not we as Latter-day Saints, knowing 
as we do that these men have been called of God, that they speak under 
the authority of the Holy Priesthood, and under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of God, I say, why should not we members of his Church in con- 
ference assembled accept these statements of theirs as scripture to us ? 

I rejoice in the remarks, the doctrines, the instructions, the cor? 
rections and the reproofs that we have received in this conference. 
Brethren and sisters, and friends who are here today, I feel that Sain| 
Paul of pjcj had, at times, difficulties the same as we mission presidents 



120 GENERAL-CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Dan 

do at the present time. Likely there came into his soul times of depres- 
sion, times of discouragement. I recall a statement of his which I should 
like to read here this morning. As he was encouraging the people of 
Philippi, the first place in Europe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was 
introduced, he held up to them the thought, as President Grant did here 
last night, that worldly things sink into insignificance in comparison 
with the values and the beauties of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He said : 

Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one 
thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth 
unto those things which are before. 

I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God 
in Christ Jesus. 

In my opinion this conference has sounded that keynote. There is 
no return, there is no backing up in the things we have attempted to do. 
Our vision points towards the future, and if there is any one thing that 
I am trying to eliminate and eradicate from among the members of the 
East Central States Mission, it is some of those things that were discussed 
a moment ago by Brother Stephen L Richards, especially dissension, 
and disunity within the Church. 

Brethren and sisters and friends, the war in heaven was a war 
beween the "brethren" and the "accusers of the brethren." Satan is 
here in our midst, this is his dominion, he is the accuser of the brethren, 
and when we find ourselves accusing our brethren, belittling them before 
men, we are fighting Satan's battles that he is hoping will be victorious. 

I am glad to report that the East Central States Mission is in a 
healthy condition. Our baptisms this year are almost a hundred per 
cent more than they were last year. We have one hundred and four 
missionaries in the field at the present time, seventy-nine Elders and 
twenty-five lady missionaries. Their health has been good in general, 
although we have had some few who have been afflicted during the 
summer months. They are happy in their work, their development is 
pleasing to me, and I am sure it is pleasing to the members of the Church 
in that mission field and to our Heavenly Father. 

My hope and prayer is that we shall continue to train our boys 
and girls in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe that we should under- 
stand that a knowledge of the Gospel and a testimony of the same are not 
hereditary, they do not come to us by reason of the fact that we have been 
born of goodly parents, unless we have accepted the teachings and the 
training those parents have given unto us. Religion without education has 
often degenerated into superstition, but theology that leads to religion, 
if accompanied by education, may result in the exaltation of man to the 
highest degree in the celestial kingdom when he applies it in his life. 

•May the Lord bless us; may we carry into our fields of labor the 
instruction, the inspiration, and the great enthusiasm that we have felt 
in these conference sessions, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDEN HEBER J. GRANT 



121 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Once more I congratulate you on seeing that there are no accidents. 
I hope and pray that you will be very careful during the remainder of the 
day. I feel humiliated always when I hear that Utah leads the whole 
nation in killing and injuring people by automobile accidents in propor- 
tion to our population. 



The Choir and congregation sang "Doxology," after which the 
closing prayer was offered by Elder Edwin L. Murphy, President of the 
Moon Lake Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference commenced promptly at 
2 o'clock p. m., Sunday, October 9. 

Once more the great Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, as was 
also the large Assembly Hall on the Tabernacle Block, and thousands who 
could not find accommodation in either of these buildings congregated up- 
on the adjoining grounds, where they listened to the services as they were 
broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir, under the leadership of J. Spencer Cornwall, 
furnished the musical program for this meeting. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the Man 
who Communed with Jehovah." 

Elder Heber Moon, President of the Duchesne Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

The Choir sang an anthem, "How Blessed are They." 

ELDER A. LORENZO ANDERSON . 

President of the Mexican Mission 

I have been thrilled by the singing and by the remarks that have 
been given in this conference, and at this moment particularly am I thrill- 
ed at the words of President Grant when he tells us to be just as brief as 
our consciences will let us. 

I was thrilled this morning with the remarks of Brother Stephen 
L Richards, when he pleaded for unity of the membership of this Church, 
and while he was speaking I was reminded of the remarks of one of our 
great statesmen when we were having trouble in the United States. He 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Day 

was pleading for unity of the people of the United States, and he told 
them "If we will be united all the armies of Europe, of Asia, and Africa 
combined, with a Napoleon for a leader, could not take a drink of water 
out of the Ohio river." 

I should like to paraphrase that statement and say, that all the powers 
of this earth and hell combined, with Lucifer as generalissimo, could 
make no inroads on the membership of this Church if we would but be 
united. 

In the Mexican Mission we have a faction that has been causing us 
considerable trouble, they think because of the fact that they are the sons 
of father Lehi that they are the heirs of the kingdom and that we 
ought to turn it over to them and let them run it. 

I want to testify to you this afternoon that as Daniel said, the God 
of heaven has established his kingdom upon the earth again, never to be 
destroyed nor given another people. 

The Mexican Mission, aside from these few people to whom I have 
referred, who are illusioned for the time being, is in a healthy condition. 
We have nearly 3000 Saints there, and when I came to this conference I 
came with the idea that we were about the poorest mission of all. We 
have nineteen million of the sons of Lehi down there waiting for the 
Gospel to be preached to them, and we have only twenty-eight mission- 
aries to do it. Eleven of those are descendants of father Lehi. 

Mexico, because of religious oppression in the past, has been forced 
to pass certain laws which make it impossible for the body of the Church 
to send us missionaries. We are dependent entirely upon the Juarez 
Stake and the Mexican Mission proper to furnish missionaries to preach 
the Gospel to those nineteen millions of the sons of father Lehi. I know 
the Lord is able to do a wonderful work. 

During the broadcast this morning I sat where I could not see Bro- 
ther Richard L. Evans, and all I had to do was to close my eyes and then 
I was down on the tops of the Sierra Madres listening to him 
over the radio. I appreciate very much the power for good in the radio, 
the preaching of the sermons that come out over this radio to the people. 
We people who live so far away are able occasionally to listen to some of 
the brethren preaching the Gospel. 

I pray that the Lord will bless you all, that he will bless this great 
work, the missionary cause, that we may be able to preach the Gospel to 
all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and I do it in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

On the 11th day of December, in the year 1907, I received a tele- 
phone message at the office of the County Clerk in Salt Lake County, 
where I was serving as chief deputy. That message said that my father 
wanted me to report to him at the Salt Lake Temple. The message came 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



123 



to me at about ten o'clock, and when I went to the temple I was ushered 
into the room occupied by the Presidency and Twelve, by Brother Sal- 
mon, and was notified that Charles W. Nibley had been chosen, to serve 
as Presiding Bishop of the Church, and that he had chosen Orin P. Miller 
as his first counselor and I was to be the second counselor. 

When the announcement was made I had not expected such a thing. 
It was not an unusual thing for father to call for me to look after his 
personal affairs. I turned dizzy. I steadied myself by the arm of the 
chair. 

On the 6th day of April, in the year 1938, 1 was confined to my home 
on account of a severe cold and sore throat. A few minutes before two 
o'clock President Grant telephoned to me and told me that a new Presid- 
ing Bishopric would be sustained, and admonished me not to worry as 
something would be found for me. 

Today only seven of the men are still living who .constituted the 
General Authorities of the Church when I first became one of that body. 
I am grateful that I have had the privilege of knowing those who served 
then and who are gone. I am grateful for the privilege I have had of 
laboring with and knowing the men who now serve as the General Au- 
thorities of this Church. I have tried to serve faithfully, for I have had 
faith. Every fiber of my body testifies that God lives and as I have said 
to you many times it is not where we labor but how we labor that leads 
us to salvation. It is not the Priesthood that assures to us exaltation, 
but the manner in which we honor and labor under the authority of that 
Priesthood. As I have tried to labor in the past to serve my God, I assure 
you that in my new calling in the Canadian Mission I shall go with that 
same faith and with that same desire to support the authorities of this 
Church, with the same appreciation of the privilege which comes to me 
to labor with my fellows in the authority of the Priesthood, the object 
being to bring souls unto our Father. 

We have only a few members in that mission, about one-half the 
number that comprises the membership of the Ward in which my resi- 
dence has been. I have met them in meetings and in their homes, con- 
versed with them, and if I dare say so I would say I have found a people 
who put to shame many of those who live under the influence of this 
great building and the Priesthood, where they can partake of the bread 
as it comes from those who hold the authority to teach. 

I rejoice in this privilege, and I pray God that he will continue to 
sustain me, that I shall not fail in the trust which has been imposed upon 
me. I sincerely hope that he will continue those blessings to me and the 
people over whom I preside, that we may continue to rejoice in him and 
his work, and in the opportunity which comes to us to serve. 

These blessings T ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

ELDER REED SMOOT 



0/ the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I thank my heavenly Father for the privilege I have of standing 
before this immense audience of his servants and handmaidens, and as 
time is limited I have decided that the only way to stop when you get 
started is to have it in such form that you will know when the end is 
reached. 

Get into the habit of being happy. I tell you you can do it. You 
can say to yourself when you are awakened in the morning, "Everything 
is all right," and keep on saying it. You will be surprised to find how 
nearly all right the mere saying of it at the beginning of the day will 
really make everything right after all. This is true in business as well 
as in the home. Prophets of gloom are never popular, and ought not 
to be. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S SAYINGS 

Joseph Smith was the author of such sayings as these: 

The glory of God is intelligence. 

It is impossible to be saved in ignorance. 

Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will 
rise with us in the resurrection. 

And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life 
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the 
advantage in the world to come. 

The Prophet was true to his principles. He established schools and 
championed the cause of education. 

A TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH SMITH 

A Mormon writer has said: 

His educational ideals passed over the threshold of time and strode 
down the halls of eternity. With a full appreciation of the knowledge 
that makes men and women capable and skilful in this life, he prized, 
and taught others to prize, above all, the knowledge that maketh wise 
unto salvation. 

How to solve life's every-day problems is of course important, but 
how to grapple successfully with the mightier problems of the great 
hereafter, how to store up treasures in heaven and lay hold upon eternal 
life, is far more consequential. Education meant to him the leading 
of the latent potential powers of the individual, the training to perfection 
of every divine attribute in man. As a child of God, and as a God 
himself in embryo, he stood for the full and complete development of the 
soul, body and spirit combined — mental, physical, moral, and spiritual 
education, the education contemplated and inculcated by the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and every succeeding President of the Church has stood 
for these principles. 

DEFINITION OF CAN'T 



There is a place provided in our Church organizations for every 
member. Excuses are sometimes offered, and many times the reason 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



125 



given is, "I cannot give the time." "Can't!" What a word ! That which 
I intend to quote now is Edgar A. Guest's definition of the word can't." 

Can't is the worst word that is written or spoken 
Doing more harm here than slander or lies. 

It has many a strong spirit broken, 

And with it many a good purpose dies. 
It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning, 
And robs us of courage we need through the day: 

It rings in our ears like a timely sent warning, 

And leaves when we falter and fall by the way. 

Can't is the father of feeble endeavor, 

The parent of terror and half-hearted work ; 

It weakens the efforts of artisans clever, 

And makes of the toiler an indolent shirk. 
It poisons the soul of a man with a vision, 
It stifles in infancy many a plan; 

It greets honest toiling with open derision 

And mocks at the hopes and the dreams of a man. 

Can't is a word that none should speak without blushing; 
To utter it should be a symbol of shame; 

Ambition and courage it daily is crushing ; 

It blights a man's purpose and shatters his aim. 
Despise it with all of your hatred of error, 
Refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain ; 

Arm against it as a creature of terror, 

And all that you dream of you some day shall gain. 

Can't is a word that is doom to ambition, 
An enemy ambushed to shatter your will ; 

Its prey is forever the man with a mission, 

And bows but to courage, and patience, and skill. 
Hate it with hatred that is deep and undying, 
For once it is welcomed 'twill break any man; 

Whatever the goal you are seeking, keep trying, 

And answer this demon by saying "I can." 

DEVELOPMENT THROUGH WORK 

One splendid way to avoid falling into error is to labor. Don't 
become a loafer. There is always something to do for a boy and girl, 
a father and mother, around the home, in the home. Take part in the 
Church in any interest for the welfare of the people. You remember 
in the old fable the tortoise won the race with the hare, not by a single 
burst of speed, but by plodding along steadily, tirelessly. In the Civil 
War it was found that Lee's army could not be overwhelmed in a single 
battle, but one federal general perceived that it could be worn down by 
time and the pressure of numbers. "I propose," said Grant, "to fight 
it out on this line if it takes all summer." It took more than a summer, 
it took nearly a year, but he did it. 

In the moral realm likewise, all things excellent are as difficult as 
they are rare. Character is not attained over night. The only way to 
develop moral muscles is to exercise them patiently and long. This 
is so well expressed by that renowned man, J. G. Holland, as follows ; 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Day 

Heaven is not reached at a single bound ; 

But we build the ladder by which we rise 
From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies, 

And we mount its summit round by round. 

I count this thing to be grandly true : 

That a noble deed is a step toward God, 

Lifting the soul from the common clod 
To a purer air and a broader view. 

We rise by the things that are under feet ; 

By what we have mastered of good and gain; 

By the pride deposed and the passion slain, 
And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet. 

We hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust, 

When the morning calls us to life and light, 
But our hearts grow weary, and, ere the night, 

Our lives are trailing the sordid dust. 

We hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray, 

And we think that we mount the air on wings 
Beyond the recall of sensual things, 

While our feet still cling to the heavy clay. 

Wings for the angels, but feet for men ! 

We may borrow the wings to find the way — 
We may hope, and resolve, and aspire, and pray ; 

But our feet must rise, or we fall again. 

Only in dreams is a ladder thrown 

From the weary earth to the sapphire walls ; 
But the dreams depart, and the vision falls, 

And the sleeper wakes on his pillow of stone. 

Heaven is not reached at a single bound; 

But we build the ladder by which we rise 
From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies, 

And we mount to its summit, round by round. 



TRUE RICHES 



How rich- are you, how rich are any of us ? I think the letter- 
portraying and answering that question is very well worded. No one yet 
has learned the author. When first it was published every effort was 
made to learn who the author was, but up to the present time we know 
not. But no matter who the author was I think the words are beautiful : 

I do not mean how much money you have in the bank, or how much 
your real estate is worth, there are other riches more valuable than 
these. Some day I am going to write a book about how every man and 
woman may be rich, right now, today, in the things that really count. 
In my scrap book I have a little article about being richer each day 
that I would like to share with you. Here it is : 

"You are richer today than you were yesterday. If you have 
loved often, given something, forgiven often, made a new friend today, 
or made stepping-stones of stumbling-blocks, if you have thought more 
in terms of thyself than myself, or if you have learned to be hopeful 
even if you were weary, you are richer tonight than you were this 
morning. If you have taken time to trace the handiwork of God in the 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



127 



commonplace things of life, or if you have learned to count things that 
really do not count, or if you have been a little blinder to the faults of 
friends, and know you are richer if a little child has smiled at you, a 
stray dog has licked your hand, or if you have looked for the best in 
others and given others the best in you." 

STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH 

My brethren and sisters, I have often wondered why intelligent men 
and women who believe in the Bible, men and women who believe that 
there was a Christ, do not attend church. We find churches in all parts 
of America with but very few in attendance. I have had men ask me 
time and time again how it was that the Mormon Church had that power 
and influence over people to tell them to do a thing and they do it with 
all their might, mind, and. strength, and with joy in their souls. They 
do not understand why our missionaries go out into the world for two 
or three years, once or twice, or three times, as the case may be, bearing 
their own expenses in an effort to convert the people who believe that 
they have the Gospel. 

How happy we should be that our lives, our position, our belief 
are based upon a direct visitation from the Father and the Son to Joseph 
Smith in this dispensation! If that were not true do you think that this 
Church would have lived and grown and become the power it has ? And 
do you think that any man, I care not whether it was Joseph Smith, or 
Brigham Young, or any other living soul, could have done this if it were 
not true that the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith, and 
also that later the Priesthood of the living God was conferred upon 
him and he was instructed to organize the Church to which you and I 
belong ? 

God grant that we may ever be loyal and true to it, and that what- 
ever comes, and whatever demand is made we may know it is what God 
would desire. God be with you, and bless you, and prosper you. May 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ grow every day and every year until the 
Master shall come, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters, nowhere in all the world do I feel 
myself so much in the presence of friends, as in these great General 
Conferences of the Church — thousands of men and women who are of 
the same faith, with the same objective in life, having the same aspira- 
tions as to the hereafter. I feel myself as one of a great family in 
these conferences. Yet there is a feeling as one stands before this group, 
akin to fear, akin to awe. I have heard my brethren say that they also 
have that feeling. Brigham Young explained it by saying that we are 
all children of Almighty God, his very children, begotten in the spirit 
world before we came here upon this earth, and that within every one 
of us, for that reason, is a spark of divinity. When a man stands before 
a group of thousands of righteous men and women, as I do this moment, 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



he feels the divinity within them, and feels much as he would if he stood 
before Divinity itself. 

I rejoice in having this opportunity; yet when I look at the clock 
I know that "the time is far spent, there is little remaining" — except 
speakers. You will permit me therefore, I am quite sure, to lay aside 
the theme that I have selected for this conference — it may sound just 
as well next April — and to bear testimony to you as the Spirit may 
move upon me at this moment. 



I do bear testimony to you of the truth of this work, which has 
brought us together during this great, wonderful, thrilling conference. 
This work is of God, not of man. It was founded in revelation. It 
has been guided by revelation. It is being directed today by revelation. 
It possesses the authority of eternity — we call it the Priesthood — the 
power by which the heavens and the earth were made. 

The man who stands at the head of the Church today holds the 
keys, rights, privileges, and authority held by every man who throughout 
the generations of time has been called to lead the cause of God. He 
stands as the representative of God's great plan of salvation. 

Our destiny is for all men. We are servants of the human race, 
bearers of truth and light to those who are in ignorance, -and who sit 
in darkness. We are not like other men ; we are not like other women. 
We are chosen and set apart unto the greatest and gravest responsibilities 
that the Lord has ever placed upon his children on earth. 

This is the last dispensation, not the first. It is the summation of 
the thousands of years since the earth was made. This is the evening 
of earth's Saturday. The work is about to be completed. The manner 
and time of its completion, and all that pertains to these last days are 
left very largely with us, the commissioned servants of Almighty God 
in this great work. 

I rejoice in this testimony, and I bear it to you. And I want to 
say to you, my brethreq and sisters, that this testimony is knowledge, 
the higher knowledge, transcending mere belief, or even ordinary faith. 
It is the best in my life, as it is the best in your lives — for I speak but 
as one of hundreds of thousands in this Church and kingdom who bear 
this testimony. This testimony is my priceless possession, the thing I 
value most, the thing to which I want to cling throughout life. 

You may well ask me, and you have the right to ask me, as you 
may ask my brethren and sisters by the ten of thousands who like me 
can bear this same testimony, how we dare to declare such a testimony, 
how we dare to say that we know that this is the work of God. In 
answer, thousands in this congregation, would join with me in explaining 
how such a testimony may be won. 



TESTIMONY AS TO DIVINITY OF WORK 



EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH ARE PLAIN TO BE SEEN' 



The evidences of the truth of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
lie all about us, if we but search and seek. They lie within easy reach. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



129 



They are evidences no man can deny, so clear to the vision, I was about 
to say, that the blind can see them. Who can read the life of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the backwoods boy of New York, untaught, unlettered, 
except as revelation came to him, who can read his career and the teach- 
ings of his life without saying of him, honestly, "The man did not speak 
of himself. Powers beyond man spoke through him for the benefit of 
humanity" ? 

Take the life of our own President, the commissioned leader of our 
Church today. His life is like an open book; we know every chapter 
in it. Who would dare to say that Heber J. Grant the President of the 
Church today speaks only through the great natural endowment that was 
recognized in him even while he was a boy ? One must be blind, indeed, 
and hard of hearing who cannot recognize the spirit of inspiration and 
the voice of God speaking through the prophet of this day, our day, 
this Sunday, in which we are living. 

Yet, evidences are not enough to gain a testimony of the truth ; we 
have something more. I was brought up in scientific laboratories, where 
I was taught to test things, never to be satisfied unless a thing was tested. 
We have the right to test the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. By 
testing it I mean living it, trying it out. Do you question the Word 
of Wisdom? Try it. Do you question the law of tithing? Practice it. 
Do you doubt the virtue of attending meetings? Attend them. Only 
then shall we be able to speak of these things intelligently and in such 
a way as to be respected by those who listen to us. Those who live 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ gain this higher knowledge, this greater 
testimony, this ultimate assurance that this is the truth. It is the way 
to truth. All the while, brethren and sisters, we must seek help from 
the great unseen world about us, from God and his messengers. We 
call that prayer. A man never finds perfect peace, never reaches afar 
unless he penetrates to some degree the unseen world, and reaches out 
to touch the hands, as it were, of those who live in that unseen world, 
the world out of which we came, the world into which we shall go. 

SIMPLE THINGS LEAD TO GREAT TRUTHS 

I want to conclude by saying that in seeking a testimony of the 
truth of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Gospel restored in our 
day, we need chiefly to give attention to the little things of life. The 
little things are really the great things of life; and the things we call 
great in life are the little things. Life is made up of little things, our 
daily duties. We are too prone to say that that which is clear and 
understandable is of little consequence; while that which is complex 
and difficult to understand we sometimes hold to be great. Let us 
remember that the little things of life, the simple things, are the ones 
that lead us into the greater truths. 

I was taught in my scientific day to look for fundamental principles, 
the governing principles, and not to worry about the complexities or mys- 
teries of things. I found that when I looked down deep into the heart 
of things, I found that the principles that govern and guide were always 



130 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Day 

simple and easily understood. Man's progress towards truth has been 
along simple ways. 

The theme of President Grant's opening sermon just a few days 
ago was constant labor of the right kind as far as we have strength 
and ability. That is a simple, elementary principle ; yet so fundamental 
that in practice it changes the whole world for every man who lives in it. 
Brother Bowen spoke of honesty — another simple principle ; yet he wove 
it into the pattern of our character. Brother Merrill spoke on unselfish- 
ness — a simple principle, yet the power that makes the world habitable. 
From such simple principles are woven the pattern of the peace and 
prosperity of the world. 

CONCLUDING TESTIMONY 

Now I must not say more. I have borne you my testimony. It 
may be gained by any and every person. The way is simple ; God has not 
made that road difficult to travel; but we must obey certain principles 
of truth to guide us if we are to reach the end. Every man may reach 
it who really desires it. There are hundreds of thousands of people, 
I am happy to say, in this last dispensation who have found this testi- 
mony, who have secured this certain and firm knowledge of the truth, 
and who can bear witness, perhaps even more certainly than I can 
— though it seems to me that my faith has passed beyond doubt — that 
God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that Joseph Smith was 
indeed a prophet of God divinely inspired and guided, and that we are 
. engaged in the work of God for the completion of God's great plan with 
respect to the human race. 

I thank God for the Gospel, in my behalf and in your behalf. God 
bless us and make us true to the truth, I pray, in the name of the Lord 
Tesus Christ. Amen. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang "By Babylon's Wave," (Gounod). 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, as I contemplate the growth of the 
mission of the Church of Christ, I feel to exclaim with Browning: 
"God's in his heaven: all's right with the world." Men and nations 
make errors and will be punished therefor, but ultimately the Lord 
will overrule the acts of men for the triumph of Truth. This great 
Conference has given added assurance in the success of this, God's 
work. I hope all who have attended the sessions or who have listen- 
ed in have had their faith increased in the divinity of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

PURPOSES OF CONFERENCES 

Such is one of the purposes of these conferences. Reference to 
the Doctrine and Covenants will disclose the fact that there are four 
principal purposes of holding conferences of the Church : 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



131 



First, to transact current Church business, 

Second, to hear reports and general Church statistics, 

Third, to "approve of those names which I (the Lord) have 

appointed, or to disapprove of them." 

Fourth, to worship the Lord in sincerity and reverence, and to 

give and to receive encouragement, exhortation, and instruction. 

GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 

It is a good thing in the Church, as in business, to check up on 
ourselves to see whether we are succeeding or failing. 

Organizations as individuals are either progressing or retro- 
grading — they seldom if ever stand still. To progress is to obey 
the law of life. If the Church or any part of it were not improving, 
you may rest assured that it would be deteriorating. No Ward, 
Stake, or Branch of the Church can long remain stationary. It is 
a source of satisfaction to all of us to realize that we belong to a 
Church that is moving forward. Statistics for the nine months 
ending September 30 corroborate this fact. Since January 1, 1938 
there have been organized six new stakes, 24 new wards, and 21 
independent branches — 4 wards and 5 independent branches have 
been disorganized, leaving a clear gain of 20 wards, and 16 new 
independent branches. This increase during these nine months is 
but indicative of the steady growth of the Church since its organiza- 
tion. 

I have been reminded, since attending this Conference and 
listening to the reports of some of the Mission Presidents, and the 
remarks of Stake Presidents when I have met them, of the great 
growth manifested since I became associated with the General Au- 
thorities. For example, in 1910 I visited the California Mission. 
As I recall it, the total membership then was about 2000, and only 
one Church building owned by the members, and that was up at 
Gridley. Today we have 9 stakes, 70 wards, 10 independent 
branches, with a church membership of approximately 35,000, and 
Church property amounting to approaching two million dollars. 
In addition to this the California Mission numbers 9,400, and owns 
property valued at approximately $227,500.00. 

I have heard President Grant refer to his early experience in 
Bear Lake Stake which was organized June 20, 1869. I do not 
know what the membership was then at the time of organization; 
but about ten years later it was 3,418. Today in Idaho there are 25 
Stakes, 244 wards, and 14 independent branches, comprising a 
membership of approximately 100,000 — (99,111) and two more 
stakes already approved. 

The growth of the Church in the Northwest during the last 
few years has been outstanding. Portland, as you know, is now 
the center of an organized Stake, as is also Seattle. 

Thriving stakes are found in Chicago and New York, and a 
promise of another in Washington, D. C, the capital of the nation. 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Dag 



COMMENDATION OF WELFARE WORKERS 

An important and most commendable enterprise undertaken 
by the Church is its Welfare Program. Of its value and significance 
much has been said during the Conference. I desire to commend 
in the presence of this large audience the able and unselfish work 
of the eleven members of the General Committee chosen to assist 
the General Authorities. These men are leaders in their chosen 
occupations and professions. They, as you, give their very best to 
the advancement of this great undertaking, contributing their time 
and ability without a cent of compensation. The reward of their 
effort lies in their love for the work. 

Under the direction of this committee and the management of 
experienced and dependable contractors, the Central Storehouse 
Building Project is being carried on at 751 West 7th South, this 
city, one of the pivotal centers around which this entire plan re- 
volves. 

In your mind's eye, come with me momentarily and stand out- 
side those unfinished buildings. Here we see a worthy example 
of cooperation. The steel lying there, being used to reinforce the 
cement, has been furnished at cost; by firms not members of the 
Church. So have the cement and the lumber; so 'have the ma- 
terials purchased from merchants in this city, also the electric poles 
and the wire. The spirit of cooperation is manifested by members 
and non-members. Here are from 40 to 60 men working daily — 
men otherwise unemployed, each recommended by his Bishop. Each 
receives for his labor small amounts in cash, the balance in orders 
on the storehouses. 

One of the most pleasing things which you observe is the fact 
that union men work side by side with non-union men. I wish to 
commend the Brick-layer's Union particularly for their attitude 
toward this great Welfare movement in permitting their men to 
work side by side with others in the spirit of true brotherhood. 

I would ask you, too, to contemplate the Mormon Handicraft 
Project carried on by the Relief Society, a most commendable en- 
terprise, in which 650 women have found employment while they 
remained at home with their families. 

The spiritual progress of the Church also is equally encourag- 
ing. Tithing has increased; so has the fast offering. The growth 
in interest in the Priesthood quorums, while it is not yet what it 
should be, indicates clearer vision on the part of officers as to the 
responsibility of these groups. 

Such are a few of the sign posts of the progress of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I refer to them not with a

tions that the Church is moving forward. 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 133 

PEACE THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH 

The future and permanency of the work is assured so long as 
the Priesthood will keep in mind the great mission of the Church. 
It is truly a messenger of peace. When Christ came to the earth 
his advent was heralded by an angelic chorus singing: "Glory to 
God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men." 
This message has been repeated so often that it seems trite, and, 
yet, if peace and brotherhood could even be approximated, it would 
prove the greatest boon that could come to humanity. 

Since time began men have kept the world in turmoil with their 
useless strivings, their bickerings, and their contentions. There is 
an old, old story told that a man from another planet was permitted 
to visit the earth. From an eminence he looked down upon the 
bustling cities of the world. Millions of men, like ants, were busy 
building palaces of pleasure, and other things that would not last ; 
chasing will-o'-the-wisps and seeking financial bubbles that burst 
before their eyes. As he left to go back he said : "All these people 
are spending their time in building just bird's nests; no wonder they 
fail and are ashamed." 

The peace of Christ does not come by seeking the superficial 
things of life, neither does it come except as it springs from the 
individual's heart. Jesus said to His disciples : "Peace I leave with 
you. My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I 
unto you." Thus the Son of Man as the executor of his own will 
and testament gave to his disciples and to mankind the "first of all 
human blessings." It was a bequest conditioned upon obedience 
to the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is thus bequeathed 
to each individual. No man is at peace with himself or his God 
who is untrue to his better self, who transgresses the law of right 
either in dealing with himself by indulging in passion, in appetite, 
yielding to temptations against his accusing conscience, or in deal- 
ing with his fellowmen, being untrue to their trust. Peace does not 
come to the transgressor of law ; peace comes by obedience to 
law, and it is that message which Jesus would have us proclaim 
among men. 

If we would have peace as individuals, we must supplant enmity 
with forbearance, which means to refrain or abstain from finding 
fault or from condemning others. "It is a noble thing to be chari- 
table with the failings and weaknesses of a friend ; to bury his weak- 
nesses in silence, but to proclaim his virtues from the house tops." 
We shall have power to do this if we really cherish in our hearts 
the ideals of Christ, who said : 

If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy 
brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before the altar, 
and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and 
offer thy gift. 

Note the Savior did not say if you have ought against him, 
but if you find that another has ought against you. How many of 



i 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Dan 



us are ready to come up to that standard? If we are, we shall 
find peace. Many of us, however, instead of following this admoni- 
tion, nurse our ill-will until it grows to hatred, then this hatred 
expresses itself in fault-finding and even slander, "whose whisper 
over the world's diameter as level as a cannon to its mouth, trans- 
ports its poison shot." Back-biting, fault-finding, are weeds of 
society that should be constantly eradicated. Gossip, too, brings 
discord and thrives best in superficial minds, as fungi grows best 
on weakened plants, "Bear ye one another's burdens," but do not 
add to those burdens by gossiping about your neighbors or by 
spreading slander. Diogenes was asked one day to name that beast, 
the bite of which is the most dangerous. The old philosopher re- 
plied : "Of tame beasts, the bite of the flatterer ; of wild beasts, that 
of the slanderer." 

During the approaching political campaign let us refrain, from 
making personal attacks and from hurling slanderous abuse, and 
thus avoid injuring one another's feelings, and after election have 
fewer regrets and heartaches. 



If the world would be at peace it must supplant the rule of force 
by the rule of love. The scriptures tell us that in the beginning 
Satan proffered to force all men into subjection to the will of God. 
By compulsion he would save every person, and for so doing he 
asked that the honor and the glory that are the Lord's should be 
his. 

There is an example of dictatorship supreme! 
In contrast to this, Christ's plan was to give men their free 
agency. 

To every man, says Joseph Smith, is given an inherent power to 
do right or to do wrong. In this he has his free agency. He may choose 
the right and obtain salvation, or he may choose evil and merit abomination. 

A man may act as his conscience dictates so long as he does 
not infringe upon the rights of others. That is the spirit of true 
democracy, and all government by the Priesthood should be actuat- 
ed by that same high motive. We are told, 

The rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned ; 

Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward 
him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy. 



Christ's plan gives free agency 



WHERE PEACE IS FOUND 



Peace is not found in selfishness, but in striving to help make 
the world better and happier. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



135 



"There was a time when I was happy," said Browning's Par- 
celsus. 

"When was that?" asked his friend Festus. 

The old philosopher answered : "When, but the time I vowed 
myself to man." 

And then Festus said : "Great God, thy judgments are in- 
scrutable." 

Then Parcelsus continued : "There is an answer to the pas- 
sionate longings of the heart for fullness and I knew it, and the 
answer is this : Live in all things outside yourself by love, and you 
will have joy. That is the life of God : it ought to be our life. In 
him it is accomplished and perfect ; but in all created things it is a 
lesson learned slowly and through difficulty." 

Finally, the perfect peace comes to the individual who has a 
testimony of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That is the 
greatest blessing, brethren and sisters; all else may be sacrificed 
rather than that. If you would have it then follow the words of 
the Savior : "He that will do the will of my Father which is in Heaven 
shall know of the doctrine whether it is of God, or whether I speak of 
myself." 

How different the peace of God from that of the world ! It calms the 
passions, preserves the purity of conscience, is inseparable from righteous- 
ness, unites us to God, and strengthens us against temptation. The peace 
of the soul consists in an absolute resignation to the will of God. 

The way to peace for individuals and nations is to have "the 
Kingdom of God within you." 

May peace come to each of us, and to the whole world. I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS 

My brothers and sisters : I am grateful for this great conference, 
and for the spirit that has been with us during its sessions. I am 
grateful for the music which we have had, all of it, for the great choir — 
and we may properly so term it — for its leader, Brother Cornwall, for 
faithful Brother Asper, and for Richard L. Evans and his sermonettes, 
which are reaching tens of thousands of people, and the inspiration and 
the spirit which will come to him from his new calling will many fold 
increase his influence in this work. 

I am grateful for the welfare plan, and for the success which is 
attending the efforts of those who are carrying it out. I thank the 
general committee, the regional committees, the stake and the ward 
committees, the Priesthood quorums, and last, but by no means least, 
the Relief Society, who are the "mothers" of the welfare household. 

I am grateful for every blessing which has come to us, which the 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Dag 



Lord has given to us. He has given us bounteous crops, he has given 
us great natural resources, he has provided us with the necessities of 
shelter and of clothing, and if anyone shall suffer, it will not be the 
Lord's fault, but ours. One thing is required beyond everything else — 
we must not waste what God has given to us. 



Repeated reference has been made to the great council in heaven, 
and to what it meant. One element of it I should like to refer to, 
namely, — what Satan then proposed to do was to give salvation without 
labor, that is, to get something for nothing. This is the spirit which is 
abroad today. It is the spirit which we must fight, or it will destroy 
us. 



Last night I said something about the up-building of hate in the 
world, and about foreign propaganda with which this whole nation is 
being deluged. I warned that this propaganda does not give us the 
whole truth by any means. I indicated that hate, aided by greed, avarice, 
and ambition could overwhelm the world in another world war. I en- 
treated the brethren as I now entreat you brethren and sisters to be chari- 
table towards those people whom the propaganda would condemn un- 
heard. 

I besought the brethren last night, as I now beseech you, to consider 
whether or not we Americans who have gained the most of the land 
which we possess — including that on which we stand — by conquest, and 
whether or not the other great nations who have glutted themselves with 
the spoils of conquest, are in a position to condemn without mitigation 
some other nation which is merely attempting to march along the way 
of empire which we and those other nations followed. I beseech you 
not to put yourselves nor this nation in the position of whited sepul- 
chers. I loathe war, I loathe conquest, I loathe oppression, I loathe the 
destruction of the liberties of men; I love freedom, I love our free 
institutions, but let us not visit upon the people themselves the sins of 
their governments. Let us not make a great body of the membership 
of our Church feel that they are outcasts from us because of the acts 
of their governments. Let us draw the distinction between peoples and 
governments. Let us be patient in our judgment, let us exercise charity. 

Righteousness and hate cannot dwell in the same heart, no matter 
how great the righteousness nor how little the hate. 



I want now to say a few words to the parents, to the teachers and 
to the youth of the Church about a matter that seems to me to be 
of the most far-reaching importance. 

To Moses on Sinai came the law of all time: "Thou shalt not 
commit adultery."

WARNING AGAIST FOREIGN PROPAGANDA 



VIOLATION OF LAWS OF CHASTITY CONDEMNED 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



137 



The Master, Jesus Christ, found his most approbrious term in the 
phrase, "an adulterous generation." 

The Lord in His time and in ours has put adultery and fornication 
side by side. Both are cardinal sins. 

The Church has from the beginning demanded of its youth — male 
and female — one standard only, absolute continence until proper mar- 
riage has legalized and hallowed the sexual relations. To this there is 
no exception. I repeat what I have said before: Man is a biological 
unit, an animal, but he is more than this, he is the temple of an immortal 
spirit ; that spirit can be defiled by the flesh, and defilement comes when 
the laws of chastity are violated. 

Our very civilization itself is based upon chastity, the sanctity of 
marriage, and the holiness of the home. Destroy these and Christian 
man becomes a brute. 

ETERNAL UNION A LOFTY RELATIONSHIP 

For Latter-day Saints the family relationship continues through 
eternity. It is the loftiest and most sacred human relationship we know. 

To the chaste young man and young woman beginning the building 
of a home there is a trust, a confidence, a joy unspeakable, an all but 
divine harmony, that no other purely human undertaking can bring. 
The rightful heritage of such a beginning is a life of righteousness that 
builds upward to eternal life. 

To the unchaste who marry there is ahead either a life of distrust, 
lack of confidence, unhappiness, leading to the divorce court, or a life 
of promiscuous sexual relationships that ends in misery, disease, and 
sham. Debauchery never gave birth to good of any kind. 

CHASTITY TO BE TAUGHT 

Chastity is fundamental to our life and to our civilization. If the 
race becomes unchaste, it will perish. Immorality has been basic to the 
destruction of mighty nations of the past ; it will bring to dust the mighty 
nations of the present. Every one of us who instructs our youth in 
whatever place or position, and in whatever capacity, must teach the 
young people of today to abstain from unchastity. We must surround 
our teachings with due and proper reserve and modesty. We must 
approach and teach the youth as the children of God, with spirits that 
are to live throughout eternity, and tell them plainly and clearly that 
the laws of God, and of men also, demand that they live chaste. If we 
shall teach anything less than this we will destroy our youth and we 
will bring ourselves under a condemnation which is too great to be 
fathomed by human mind, and which God alone can alleviate. 

In what I have said I include all of us parents. How can we par- 
ents face our Maker if we have failed in one featherweight to meet the 
duty which is ours in these matters ? And let us not make the mistake, 
any of us, of assuming that our children are beyond temptation and 
may not fall. This is a delusion and a snare that will bring us to the 



138 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Day 

very depths. Let every father and every mother, every brother and 
every sister, stand guard day and night, that their loved ones be not 
seized and carried away by lust. 

And now you young people — May I directly entreat you to be chaste. 
Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life 
itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me ; it is truth. Better die 
chaste than live unchaste. The salvation of your very souls is concerned 
in this. 

A FRIENDSHIP NOT TO BE TRUSTED 

I ask you to believe me when I say that whenever a man or woman, 
young or old, demands as the price of his friendship that you give up 
the righteous standards of your life, or any of them, that man's friend- 
ship is not worth the price he asks. You may not trust that friendship ; 
he will cast it off as he does his worn-out coat. Friendship is not now, 
and never was, the offspring of debauchery or unrighteousness. 

I ask you young women to believe me further when I say that any 
young man who demands your chastity as the price of his love, is spirit- 
ually unclean, and is offering something that is not worth the purchase 
price ; his love will turn to ashes under your touch ; it will lead you to 
misery and shame ; and too often it will curse you with dread disease. 

To you young men I say that any woman who comes to you offering 
her person outside of legal wedlock, is playing the harlot. 

The Lord has said in our day : "For I the Lord cannot look upon 
sin with the least degree of allowance." (D. and C. 1 :39; Alma 45 :16), 
and to Moses of old he said that no unclean thing can dwell in the 
kingdom of God or in his presence. (Moses 6:57.) 

FORGIVENESS THROUGH REPENTANCE 

Yet there is forgiveness for the sinner who truly repents. God's 
mercy is just as boundless as his justice. To the woman taken in 
adultery, condemned to death by the Mosaic law, Jesus said: "Go, and 
sin no more." (John 8:11.) But the heart must be ripened in repent- 
ance before forgiveness can come, and sorrow alone is not repentance. 
A new and righteous life must be led. 

Church members, young and old, the Lord demands that you be 
chaste ; the Church requires chastity from you under penalty of disf el- 
lowship and excommunication. If any have already sinned, your brethren 
and sisters stand ready and anxious to forgive if you shall come with a 
repentant heart and contrite spirit. 

I have spoken plainly because plain speech is necessary. I have 
tried not to speak indelicately. I have not spoken lewdly. 

A WORD TO SCOFFERS 

To the unbelieving scoffer who says, "All you say merely shows 
how old and out of date your religion is," — or, as one educator said, 
"How much your religion is of the kindergarten type,"— to the scoffers 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N I ON 



139 



who say that man has outgrown the old God with his rewards and 
punishments, his standards, and that man must now create for himself 
a new God — and this is at the root of much of the modern so-called phil- 
osophy which considers man as creating his God, not God as creating 
His children — to these scoffers it is sufficient to say that thus have their 
kind spoken since Cain tried to find a better way than the one God had 
provided. Thus will they always speak until God shall close their mouths. 

ADVICE TO YOUTH 

Youth, be not disturbed. Be valiant. God lives. The Gospel is 
His way of life. Follow the Gospel path to eternal life. "And this is 
life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ, whom thou hast sent." (John 17:3.) 

May the Lord give us his Spirit, bring home to our hearts the 
necessity of chastity for every man and every woman, for every boy and 
every girl, I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

For the first time since I became President of the Church, we will 
have to fail to hear from all of our General Authorities, and some of our 
Mission Presidents. We cannot stop the clock like the legislature does. 

Our next speaker will be Brother Samuel O. Bennion, and after him 
Brother John H. Taylor. 

Elder Rufus K. Hardy is at home on account of illness, but is 
improving. 

There are just fifteen minutes left. The brethren will have to limit 
themselves to five minutes each, and we shall ask the Mission Presidents 
to save their speeches, the same as Brother Widtsoe is doing, for the next 
time. I think we shall have to have four days of conference in the future, 
or not try to crowd it all in and let every man who takes more time than 
he has been requested learn not to do it again, and that would help us 
out a little. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

Since listening to that fine junior choir that sang so beautifully for 
us yesterday I have been much impressed by the strength of our boys 
and girls in this Church. If that same spirit of improvement is being 
carried on in all branches of this Church, both in the Priesthood quorums 
and in the auxiliary organizations, so that every note and expression 
will ring as true as did the voices of this youthful choir, the Church 
will make wonderful progress in the next few years. 

This Church has had a continual and steady growth. My testimony 
to all is that the youth of Zion are growing in faith, that they are firm 
and true, and that they will hold the places of those who are older when 



140 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 9 Third Day 

these pass on, for the youth of today are the men of tomorrow, and the 
training that they receive every day of their lives is the thing that will 
qualify them for positions of trust. 

We lost, through death, the leader of our Council, President J. 
Golden Kimball, whom so many knew and loved. His departure is a real 
loss to us. In just a short time, however, another man has been found 
who will be able to assist in the responsibilities of our work. And so 
the Lord provides. 

I was in the ministry long enough to see young men fill missions, go 
home, be married, and send me their sons and daughters. I saw fine 
improvement in them. I know that the training the father and mother 
received in the mission field was carried over and was evidenced in that 
boy and girl who came to me. I found faith among the sons and daugh- 
ters of God at home. I found the fathers and mothers who had provided 
the means for the missionaries to accomplish their work and to develop 
into faithful servants of the Lord had in their hearts the spirit and in- 
tegrity of Latter-day Saints. Many of them were not heard of, many 
of them lived their quiet lives, but they contributed of their means and 
of all they had for the preaching of the Gospel. 

In one of the stakes where I went to hold conference, I noted in 
the audience on the first day an aged brother, the kindness in whose eyes 
attracted me. I asked the president of the stake to call him up, but the 
president hesitated. I learned that the man's wife had died and that he 
was living with his children and grandchildren. His beard was unkempt, 
his hair likewise. But he attracted me. The second morning I asked 
again if this brother might speak. The president said : "I am very doubt- 
ful about his wanting to speak." 

In the afternoon that same impression came to me again. I said, 
"Go down and ask him if he wouldn't like to speak. I feel impressed 
to call upon him." And when the invitation was given the old brother 
said : "Yes, I should like to speak," and he stood up and said : "I have 
never been called on a mission, I have been called on to speak only once 
or twice in my life. I helped to build the town and make the roads and 
bridges. I sent every one of -my sons on missions. Where the money 
came from I do not know but I have kept my pledge with my Lord." 

There are many such in the stakes of Zion. I pray the Lord to bless 
these noble souls in their valiant endeavors to carry on. I pray that the 
youth may continue to measure up to their glorious heritage, and I do 
it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I know I speak for the First Council of Seventy when I welcome 
Brother Richard L. Evans as one of our members. I have known him 
for many years. His noble character and fine intellect have been an in- 
fluence for good wherever he has gone. His father died when Richard 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



141 



was a little boy, and was one of the truest men that ever lived. Richard's 
mother has reared a large family. She has faced sorrows with fortitude, 
but always with deep faith in the ways of Providence. 

May I say to President Grant and all the brethren under whose 
direction the First Council works, that the Seventies throughout the 
Church are doing nobly in their quorum activities, and have risen to the 
call to carry the Gospel into the homes of all people. 

To my brethren of the respective quorums, I should like to remind 
you of the words of Paul the Apostle to Timothy, when he said:. 

When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which 
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am 
persuaded that in thee also. 

Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of 
God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 

For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power, and of love, 
and of a sound mind. 

That we may go forward in carrying out the wishes of the First 
Presidency and the quorum of the Twelve to the end that thousands, yea 
millions, of the children of men may be brought to the knowledge of the 
truth, I ask in His name. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 
May I relate these two instances : 

Last week I had the opportunity of going into the Missionary Home 
for a day or two and meeting the splendid missionaries who were about 
to leave for the mission field. Yesterday, one of the missionaries looked 
for me all day and when I went over to my missionary reunion he was 
waiting with his father at the door. Because of something I had said 
or done, he desired that I be the one to ordain him to the office of Seventy. 

When I was twenty years of age and went on my first mission, as I 
came out of the meeting that had been held for my farewell, an old lady 
who was earning her living by washing stood by the door with a shawl 
over her head. She put a dollar into my hand and said to me, "John, 
it is not very much but I would like you to have it. I hope I shall live to 
welcome you back again, for when I go I would like you to say something 
about me at my funeral, because I love you." 

The good things we say and the good things we do bring us happi- 
ness and joy. When we say evil things or do evil things in life, we are 
ashamed and uncomfortable. 

May the Lord help us to be faithful and true to the fine things in 
life, so that we might be helpful to our fellow men, I humbly pray, in 
Jesus' name, Amen. 



142 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 9 Third Dag 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Again I express my gratitude for the singing that we have had, for 
the wonderful "Elijah" oratorio, for the fine speeches that we have heard, 
for the marvelous attendance at this Conference, and for the blessings 
of the Lord that have been with us. 

INVOKES BLESSINGS OPON THE PEOPLE 

I rejoice beyond all else in the growth of faith among the Latter-day 
Saints, and with all the power and authority that God has bestowed upon 
me — and I know as I know that I live that he has directed me from 
boyhood, that he has heard and answered my prayers, that I have had 
revelations, so to speak, from the Lord, and have endeavored to carry 
them out — I pray God to bless every honest-hearted soul at home or 
abroad. I pray that what has been said here may sink deep into the 
hearts of the people, that we will judge not that we be not judged, and 
that we will not condemn people in any of the countries today that are 
doing things that we think they ought not to do, because many of them 
are doing what they are doing because they dare not do otherwise, and 
are just as much opposed to it as we are. 

May the spirit of peace and brotherly love grow among the Latter- 
day Saints. 

Again may I plead with the people to get down on their knees and 
ask God to direct them in every act of life, and then if they get the Spirit 
of God they will feel happy and content in what they do. Do not do 
something that you can not ask God to help you to do. Grow in the light 
and knowledge of the Gospel, and as a servant of God I promise you 
peace and joy and happiness, in the name of our Redeemer, Amen. 

The Choir sang an anthem, "Glory and Praise to God" (Handel), 
after which the benediction was pronounced by Elder William R. Ells- 
worth of the Maricopa Stake Presidency. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The musical exercises for the Friday morning session were furn- 
ished by the Relief Society Singing Mothers, Wade N. Stephens, Con- 
ductor; at the Friday afternoon session by the Woodruff Stake Choir, 
under the direction of John Nielson ; at the Saturday sessions by the 
Moroni High School Choir, Ray Anderson, Conductor ; and at the Sun- 
day sessions by the Tabernacle Choir, J. Spencer Cornwall, Conductor. 
The congregational singing was directed by J. Spencer Cornwall and 
Richard P. Condie. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played b> 
Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

Teachings of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith 

Taken from his sermons and writings as they are 
found in the Documentary History and other 
publications of the Church and written 
or published in the days of the 
Prophet's ministry 



Selected and arranged by the Historian, Joseph Fielding Smith, 
and his Assistants in the Historian's Office of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 



Many of these discourses and writings appear in the Doc- 
umentary History of the Church, but others have not been in- 
cluded in these volumes, but are scattered through the early 
publications of the Church. It has been difficult even for the 
student to obtain these because the old publications are not 
accessible for general use. 

In accordance with the many calls that have been made 
that there be a more extensive compilation of these discourses 
and sayings, the matter was taken up in the Historian's Office 
and such a compilation has been prepared, submitted to the 
First Presidency and passed by them for publication.

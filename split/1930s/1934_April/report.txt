Annual Qonference

A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of great pleasure to me to meet this vast audience. 
I think that this is the largest audience that I recall having seen in this 
house at a Friday conference meeting. It is very gratifying to me to 
see the interest that the people have in our conferences. 

I appreciate the remarkable and wonderful growth of the Church. 
When I look back fifty-one years ago this coming October conference, to 
the time when I became one of the General Authorities of the Church — 
at which time as I recall it we had less than thirty stakes, and now 
we have one hundred and five — I am grateful for the growth of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

RECALLS EARLY TRIP 

I recall my first trip fifty years ago this coming May up into the 
Rexburg country. Rexburg at that time was a branch of one of the 
wards in Cache Valley, and there were fewer than 1300 people belong- 
ing to the Church residing north of the Oneida Stake of Zion. Today 
we have more than 100,000 I am sure, if we go north and west, and up 
into Canada. 

I also recall that just before I was made a member of the Council 
of the Twelve, I visited Oakley and other towns in the vicinity of Oakley. 
One year previous to that time I visited Oakley when it was a branch of 
the Grantsville Ward of the Tooele Stake of Zion. I had to travel to 
Salt Lake City, through the Salt Lake, the Davis, the Weber and the Box 
Elder stakes to Brigham City, and then two days and a fraction west- 
ward to get to a branch of the Grantsville Ward of the Tooele Stake of 
Zion. We now have about half a dozen stakes between Brigham City 
and that section. 

DIVINE AUTHORITY RESTORED 

Each and every year the Church is stronger than it was the year 
before. The Church is progressing, it is not going backward. Men 
may make mistakes, but the Church stands firm.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The Gospel is in very deed the plan of life and salvation. God 
has spoken again from the heavens. God himself has introduced his 
Son Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, to the boy Joseph Smith. 
John the Baptist has laid his hands upon the heads of Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery and given them the authority to baptize, then com- 
manding them to baptize each other. 

Peter, James, and John, the Apostles of Jesus Christ during his 
ministry and after his death, have laid their hands upon the heads of 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored again the apostleship 
to earth. Every gift, every grace, every endowment, every privilege, and 
every authority that was enjoyed in early days by the Saints of God 
during the administration of Jesus Christ and following his crucifixion 
belong to and are enjoyed today by the Latter-day Saints. 

CHAPELS DEDICATED 

Nearly every Sunday during the past six months I have dedicated a 
meeting house or met with various branches in the missions of the 
Church. During the past six months we have dedicated a magnificent 
chapel in Washington, D. C, a credit to the Latter-day Saints and a 
credit to that great city, acknowledged by all with whom I have talked — 
although not so expensive as some other church buildings which cost 
perhaps two, three or four times as much — to be a building equal in 
beauty and construction, for its size, to any of the fine buildings in 
Washington. At the first meeting of the branch some years ago in 
Washington there were five in attendance. More than two thousand 
people attended the dedication of our chapel — of course some of them 
came a second time, and perhaps a third, but people were requested to 
attend but one meeting. It is a matter of satisfaction, to realize that we 
have one of the very finest churches in our chief city, the capital of our 
nation. 

HAVE TRUTH TO GIVE 

It is a source of satisfaction that I can say that I believe that 
every true Latter-day Saint, or every Latter-day Saint who is actually 
living his or her religion, sustains in his or her heart, with prayers and 
good works, the General Authorities of the Church. I am very grateful 
for the truth. 

I remember distributing some pamphlets — in fact several thousand 
— during the Christmas season, entitled, "The Power of Truth." We 
have the truth to give to the world, and no other people has the truth, 
the actual Gospel of Jesus Christ, established by Him. This little 
pamphlet says regarding truth : 

Truth is the rock foundation of every great character. 

And truth is the rock foundation of the Church of Christ, and you 
and I have been blessed with a testimony of the divinity of it. 

It is loyalty to the right as we see it; it is courageous living of our lives 
in harmony with our ideals ; it is always — power. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

TESTIMONY REMAINS 

When we live in harmony with our high ideals we never lose the" 
testimony of the Gospel. We are ever ready and willing to sustain 
those who in the providence of the Lord have been called upon to 
preside over the Church. Those who fail to keep the commandments 
of the Lord and who indulge in fault-finding and criticism are the only 
ones who lose their faith. 

From my childhood until the present time I have no recollection of 
any individual with whom I have been acquainted, who was an honest, 
conscientious tithe-payer, who was listening to and obeying the instruc- 
tions given by the president of the Church, and by the various presidents 
of stakes and bishops of wards, having lost his or her faith. On the 
contrary I have seen many lose their faith who have failed to live up to 
Latter-day Saint ideals and their Gospel knowledge. Some one has said 
that "knowledge without practice is like a glass eye, all for show and 
nothing for use." 

Truth ever defies full definition. Like electricity it can only be explained 
by noting its manifestation. It is the compass of the soul, the guardian of con- 
science, the final touchstone of right. Truth is the revelation of the ideal ; but 
it is also an inspiration to realize that ideal, a constant impulse to live it. 

MISSIONARIES HAPPY 

In no part of the work of God here upon the earth at the present 
time is there such a band of happy, contented, peaceful people as those 
who are engaged in missionary service. Service is the real key to joy. 
When one is giving service for the advancement of humanity, when 
one is working without money and without price, with no hope of 
earthly reward, there comes a real, genuine joy into the human heart 
that I am convinced only those who have experienced the inspiration » 
of the Holy Ghost which comes to them in the mission field know any- 
thing about. 

I can testify in all humility that the three years that stand out most 
prominently in my life are the three years when I was laboring as 
the president of the European Mission. 

LYING SCORED 

Lying is one of the oldest vices in the world — it made its debut in the first 
recorded conversation in history, in a famous interview in the garden of Eden. 
Lying is the sacrifice of honor to create a wrong impression. It is masquerading 
in misfit virtues. Truth can stand alone, for it needs no chaperone or escort. 
Lies are cowardly, fearsome things that must travel in battalions. They are 
like a lot of drunken men, one vainly seeking to support another. Lying is' the 
partner and accomplice of all other vices. It is the cancer of moral degeneracy 
in an individual life. 

Truth is the oldest of all virtues ; it antedated man, it lived before there was 
man to perceive it or to accept it. It is the unchangeable, the constant. Law 
is the eternal truth of nature — the unity that always produces identical results 
under identical conditions. When a man discovers a great truth in nature he has' 
the key to the understanding of a million phenomena ; when he grasps a great 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



truth in morals he has in it the key to his spiritual re-creation. For the individual, 
there is no such thing as theoretic truth; a great truth that is not absorbed by 
our whole mind and life, and has not become an inseparable part of 
our living, is not a real truth to us. If we know the truth and do not live ift, 
our life is — a lie. 

May the Lord help each and every one of us to live the truth is 
my humble prayer. 

CHURCH MAKES NO MISTAKES 

I am very happy indeed to feel that the Church does not make 
mistakes ; that the Church has been true to its divine commission from 
the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph, and in fact from the time of the 
organization of the Church until the present. 

I have heard quite frequently of the inability of your humble 
servant, not having sufficient knowledge and ability, to preside over the 
Church. 

PRESIDENT SMITH'S LAST MESSAGE 

I will read the following statement — and have no recollection of 
having done so before — written at my request, by Bishop David A. 
Smith, Nov. 19, 1918: 

President Grant came into the Beehive House yesterday afternoon to 
inquire as to father's condition, and I suggested that he go in and speak to him, 
but he said he did not want to disturb him. I said, "You had better wait and 
see him, as it may be your last chance to speak to him." 

Father being awake, I told him Brother Grant was there, and he directed 
me to tell Brother Grant that he wanted to see him, and when Brother Grant 
entered the room he took him by the hand and said : 

"The Lord bless you, my boy, the Lord bless you, you have got a great 
responsibility. Always remember this is the Lord's work, and not man's. The 
Lord is greater than any man. He knows whom he wants to lead his Church, 
and never makes any mistake. The Lord bless you." 

This was the last message that President Smith delivered to any one. 

(Signed) DAVID A. SMITH. 

WHILE PRESIDING IN TOOELE 

It fell to my lot before I was twenty-four years of age to be called 
to preside over the Tooele Stake of Zion. I had never made a speech 
of ten minutes in a Church meeting up to that time. I felt then my own 
weakness, but look back with pleasure to having fulfilled the pledge 
made in the short speech delivered in seven and a half minutes. I ran 
out of ideas at the end of that time. That night in the dark I) heard 
a man say in a contemptuous way, "It is a pity that if the Authorities 
of the Church had to send a boy out here to preside over our stake, 
they could not have found one with sense enough to talk for ten minutes." 

They were correct, I lacked the knowledge to talk ten minutes. I 
ran out of ideas in seven and a half minutes by the watch, having timed 
myself. 

We find recorded in the twenty-ninth chapter of Alma that the Lord 
granteth unto men according to their desires, whether they be unto 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. I desired to do my duty. 
I pledged myself there and then to keep the Word of Wisdom to the 
best of my ability ; to labor as diligently as any man in Tooele ; to donate 
of my means as liberally as any man ; and to the best of my ability to 
fulfil the duties and obligations devolving upon me. The man who 
criticized me was looking for an opportunity to find fault, and found it. 

GROWTH THROUGH OBSERVANCE OF DUTY 

I know nothing in the Church that is more serious than fault- 
finding ; and on the contrary nothing that inspires men so much as to 
be observers of the Word of Wisdom, to be honest and conscientious 
with God in the payment of their tithes, and to be honest with their 
fellow men. I have seen men grow and increase in light, knowledge 
and intelligence when they do their duty. 

I was astounded when one as weak as myself was called to be an 
apostle. It seemed almost beyond anything believable that I could 
become the president of the Church. But I am very thankful indeed 
today at being able to sleep with a clear conscience. I am very thankful 
that I have no fault to find except with my lack of ability and my lack 
of knowledge, but not with my lack of energy, or my lack of deter- 
mination and willingness to labor. I am grateful for the little that I 
have accomplished, and rejoice that in all my labors I have found nothing 
that has in the slightest degree weakened my faith in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

POSSESSES KNOWLEDGE 

I do not need to say faith, for I can say knowledge. I know that 
God lives; that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the true and the living God, and that Mormonism, so-called, is in 
very deed the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the plan of life and salvation, 
revealed again from heaven, and that all authority existing on the earth 
at any time has been bestowed again upon men by messengers from 
heaven. 

I rejoice in the marvelous work that is being accomplished in our 
temples, in the restoration to the earth of the privilege of baptizing, 
by the authority of the living God, in behalf of those who have passed 
away, and of performing ordinances which if accepted, will lead the 
dead to life eternal and to salvation, although they may have died 
without a knowledge of the Gospel. 

THE LORD PREPARES THE WAY 

I rejoice that as a young man I fell in love with Nephi, and more 
than any other character — of course excepting always the Savior — 
his life, his example, his teachings have been the guiding stars of my life. 

I have believed, accepted, and preached the following : 

And it came to pass that I Nephi, said unto ray father, I will go and cflo 
the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord givefth 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



no commandment unto the children of men save he shall prepare a way for them 
that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. 

I have no fear but that I can, with the help of the remarkable and 
wonderful men who are associated with me, fulfil every duty and obli- 
gation, every requirement, and commandment that God may give to me. 

THANKFUL FOR WISE COUNSELORS 

I thank God for Anthon H. Lund and Charles W. Penrose — men 
who had a marvelous and wonderful store of knowledge; marvelous 
knowledge of the scriptures, wonderful comprehension of the plan of life 
and salvation; men who had ability to write about and to teach the 
Gospel such as I do not possess. But they gave me all they had ; they 
gave me the best that was in them. 

I rejoice in having for my counselor, my cousin, Anthony W. Ivins. 
I rejoice in his wisdom and his devotion; I rejoice in the remarkable 
mind and ability that was possessed by Brother Charles W. Nibley. 
I rejoice in the wonderful ability of Brother J. Reuben Clark, Jr., who 
is now one of my counselors. I am grateful for these men, for their 
stores of knowledge far beyond my own. 

CONFIDENT CHURCH WILL TRIUMPH 

I acknowledge my own lack of great ability, but I do not lack 
confidence in God. I do not lack in the blessing given to me by President 
Joseph F. Smith. I do not fear that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints will fail to go on, and on, and on, as it has 'been 
doing, and prosper ; while all those who fail to do their duty will fall 
by the wayside. 

AN EARLY EXPERIENCE WITH PLANCHETTES 

I recall that when I was a child there was a great apostasy in the 
Church, known as the Godbeite movement, called the New Move. I 
remember that my dear sainted mother had to sew with needle and 
thread for a living, and finally she did a great deal of sewing in homes 
of people who were rich enough to have sewing machines. When she 
would go to one of these homes to operate a sewing machine and spend 
the day, often late into the night, I was always invited to go there to 
have dinner. Upon one occasion I was in William Godbe's home, known 
as the Octagon House — located on the corner of Second South and 
Second East — which has since disappeared and where there is now 
a large, fine gas station. 

These people were having a glorious time, laughing and screeching, 
in the room in the center of the house which was surrounded by eight 
rooms. They had a planchette, and were receiving messages. They 
came into the bedroom where mother was sewing and said : "Come in 
Rachel, and have a fine time." 

She said, "No, President Brigham Young said that any person who 
would fool with one of those planchettes would be led into spiritualism ;

and spiritualism was, of course, apostasy ; and the fruits of spiritualism 
were insanity and suicide. I will not go in." 

Finally they came into the bedroom and brought the machine with 
them, but it did not work. Later they came back again and said : "Come 
in, Rachel." They had gone back into the other room and were laughing 
and screeching. To my utter astonishment she went in. 

You know children occasionally criticize their parents, as was the 
case with a certain good man. One of his little children spoke up one 
day and said: "Papa, we never have prayers, do we, unless we have 
company ?" As we were walking home that night I said to my mother : 
"What did you go into that room for when Brother Brigham told you 
not to have anything to do with such things ?" 

She laughed and said, "My boy, did you notice that the machine 
did not work in the bedroom when they brought it there?" I said, "Yes." 

"I want to tell you the reason it did not work. I told the Lord that 
I could not prevent their bringing it in there, but to please shut it up, 
and he did. When they asked me to go into the parlor I told the Lord 
that if he would give me the impression in my heart that I could go 
in there and shut up their machine, that it could not work in my presence, 
I would go in. And I received the impression, so I went in, and it 
did not work." 

RESULT OF GODBEITE MOVEMENT 

What was the result of the Godbeite movement? The final result 
was spiritualism on the part of those who remained with it. I was 
told — I do not know how true it is — that William Godbe's wife lost 
her mind — the wife with whom he lived. Of course he had a mani- 
festation that he should not live with the other woman whom he had 
married. William Godbe received a revelation that his brother-in-law, 
my cousin-in-law, Ben Hampton, was to be an apostle of the Church. 
He went up to the toll-bridge over the Bear river, where Ben had a fine 
large adobe house, and served meals. It was the outfitting place for 
people who were going up into Montana. 

Godbe read this revelation to Ben. You know that some people 
say that "damn" is not swearing, it is only emphasis; well, with 
emphasis Ben said : 

If all the rest of your revelations — with emphasis — are as big lies as that, 
you ought to go right down to Brother Brigham and make peace with him, 
because you are getting revelations from the devil. 

The idea of you, a hard-headed business 1 man, who built the first three-story 
rock building ever built in Salt Lake City, who has built smelters and engaged 
in mining and other business, thinking that the Lord would call me to be an 
apostle — a man who never paid any attention to religion, a man who drinks when 
he wants to, smokes when he wants to, and chews tobacco when he wants to, 
a man who gets mad and swears occasionally — he lived a clean life otherwise — 
Billie, go right down to Salt Lake and have it out with Brother Brigham. You 
are getting revelation from the wrong source. 

Years later I was in the Williams hotel in Mil ford, upon the hill 
there, having been over to Beaver as I remember it attending a con- 



i

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ference, and William Godbe and his son and others were stopping at 
that hotel that night. They were on their way from Salt Lake to 
Bullionville, as I remember it, or coming from Bullionville where they 
had mining interests. The next morning we could not find his son, 
and we hunted all over for him. Finally we found his body about 
1,500 feet away from the hotel. He had gone out there and committed 
suicide. 

RECALLS OTHER INSTANCES 

I remember preaching in Los Angeles on one occasion the same as I 
am doing here now, and after the meeting a woman came to Brother 
Joseph W. McMurrin and said she had an ouija board — that is what they 
call it now, it used to be called a planchette — and she thought it was very 
remarkable, but she would never use it again. He tried to get her to let him 
have it and burn it. Oh no, she did not want to burn it. She later com- 
menced using it again. She was in Los Angeles on a visit from Arizona at 
the time I made this talk. She finally landed in the insane asylum in 
Arizona. 

The fruits of the Gospel of Jesus Christ are health and vigor of 
body and of mind and of spirit, and the fruits of spiritualism are insanity 
and suicide. 

I remember that some of the Elders over in England had rented 
a hall on one floor of a building where spiritualistic mediums had 
their seances. They kept inviting the boys to come to their meetings. 
I told them to stay away, saying, "You cannot handle a nasty dirty 
stovepipe without soiling your hands, and you have no business, to be 
on the devil's ground, so stay away. You know you have the truth; 
go on proclaiming and living it, and let them alone." 

Finally the boys pleaded with me to let them go. I said: "All 
right, you can go on one condition" — it was a night meeting — "that is 
that you do not eat anything that day, and that you go there fasting 
and praying to the Lord to prevent them from carrying on their spirit- 
ualistic operations." 

They went to the meeting, and the spiritualists were unable to have 
any seance that night. 

THE TESTIMONY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF 

I rejoice in the testimony of President Wilford Woodruff. One 
night he was at a meeting where they had been having remarkable 
spiritualistic manifestations. Brother Woodruff went there and rebuked 
the spirits and commanded them not to operate through this medium. 
Finally, after they had been assembled for some time and had a Quaker 
meeting, the man who was the medium came down off the platform, 
walked through the audience to where Brother Woodruff was, shook 
his fist in his face and said: "You are the man who is olpposing me 
and preventing me from doing anything here tonight." 

Brother Woodruff said : "Yes, T have the Priesthood of God and 
have rebuked the evil spirits." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

They pleaded with Brother Woodruff to please leave, and he did so, 
and they had the devil's own time, all right. 

A TRIBUTE TO MOTHERS 

I rejoice in the remarkable meeting held here yesterday by our sis- 
ters, the faithful and diligent mothers of the Church. I happened to 
pick up a book this morning before getting out of bed, and read from 
it a tribute to mothers — to your mother, to every fine Latter-day Saint 
mother : 

The sweetest word in the Language of Languages is that of — Mother. There 
is in each letter of this word a wealth of music so divine — there are vibrating chords 
of Love so Angelic — that the whole world often pays homage to Mothers whom 
it honors. 

Nancy Hanks — the mother of Lincoln; Frances Willard and Jane Addams 1 — 
mothers of the motherless ; Queen Victoria — the mother of a nation of mothers. 

You — whoever you are — your greatest asset is your mother. You — bankrupt, 
discouraged, failure-riddled, hope-wasted, heart-wrenched, self-estranged — there 
remains still a day, glorious in sunsets for you if you will but get back again, 
in thought, or heart, or person — to your, mother. 

The most wonderful event in the history of the world was when the first 
woman became — a mother. Human life has become a beautiful thing because 
the world has had its mothers. 

HONORED BY CHURCH 

No other Church has ever honored mothers as has the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — through the instrumentality of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, by establishing the female Relief Society. 

The greatest men in any community are those who render the highest 
tribute to motherhood. No one ever has surpassed, or ever will surpass the 
achievement of a woman when she becomes a mother. When did you last write 
to your mother? If she has gone from you, how often do you think of her? 
Do you realize that all you are or ever hope to be started back in the years 
when your mother, her whole being pulsating with pride, held you tight, with eyes 
lustered and watered with love, watched your every breath, and kept pace, over 
the hours, with your faintest heart throbs? Think of how, all through these days 
she wrapped you in her unselfishness and her sacrifices. 

The measure of your success will be the degree of honor you pay to your 
mothers and to motherhood. 

PRAISES OWN MOTHER 

I stand here today as one whose mother was all to him. She was 
both father and mother to me ; she set an example of integrity, of de- 
votion and love, of determination, and honor second to none. I stand 
here today as the president of the Church because I have followed the 
advice and counsel and the burning testimony of the divinity of the 
work of God, which came to me from my mother. 

There came into my home when I was a child a great man of the 
world, a man of great importance, a man who once offered me a magni- 
ficent position carrying $40,000 a year as salary, and who thought 
I was very foolish not to take it when the Church at that time did not 
allow me a tithing of that amount. This man wrote me from London ; 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he was at that time manager for the entire United Kingdom of the 
great New York Life Insurance Company. He said, "What has 
become of your cousin? I often said to my wife" . . (and by the way 
this man came into our home when he was a young unmarried man, 
he came here on the overland stage; later he came with his wife, and 
finally his first child was born in our home. He became one of the 
dearest and best friends the Latter-day Saints ever had.) 

INQUIRED FOR ELDER IVINS 

He said: "I often said to my wife, Mrs. Hawes" (this man was 
Col. Alexander G. Hawes) "that those two boys, Anthony W. Ivins 
and Heber J. Grant, will some day stand right at the top of the 'Mor- 
mon' Church, it is in them. Here you are, an apostle, and president 
of a bank, and I haven't heard of your cousin. What has become of 
him ?" I answered, "Colonel, he has. gone to Mexico. He has filled 
two missions in Mexico, and if there is any place in the world he did 
not want to go, it was Mexico. But he has gone — why? Because he 
has been called to go there, and he will stay there and live and die there 
unless he is called back." 

THANKFUL FOR TESTIMONY 

I thank God for a testimony that came to me, the eternal part of 
me, the day Brother Ivins was called to Mexico. Brother George Q. 
Cannon made the remark, "I do not want Brother Ivins to go to Mexico, 
we need him here. He is the outstanding man in his party in Utah, 
but I believe the Lord wants him there." When he was called I felt 
a little sad, and while thinking about it, the Lord saw fit to give me 
this word : "You need not feel bad, he is going where the Lord wants 
him to go and you shall have the exquisite joy of welcoming him back 
into this room as one of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ." I 
was in the Apostles' room in the temple at the time. I turned my head 
and wept for joy. 

COLONEL HAWES' TRIBUTE 

I rejoice that Brother Ivins had such a wonderful mother — my own 
mother's sister. Two women more true, two women with greater serenity, 
two women who lived finer lives, always speaking well of every one 
or keeping still, I have never known. This same Col. Hawes wrote to 
me when my mother died — he was agnostic — and said : "If the God of 
nature ever did stamp peace, nobility, and serenity upon any human 
countenance, he did upon the face of dear Aunt Rachel." My cousin 
Caddie Ivins waited on the table at the time of Col. Hawes' visit and 
she balled mother "Aunt Rachel," and the boarders adopted that title. 
The Colonel told the president of that great insurance company with 
which he was associated, that of all the women he had ever known in his 
life, barring only his sister, his mother and his wife, he had never met 
a woman that he admired and loved so much as he did my mother. The 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



17 



president of the company told me this, and extended his sympathy to me 
when I met him after the death of my mother. 

Talk about sacrifice ! Why, the sacrifice of the women of this 
Church and their devotion are beyond the power of pen and tongue 
of man to pay proper tribute. 

May God help us to follow the teaching and example of our 
mothers who are true Latter-day Saints, and there will be an eternity 
of joy and an exaltation in store for each and every one of us ; and that 
we may receive it is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, 
our Savior, our Redeemer, even so. Amen. 

At the request of President Heber J. Grant the congregation arose 
and sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I appreciate very much the excellent testimony that has been given 
to us this morning and the wonderful tribute paid by President Grant 
to his mother. So I also can pay a tribute to my mother, and I treasure 
in my heart her teachings, which have helped me so wonderfully and have 
been a guide to my path, and I think that most of us could testify likewise. 

This morning I would like to address my remarks more particularly 
to the presidents of stakes and bishops of wards, and all presiding 
officers, and the clerks who are called upon to keep the records in the 
stakes and wards and missions of the Church. 

IMPORTANCE OF RECORD-KEEPING 

Record-keeping is very important. When the Church was organ- 
ized one of the first revelations that the Lord gave was to the effect that 
records should be kept, a record of the members, a record of events, 
everything of importance, and one of the brethren was chosen to be the 
recorder. He was Oliver Cowdery. Later, because of other duties, this 
responsibility was placed upon the shoulders of another. But the Lord 
has emphasized from the beginning the need of keeping records in the 
Church. In fact we read in the marvelous records that have come to us 
through revelation that in the beginning the Lord gave this command- 
ment to men. 

I want to read a verse from the Pearl of Great Price, perhaps more 
than one : 

And then began these men to call upon the name of the Lord, and the Lord 
blessed them 

This was in the days of Adam and his immediate posterity. 

And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the 
language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write 
by the spirit of inspiration ; 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And by them their children were taught to read and write, having a language 
which was pure and undefiled. 

Now this same priesthood, which was in the beginning, shall be in the end of 
the world also. 

Now this prophecy Adam spake, as he was moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
and a genealogy was kept of the children of God. And this was the book of the 
generations of Adam, saying: In the day that God created man, in the likeness 
of God made he him ; 

In the image of his own body, male and female, created he them, and 
blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created and 
became living souls in the land upon the footstool of God. 

Abraham has also given, in the writings that have come to us from _ 
him, a statement that I also want to read : 

But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of 
Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands ; therefore a knowl- 
edge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars, 
as they were made known unto the fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and 
I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this record for the benefit of 
my posterity that shall come after me. 

We are very fortunate in the fact that these worthies who held the 
Priesthood and were in communication with God in those ancient times 
did receive inspiration and revelation, and recorded the word of the Lord 
to them which has come down to us, much of it of course in a corrupted 
form, but nevertheless the word of the Lord, and we have profited be- 
cause of it. 

Today the Lord has spoken and has again given revelations to the 
Church, and is now giving revelations to the Church ; in fact we have 
received more apparently than we are willing to keep, and yet the Lord 
is willing and ready to bless us with inspiration and knowledge and truth. 

In section fifty-nine of the Doctrine and Covenants he says that he 
will give us commandments not a few when we are ready to receive them. 

Now I want to impress upon those who are keeping records in this 
Church the importance of record-keeping. We are trying to get the 
clerks to follow the instruction which has been given them and send to 
us a detailed history of the stakes, and we want the clerks in the wards 
to keep a detailed history of the wards, and furnish information to us 
quarterly, that we may file it in the archives of the Church. We are 
asking presidents of stakes and bishops of wards, also mission presi- 
dents, to carefully supervise and scrutinize these prepared histories of 
the missions and stakes and wards, and then sign with their own names 
the history before it comes to be filed in the archives of the Church, 
stating that to their best knowledge and understanding that which is 
written is correct. We want them to see that everything of importance is 
recorded. We are under the necessity very frequently of sending letters 
out to a great many of the stakes and some of the missions and asking 
them to see that the history which is delinquent is forwarded. We would 
like to have these records sent to us on time. 

INFORMATION FURNISHED BY HISTORIAN 

Frequently, yes, hardly a week passes that people do not write 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



19 



to us or come into the office seeking information concerning themselves. 
They want to know when they were baptized, they want to know when 
they were ordained, and sometimes they want to know when they were 
born — that isn't a joke, it is an actual fact. We receive communications 
from the Government sometimes asking us to verify records of this kind. 
I think that every member of the Church ought to keep a record of vital 
things for himself. When a man is baptized he should make a record 
of it. When he is confirmed, when he is ordained, when other duty or 
responsibility or call comes to him he should make a record of it and keep 
it himself ; but it is also the duty of the clerk in the ward or in the 
stake, as the case may be, to also make a record of this and have it put into 
the history of the ward or stake, where it can be preserved. 

We can furnish a great deal of information for people if they do 
not want us to go back too far. The early records of the Church were 
not kept as thoroughly as they should have been. We have learned a 
great many things by experience. Today our records are kept in a much 
better way, and yet at times things escape the notice of those who are 
called to make the records. 

Now this is a vital problem. We should not depend solely upon the 
Church to keep our individual records, and yet the individual record of 
each member of the Church today is kept. The Presiding Bishop's 
office is working in full harmony with the Historian's office in regard to 
matters of this kind and through them we are enabled to keep in better 
touch with these officers who are appointed to keep the records than we 
would be if we did not have the machinery of the bishops often at our 
command. 

recorder's office an important one 

Now, brethren, I am appealing to the presidents of stakes and 
bishops to see that these records are properly kept. Let me say further 
that the choosing of a clerk and recorder is a very important thing. 
Sometimes we think that anybody can keep a record. It requires intel- 
ligence to do so. A man ought to have keen discernment, he ought to 
be able to segregate facts, he ought to be able to choose and record the 
things that are important and separate them from the things that are 
perhaps unimportant, and make a record of them. Our custom in record- 
ing is to take more than we need rather than less. We can always elimi- 
nate if something is recorded that we do not need, but it is sometimes a 
very difficult thing to find something that we have overlooked. 

INDIVIDUAL RECORDS 

And so I am making this appeal at this general conference of the 
Church to all the members of the Church to keep their records, the 
records of their families, to look after the interests of their families in 
regard to their temple work as well as to their individual records. The 
Lord has called upon us to look after our dead, to seek out their gene- 
alogy. This spirit has gone forth, the keys that were bestowed by Elijah 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are here, and the hearts of the children have turned to their fathers. One 
of the greatest evidences of the truth of the story told by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith that Elijah came to him and Oliver Cowdery is the fact 
that people who are not connected with this Church, who have no sym- 
pathy perhaps with the Church, are gathering the records of the dead. 
Their hearts have turned to the fathers. Our duty of course is to seek 
after our dead. We have a department in the Church, the Genealogical 
Society of Utah, where we are gathering in these records for the benefit 
of the members of the Church, where we can receive information, and 
are able to give help and encouragement in relation to these matters that 
pertain to the salvation of our families. 

PATRIARCHAL RECORDS AND PRIVATE JOURNALS 

All patriarchal records belong to the Church and not to the patri- 
archs who gave the blessings. Neither do they belong to the families 
of the patriarchs. When a patriarch has completed his record, or when 
he dies, the record should be sent to the Historian's office to be filed. 
Many of these records have not been received, and in some instances 
the descendants of the patriarchs have claimed them as personal property, 
and this is wrong. Moreover, there are many important private journals 
scattered about which we would like to obtain for preservation and for 
historical purposes. We discover that when these are left in the keep- 
ing of the descendants of the pioneers, they frequently are lost, or lose 
their value by the time they reach the third or fourth generation, and are 
thrown away. If they are given to us we will file them away where they 
will be preserved. 

May the Lord bless and guide us in these things. They are important. 
We sometimes look upon them as being trivial. The Lord expects us 
to keep records and to put in permanent form all things that pertain to 
our welfare in relation to our history, individually as well as the history 
of the Church. May we be guided in it, I pray, in the name of 'Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is just twenty-eight years since I was called into the Council of 
the Twelve. As I listened to President Grant this morning I looked 
introspectively into my own soul, and thought this : 

"Never before in my life have I felt so grateful for my membership 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Never before have 
I felt more intensively how beneficial the Church has been to me and my 
loved ones. Never before has my testimony been stronger. Never 
have I felt so deeply in every fiber of my being that this Church was 
established by God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, and that the 
men who have guided its destiny have been inspired by the revelations 
of God to them."

PAYS TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS AND TEACHERS 

I desire to say a word this morning about the Church and the oppor- 
tunity it offers to the young people of the Church. I should like to pay 
a tribute to these bishops and to other ward officers who are working 
so unselfishly and conscientiously for the establishment of truth in the 
hearts of men. I should like to express a word of appreciation to the 
officers and teachers of the auxiliary associations who are rallying around 
them the army of young people and instilling into the hearts of the youth 
faith in the Church of Jesus Christ. I want to express also a word of 
appreciation to the leaders in Priesthood quorums. I think that never 
before has there been such a quorum consciousness manifested as is 
manifested at the present time. 

SUCCESSFUL CONVENTIONS 

Since January 1st, 1934, the General Board of the Sunday Schools 
has held a number of conventions. In the stakes of Zion we havte 
approximately 21,000 officers and teachers enrolled. Of these 21,000 
invited to attend the conventions already held we have had an average 
attendance of eighty-three per cent. That is a good response. Seven 
stakes, comprising eighty-four wards, have been in attendance one 
hundred per cent. That is not counting the presidencies of stakes, high 
councilors, bishoprics, and members of Priesthood quorums who were 
invited and in many cases were in attendance with a perfect record. We 
have had a total of 172 wards who have had a perfect attendance at 
these conventions. Estimating an average of about fifteen officers and 
teachers to a ward, these conventions have been attended by more than 
two thousand five hundred young people. Most of these people who 
have been attending these meetings are young men and young women 
between the ages of eighteen and twenty-seven. 

More gratifying even than this outstanding record of attendance, 
is the attitude of these young people towards the theme presented and 
expounded in the various sessions. This theme is expressed in the first 
article of the "Children's Charter" — "For every child spiritual and moral 
training to help him to stand firm under the pressure of life." 

SEEKING AND DESIROUS OF LIVING THE TRUTH 

We hear a good deal of talk about our young people these days. 
Some say that they are indifferent, that they are losing their interest in 
the Church. I do not agree with this accusation. My experience with 
the young leads me to believe that there was never a time when youth 
more sincerely sought the truth,, when they were more responsive to 
assignments made in the Church, when they were more observant of the 
ideals for which this Church stands. 

Oh, I am not blind to the fact that there are those who are wavering. 
I also know that there were young people during our youth who wavered. 
I realize that there are those who stand on the side lines, and arro- 
gating to themselves superior wisdom which they do not possess, would 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fain guide and dictate, but there have always been such. The great 
majority of our young people are desirous of living the truth. 

WIELDING AN INFLUENCE FOR GOOD 

I realize that temptations were never stronger than they are today ; 
but the young people who resist these temptations deserve all the greater 
credit. We hear about young boys and young girls who indulge in 
things contrary to the teachings of their parents and the officers of the 
Church, and contrary to the ideals of the Gospel, but we too seldom 
hear about the much larger group who are exerting an influence for good 
upon their fellow-workers and upon their associates. 

If time permitted I might narrate several specific instances in which 
our girls have wielded an influence upon their associates and led not 
only members of the Church but people outside of the Church to lay 
aside violations of the Word of Wisdom, and to conform to the ideals 
and principles of purity of life. 

AS A RESULT OF RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS 

Religion is the most potent power in life. Spiritual development 
and moral integrity are fundamental in the lives not only of the Latter- 
day Saints but of all who would build a community that will contribute 
to the safety and advancement of our republic or of any other nation. 
President Calvin Coolidge truly said that "the government of a country 
never gets ahead of the religion of a country. There is no way by which 
we can substitute the authority of law for the virtue of man. Of course 
we can help to restrain the vicious and furnish a fair degree of security 
and protection by legislation and police control, but the real reforms 
which society in these days is seeking will come as a result of our re- 
ligious convictions, or they will not come at all. Peace, justice, humanity, 
charity — these cannot be legislated into being. They are the results of 
a Divine Grace." 

LATTER-DAY SAINT STANDARDS 

I have observed during the past few months a most hearty response 
by the young people of our Church to spiritual ideals. Generally speak- 
ing youth are anchored. Sometimes they seem to waver and digress 
from the standards. Some of them it is true lose their virtue, the most 
benighting and cankering condition that can contaminate young people's 
lives. I know that there is a looseness in sexual morality which is dan- 
gerous, which indeed is threatening. I know too that such breaking down 
of moral standards is manifested not alone among the young people, 
and I warn the Church to guard against unchastity. Keep yourselves 
unspotted from the world, the fundamental element in pure religion. 

No, we are not shutting our eyes to the dangers, but I want to tell 
you we must not shut our eyes to the virtues of the tens of thousands of 
those who are true and valiant. 

Spirituality and morality as taught by the Latter-day Saints are 
firmly anchored in fundamental principles, principles from which the 
world can never escape even if it would, and the first fundamental is a 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



23 



belief — with Latter-day Saints a knowledge — in the existence of a per- 
sonal God. Latter-day Saint children have been taught to recognize 
him, and to pray to him as one who can listen and hear and feel just as 
an earthly father can listen, hear and feel, and they have absorbed into 
their very beings, from their mothers and their fathers, the real testimony 
that this personal God has spoken in this dispensation. There is a reality 
about it. 

THE PERSONALITY OF GOD 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, but a youth, did not argue upon the 
personality of God, he did not speculate upon that eternal source of energy, 
and intelligence from which all life gets its being, he merely stated the 
truth. Nearly a hundred years later another man through thought and 
reason confirmed this truth as follows : 

Religion standing on the known experience of the race, makes one bold and 
glorious affirmation. She asserts that this power that makes for truth, for beauty, 
for goodness 1 , is not less personal than we. This leap of faith is justified because 
God cannot be less than the greatest of his works ; the cause must be adequate to 
the effect. When therefore, we call God personal, we have interpreted him by 
the loftiest symbol we have. He may be infinitely moral, he cannot be less. When 
we call God a spirit, we use the clearest lens we have to look at the everlasting. 
As Herbert Spencer has well said, "The choice is not between a personal God 
and something lower, but between a personal God and something higher." 

Thus anchored in the faith, our young people have the foundation 
of spirituality and the teachings of materialistic philosophy cannot dis- 
lodge them. Next to this belief in a Supreme Being is the testimony 
they have that God is revealed through his Son Jesus Christ, the one 
perfect being who is the light and life of the world. 

A MEANS OF CONSUMMATING GOD J S PURPOSES 

The third anchor of the young people is in the realization that the 
Church is established as a means of consummating God's purposes ; and 
they realize too, even if they have not thought it out as they will some 
day, that there is nothing in the world to compare with the Church of 
Jesus Christ as an effective organization in alleviating the ills of mankind. 

And now, young people, thus anchored in the faith, and thus 
organized, we ask you to join the organizations in your wards, to heed 
the advice of the President of the Church, to affiliate with your quorums, 
with your auxiliary organizations, in your fast meetings, and there 
in these local groups express your thoughts, express your doubts, seek 
after the truth, apply measures that will appeal to those of your 
associates, and when you prove those measures to be effective and 
satisfying to the soul, then can the central organizations take those 
measures and adapt them to the whole as a universal benefit. In that 
way, and in that way only, will progress and efficiency be fostered. 
Don't stand out on the side lines, and say "This quorum is not doing 
its work," but get into the quorum and help it do its work. That 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

is the way which God intends people to work in this Church, and it 
offers to you one of the best opportunities in the world. 

AS A MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 

Finally the consummation of God's purposes is put in these words : 
"My work and my glory is to bring to pass the immortality and the 
eternal life of man." This divine purpose may be achieved by using 
the Church as a means of accomplishing the following specific objectives 
in the achievement of which lies a sufficient challenge for the brightest 
minds in the world : 

First, physical strength, virility, cleanliness. When therefore you 
hear carping critics say that the Church Authorities over-emphasize the 
Word of Wisdom, you may know that they have not studied very deeply 
the significance of the Word of Wisdom. Fundamentally, physical 
strength and virility are essential factors in the progress of humanity. 

Secondly, economic security. When you hear a young man say we 
lay too much stress on tithing, you may know he does not realize the 
relation of tithing and fast offerings to the economic security of every 
man, woman and child in the Church. 

Thirdly, social justice. Go into any quorum and see who are meet- 
ing there — your lawyers, your doctors, your farmers, all meeting on a 
social plane. In the Chruch of God every man and woman has equal 
privileges to every other man and woman. 

Fourthly, spiritual enlightenment. Cultivating the fruits of the 
Spirit which are love, joy, peace, kindness, long-suffering, gentleness, etc. 

THE PRINCIPLES OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY 

In conclusion, let me say that now, if ever, is the time to make 
practical the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to strive to live up to the prin- 
ciples of true Christianity. Wm. P. King in "The Practice of the Prin- 
ciples of Jesus" says : 

Mankind has tried everything except Christianity. The world has tried hatred, 
greed, impurity, graft, self-interest, and has been brought to the brink of perdition. 
It is curious that we must stand up in the twentieth century and plead with the 
people who bear his name, that Jesus Christ was not a foolish ruler, a visionary 
leader, that His word is the illuminating word; that His way is the living way; 
that it is only safe to trust and follow Him. The church must liepent of her 
lukewarmness and rebuke with prophetic wrath the selfishness of men and break 
her cowardly silence and say to the world, "We have let you run affairs after 
selfish pagan methods until you have come unto the brink of ruin. Unless you 
Christianize your industrial system it cannot last. Unless you Christianize your 
institutions they cannot endure. Other foundations can no man lay than that is 
laid which is Jesus Christ." Too long have we imagined that the principles of 
Christ were for some other world. We have put the kingdom He came to establish 
beyond the stars, but this was not the purpose of His mission, this is not the 
meaning of His gospel. His laws are to be followed in the world in which we live, 
now and here, in street and market and factory. It will only be through obedience 
to moral law, the Sermon on the Mount and the Golden Rule and wholehearted 
response to the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man and a suffering 
love of Jesus Christ that there can ever be frictionless society in our world.

God be thanked and praised for his Church, for the authority of 
the Priesthood, for the opportunity it offers to young people of the 
Church to obtain happiness through service. May they have power and 
interest to take advantage of these opportunities, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The hymn, "Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation," was sung 
by the congregation. 

Elder Charles Wl Fagg, President of the Grant Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

President Heber J, Grant called the second session of the Confer- 
ence to order at 2 o'clock, and announced that The Singing Mothers, 
(Relief Society Chorus) under the direction of Sister Charlotte O. 
Sackett, would furnish the music for this meeting. 

The Chorus and congregation sang the hymn, "God moves in a 
mysterious way." 

Elder Charles C. Heaton, President of the Kanab Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A sacred selection, "Sleepers wake," was sung by The Singing 
Mothers Chorus. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am very grateful today to be with you, my brethren and sisters, 
in this, the second session of our conference. I trust that the Spirit of 
the Lord will continue with us, that we may be edified under the influence 
of the same, and that when we go from here we may feel that it has been 
profitable and that we have indeed waited upon the Lord. 

A DIMINISHING FAITH IN GOD 

During the last few months some things have occurred that have 
been more or less distressing to me, one being the evidence that there is 
a diminishing faith in God. Only a few weeks ago I read in one of the 
large daily papers a statement of the result of a questionnaire that had 
been sent out to 500 Protestant ministers, men who are leaders in the 
churches of the world, and I was very much disappointed to discover that 
there were those among them who did not believe in a personal God, 
who did not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ, who did not believe 
that there is a heaven, and 54 per cent did not believe in a personal devil. 
I might mention other things, Bible teachings, that were discredited by 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these men, who have been educated to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
in the Christian world. 

Recently I have met quite a number of missionaries, many of them 
young men, some young women, representing the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. They have been able when they were called upon, 
to stand on their feet and testify to the truth of these things that are 
doubted by the men who are supposed to be leaders in Christian churches. 

AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 

I fear that the condition of the world is due to a lack of understand- 
ing of the purpose of our being. They do not know about pre-existence. 
There are so many that seem to have no conception of it, and have no 
desire to know where we are going when our mortal life is ended. 

That was the condition which prevailed in the world when the 
Gospel was restored in the latter days. The Savior, in the meridian of 
time, delivered his message and gave to the people an understanding of 
the truth. Then, when he finished his work, after having organized his 
church, he left them, went back to his Heavenly Father and is enthroned 
in the heavens. We are the recipients of the benefits and blessings enjoy- 
ed by humankind as a result of his marvelous life here upon the earth. 

A little over a hundred years ago there were few people in the world 
who believed in a personal God with a body. But a manifestation came 
at that time to the Prophet Joseph Smith, when he was only a boy, not 
yet fifteen years of age, and he saw the Father and the Son and so 
testified. He also received visitations from other heavenly beings, and 
the Lord, through them gave him additional information for the children 
of men, and he, in his own way, gave to us, or to those who preceded us 
in the Church, an understanding of the purpose of life. The Lord 
blessed him in his ministry, but like many of the prophets who had lived 
before him, he became a martyr for the truth. 

DIVINE TRUTHS REVEALED THROUGH A PROPHET 

Before his death thousands of good men and women accepted him 
as a prophet and gathered at Nauvoo, Illinois, and erected a beautiful 
Temple. Mob violence deprived them of their homes and they were 
driven to the wilderness, arriving in this then desolate valley July 24, 
1847. They believed in God the Eternal Father and in his Son Jesus 
Christ and accepted his Gospel as the only plan that would insure them 
a place in the Celestial kingdom. His description of heaven inspires 
us with a desire to foe worthy of a home there when our earthly lives 
are finished. A literal resurrection and a description of heaven and hell 
are made so plain that, to use a scripture, "a wayfaring man, though a 
fool, need not err therein." 

All that information that was given to Joseph a little over a hundred 
years ago has been passed on by a community of people that were driven 
from their homes in the East, who came to this western land and estab- 
lished themselves here. They have been subduing the land, building 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



27 



homes and cities, and in the meantime they have been sending mission- 
aries into all parts of the world to disseminate the truth. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MANKIND 

I can understand how careless men might be with the rights of 
others, if they believe that in this life only we have hope. They would 
not be as considerate of their fellows if they did not understand the pur- 
pose of life. There has been bequeathed to us who are here today, and 
our associates in this Church, the responsibility of delivering a message 
to the children of men, carrying it into all the world so that others will 
understand it, and so that those who do not know may be brought to 
repentance of sin, and turn to righteousness. 

I asked myself today, as I looked into the faces of this fine congre- 
gation, how many of us have performed our part ? How many of these 
men who are in presiding positions have been in the world, and given 
their time and their means to divide with our Father's children the truth 
that has been restored again in this latter day ? There are thousands of 
men in this audience, and it is probable that by far the majority of those 
who are here, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, have been in the 
mission field. You have not only given two or more years of your lives 
as ambassadors of our Lord but you have borne the expense necessary 
to accomplish your missions, for which you may receive an eternal bless- 
ing. 

It is our duty to teach the truth. The Lord has called us to do that 
and we should qualify, not only to teach it to the world, but to live it in 
our own homes, in all our communities. Only in proportion to our ob- 
servance of the teachings of the Lord will happiness come into our lives. 

To believe that we are the children of the Lord, that he is the Father 
of our spirits, that we are living eternal lives, is surely a comfortable 
feeling. To know that we may have the companionship of those we love 
throughout the ages of eternity is an inspiration. These blessings have 
come to us. The Lord has bestowed them upon us to prepare us to take 
advantage of our opportunities here, and to exemplify in our lives those 
precious truths that enrich us here and bless those with whom we asso- 
ciate. 

THE ONLY MEANS OF SECURING PEACE AND HAPPINESS 

There is much confusion in the world and there seems to be no way 
to remove it except by the power of our Heavenly Father. The wisdom 
of the world is failing, the scripture is fulfilled, and today the wisest of 
all men are seeking, by means of legislation, to bring about a better con- 
dition and a more wholesome life among the human family. They may 
strive in that way, but unless men have faith in God, unless they under- 
stand the purpose of life, they will not go very far. The people of the 
world must repent of their sins before the Lord can give to them the 
peace and happiness desired. No other plan will succeed. 

OUR PRIVILEGE AND DUTY 

So upon you, my brethren, who hold the Priesthood, much respon- 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sibility is placed. We have an understanding of the truth. It is your 
duty and mine to live the Gospel, and to disseminate the truth as we 
have opportunity. It is your privilege and mine to carry the message of 
life and salvation to the children of men. There are many who have 
no idea of the purpose of this Church. I have had men ask me: "Of 
what benefit is your church more than some other church ?" I have tried, 
in a tactful way, to explain to them the difference. Any organization 
may band together for worship, but that does not give them divine author- 
ity. Any group of churches may mass together and organize community 
churches. That does not confer divine authority. Men may unite for 
good purposes, but authority from our Heavenly Father is only obtained 
in his way, and his way in former days was by calling and ordaining 
men and setting them apart for the work. The same thing is true in 
our day. 

PREPARATION FOR CELESTIAL GLORY 

So while we may see the beauties of other faiths, and they may teach 
precious truth, and many wonderful people are identified with the vari- 
ous churches, we must understand that only the Lord's plan will prepare 
them for a place in the Celestial kingdom. The purpose of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ is to prepare us for the Celestial kingdom. The Lord has 
revealed to us that there are other kingdoms of glory, and other king- 
doms not of glory; but in order that men might be prepared for the 
Celestial kingdom he sent his Only Begotten Son into the world. He 
overcame death and found the way of the resurrection, and delivered 
the message of life and salvation to the children of men. We know that, 
brethren, but our Father's children in the world do not understand it. 

Think of the responsibility that is upon us, if in carelessness or in- 
difference we live our lives, not seeking to divide the truth with those 
whom the Lord loves as much as he loves us, and who are precious in 
his sight. I feel that there should be an awakening among some of the 
members of this Church. I think a greater effort should be made to 
divide with our Father's children all the truth that is deposited with this 
Church. 

DIVINE AUTHORITY NECESSARY 

People should be made to understand that just to bow before the 
Lord in prayer does not give them divine authority. To live up to the 
requirements that are made of honesty, virtue, truth, etc., does not give 
them divine authority. Our Heavenly Father has made it plain to the 
children of men that only under the hands of those who possess divine 
authority may we obtain the power to become members of the Celestial 
kingdom. Knowing that, how anxious we ought to be to disseminate 
that information and divide it with those who live in the world. 

I stand here today, fully convinced of the divinity of the mission of 
Jesus Christ. I know it as I know that I live. If I were recreant to 
that knowledge, if I failed to do my part, knowing that, what would my 
condemnation be ? 

I am grateful that in this day and age the Lord has revealed the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



29 



Gospel again. The Father and the Son appeared, men who held the 
Priesthood formerly came and conferred that Priesthood upon humble 
men and they in turn were commanded to confer it upon others. So the 
Gospel and the Priesthood have been made available to all who will 
qualify to receive the same, and that is the Lord's way. 

It is not sufficient that we pray, that we attend church. It is necessary 
that we possess divine authority, and it is the claim that we possess that 
authority that has brought upon this Church much of the persecution 
that has followed it from the beginning. But it is the truth and many of 
our Father's children are beginning to observe the effect of divine author- 
ity in this Church. They see the development that is made in the lives 
of men and women and I think there is more inquiry today after the 
truth, as taught by the Redeemer of mankind, than there has been 
during the last hundred years. I believe the way is opening, and the 
Lord is preparing the hearts of men, that they will be willing to hear 
the truth and accept it. 

PROGRESS OF CHURCH CAN NOT BE IMPEDED BY MAN 

What a glorious opportunity is ours ! The Gospel has been preached 
in this very structure, from this pulpit, for more than half a century and 
we are the fourth, fifth and sixth generations in the Church now living, 
and all this time the adversary has opposed the truth, and he will continue 
to oppose it, but it is our duty to exemplify the beauty of it in our lives, 
that men, seeing our good works, will be constrained to accept the 
Gospel and to glorify the name of the Redeemer. 

Think of the men who have presided over this Church — Joseph 
Smith gave his life without hesitation, when the time came, but he had 
finished his work. The men who have succeeded him in the presidency 
have possessed divine authority. Each of them in their turn has been 
criticized. Fault has been found with their ministry, but they have been 
servants of the Lord and he has recognized them, and they have lived 
long, useful lives, and have blessed the people. 

The conditions are just the same today. The same influences that 
destroyed the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith crucified the Savior. The 
same influences that have betrayed the servants of the Lord in the past 
are in the world today. Knowing that and realizing how futile men have 
been to impede the progress of this Church how grateful we ought to 
be to know that this work is not the work of man, but it is the work of 
the Lord; that this Church, that bears the name of Jesus Christ, is 
directed by him, and he will permit no man or group of men to destroy 
it. He will not permit the men who preside over his Church to lead 
the people into error, but he will sustain them with his almighty power. 
He will magnify them in the eyes of good and great men and women. 
He will bless their ministry and it will be fraught with success. Those 
who oppose and find fault will not find joy in their opposition. Those 
who criticize and seek to destroy the influence of the leaders of the Church 
will suffer the result of their wrong-doing.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE ONLY PLAN 

But let us who know, those of us who have a testimony, go forth 
day by day and with love and kindness unfeigned go among these men 
and women, whether they be in the Church or out of the Church, and find 
a way to touch their hearts and lead them into that pathway that will 
insure them a knowledge of the truth. 

This is the Lord's work. As I said before, men may unite for 
prayer and thanksgiving, but that does not confer upon them divine 
authority. All the churches of the world might unite and agree upon 
one plan of worship, but that would not give them divine authority. 
And if all the churches of the world did agree to some plan, and decide 
that that plan would be sufficient for us here upon earth, that would not 
prepare men for the Celestial kingdom. The only plan that will prepare 
men for the Celestial kingdom is the plan that has been given by Jesus- 
Christ, our Lord ; and the only authority that will qualify men to teach 
and to officiate in the ordinances of the Gospel properly is the authority 
of Jesus Christ, our Lord. 

SHOULD MAGNIFY OUR CALLING 

Now, brethren and sisters, knowing that, how grateful we ought 
to be ; realizing that, how anxious we should be to go about doing good. 
It is a slothful servant who waits until he is commanded in all things. 
Our Heavenly Father expects us to magnify our calling, no matter where 
it may be, no matter how humble our lot in life may be. Let us improve 
our talents, so that when the time comes for the Master to reward us 
according to what we have done, we may receive the blessing that was 
given to two of the three men referred to in the parable of the talents : 
"Well done, good and faithful servant." 

REJOICES IN COMPANIONSHIP OF CHURCH AUTHORITIES 

Again I say I know this is the work of the Lord. I am thankful 
for the companionship of the men with whom I am associated. I am 
grateful to stand at the side of the Presidency of the Church and among 
the Quorum of the Twelve and bear witness that I know that this is 
God's work. I am thankful for my heritage, grateful for the love and 
kindness that have been extended to me by those with whom I have 
associated. 

I pray God, our Father in heaven, that we, his people, may see and 
understand all truth, attune our lives to the righteousness of the teachings 
of the Gospel, and conduct ourselves in such a way that everywhere we 
go men may rejoice in our companionship. If we will do that our homes 
will be the abiding place of peace ; our towns and cities and our country- 
side will be blessed of the Lord. If we will observe the commandments 
of our Heavenly Father we will not suffer for the necessities of life, 
beyond what we can bear, we will not lose the faith, we will not fall into 
darkness, but the light and joy of the testimony that comes from our 
Heavenly Father will fill our souls. That it may do so, I humbly pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 
I will read the platform on which I stand as a member of the Church. 
There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 

One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. 

******* 

And he gave some, apostles ; and some, prophets ; and some, evangelists ; and 
some, pastors and teachers ; 

For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying 
of the body of Christ. 

Till we all come in the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son 
of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of 
Christ. (Ephesians 4) 

On August 6, 1842, Joseph Smith prophesied to the Saints : 

Some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities 
and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith gave instructions to the Apostles at the 
last meeting prior to their leaving on missions : 

I have sealed upon your heads all the keys of the kingdom of God. I have 
sealed upon you every key, power and principle that the God of heaven has 
revealed unto me. 

President Brigham Young said after the martyrdom of the Prophet : 
Thank God, the keys of the kingdom are here. 
President Woodruff said : 

We have already revelations enough to lead this Church into the Celestial 
kingdom of God. We are not without revelation. The heavens are full of it and 
so also is the priesthood of God. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is established and perfectly 
organized, and the keys will remain with the Church until the coming of the Son 
of Man, which means until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in the cl'ouds 
of heaven, to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body. 

The machinery of the Church is working perfectly : Semi-annual, 
stake, and ward conferences are being held ; auxiliary organizations are 
doing their part as helps in the Church. The people are taught and 
fully instructed. 

Thank God we have in our Church men whom God hath chosen, who 
have a genius for expression, and who are so vivid that when such men 
talk to people they repent of their sins and serve God and keep his com- 
mandments. 

Our Eternal Father, the Ruler of the Universe, is working for his children 
daily. He is rolling up the sun of morning, making wheat, and fruit and vegetables 
grow ; keeping our hearts and lungs going ; carrying water from the ocean and 
sprinkling it Over the land. In short, he too goes on loving again and again as 
long as we live, and he too finds joy in service to his children who are thankless 
and unappreciative most of the time.' 

Jesus Christ in his ministry could have built up a kingdom. He 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



could have built cities, temples, tabernacles, and ivory palaces, had armies 
and navies, and forcefully proclaimed himself a king, a ruler. He could 
have won the crowds, could have filled his time with appointments with 
rich and influential folk, who would have contributed to the establish- 
ment of a temporal kingdom. 

Jesus Christ taught the people a simpler way. Some of the out- 
standing wayside ministries of Jesus, some of the incidents which reveal 
Christ's methods of teaching, were his conversation with the woman at 
the well, his approval of Mary's lavish outpouring of the precious oint- 
ment in expression of her love, the turning of the water unto wine, 
the healing of Simon's wife's mother, the washing of the disciples' feet, 
the stilling of the storm-tossed waves. 

Jesus took time to heal the sick and to bless, to talk with the heart- 
weary, to comfort the discouraged. His time was largely spent in 
kindly "wayside ministries" and it was not counted as wasted time. 

We can hardly think of Jesus Christ as feeling himself interrupted 
by the sick and weary who at eventide crowded around the house where 
he tarried. 

The visit from the rich young ruler, the midnight meeting with 
Nicodemus, the time of the service at the wedding feast, are just as im- 
portant as are those incidents where he preaches to the crowds or feeds 
the hungry multitudes. 

The more we think of and study Christ's way of living and preach- 
ing the more we are impressed that there was a lack of fixed formalities 
or haste in his plan of work. There were no false standards of time, no 
statistics, no wrong estimates of the great importance of numbers. His 
mission was to minister to seeking hearts anywhere and at any time. The 
only time, so far as we know, that Jesus excluded himself was when 
he went aside alone to pray. 

How strikingly in contrast with our modern conception of the 
value of time, and of organization, and of efficiency, which so completely 
fills our days with one pressing engagement after another, running hither 
and thither, until we have little or no time to minister to the needy, the 
hungry, the naked, the disconsolate ones who are ever with us. It would 
almost seem that materialism and selfishness and greed have nearly 
driven out of us that Christlike spirit. 

We as Latter-day Saints, holding the Priesthood as we do, should 
become more intimately acquainted with Jesus Christ, who is the Way, 
the Truth, the Life, and let Christ's spirit of self-forgetfulness and 
service take possession of us and "seek ye first the kingdom of God and 
his righteousness." 

It is disquieting to talk about it. 

"Many are called and few are chosen." 

The people who were in a hurry crucified Christ. What was Christ 
thinking about when he was nailed to the cross ? 

"There is safety in thought, but great danger in the expression of 
one's thoughts." The idea some have is to think and study but keep 
still and not talk. That is, you just sit on the fence and be a cud-chewing 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

cow and watch the procession go by. You listen and hearken and let 
knowledge sink into your soul, just as a sponge absorbs water, and 
answer in monosyllables. Some wise men never express a thought. 
Why? Because they trust in the arm of flesh. Fear creeps into their 
hearts. 

That is to say, you assume an air of owlish wisdom and get a plaster- 
cast expression on your face and conclude that silence and mental dryness 
are indicative of wisdom, but such people seldom if ever get a bright idea 
in their heads or a generous sentiment in their hearts. Such men are half- 
way men. In a million years they couldn't prophesy. If God put the 
words into their mouths fear of criticism and misunderstanding would 
put them to silence. Heber C. Kimball in 1848, or near that time, proph- 
esied that goods would be sold on the main street of Salt Lake City as 
cheap as in New York. 

Arthur Henry Young believes "that thought is the most sacred 
thing in the world." Of what use is thought if there is no way of giving 
expression to thought? There never was genius without inspiration. 

In a revelation to Joseph Smith in 1831 the Lord said : 

But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, 
but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. 
Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them. 

And it shall oome to pass', if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall 
be taken away, even that which they have. (Doctrine and Covenants 60:2-3) 

This ought to be an ensample unto all those who are ordained to 
the holy Priesthood and moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and more es- 
pecially to those whose mission is appointed unto them to preach the 
Gospel. Because the instruction is that "they shall speak as they are 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost." 

And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall 
be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall 
be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of 'the 
Lord unto salvation. 

Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servant?, (Doc- 
trine and Covenants 68:3-4) 

President Wilford Woodruff said : 

There is not a man on God's footstool that is sent forth into the world to 
preach the Gospel but ought to have the Spirit of the Lord upon him and the 
revelation of God to him. The holy Priesthood and power of God does not stop 
with the prophet, seer, revelator, Apostle, or just leading men of the Church, 

The reason for this is, that every man who is honored by holding 
this holy Priesthood and receives an appointment under the hands of those 
having authority, the Holy Ghost should be with him. That is, if he 
lives his religion and does his duty and lives a clean life. 

Brother Woodruff continues : 

The Bible is all right. The Book of Mormon is' all right. The Doctrine 
and Covenants is all right, and they proclaim the word of God. But the holy 
priesthood is not confined to these books ; that is, the revelations of G^d did 
not cease when these books were written.

Heber C. Kimball expressed a thought when he said : 

I do not know that this can be found in the Bible, but it is just as good and 

true. 

Thought, with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, is to the Latter- 
day Saints the most sacred thing in the world. Oliver Cowdery, how- 
ever gifted, did not understand the great secret of thought and study. 
He supposed that the Lord would give it unto him when he took no 
thought save it was to ask. But the Word of the Lord came to him : 

Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind ; then you 
must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall 
burn within you ; therefore you shall feel that it is right. 

Jesus gives a perfect answer : 

My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me. If any man will do his will, 
he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 

"Ask, and it shall be given you ; seek and ye shall find ; knock, and it shall 
be opened unto you. 

We have men who can look into the future. Men of vision is what 
the world needs. Three thousand years ago it was written: "Where 
there is no vision the people perish." 

Today, at the dawn of the twentieth century, we, as Latter-day 
Saints, are in sore need of a vision of the future which will uplift us 
above and beyond the petty, sordid interests of the moment, viz : That 
money devil, intemperance, and immorality, are some of the evils which 
are lying right across the highway of our future. It is riches, automo- 
biles, oriental rugs, fashion, social functions, class distinction, and other 
worldly things that appeal to our covetousness more than just doing 
right, for they are advertised better and have a stronger appeal to our 
sordid natures. 

Brethren and sisters, I have been in this work a long time. I pray 
God that I may have his Spirit always. There is only one way for me 
to get out of this Church, and that is by doing wrong. I hope I shall 
never live long enough or say anything that there will be taken from me 
that which I have. God bless you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

Bowen and the Singing Mothers. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

In contemplating the attitude of the Latter-day Saints as a body 
of religious worshipers towards their fellowmen, my mind is led in 
serious reflection to the great mission on which we lay a divinely author- 
ized claim. We present ourselves as messengers of life and salvation 
binder the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to all with whom we come in contact. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



35 



We fit our calling to the present day, this scripturally known Dispensa- 
tion of the Fulness of Times. As members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, our claim is that we are divinely commissioned 
to perform Gospel ordinances in the name and by the authority of Jesus 
of Nazareth, the Son of the living God. 

FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PROMISES 

We particularly lay stress today upon a culminating feature of the 
Gospel revelation for the salvation of the living and of the dead of 
God's children who have dwelt on the earth in ages past. We point 
out that through the channel of divine revelation to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, that culminating feature was in fulfillment of God's promise 
recorded in the closing words of the Old Testament, that he would send 
Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of 
the Lord to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart 
of the children to their fathers. In proof of the validity of our claim 
we cite, among other things: 

1. That the present disturbed condition of the world, more general 
than ever known before, is evidence of the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord now being upon us. 

WORK FOR THE DEAD 

2. That early in the present dispensation of the Gospel, and now 
about a century ago, the Prophet Elijah did come; and that following 
that coming, the genealogical researchers have grown to millions in 
numbei among the civilized peoples of the earth, and are seeking, 
records of their ancestors back to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob. 

3. That in the temples of the Latter-day Saints, and among that 
people only, are performed the higher Gospel ordinances for the 
salvation of the living and of the dead of ages past. 

4. That while those ordinances are no part of the strictly Mosaic 
law, they are a necessary part of the fulness of the Gospel for this age 
and time, and for the dead who have died without law as well as for 
the living today, as resultant upon the statement of Jesus of Nazareth : 
"The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice 
of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live." (John 5:25.) The 
reason for this is given by the Apostle Peter: "For for this cause 
was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be 
judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in 
the spirit." (1 Peter 4:6.) 

To my mind this is a serious, a marvelous claim, carrying not 
only to the Church as a body, but to the individual members thereof, 
a stupendous and weighty responsibility which cannot be lightly turned 
aside. In early days, now nearly thirty-three centuries ago, those 
children of Israel who had come out of Egypt, and were traveling in 
the desert between that place and their promised land, failed in a 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



degree to meet the requirements of the higher Priesthood law, and were 
placed under the lesser law known as the Mosaic covenant. 

UNDER THE HIGHER PRIESTHOOD 

But such is not the case with the Latter-day Saints. We are 
under the covenant with Christ, which is the higher Priesthood, and 
are amenable thereto in our individual as well as in our collective 
capacity. The authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood is conferred 
upon us. The ordinances of that higher Priesthood are ours. The 
requirements of its responsibilities are upon us individually, and admit 
of no justifiable evasion on our part. They come under the explicit 
saying of the Savior: "If ye love me, keep my commandments." 
(John 14:15.) 

Jesus further said to his disciples : 

This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. 
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his 
friends. 

Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 

Henceforth I call you not servants'; for the servant knoweth not what his 
lord doeth ; but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard 
of my Father I have made known unto you. 

Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye 
should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatso- 
ever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 

These things I command you, that ye love one another. (John 15:12-17). 

FREE AGENCY 

Men have their free agency. Under the full and proper exercise 
thereof, they are free to think, free to act within reasonable restrictions. 
This freedom of agency places upon them the responsibility of both 
thought and action as individuals. Their opportunity is to choose to 
follow either the good or the evil in life. Those of us who have aligned 
ourselves sincerely with the Church of Jesus . Christ of Latter-day 
Saints have made choice of the good, and have become messengers of 
salvation in ourselves and to others. We have become followers of 
Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God. As such followers, integrity of 
word and deed should be the cornerstone of our efforts. 

NECESSITY OF LABOR 

To be a true disciple of Jesus, we must needs be workers in his 
great cause. It is said in one of the Proverbs, "Seest thou a man 
diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings." This necessity 
of labor is a mainspring in what we call progress by individuals as 
well as in civilization. To labor, to actually, definitely labor in the cause 
of Christ produces its effects in righteous growth and development. 
The Apostle Peter once said to believers in his day : "Ye are a chosen 
generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." 
(1 Peter 2:9.) A "do-nothing" people cannot fill that calling. In- 
dustry, integrity, application, self-respect, in the spiritual as well as in 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



37 



the material things of life, are essential qualites. "Ye shall know 
them by their fruits." 

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 

In the quotation here made from the Apostle John's record of the 
sayings of Christ, two elements may be selected for definite thought. 
One of these is that in and of our own volition, we assume the respon- 
sibility of doing something ourselves, rather than be always seeking 
to depend wholly upon the advice and direction of others. This advice 
is timely in degree, but it has its limit in often burdening others beyond 
necessity. In proper degree it is timely in that it complies with the 
design of Providence. Yet let us remember that the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost for us to proceed upon our own individual initiative is 
worth something; and acting under that inspiration is an obligation 
aptly expressed by the Apostle James : "Be ye doers of the word, 
and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves." Wherein we seek 
over-guidance or over-government from human sources, we develop 
in ourselves a tendency to helplessness. That which is put into us by 
others is always far less ours than that which we acquire by our own 
diligent and persevering effort. It is not luck nor accident that helps 
a man in the world so much as purpose and persistent industry. 

These aphorisms are among those which, so far as my ability to 
apply them in my own life has been concerned, have been to me of 
great and durable value. But to be of the highest value, we must 
remember our duty and service to God. That is the supreme calling 
which the Latter-day Saints have accepted and assigned to them- 
selves in the choice they have made within their free agency. By 
thus assuming our individual responsibility, our example becomes not 
only helpful to others, but definitely removes us from the classification 
indicated in the verdict: "Every tree that bringeth not forth good 
fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire." (Matt. 7:19-20.) Those 
Latter-day Saints who have the spirit of their calling aim to bring 
forth good fruit in the Gospel of Christ, materially and spiritually. 
Therein they do manifest their love for their fellowmen as the love 
of Christ comes into their hearts. 

Jesus himself found occasion to lay particular stress upon the 
individual responsibility for action by those who. professed his name. 
He thus did so in these words : "Ye are the light of the world. A city 
that is set on a hill cannot be hid. * * * Let your light so shine before 
men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father 
which is in heaven." (Matt. 5:14, 16.) 

SOME ACHIEVEMENTS 

It is in the history of the Latter-day Saints that they have done much 
in harmony with this divine injunction. In a spiritual way, they have 
engaged in extensive missionary service for bringing souls into the fold 
of Christ. Yet it cannot be said that they have been idle in helpful 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



material things. Since coming to these valleys, now nearly eighty-seven 
years ago, they have been wonderful colonists ; their mission of coloni- 
zation has opened up to an advanced civilization this intermountain 
country, from their settlements in Canada to their settlements in Mexico, 
as well as easterly and westerly to a considerable extent. Individually 
and collectively they have established and carried on home industries 
which reach into every city and hamlet, bringing useful and congenial 
employment in the production of life's necessities and comforts. By 
both individual and cooperative effort they have developed irrigation 
projects that aid in "subduing the earth" in this intermountain region, 
until it has become desirable for man's habitation. By similar effort they 
have encouraged educational institutions and an educational system of 
which any community may be proud. By their moral training of both 
young and old, they have attained a standing in character that is an honor 
•to the commonwealth. As temple builders they have adopted different 
types of architecture into a class of strikingly beautiful edifices regarded 
as especially sacred. As a community of home-makers they have brought 
to comfortable homes thousands of families from the civilized nations, 
and have molded those people of different tongues and nationalities into 
a uniform community sentiment. Yet, in their responsibilities under the 
higher law of the Gospel which they have received, these achievements 
are not at an end. They are just begun, to be continued until the Zion of 
God is established in the land, as the Lord has foretold through his 
prophets. Their work as individuals may be humbly done, but in right- 
eousness it is age-during, to the glory of the God of Israel whom they 
seek to serve. 

As Jesus invited his followers anciently to voluntary and coopera- 
tive effort for all good, so in this dispensation he has given explicit 
instruction which applies to such voluntary action by each Church mem- 
ber. On one occasion, he expressed such lesson in these words : 

For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things ; for he that is 
compelled in all things, the same is' a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore 
he receiveth no reward. 

Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness ; 

For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a 
commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same 
is damned. (D. & C. 58 -.26-29.) 

RESULTS FOLLOWING NEGLECT 

Yet it is wise to recall that sometimes, in our own human weakness, 
we become neglectful even of our supreme obligations. As told in 
Bible history, the Israel of olden time did this on different occasions, 
and called forth reprimands therefor. Our knowledge of such instances 
may serve as warnings to us, to avoid similar mistakes, and to keep the 
Gospel light shining within our hearts. The Israel of the Book of Mor- 
mon record also had occasions of neglect. The book of Helaman in the 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



39 



Book of Mormon makes record of such event, wherein the words of that 
writer present a timely lesson to us, were we to become neglectful of 
God's word. The writer says that the people to whom he refers had been 
prospered "in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, 
and in gold and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every 
kind and art." They also had been relieved from the active antagonism 
of their enemies, and presented a scene of "exceedingly great prosperity." 
Then they became lifted up in pride, and were given to boasting. When 
in their situation of ease, they began to forget God, they fell under 
affliction arising from their own neglect of responsibility to the divine 
word. The historian then goes on to say of them : 

Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, 
shruld rule and reign over them ; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy 
towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should 
he their guide. (Helaman 12:6.) 

REMEMBER THE LORD' 

In these days of distorting the plain words of scripture, of atheistic 
teachings, of chaotic social propaganda, and of general economic uncer- 
tainty, it may be well for us, in our private contemplation, to give at 
least a passing heed to the conditions cited in the Book of Mormon, and 
for us to seek more earnestly than ever to remember God, that his bless- 
ings and protecting care may come to us still more abundantly in our 
time of special need, such as seems to be upon us today. Though the 
efforts of men may be frustrated, God's promise does not fail wherein 
he says to those who draw near to him : "I will have respect unto you, 
and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant 
with you." (Lev. 26:9.) It is our own responsibility, individually as 
well as collectively, to thereby gain our own welfare, and the welfare 
of others, under our divine call in this age. 

FRIENDS OF JESUS 

Referring again to the quotation hereinbefore made from the 
Apostle John's record of the sayings of Christ, a second element for 
present definite thought is in the Savior's words : "Ye are my friends if 
ye do whatsoever I command you. * * * These things I command you, 
that ye love one another." This command to "love one another" was 
not narrowed to family or social relationships, or even to Church mem- 
berships. Its scope was broad indeed, for bringing the Gospel message 
to all who would give heed. Jesus himself thus explains it : 

Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and 
hate thine enemy. 

But T say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good 
to them that hate you, and pray for them that dcspitefully use you, and persecute 
you ; 

That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he 
maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just 
and on the unjust.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even 
the publicans the same ? 

And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others ? Do net 
even the publicans so? ( Matt. 5 :43-47 ; 3 Nephi 13 :44, 45.) 

In the present hectic discussions of religious and social questions 
especially, it is well to be careful in personal criticisms, that we may 
not be unjust. There may be faults, but who is without them? These 
can be corrected without either growing angry or scolding each other. 
The scold may make an enemy, but never a convert. Sometimes we 
meet the suggestion that Jesus himself administered severe rebuke to 
certain persons. (Matt. 23:15.) He did more. He denounced them. They 
were seeking his life, and the lives of his followers. It was open war- 
fare. It was his affair, not ours. Theirs were the grosser sins. To us 
he says : ''Judge not." 

As Latter-day Saints we wish to be recognized, and to be in reality 
as friends of Jesus, by keeping his commandments. That is the condition 
he has prescribed. Even our little Sunday School children are taught 
his command "that ye love one another," and to "oft speak kind words 
to each other." For myself, I do sincerely trust that as Latter-day Saints, 
whether of high or low degree in membership, yet all being under the 
Gospel law in the covenant with Christ, we will seek diligently and 
honestly to speak kind words to and of each other, that the love of God, 
the love of our associate members in the Church and the love of our 
fellowmen may increase among us for the- furtherance of the kingdom 
of God and his righteousness. Let us not forget the divinely given words 
which I have quoted to you today, and also the further words of our Lord : 

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy mind. 

This is the first and great commandment. 

And the second is like unto it : Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prcphets. ( Matt. 22 : 
37-40.) 

May the grace of the Father and his boundless love be with you 
evermore, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Chirst. Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I feel my weakness, my brethren and sisters, in standing before you 
this afternoon, realizing, as I do, the great responsibility that rests upon 
those who undertake to speak in the name of the Lord. 

I am indeed happy to report to you this afternoon the activities of 
the East Central States Mission. I am pleased to say that the mission- 
aries are enjoying good health. They are enjoying their labors. There 
are new fields being opened up from time to time, and they have the 
privilege and the opportunity of explaining the Gospel to many people, 
and many are being brought to a knowledge of the truth, and are receiv- 
ing the ordinance of baptism by immersion, for the remission of sins ; 



ELDER MILES L. JONES

and after that, the birth of the Spirit by the laying on of hands for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost. 

I have had the privilege, while laboring in the mission, of meeting 
many men and women of prominence in various communities and have 
had the privilege of explaining the Gospel to them. 

Just a few days ago, in the city of Louisville, in conversation with a 
very influential man whom I had met several times before, and with 
whom I had left some literature — he put this question : 

"Mr. Jones, do all members of your church have the same abiding 
faith and assurance that some of you have?" To which I answered that 
that testimony comes through the Holy Ghost, which is conferred upon 
the baptized believer by those who hold the authority. Having been 
divinely commissioned and holding the holy Priesthood, they have the 
authority to perform that ordinance in the name of the Lord. Those 
who receive the ordinance of baptism and then the birth of the Spirit, 
through the laying on of hands, do have that abiding faith and that 
testimony burning within their souls, provided they live worthy of that 
blessing. 

Conditions have arisen that have given me a great deal of satisfac- 
tion. Just recently we had an application from three persons who desired 
to enter the waters of baptism. Not desiring to wait until the weather 
was more pleasant so that we could retire to the river, I called upon a 
very influential man who I knew was a member of the Board of Con- 
trol of the First Christian Church. I had talked with him a number of 
times, I had learned some of his views, and I knew the position that he 
held. I called upon him and asked if it would be possible for us to 
arrange for the use of their baptismal font for this particular occasion, 
to which he answered very readily : "Yes, sir. I can make the arrange- 
ment for you, and will be very glad to do it," which he did. We had 
the privilege of going into the finest chapel in the city of Louisville, and 
those three persons entered the waters of baptism. 

I wish to say that the feeling that went out upon that occasion, and 
the spirit manifested, bore witness to all who were there of the divinity 
of the work; and the director and others, as well as the minister in 
charge, assured us that we could have the use of the font any time that 
we desired, absolutely free of charge, and that we were entirely welcome 
to the use of it. 

That is the spirit that is being manifested among the people of the 
world, generally speaking. A wonderful change has come over the 
people, and I am very thankful indeed for conditions as they exist. I 
want to say that there are thousands in the world today that are earnestly 
seeking after truth, and as the Gospel message is brought to their atten- 
tion it is making an impression upon their minds. It is almost a daily 
occurrence that I receive letters from various parts of the mission, asking 
tor more literature and more information in regard to our teachings. 
Thus we have the opportunity of corresponding with these people after 
which the Elders visit them in their homes and explain the Gospel to 
them ; in this way many are being brought to a knowledge of the truth.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



As I view it, there is a wonderful harvest before us, not only for 
this' year but for time to come because of the change that is coming 
among the children of men; and I ask you who are here in the land of 
Zion, where you have the privilege and the opportunity of attending 
your meetings, your Sunday Schools, and the various organizations, 
if you realize and appreciate to the fullest extent the blessings that you 
are enjoying. You should be thankful for the opportunity that you 
have, compared to that which prevails in the world. It is a great blessing 
to you and a blessing to all those who have this privilege and this oppor- 
tunity. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, that I have had the opportunity 
of laboring in the work of the Lord for a third time in the mission field, 
something over five years now. It seems a short time, but I have seen 
many things that have strengthened my testimony, and I have witnessed 
conditions upon several occasions that have been beyond the power and 
the wisdom of man to solve, but God has come to the rescue, the way 
has been opened, and the work has been carried on, I hope and trust, 
in a way that is pleasing to our Heavenly Father. 

I rejoice in the testimony that I have of the divinity of this great 
latter-day work, for I know, as I know that I stand before you this 
afternoon, that it is the work of the Lord, that it is the power of God 
unto salvation ; that God lives ; that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and 
the Redeemer of the world ; and that the Prophet Joseph Smith was the 
instrument in the hands of Almighty God, in establishing this work upon 
the earth for the last time. It will never more be thrown down nor given 
to another people, but will stand forever ; and those who have succeeded 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, down to the President who stands at the head 
today, even President Heber J. Grant, have been and are God's mouth- 
pieces upon the earth. 

God bless you. Peace be with you, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Central States Mission 

I appreciate the opportunity that is mine, to represent the division 
of the Church known as the Central States Mission of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have never permitted myself to 
aspire to such a position, or to even think about it, but the Lord, through 
his servants, has graciously permitted me to enjoy this opportunity. To 
me it is a rar e privilege. I hope to be worthy of the confidence and the 
trust imposed in me. 

The people of the Central States Mission, most of them having been 
converted and brought into the Church under the presidency of Presi- 
dent Samuel O. Bennion, are God-fearing, humble, sincere people. There 
are twenty-three organized branches and a considerable number of Sun- 
day Schools in addition to the branches, with the usual Relief Society 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF

organizations and the Primaries that are common to each of the missions. 

These good people are faithful tithe-payers. They observe the 
Word of Wisdom as well as the people do in the stakes of Zion. They 
are trying, in their own way, and it is a good way, to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord. They are well organized. We have a mission 
stake organization, so to speak, that is, a union board, which supervises 
the auxiliary work of the mission. 

During the month of May there will be a Mutual Improvement 
contest, which is held annually in Kansas City, Missouri, from which we 
hope to have the honor of sending a few delegates to join with you in 
your June conference. 

It occurred to me that it might be of interest to many people who 
know Horace Ensign very well, to have me tell you that he presides 
over our Wichita branch, and that delightful and rich voice of his, which 
has cheered and gladdened the hearts of many, is frequently heard in 
that humble congregation, and enjoyed by them. He is their spiritual 
father and their music master. They love him, and he devotes himself 
as assiduously to that work as if he were presiding over the most im- 
portant branch of the Church. I know he would like to have me give 
you his greetings, because I can remember many a conference, in days 
gone by, when his voice has added to the pleasure of our conference. 
Others formerly prominent among you are living here and there in por- 
tions of our mission. 

As you know, the mission headquarters are in that city of early 
romance in church history, Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. I 
think I have never been in a community where the business men seem to be 
more united and of higher character than they are at Independence. They 
hold our people in high esteem. This has been made so, I am sure, by 
the very splendid public service rendered by President Bennion and his 
wife in that community. I find, in going about Independence, when I have 
to introduce myself, if I merely say I am the successor to President 
Bennion the door is open for me, and I am made welcome everywhere. 
Those good people send greetings to him. The thing I have noticed 
about the people of Independence is their devotion to high ideals. 

I remember, at a recent meeting of the Kiwanis Club, listening to 
a lecturer from Kansas City, who, in the course of his lecture, saw fit 
to tell a few stories that may not be properly told in a drawing room, 
among ladies and gentlemen, and he was not very well received. I re- 
member particularly that at the close of the gathering, as we were separ- 
ating to go to our occupations, the editor of the paper said to me: "Mr. 
Woodruff, how did you enjoy the talk?" "Oh," I said, "I have enjoyed 
things better than that." 

"Well," he said, "I didn't like it at all. I don't see why it was neces- 
sary for him to impose his stories upon us." 

I mention that because I want you to know that the people who 
now live in Jackson County, Missouri, are high-minded, clean-minded 
people, and they esteem the Latter-day Saints. They regard us as worthy 



44

people, and would welcome us back there in numbers if we should 
happen to want to go. 

The mission is in a prosperous condition. The people are happy. 
I am honored to represent them and happy to labor among them. I 
hope to be worthy of their love and confidence. 

I am happy to tell you that the missionaries are well and enjoying 
their labors, and they are laboring with reasonable zeal and diligence to 
carry the message of the Gospel to those to whom they have been sent. 
The harvest is great and the laborers are few. Through the Bureau of 
Information we receive many leads, many names of people upon whom 
we are asked to call. We can visit only a few of them. All over the 
mission people are calling and asking for Elders — can't we send some 
Elders ? We can send them only those that we have, as far as they can 
go. They often become wandering Elders, at the present time. Only a 
few of them settle down in any community to labor locally. In order 
to cover the districts it is necessary for them to move about a great deal. 
But they enjoy their labors, and as I say, they are all well. 

We have no persecution at home or abroad apparently, that is, 
nothing to speak of. It seems to me, my brethren and sisters, that the 
danger in the Church today is within it. I have found, as I go aboiut 
the mission and over the Western States Mission, to some extent, the 
same — a disposition on the part of the people to want to find fault with 
each other, rather than to be happy with each other. I do not mean all of 
them; I mean some of them. When I come home I find the same condi- 
tion here. 

I wonder, my brethren and sisters, if we cannot be more united, if 
we cannot have more confidence in our leaders, those who preside over 
us, locally and generally; if we cannot live so that we may enjoy the 
spirit that comes to those who keep the commandments of the Lord, and 
who want to sustain his servants who preside over them and be in har- 
mony with them. I am trying to teach the people, as far as it lies within 
my power, to examine themselves, to ask themselves the question : "Am 
I enjoying the Holy Spirit?" And in order to ascertain whether they 
do or not I say : "Find out whether or not you have the fruits of the 
Spirit in your lives, for the fruits of the Spirit are love and joy and peace 
and long-suffering and patience, and kindred qualities. If you are happy 
and at peace with all men, if you love your neighbor, then you enjoy 
the Spirit; but if you are unhappy and discontented, and if things are 
not going the way you think they should go, and you feel like you must 
reach out your hand to steady the ark, then perhaps the fault is yours." 

So the people are being urged to examine themselves, to see whether 
there is something the matter with them. I ask myself the question : What 
is the matter with Elias Woodruff? If I can find out what is the matter 
with myself, and keep myself in harmony with the Holy Spirit, then I 
feel like I am reasonably safe. Let me ask you, my brethren and sisters 
at home, as well as I would ask those people in the mission : Examine 
yourselves and see if you are in the faith. Do you believe the Gospel ? 
Do you believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God ? Do you believe 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF

that President Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God ?' Are you willing to 
take his counsel and advice, and follow it ? Or are you a law unto your- 
self, guiding and charting your own course in life, determining what 
you think is right and what you think is the wrong thing to do ? It 
seems to me, my brethren and sisters, that there is the danger in the 
Church today. Let us examine ourselves. Let us be happy in our 
worship. "Adam fell," we are told, "that men might be ; and men are 
that they might have joy." If we are not joyful and happy, then we 
ought to be. 

God bless you, I ask, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to again bring greetings 
from the mission field, and to join in testimony of the truth and im- 
portance of this great latter-day work. I know, as I know that I live, 
that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and am grateful that we of the 
mission fields have the privilege semi-annually of coming up here "To 
the mountain of the Lord's house, — to be taught of his ways, and to walk 
in his paths." I am increasingly thankful for this testimony and privi- 
lege, and for my calling in the mission field. 

Some one has said that what men most need is something to hold 
them always at their best. Mormonism and the missionary system of 
this Church do just that. A story, abbreviated within time limits allowed, 
will illustrate : 

In a hall at Northwestern University is a bronze tablet memorial to 
"The Man Who Did His Best." And the legend accompanying it is as 
follows : 

A storm of unusual violence had swept Lake Michigan, destroying 
or disabling practically all vessels and strewing the shore with wreckage. 
As the storm abated, watchers ashore could see, far out on the lake, a 
group of survivors clinging helplessly to the wreckage of their crafts. 

For want of other means of rescue, one young man, a student at 
Northwestern, renowned among his fellows for his prowess in the water, 
resolved to bring what help was possible to those in distress by swimming 
to their aid. Stripped of excess clothing, he swam out and back, out and 
back, eighteen times, each time bringing to safety a sufferer from the 
wreck, until, completely exhausted, he fell unconcious among his fellows 
ashore. Admiring friends worked over him, and as consciousness re- 
turned, he looked into their anxious faces, his own brother among the 
number, and feebly asked: "Did I do my best?" 

In like manner, I repeat, Mormonism and the missionary system of 
the Church encourage the youth of the Church to do their best. They 
go into the mission field imbued with a testimony of the truth and with 
a feeling of responsibility to you, to the Church and to the Lord. They 
read with new meaning the first great commandment. "Thou shalt love 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all 
thy mind. — And thy neighbor as thyself." And they begin really to 
live up to that standard. 

They learn afresh that "The worth of souls is great in the sight of 
God ;" and they go out and try humbly to reclaim some of these souls. 

They begin to realize the meaning of the Savior's words: "He that 
findeth his life shall lose it; but he that loseth his life for my sake, 
shall find it." In borrowed phrase, "Who gives himself with his gift 
feeds three, himself, his hungry neighbor, and Me." And so, unselfishly 
serving this great latter-day cause, they grow as never before, and pos- 
sibly never again ; and "the power of God is in them." They love their 
work, and are magnified in the eyes of the people. Small wonder they 
remember these experiences as the happiest of their lives. 

And while the missionary is thus serving at his best in the field, 
what is happening here at home? Devoted parents follow anxiously the 
progress of the one away. Brothers and sisters often make little sacri- 
fices that the missionary work may continue. Thus, each at his best, all 
share in the spirit of service and in the rare privilege and opportunity 
of carrying this great Gospel message to the world. 

I concur and rejoice in the testimony that friendliness is increasing 
in the world. There never was a better time for preaching the Gospel 
than now. Everywhere, among the better informed classes, this Church 
and people are held in high regard. But I venture the thought that 
friendliness alone is not enough. Salvation cometh not by sufferance of 
former critics; but by obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That 
good men everywhere may come to know and love the truths of the 
restored Gospel, that our friends of the world may be induced seriously 
to examine the claim that God has again spoken from the heavens, and 
that this is verily the Church of Jesus Christ, established again upon the 
earth, for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the benefit and blessing 
of all who believe and obey its teachings, — all this is part of the high 
purpose and obligation of Mormonism's message to the world. 

In conclusion, I can think of no more fitting expression of the mis- 
sionary spirit than Howard Arnold Walter's "My Creed" : 

I would be true, for there are those who trust me; 
I would be pure, for there are those who care ; 
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer ; 
I would be brave, for there is much to dare. 

I would be friend of all — the foe, the friendless ; 
I would be giving, and forget the gift ; 
I would be humble, for I know my weakness ; 
I would look up — and laugh, and love, and lift. 

On my honor, my brethren and sisters, I will do my best to live up 
to the high privilege of missionary service. 

May the Lord continue his blessings upon the missionary work of 
his Church, and upon the people of the world, that they may find the 
truth and obey it, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

The Singing Mothers Chorus sang the anthem, "The Lord now- 
victorious," after which the congregation joined with th e Chorus in 
singing the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Wallace E. Poulson, 
President of the Sevier Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning, April 7. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Saturday morning, April 7. 

The Conference reconvened promptly at 10 o'clock, with President 
Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 

Elder Thomas E. Towler, President of the Wells Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A tenor solo, "Then shall the righteous shine forth," was sung by 
Herbert Bluck. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The Lord giveth men weakness that they may be hurrible. In hu- 
mility I earnestly invoke his aid this morning. 

The words of the poet come to my mind. They are as follows : 

On Christ the solid rock we stand ; 
On other ground is sinking sand. 

What is there for our salvation outside of our Heavenly Father, 
our Savior, and the glorious Gospel which they have provided ? There 
is nothing of real worth to the soul. 

A VISION OF DEITY 

It is a remarkable thing that two of the greatest prophets that ever 
lived commenced their prophetic ministry with a vision of Deity. The 
prophets referred to are Isaiah and Joseph Smith. In the sixth chapter 
of Isaiah — and many commentators think this chapter should have been 
placed first in the P>ook of Isaiah — the Prophet says : 

[ saw the Lord sitting upon a throne * * * mine eyes have seen the King, 
the Lord of Hosts * * * I heard the voice of the Lord. 

Xo quibbling here. This is direct evidence, the highest form of 
testimony. No living being can successfully challenge the truth of that 
statement. Every Christian soul accepts it as the truth, but can that 
testimony be proved ? It can. It is proved by the fulfilment of prophecy, 
and the fulfilment of prophecy is one of the strongest evidences that a 
man is sent of God. 

That the prophet in the vision saw Christ in human form, as the 
brother of Jared saw him, there can be no doubt when the passage is 
deliberately compared with John 1 2 :41 . "These things said Esaias, when 
he saw his glory, and spake of him." Isaiah was preeminent among the 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



49 



noble band of Old Testament prophets. His clear and striking represen- 
tation of Jesus Christ and prophetic delineation of the person, work, and 
character of the Messiah deserved the praise the Savior bestowed upon 
him when in quoting his prophecies he said: "For great are the words 
of Isaiah.!' (3 Nephi 23:1.) 

THE WORDS OF ISAIAH 

Centuries before the birth of the Savior, Jsaiah predicted that 
wonderful event in this stately language : 

For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given : and the government shall 
be upon his shoulder : and his 1 name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The 
mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 

Isaiah predicted the sufferings, death, and the resurrection of the 
Lord Jesus Christ so vividly that his prophecy adds strength to the truth 
of the old axiom that prophecy is but history reversed. The prophecy 
as every Bible student knows was literally fulfilled. The prophet fore- 
told the coming of the locomotive and the airplane. In the 29th chapter 
of his book Isaiah predicts the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. 
We testify that that prophecy has also been literally fulfilled, and that 
Joseph Smith translated that sacred record by the power of God. 

PROPHECIES THAT HAVE BEEN FULFILLED 

Is it not reasonable to conclude that if Isaiah's predictions concern- 
ing the Savior have been fulfilled, his prediction concerning the Book 
of Mormon has likewise been fulfilled? The Latter-day Saints know of 
a certainty that the prophecies concerning the Savior and the Book of 
Mormon have been fulfilled to the enlightening of their understanding 
and the salvation of their souls. 

The Creator said : 

So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return 
unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in 
the thing whereto I sent it. 

A SOLID FOUNDATION 

Consider the Prophet Joseph Smith. He beheld in glorious vision 
the Father, and the Son. Can any man on earth successfully contradict 
the testimony Joseph Smith gave of that vision? No, it stands as firm 
as the Rock of Ages. His witness is supported by the fulfilment of 
prophecy. The same source of Isaiah's prophetic power was the 
source from which Joseph Smith derived his prophetic gifts. 

When the Apostle Paul stood before Agrippa and Festus, he said : 

Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing 
both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets 
and Moses did say should come : 

That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise 
from the dead. 

That was the yardstick that the Apostle Paul used. That should be 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the standard of measurement that the Elders of Israel should always use 
to keep their feet firmly upon the foundation of the Bible, the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the teachings of ancient and 
modern prophets. And when they preach from this foundation they 
stand on solid ground, and the souls of the people are fed. - 

PROPHECIES OF A MODERN PROPHET 

Joseph Smith was an inspirer of souls. He said he did nothing but 
what the ancient prophets said he would do. He was a fulfiller of Bible 
prophecy. Consider some of the prophecies which he uttered : The 
exodus of the Saints to the Rocky Mountains, where they would become 
a great and a mighty people; his prediction of the Civil War, twenty- 
eight years before it occurred — and only a month before that bloody 
conflict, statesmen were saying, "Peace, peace, there will be no war." 
But the God of heaven had spoken and desolation swept over the land. 
Oh, if those statesmen had only heeded the words, if they had only 
accepted the remedy, the solution which the great statesman-prophet, 
Joseph Smith, gave to them, a million lives would have been spared and 
eight billions of dollars in property would not have been destroyed ! 

TESTIMONIES OF THOSE NOT OF US 

Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. A great American statesman, on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, referring to this great organization, said : "It is magni- 
ficent in its priestly organization and rivaled by no other institution in 
the world." 

Charles Dickens, the celebrated novelist, whose "Life of Our Lord" 
is appearing in some of the daily papers, declared before he visited a ship- 
load of Mormon emigrants bound for America that he was going there to 
bear testimony against them. But when he saw the order, the neatness, 
the cleanliness, the prayerful spirit which prevailed there he said : 

There is a power in that Church, there is a remarkable influence among those 
people that is not witnessed in other institutions in the world. 

AN EXPERIENCE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA 

Some years ago President Grant was in Atlanta, Georgia. A Uni- 
versalist minister had converted his chapel into a sort of public forum, 
the ministers of the various religious denominations of the city were 
invited to occupy his pulpit and preach their religious sentiments. He 
propounded several questions that he requested them to answer, and two 
of these questions were as follows : "Do you believe that Jesus Christ 
is divine and the Son of God ?" "Do you believe that there is a life after 
death ?" The answers were not satisfying. 

Hearing of President Grant's presence in that great city the minister 
invited him to deliver a sermon and he placed in President Grant's hands 
the same questions that he had earnestly entreated the pastors to answer. 
President Grant did answer all the questions, and not in a negative way. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



51 



He did not say, "It may be," or "I believe that such is the case," but stand- 
ing before that mixed congregation the President said : "I know of a cer- 
tainty that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I know that 
there is life after death, and that the soul is immortal." The other ques- 
tions he answered in an equally frank, authoritative way. 

At the close of President Grant's address the minister approached 
him with extended hands. I fancied that there was a trembling in his 
voice ; there was a longing in his heart for something better than he had, 
for, as he held President Grant's hand he said to him : "I wish I had 
your earnestness, your sincerity, your faith, and your testimony." There 
was sadness in my heart for that man. 

WITH NO UNCERTAIN SOUND 

President Grant has always sounded the Gospel trumpet with no 
uncertain sound, so that the children of men could prepare themselves 
for the battle. In line with Joseph Smith and the Apostle Paul and all 
the prophets our President is speaking and doing the things that the 
ancient prophets declared would be done. We are rallying around 
President Grant and listening to his inspired counsels. The Gospel 
message is sounding in our hearts. With the help of the Lord, by keeping 
his commandments, we will go with the First Presidency and the rest of 
our leaders into the Celestial kingdom of God, which I humbly pray, 
through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters, I said this morning to one of the brethren who 
is yet to speak, "Brace up, brother, brace up." 

He said, "Yes, Brother Clawson, I feel a little exercised about it, a 
little timid. I feel as if I need some stimulant. What shall I take?" 

I said : "Take the strongest within your reach." 

Of course that would be a glass of cold water. 

If any of you brethren think it is a simple matter to stand before 
a vast assemblage of people like this, I can only wish that you might 
have the opportunity. It is a great responsibility. I must needs look to 
the Lord to assist me, and I ask for your faith and prayers. 

THE ARTICLES OF FAITH 

I have in mind just at this moment the Articles of Faith that were 
given to the Church by its founder under the Lord, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and I submit to you that this is a very wonderful instrument, that 
these Articles of Faith were set forth in simple language and with great 
clearness and cannot very well be misunderstood. 

The first Article of Faith reads as follows : 

We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in 
the Holy Ghost. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Let me say to you that there is very much of supporting scripture 
that is placed behind this first article and the twelve articles which follow. 
I call your attention briefly to article eleven, which reads like this : 

We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates 
of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship bow, 
where or what they' may. 

You will notice that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is very liberal in its attitude towards other beliefs. As a Church 
and as individual members of the Church we do not attack other people, 
we do not hold their religious views up to ridicule, but since their articles 
of faith are set forth and published to the world we take that to mean an 
invitation to investigate them and to investigate their views. That is 
our attitude in relation to the Gospel that is set forth in our Articles of 
Faith. 

These Articles are published to the world and we invite them to in- 
spect them and carefully consider them, and, if they choose, to offer 
friendly criticism. So when we observe conditions that obtain in the 
world and as set forth in the daily papers we take that to mean that we 
are invited individually and as a community to consider these conditions. 

MINISTERS ANSWER QUESTIONS 

I remember a few years ago that President Heber J. Grant spoke 
of a questionnaire that had been sent out by Albert J. Beveridge, a mem- 
ber of Congress, and the results of that questionnaire were quite re- 
markable. President Grant made comments on it that were enlightening 
and instructive. 

Recently another questionnaire was sent out by the Chicago North- 
western School of Education. The presumption is that the said school 
was sincere in this matter and sent out this questionnaire for enlighten- 
ment and for study. If you will pardon me I will take a few moments 
to read the results growing out of that particular questionnaire as pub- 
lished in one of the daily papers in February of this year. Answers were 
given in percentages by the paper that published them, but I have reduced 
these percentages to actual figures. The questionnaire was submitted to 
500 Protestant ministers. 205 of that number did not believe that there 
is a heaven ; 345 did not believe that hell is a place having existence ; and 
so far as those two questions were concerned, as you will see, heaven 
and hell were swept away. 270 did not believe there is a devil, and yet we 
see the works of the devil on every side and all around us. 195 did not 
believe there would be a judgment day. I fancy some men perhaps are 
fearful that there will be a judgment day. 370 did not believe that God 
keeps a record of an individual's bad deeds, and 130 did not believe in the 
deity of Jesus Christ. 

THE BIBLE A PRECIOUS BOOK 

Now the Latter-day Saints as a people have regarded the Bible as a 
sacred volume of scripture, and we look upon it as a holy book — 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON 



53 



Holy Bible, book divine, 
Precious treasure, thou art mine. 

And furthermore, the Bible is one of the standard works of our Church. 
We cannot get along without it, we cannot spare it, it is invaluable to the 
Church. Brother Callis has just been quoting wonderful words from the 
Bible, words spoken by the prophet Isaiah. Marvelous predictions were 
given by that holy prophet, and in the New Testament we have a very 
elaborate and reasonably full account of the life and works of Jesus 
Christ, the Savior of the world, one who has atoned by the shedding of 
his precious blood, for the sins of the world, which sins are to be washed 
away by repentance and reformation and the application of the blood of 
Christ. 

And yet there are 134 Protestant ministers who have apparently 
abandoned the Bible. They do not believe in the deity of Christ. Did 
you notice, brethren and sisters, the remarks that have already been made 
in this meeting and in the former sessions of this conference in regard 
to religious matters, in regard to our faith, how direct and to the point 
these remarks have been and will be throughout this conference ? There 
will be no uncertain word go from this pulpit, you may depend upon it. 
We invite the world at large and everywhere to investigate our teachings, 
to go right to the bottom of them, and if they discover any errors, and can 
persuade us that they are errors, we will gladly abandon them. Our 
Articles of Faith have stood the test of one hundred years. 

MEETING OF MISSION PRESIDENTS 

Now briefly let me call your attention to an incident that occurred 
on Wednesday last. The presidents of the Latter-day Saint missions 
met with the Council of the Twelve and the First Council of Seventy, 
thirteen of them, representing the missions in the United States, and 
one in Canada and one in Mexico. These mission presidents preside 
over about 537 missionaries at the present time. They came together to 
make report of their labors and of the labors of the missionaries in the 
field, and I will say to you we had a glorious time together. And I might 
add in this connection that seven of the Apostles of the Church have 
been mission presidents, and six of the First Council of Seventy have 
been mission presidents. The other member of the First Council of 
Seventy has filled a mission and presided over a district within the mis- 
sion. So that in fact it was a gathering of mission presidents through- 
out. 

In making their reports, which were brief and to the point and yet 
quite comprehensive, we discovered that these mission presidents are 
attentive to their duties and active and progressive, and are well posted. 
They reported the activities of the Elders and lady missionaries in the 
field. These young men and young women under their charge are very 
much devoted to the work, and most of them, if not all, have a testimony 
of the Gospel. They could not very well fill their appointments success- 
fully without a testimony of the Gospel. There may be a few among 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



them who, if they have not yet received a testimony, still say they believe 
the Gospel is true. In those cases the testimony soon comes to them. 

SPIRIT OF TESTIMONY WITH LEADERS AND PEOPLE 

Before we closed our meeting and as it progressed these thirteen 
mission presidents bore their testimonies and each and all of them said 
that they knew that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the 
world ; that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet sent of God, standing at 
the head of this great last dispensation. That was their testimony uni- 
formly, no exception to the rule. And be it remembered, brethren and sis- 
ters, that that same spirit of testimony rests upon the Presidency of the 
Church. We will not soon forget the powerful testimony that was 
given by President Grant at the opening of this conference. The same 
spirit is with his counselors, I assure you, and this testimony is with the 
Council of the Twelve Apostles. 

I am happy to say that the Twelve are active, diligent and faithful 
in the performance of their duties. They are a body of men who make 
quick response. They do not hesitate, there is no shirker in that Council, 
they are alive to the situation. I think you will agree with me that they 
are men of wisdom, men of counsel, and I believe I can say as the presi- 
dent of the Twelve that they are as nearly one as a Council of Twelve 
could be, and that they give to the Presidency of the Church their entire 
support. They recognize them as their file leaders and are laboring con- 
stantly under their jurisdiction. If we go into the stakes of Zion — 
and we are a traveling high council — we go to represent the Presidency 
of the Church because we are laboring under their direction. I am very- 
happy to bear this testimony to you. So far as I know there is no divi- 
sion of sentiment in the Council of the Apostles. 

The same testimony rests not only upon the Twelve, but upon the 
First Council of Seventy, and not only upon them but upon the quorums 
of the holy Priesthood — High Priests, Seventies and Elders — and upon 
the presidencies of stakes and high councils, also bishoprics of wards 
and lesser officers in the Church. 

And may I be permitted to say that this testimony as to the truth of 
the Gospel is in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, the entire people of 
this Church, and there is no uncertainty about it either. They know it is 
the truth. They know it is the pearl of great price. They know it is 
most precious indeed. 

I am speaking now, as perhaps I have a right to, of the Twelve. We 
know that except we are one we are not Christ's. And further let me add 
that except the people of the Latter-day Saints are one they are not 
Christ's, because he is not the author of doubt or disbelief or contention 
or false doctrine. 

I bear testimony to you that this is a glorious work in which we are 
engaged, and this is a glorious occasion and a glorious time. I know 
there is a depression and we have suffered and are suffering every day 
more or less from it, but behind and above it all is the Lord God of Israel 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON

and we are getting experiences that may be profitable to us. If the Lord 
will sanctify it to our good, we will surely be mor e careful in the future, 
will be a little more economical, will not be wasteful and spend our means 
foolishly, and we will stand by the principles of liberty and by the Declara- 
tion of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. May the Lord bless the 
Presidency of the Church, all of which I humbly pray in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

Sister Elizabeth S. Cushing sang a solo, "My Western Home." 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

What a remarkable age is this in which we live! It seems to me 
that it is most wonderful, and I feel grateful that the Lord has permitted 
me to live in an age and time when such wonderful progress has been 
made, in an age that surpasses all previous periods in the history of the 
world, and yet the preacher tells us there is no new thing under the sun 
— things which were, which are now, and will be in the future. Some- 
times I almost doubt that, and yet when I contemplate it still further, 
I believe that all of our progress, the advancement of science, all our 
new inventions and discoveries, the great things that are taking place 
in the world today, mean simply this, that we are approaching nearer 
to the ultimate truth, that truth however which is eternal, and always 
has been, and always will be. 

None of the great principles of progress is changed. Many things 
are changing. We change our views with regard to many things, and 
in these changes lie the principles of progress, we do not remain just 
where we are. We are going onward, but that progress is that we are 
approaching more nearly to the truth. 

We want to keep abreast with all the various things we see around 
us ; we do not want to be accused at any time of not progressing. We 
ought to adapt ourselves more or less to the times in which we live and 
not be what some people call those who do not change at all, "old fogies." 
Old fogies ? Oh, no, but there are some things that do not change, and 
one thing is the truth, and the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is the 
truth. Whenever we see people who undertake to make changes in the 
fundamental things that have been revealed from heaven they are under- 
taking to change God's truth. 

The Lord has said, "I am the Lord, and I change not." His word 
shall endure forever. The Lord has so ordained that a number of gen- 
erations shall be contemporary in sojourning upon this earth. What a 
wise provision is this! What a wonderful thing is wedlock, the home 
where father and mother rear their family of children ! What a splendid 
thing it is to have grandfathers and grandmothers, and even great grand- 
fathers and great grandmothers, four or five generations sometimes con- 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



temporary, living upon the earth at the same time ! What a wonderful 
advantage that is to mankind, an advantage to the aged, and an advan- 
tage to the young, to live and to mingle together and to partake of each 
other's feeling and spirit! Youth — how eager they ought to be to 
profit by the experience of Age ! The aged — what a wonderful and ele- 
vating influence it must have upon them as they ponder over the lives 
and characters of their own children ! What a development of all the 
Christian virtues is involved in this contact or association with those you 
love — your own kindred ! It always brings a certain amount of regret 
when this association is lacking. 

Old age can learn much from youth. They keep us abreast with 
the times ; they keep us alive to the burning questions of the day. There- 
fore, you fathers and mothers, let us listen to the young with sympathetic 
hearts while they endeavor to instruct us, which they sometimes feel 
themselves quite competent to do. But, oh youth, you have much to 
learn from old age! Out of the rich experiences of many years your 
elders are surely able to instruct you in the way of life, in the principles 
of truth. 

The Psalmist says : "I have been young, and now am old, yet have 
I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." There- 
fore youth should hearken and give heed unto the counsels of old age ; 
they should seek the counsel of their fathers and their mothers. Remem- 
ber the Lord's commandment : "Honor thy father and thy mother, that 
thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." 
How greatly then we ought to appreciate the privilege of living with 
them and seeking their counsel, and we ought not to regard them as "old 
fogies," or somebody not up to the times. How can one be up to the 
times unless he can benefit by the experience he has ? How could there 
be any progress without experience ? 

"There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty 
giveth them understanding," and whatever understanding we have it 
comes from the Almighty. There is no other source of knowledge. He 
is the great fountain of all truth, the inspirer of all discoveries ; they all 
come from him. I am aware that sometimes we find inventors, dis- 
coverers and scientists that are not always willing to admit the source 
of their inventions and their discoveries, but nevertheless it is true.. 
We do not always appreciate when the Lord is making known his truth. 

I remember in my school days many years ago reading the story 
of a Greek philosopher, Archimedes, who was making a study of specific 
gravity, the relative weight of things. Upon one occasion while he was 
bathing in a pool of water he observed that his body in the water was 
much lighter than it was out of the water, and as he pondered upon it 
a flash of light came to him and, greatly elated over his discovery, and 
forgetting that he was naked, he rushed out into the street crying 
"Eureka, Eureka, — I have found it!" 

Now what was that ? There was a spirit in the man and the in- 
spiration of the Almighty had given him understanding. It does not 
detract from the honor that is due to the scientist, the discoverer, or the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

inventor to say that God has used him in bringing truth to light. And 
what is true of secular knowledge and of the things that pertain to our 
temporal salvation is likewise true of religion. God uses scientists and 
philosophers, inventors and discoverers — for they are also his servants 
— in bringing secular truth to light ; but he also uses his servants, the 
prophets, in bringing spiritual truth to light. 

What a wonderful flood of light came into this world with the 
advent of the Gospel, with the coming of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that 
prophet of the latter days 1 What wonderful discoveries have come to 
us and to all mankind ! The same almighty being who overrules all 
things is bringing to pass his mighty purposes, and a flood of spiritual 
light has come to the world through the instrumentality of the prophet 
of God in the day and age in which we live. That is another source of 
joy and gladness to me that I live in this glorious day, notwithstanding 
the fact the world seems to be changing. We are merely discovering 
more truth. 

How eager we should be to keep abreast of the times and come to 
a knowledge of the truth, both secular and spiritual, scientific and 
religious. Be assured that when we do there will be no conflict between 
the two. Doctor John A. W'idtsoe tells us in that excellent little book 
"In Search of Truth" that "the way to truth may be found by anyone 
who desires it." "But," says he, "he must desire it with all his might, 
mind and strength." 

We often sing the words of our inspired poet, John Jacques : 

Yes, say, what is Truth? Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or Gods can aspire; 

Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, 

Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies, 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 

And let me add the following words found in the closing paragraphs 
of the Lord's preface to the Doctrine and Covenants : 

Search these commandments for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies 
and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

What I the Lord have spoken, I have speken, and I excuse not myself; and 
though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but 
shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, 
it is the same. 

For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the spirit beareth record, and the 
record fs true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. 

But other things do change. I am reminded of a little sentiment I 
read in an autograph album in the German language when I was upon 
my first mission. Slightly paraphrased it reads like this : 

Es wechselt Zeit und Glueck 
Es aendert alles sich 
Doch Gottes Liebe bleibt 
Stets unveraenderlich. 

Translated into English, without any attempt at rhyming, it means

this : Time and fortune change, everything changes, but the love of 
God remains always unchangeable. 

'And so it is with his glorious Gospel. It is the means of advance- 
ment, it is the means of progressing along spiritual lines. If we would 
be better men and better women, and lay hold on eternal life, let us 
render obedience to those principles which God has revealed, and which 
have remained the same from eternity to eternity, never changing. If 
we have fallen by the way and made mistakes and feel almost depressed 
and discouraged, resort again to those principles. There never was a 
time when genuine faith and sincere repentance would not bring a bless- 
ing and a change for better in one's life. There never can be a time when 
these principles will not bring progress and advancement. There never 
will be a time when we can grow in the knowledge of God and good 
works without the application of these principles. Be not discouraged 
or fall by the way, but if we have made mistakes repent and (if not 
already) be baptized, every one of us, for the remission of our sins, and 
we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. These principles are 
applicable to all mankind and they never change worlds without end. 

May God bless us and our children to the latest generation and help 
us to live in accordance with them, that we may come to the knowledge 
of the Truth. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Yesterday afternoon I stood in uniform on the parade grounds at 
Fort Douglas. That uniform indicated that I held a position of some 
importance in the United States Army. On each shoulder I had insignia 
showing my rank ; on the lapels of my coat the insignia showing the 
branch to which I belong. Men in uniform honored that insignia by 
saluting me, many of them did not know me, they were showing their 
respect for the authority as indicated by my uniform. I had wit- 
nessed death-dealing instruments and machinery, while overhead air- 
planes were roaring, diving to the earth, turning and looping, to show 
their power and strength. In the guard-house were confined men who 
had been disobedient to orders, on the parade grounds were men forming 
for review. 

As the commanding officer gave orders, which were passed from one 
to another, all executed them with precision and accuracy. They had been 
well trained and knew what to do. Every man was in his place, and 
rendered the service required of him without hesitation or confusion. 

During the time I was there I had in my mind another picture. I 
had left this building and hurried to that place to take part as an officer 
during the celebration of the state department of the Reserve Officers 
Association of the U. S. A. Here was a marked contrast. There I 
found a group of men trained and equipped to battle an enemy if an 
enemy should come upon us. They were soldiers and that was their 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



59 



calling and duty. Some of my brethren have inferred that it was not 
very becoming for one of my position to be engaged in such work. It is 
not of my choosing. I went in at the request of this government and 
have remained because we are all expected to do our duty. For the dura- 
tion of eighteen years I have been at times under training. During that 
time I have never heard one of them — and I have mingled with men of 
the line and officers of every rank, up to that of commanding general — 
ever express a desire that we go into action. But I have heard them 
say that they wanted to be prepared to defend themselves should an 
enemy make it necessary for them to go into action. The Army of the 
United States is not training to invade the country of another, but they 
are training to be ready and prepared to defend their country if an 
enemy should come upon them. 

Now, as to this army which I see before me. The officers are not 
in uniform, no insignia of rank to designate their authority, but they are 
men nevertheless who have authority to serve and to give orders in a 
greater army, one commanded by our Lord and Savior. These officers 
are devoted to the great cause in which they are engaged. They are men 
who are self-sacrificing, men who are full of faith and of love. And 
when I say men I speak of our sisters also, for I am quite sure if it were 
not for the devotion of our wives and our mothers and our sisters, we 
would find it far more difficult to carry on the work that is required of us. 

This army is made up of deacons, teachers, priests, elders, seventies 
and high priests, with power far greater than that which comes to those 
who are engaged in this other army. 

I believe that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, 
his Son, and conversed with them. I believe that the Priesthood of God 
was bestowed upon him and his associates, and that that Priesthood has 
been passed down to us. iWe enjoy power and privileges through it. 
I say power, because in the Priesthood there is a power as witnessed daily 
where the Priesthood is found and exercised in harmony with the plan 
and promise of God. To have this Priesthood conferred upon one is not 
only a privilege but a great honor, and one who receives it and disregards 
its sacredness is a deserter. 

Some among us are asking for new revelations. I am not concerned 
as to whether new revelation is coming or not. I am just a little fearful 
that should new revelation come, especially if it should be of the type 
that some people feel we should have, too many of us would not be in a 
position to stand up under it, as evidenced by the failure to understand 
and follow that which has been given to us. I am concerned with that 
which has been received and the question of whether or not I am living 
in harmony with those teachings which have come to us through revela- 
tion by the power of the Priesthood. 

I am not so sure that we as a people as yet are sufficiently familiar 
with the revealed word which has been given to us to be in a position to 
receive new revelation ; and I am quite sure that when we reach a point 
where we fully understand and observe that which has been given to us 
new revelation will come, and those whom the Lord has endowed with 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



authority to receive revelations will receive them. For more than a quar- 
ter of a century it has been my good fortune, privilege and blessing to 
meet almost daily with the men whom we sustain as the Presidency of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and whom we sustain 
as prophets, seers and revelators. With that acquaintance and that 
association there is no question in my soul but that when the time comes 
for us to receive more than the Lord has already revealed, it will come 
through them, or their successors. 

One of my brethren working in the Church Historian's office, said 
to me : "Brother Smith, I have been going over your sermons and com- 
piling them. You have something human about that which you say. 
You are constantly appealing for help for the young man." It may 
seem that that is the only thought I have to express in these meetings. 
We are of necessity limited as to time. There are many other subjects 
I could use, but as a member of the Presiding Bishopric, a member of 
the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, there has been placed upon me a responsibility, 
and as I visit with you and see the reports that come in I think I sense 
that responsibility, and I don't want to be held to account for my failure 
to encourage my brethren to see that which I think I see. 

We have accomplished a most wonderful missionary work, and yet 
there is much more to be done. We don't have a guard-house. In this 
army punishment is of our own making. We go out to battle, and, 
unlike the Army of the United States, we are in a great conflict. Some 
of us don't know it, but we are. We have an enemy, an enemy we can't 
always see, an enemy which we don't always feel, because we have not 
been trained to see and feel. When we who hold the Priesthood and are 
honoring it and magnifying our calling in it, come in contact with that 
enemy, we are given to understand that he is an enemy and that we must 
defend ourselves with all the vigor and power of our manhood. We don't 
always do it. 

I dislike to make this statement, and would not do so were it not 
for the fact that I have heard it several times during the past year in 
different stakes of this Church : "But Brother Smith, we can't do it," — 
speaking of laboring with men who have become indifferent to the work 
of the Church and are falling away — "We are a little community. We 
know each other. All we do when we go to visit is 'kid' each other." 
What justification is there for such a thought? If we permit it, are we 
prepared ? To me it has the ear mark of a slacker. I think a prophecy 
made centuries ago might give us some encouragement. The prophet 
Haggai said : 

Ye have sown much, and bring in little ; ye eat, but ye have not enough ; ye 
drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm ; and 
he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. 
Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. (Haggai 1 :6-7. ) 

Are we not in that condition? Why is it? What has brought about 
this condition ? How are we to overcome it or change it ? Just one way. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



61 



and only one, and that is to be true to the Gospel teachings and honor 
the Priesthood which has been conferred upon us. And those who are 
afraid to kneel in prayer with a wayward brother should first set their own 
houses in order; then when we have developed faith, manifest that faith 
through our works. When we do exercise our faith in our work the 
Spirit of God is manifest, whether in our own home or in the home of our 
neighbor, or in the lives of our neighbors, and the better the acquaintance 
the greater the opportunity for carrying into the life of our brother who 
is wayward that which will save him from the error of his ways. It can 
be done only through the spirit of prayer, not by "kidding," not by being- 
afraid. 

Remember the statement of Paul to Timothy : 

I thank God whom I serve . . . that without ceasing I have remembrance 
of thee in my prayers night and day; 

Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, 
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 

For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power, and of love, 
and of a sound mind. 

Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of cur Lord. . . 

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to 
our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in 
Christ Jesus before the world began. (2 Tim. 1 :3-9) 

The Savior said : 

Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess 1 also 
before my Father which is in heaven. 

But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my 
Father which is in heaven. 

And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of 
me. (Matt. 10:32, 33, 38.) 

It is my opinion that if we want to succeed, if we want to bring peace 
in the earth we should stir up the spirit, the gift which is in us, by the 
laying on of hands by those who are in authority, being not afraid. Let 
us go into the homes of these our brethren who are wayward, and who 
because of inactivity have been blinded and see not the light, and pray 
with them and plead with them, that God may give them again the spirit 
of the work, that they may return into the spiritual light, and praise him 
for his goodness and his mercy. That will bring peace. That will put 
love into the hearts of men, and is the only way in the world in which 
peace and happiness and prosperity can come to the children of God in 
the earth. 

What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have 
not works ? Can faith save him ? 

Even so, faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 

Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my 
works. 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well ; the devils also believe, 
and tremble. 

But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead ?. . . . 
By works was faith made perfect. 

Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead. 
(James 2:14-26) 

May the Lord help us, I pray. May his Spirit rest upon us. May 
we understand that this Priesthood which is in the Church today has 
power and is manifest in the Church, through those who serve, not only 
as leaders, known as the general authorities of the Church, but you who 
labor in the stakes. 

God bless you, and bless those who serve with you, that we may 
carry the spirit of this work into every home, into the life of every indi- 
vidual, continuing untiring and unafraid, until we shall have won the 
battle and brought them back into the fold. God so help us, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, the last six months have been eventful ones 
in the Eastern States Mission. We have dedicated three chapels in that 
mission. A member of the Council of Twelve, Elder Stephen L. Rich- 
ards, has visited practically every district in the mission. President 
Grant, during his stay in the East this winter, also went into many of the 
branches and districts of the mission, all of which we feel sure has 
resulted in great good. 

Reference has been made in this conference to the dedication, last 
November, of the Washington chapel. We regard it as one of the great 
agencies for missionary service in the Eastern States. Brother Edward 
P. Kimball has given an organ recital every day, I think, except one, 
since the chapel was dedicated. More than six thousand people have 
attended these exercises. They consist not only of the organ recital, but 
also a speech by Brother Kimball and in most cases the escorting of the 
company through the building. Between five and six thousand tracts 
have been distributed at the chapel. 

This does not include the many people who visit the chapel during 
the day, nor the special clubs and organizations which have held their 
gatherings there. 

Recently one organization of the Government, with a membership 
of about four hundred was entertained there. The Rotarians of Wash- 
ington recently held their weekly dinner in our chapel. Some of the 
leading ladies' clubs of Washington have met there and have listened 
more or less to the story of Mormonism, which is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, as explained by our brethren in charge of the chapel. We feel 
very grateful for this great agency for good in our mission. 



ELDER DON B. COLTON

I have rejoiced in the exercises of this conference. There is an 
ancient Arabian proverb which reads something like this: "If thou hast 
two loaves of bread, sell one quickly and buy a rose. Something beautiful 
is as essential to the welfare of man as is bread." So I thought today, 
and also yesterday, particularly while listening not only to the inspired 
remarks but to the excellent music, that the spirit of all those who come 
to these conferences is being fed — fed with food as essential to the soul 
as that which is needed to nourish and strengthen the body. 

Two thoughts have been running through my mind ever since Presi- 
dent Grant spoke. Religion is the master passion in the life of a man 
who believes in Jesus Christ. It is the mainspring of his life, the motor 
that carries him forward. Today there are two great influences at work 
to encourage and develop religion within men. The mothers of Israel 
are doing, in my judgment, one of the greatest services possible for this 
Church. May I speak to the mothers particularly who have sons upon 
missions. Continue, I pray you, to write them. Tell them of the deep 
feelings in your soul. It does them good. Let them know your feelings 
concerning the Gospel. 

One boy, speaking to me just a few days ago, referred to the fact 
that he had written home and expressed some doubt as to whether or not 
he was acquiring all that he should acquire upon his mission. His good 
mother wrote back and said : "My son, if you are acquiring a testimony 
of the Gospel, if in your soul there is coming a conviction that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that his Gospel has been restored for the salvation of the 
souls of men — if you are acquiring that, you are acquiring sufficient to 
justify your being upon a mission." 

I would like to say to that mother, and hope it will encourage all 
mothers, that boy, on that occasion, with tears in his eyes and emotion 
in his voice, said : "That much I am acquiring. I do know, as I know 
that I live, that Jesus lives and that his work is true." 

I am grateful for my mother, now gone to her reward. I am 
grateful that from her I acquired the first feeling that led me to seek God. 
How glad I am for parents who knew of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ! 

The love of mother and its influence for good in the earth is perhaps 
only surpassed by the love of Jesus Christ. The power which he has 
exercised and is exercising in the world is the other great influence for 
good. 

Paraphrasing and abbreviating the words of another: Jesus was 
born in obscurity; never traveled more than two hundred miles from 
the place of his birth ; never attended a university ; had no newspaper ; 
never wrote a book ; the only property he owned of which we have any 
record was divided at the time of his death, at the end of a quarrel 
between soldiers ; dying between two thieves ; buried in a borrowed grave ; 
— yet he has exercised an influence in the world that exceeds that of all 
the armies that ever marched, all the navies that were ever built, all 
the parliaments that ever assembled, all the kings and queens that ever 
ruled. The influence of Jesus in the earth has exceeded them all, and 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it is a glorious thing to be an ambassador of the being whose influence 
has been and is so potent in the world. 

We have been accused of not being Christians. Well, what does 
it matter anyway, if the accusation is without foundation ? In this case 
it isn't true. We know that in his name and in his love and in his great 
Gospel plan is salvation, and in reality we are preaching his message to 
the world. And we say now — I say — that if the nations of the world 
would accept Christ and his teachings as taught by the Latter-day Saints 
all the problems of this weary world would be solved in a single day. 

God bless us and help us to know the truth. I know it and bear 
witness to you of its truthfulness today. God help us to know it and to 
live it, for it is the power of God unto salvation. I know whereof I speak, 
and bear this witness in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I trust that the Lord will give me strength to say the things I should 
say to you on this occasion. I have been deeply impressed during this 
conference, and especially with the remarks of our President at the first 
session. 

President Grant, in speaking of some criticisms, made reference to 
the fact that he acknowledged his own lack of information. When he 
said this I remembered that two thousand years ago the most learned 
men among the nation of the Jews went to the court of Pilate, the Roman 
governor, and there they said of our Savior : "Crucify him ;" and they 
emphasized it by repeating it three times. They also said : "Let his 
blood be upon us and upon our children." And I remember that just 
before this the Lord had asked Peter whom he thought that he, the Son 
of God, was, and Peter said : "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living- 
God." Then our Savior told him that that knowledge came direct from 
God through revelation. Then I thought of the two thousand years since 
then, when the sequel has proved that the great revelation which Peter 
had, though he was but a poor fisherman, without the learning of the 
world — I say time has proved that that knowledge was worth a thousand 
times more than all the knowledge of the learned. 

I have had the privilege of sitting, as a student, at the feet of some of 
the most learned men in this world. Or at least some who have the repu- 
tation of being the most learned. I remember that one of these great 
educators — the man who translated the Old Testament most recently, 
and whose translation is said to be the most learned translation of the 
Bible that we have, — in reviewing the events in the Old Testament this 
gentleman said that he had recently been to Palestine with the archaeo- 
logical expedition which his school had sent there. He was speaking of 
that story in the Bible which tells of the walls of Jericho falling when 
the army of Israel marched around the city. He said that in the explora- 



ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 



65 



tions of Jericho they had found that the walls had never fallen ; and in 
rather a light mood made light of that and other stories in the Bible. 

Of course, I do not feel that it is my duty, nor the duty of the Latter- 
day Saints, nor is it their responsibility, to prove the truth of all the 
stories in the Bible. Yet, I was impressed greatly only a month or two 
later when I read that that very expedition from his school, in exca- 
vating farther, had found that part of the walls of Jericho had fallen. 

Paul spoke of those who were ever learning but never coming to a 
knowledge of the truth. I respect the scientists, I respect the great men of 
learning, but I respect more than them those who, like the prophets of 
God, have obtained that light which comes direct from God, — that which 
can never be changed, even though another archaeological discovery 
may be made. 

It is the spirit of the Gospel of Christ — the spirit that is manifest 
by the missionaries in the mission field in their devotion to the great 
eternal truths which God has revealed, that will save this world from the 
ills which now encompass us. It is the same spirit which Abraham 
Lincoln had when, in reference to the laws of our country, he wrote the 
following words : 

Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, 
swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws 
of the country, and never to tolerate their violation. Let every man remember that 
to violate the law is to trample on the blocd of his father, and to tear the charter 
of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the law be breathed by 
every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it he 
taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges ; let it be written in primers, 
spelling books, and in almanacs ; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed 
from legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it 
become the political religion of the nation, and let the old and young, the rich and 
poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions 
sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars. 

Your sons and daughters in the Northern States Mission are full 
of this type of devotion which was advocated by our great President 
Lincoln. Their devotion is to the laws of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that 
sacred truth that the Lord has given to us as a people. 

I bring that message to you, and trust that throughout Zion that 
same love of truth, in the acting and doing of a thing, may come to all 
of us, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "High on the mountain tops." 
Elder Claudius Bowman, President of the Juarez Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



SECOND DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference commenced at 2 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant, who presided, announced that the music 
for this meeting would be furnished by the Liberty Stake Mutual Im- 
provement Association Chorus, under the leadership of Dr. David E. 
Smith. 

The Chorus sang as an opening number, "The heavens resound." 
The opening prayer was offered by Elder Joseph S. Peery, Presi- 
dent of the Temple Block Mission. 

The song, "Carry on," was sung by the Chorus. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Fifty years ago this summer my soul was deeply stirred when, with 
groups of others, I went to the railroad station in Logan to receive home 
the body of Elder Gibbs, who with his companion, Elder Berry, had 
been assassinated while doing missionary work in the Southern States. 
I shall never forget the memory of that night, and the emotions that 
swelled through my soul in contemplation of the sacrifice of these noble 
missionaries. 

A MARVELOUS CHANGE 

I have heard since then the story of the whipping and the mobbing of 
many others. Since the last conference I paid my first visit to the 
Southern States Mission. In company with President Callis we were 
officially visiting that mission, and what a change in the fifty years ! We 
held over thirty public meetings, attended by more than ten thousand 
people ; not a bit of opposition anywhere. There were no newspapers, 
from the large city dailies to the country papers, that were not willing 
to carry all the space we asked, and they gave us notices and reports of our 
meetings that were as satisfactory as anything we could secure here 
at home. 

In one of the large cities of the South a public reception was held 
which was attended by the mayor of the largest city in that state, and he 
gave a eulogy on the Mormon people. Radios were offered to us. It did 
seem to me that the change was marvelous and I could not but thank God 
for it. The condition is similar elsewhere, so that we have indeed 
reached a new day. 

ENEMY SEEKING NEW MEANS 

What is the meaning and significance of all this ? There may be some 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

who are disturbed because the world speaks well of us. I am not alarmed 
at that. I rejoice in it, because I do see a new day dawning for the 
Latter-day Saints. We had to have our struggles and fight for the right 
to exist. We have won and achieved our objectives up to this point, 
and now we look forward to a glorious day that is yet to come. 

I would not have you think, however, my brethren and sisters, that 
the enemy of all righteousness has quit the fight. By new means he is 
seeking to destroy that which mob violence and martyrdom, bonds and 
imprisonment and slander, could not destroy. Every means that has 
been heretofore successfully used in the destruction of God's work in the 
dispensations that have preceded ours, has failed to date. The old 
prophets saw it fail, for they declared that in the last days — I am quoting 
now from a prediction of Daniel — "In the days of these kings," — these 
latter kings — "shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall 
never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other people. 
Rut it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall 
stand forever." 

DAWNING OF A NEW DAY 

There was to be a new day. Nothing like it has happened heretofore, 
and so I am not alarmed that the kingdom is prosperous, and that at the 
end of an hundred years we discover it has achieved certain desirable goals. 
In the revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith, after having 
given us the fulness of the Gospel and established the Church with all 
the institutions and the doctrines necessary to perfect the lives of the 
people, he enjoins upon us to arise and shine and to become a light unto 
the nations. The old prophet saw this condition when he declared . 

In the last days the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in 
the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations 
shall flow unto it. 

And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the moun- 
tain of the Lord, to the house of the God of lacob; and he will teach us of his 
ways, and we will walk in his paths. 

All this indicates a change that will come over the hearts of the 
children of men toward the work of God. They shall not come to per- 
secute, but they shall come to learn of the ways of the Lord and to walk 
in his paths. 

satan's allurements 

I said a moment ago, however, that the enemy of this Church has 
not quit the fight. Nephi saw — and you will find it recorded in the twenty- 
eighth chapter of II Nephi — that in these days Satan would rage in the 
hearts of the children of men, and that one of the methods by which 
he would seek to destroy God's work would be to induce men who had 
entered into covenants to serve God to commit a little sin ; to steal a little ; 
to commit whoredoms a little ; then he would assure them that they would 
be beaten with a few stripes, but that it would be all right. Thus he 
would deceive them and lure them away from their standards. 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Among other things Nephi said : "They have all gone astray save 
it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ ; nevertheless they are 
led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the 
precepts of men," — warning that the enemy, by new tactics, by new 
methods, would seek to destroy the work. I see the evidences of it. 

A CHANGING WORLD 

In this changing world — and we are in the midst of change — no 
standards are so sacred or so old but that they are being questioned today. 
I am not disturbed over this questioning age. I think it is the greatest 
age the truth has ever known, and that the truth could never grow as it 
should grow unless men are open-minded and are willing to ask ques- 
tions and to receive light and information. Yet I recognize that there is 
great peril and danger that in the changes that are occurring we may 
discard many true, good, and beautiful things. So that there is need, as 
never before, to lift our standards in this changing world, and to rally 
our people to them. 

But we parents and teachers must be able to give a reason for every- 
thing we ask our children and our people to do. Thank the Lord there 
are good reasons for everything the Lord has asked us to do. I see 
danger, however, that in the desire for change many thoughtless ones 
will want to change stable, eternal practices and principles. I see the 
spirit of the enemy at work in seeking to destroy the standards of mor- 
ality among men. From the time of my childhood, at my mother's 
knee, and in the Church, I was taught to keep myself as clean and as 
pure .as the girl I asked to be my wife, the mother of my children; 
that next to the crime of murder was the crime of adultery. Yet there 
are those who would have the thoughtless believe that improper sex 
relations are all right as long as one is not exposed. The devil surely 
has paved the way with promises of immunity to those who would follow 
after his standards. 

TRUE TO OUR STANDARDS 

But will the world come to learn of this people if we live like the 
world? Suppose they abandon their standards, shall we do so too? No ; 
no, we will carry on, loyal and true to our standards. You young men, 
descendants of that Joseph who was sold into Egypt, think upon him 
in the hour of his temptation, how he stood for chastity and for virtue ! 

Let us be, therefore, men and women who are standard makers, not 
like the world. Any man or any nation who imagines that one can 
depart from these standards that the Lord established when he uttered 
the Ten Commandments and find peace and the solution of human 
happiness is sadly mistaken. 

We are also in danger from the spirit of abandonment, having re- 
pealed the Eighteenth Amendment. Some folks may be of the notion 
that the Word of Wisdom is also repealed, but thank the Lord that this 
Church still has a high standard to guide it, and not by compulsion or by 
force, but by persuasion, by appeal, with precious promises. These 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



69 



principles stand and will stand forever, and will continue to appeal to our 
people to live up to them. They are standards of honesty, standards of 
uprightness that will make any people great if they will only observe 
them. 

god's work shall triumph 

So, my brethren and sisters, we ought to be aware of the new 
menace. I am not afraid of it. If the Latter-day Saint teachers and 
parents and leaders will forewarn the youth, I feel sure they will be as 
loyal and true to the truth as their fathers and mothers were, and that 
this new manner of assault and attack made upon the membership of the 
Church will be no more successful in destroying this work than have 
been mob violence, bonds and imprisonment, because God has decreed 
that this work shall triumph and shall not be left to another people. It 
is true that Satan will give revelations to lead the people away from the 
truth — pretended revelations to lead them into open violation of the 
commandments of the Lord — but I have confidence in the outcome. We 
have been through this long period of struggle to secure certain rigrhts 
and privileges. We have been through the day of colonization, of mi- 
gration and immigration ; the settlement of the waste places ; of building 
temples and tabernacles ; of subduing the desert and securing the com- 
forts and necessities of life, and the Lord has been with us in all these 
changing scenes. 

There are some who would be disturbed because they see no im- 
mediate objective before the Church. I grant you that where there is no 
vision the people will perish. But there is a vision before us if only our 
eyes are turned toward it, a vision of the most glorious things to be 
accomplished by this Church. We have reached a new day, and all these 
changes that have occurred, changing the attitude toward the Church, 
were necessary in order that we might be prepared for that new day that 
is before us. The day of demonstration has come to the Church, the day 
for it to arise and shine, in a world which has been crushed and humbled 
to the very dust — a world that is full of doubt and uncertainty and that 
is questioning and abandoning the creeds of men. 

Perhaps some of you have been reading articles such as "God save 
the Church," "What is Wrong with the Church ?" and other articles that 
have been appearing recently, measuring the institutions of man and 
finding them wanting. One author says : "We waited eighteen hundred 
years for Christianity to reach the zenith of its power, and then it was 
utterly helpless to save the world from one of the greatest catastrophes 
which have happened — the world war. Why wait for Christianity to 
help us out of our troubles?" 

CHURCH NOT FOUND WANTING 

But the Church of Christ has not been weighed in the balance and 
found wanting. I grant you that men have done the best they could 
during the ages that are past, with the small measure of light they have 
had. But never since the Lord Jesus Christ, in the sacred grove, said of the 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



institutions of men, that they had the form of godliness but lacked the 
power thereof, have these words been more generally accepted as true. 
Without the power to accomplish what the Gospel of Jesus Christ was 
destined to do men did the best they could. Joseph Smith could have done 
no better had he not received divine authority and the perfect Gospel plan 
at the hands of divinely appointed messengers from God. 

Now, for the first time in the history of the world, the Church of 
Jesus Christ has an opportunity to demonstrate that it has indeed the pow- 
er, the knowledge, and the strength to meet and solve the problems of this 
world, and the world is willing to listen. They have been humbled so 
that the wisdom of the wise has perished and the understanding of the 
prudent is hid,- and men are willing to listen today as they never have 
been heretofore. 

Oh, you Latter-day Saints, to your standards! Talk about abandon- 
ing the Word of Wisdom ? Now is the time to rally to it and then show 
the world a race of men and women of physical, mental, spiritual, and 
intellectual strength, the like of which we have not seen. And that will 
come if we shall adhere to these Gospel standards. 

Those of you who are anxious to see the Church move forward 
in the solution of the economic problems and the establishment of that 
vision which once was given to the Church, known as the United Order 
— then immediately afterwards the Lord saw the necessity for training 
us, preparing us, and he gave us the law of tithing, which he called a 
schoolmaster — if you want to see that other thing come, pay your tithes 
and offerings, be honest before the Lord, for no man can live the Order 
of Enoch who has not learned how to honestly live the law of tithing. 
If you want to promote that glorious day, live the law of tithing. If you 
want to see the realization of all these glorious things spoken of by the 
prophets of old, subscribe to these Gospel standards. 

The world will come up to the top of the mountains to learn of the 
ways of such a people. Our opportunity I say, therefore, is to demon- 
strate what we believe — not so much by what we say as by what we do, 
for that, after all, is the most effective argument we can present to the 
world. That opportunity is ours today. 

A GLORIOUS FUTURE 

I see the hand of the Lord moving rapidly in the events of the world. 
He is preparing for our mission to be carried on, not only among this 
small handful of people that we have been an hundred years gathering up 
—we have been an hundred years gathering up but one branch of the 
house of Israel — but the day for the rest of that favored house is at hand. 
God is preparing the way. The day is soon to dawn for those who are 
of our family and of other branches of it. Activity such as we have 
never dreamed of will presently be ours if we shall succeed in realizing 
the hope the Lord had in establishing this work. Missionaries? We 
will need ten where we have needed one. I see no diminution, I see no 
end, but I see a glorious future awaiting God's work. 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord hasn't 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



71 



gone off and left the Church. He is working, preparing the way for it 
to function, to fill its mission, to come out of its isolation, to arise and 
shine. God is not retarding the work but there are some of us who are 
not living up to our covenants and our privileges. We might speed it on. 
Do not worry about the Church. The good ship is sailing on in the 
charted course God marked for it. The light is in the ship. The captain 
is not asleep. 

I bear witness to you that no man has ever presided over this 
Church who has been more willing to do what the Lord wants him to do 
than the man who presides today. God bless him and God bless the 
people, and help men to see the new highways that are ready for our 
feet, the new deceptions that will be offered, that we may escape the pit- 
falls that would lure us from our standards, that we may continue to be 
loyal and true, and go marching on victoriously with God's work, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am impressed, my brethren and sisters, with this wonderful con- 
gregation, and with the spirit of this meeting, as well as those that have 
preceded it. This is a representative congregation of the Latter-day 
Saints. Here are represented practically all of the officers of the Church 
and a goodly number of the members thereof. I am happy to be with 
you. Yet I feel keenly the difficulty of speaking in the midst of this vast 
gathering. 

LABORS OF PRESIDING BISHOPRIC 

I desire briefly to report to you my stewardship in the position that 
I fill, as a servant of this people and as one of the servants of the Lord. 
The labors and duties of the Presiding Bishopric are varied and extensive. 
I desire to state to you that we are doing our best to fulfil the duties and 
responsibilities thereof, to exercise judgment, accuracy and economy in 
all the matters entrusted to our care ; and to see that honesty and integ- 
rity are maintained in every department of the work. While the duties 
and labors are many and diverse, we are endeavoring to so organize and 
systematize the affairs that you may be assured that every phase of the 
work with which we have to do is being carried forward promptly and 
thoroughly, and the most effective results possible obtained in every 
division thereof. I rejoice in this duty. I may say to you that I have 
never worked so hard in my life as during the time that I have been in, 
this place ; and I have never enjoyed work so greatly as I have in this 
department. I realize that the Lord has blessed me more than I have 
been justified in receiving. I desire to carry on under the direction of my 
brethren of the First Presidency, and to do my best to advance the pur- 
poses of the Lord. 

PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH 

In addition to what has been presented in the financial and statistical 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



report of the progress of this work during 1933, and since the last con- 
ference, I call your attention to the fact that in general there is an increase 
in the activities, and as far as can be determined, in the faith of the 
people. Notwithstanding the very seriously unfavorable economic con- 
ditions of the past year, there was a slight increase in the tithes of the 
people of the Church. There was quite a material increase in the number 
who paid tithing, which indicates the faith of those who have taken upon 
them these covenants. Unfortunately, there was not an increase in the 
fast offerings. Why that should be I cannot quite understand ; because of 
the need of donations that should come through the fasting of the people, 
and their willingness to give for those who are in need. In other respects 
the activities have generally increased. There was a slight increase in the 
attendance at sacrament meetings and at ward Priesthood meetings. 

GROWTH OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

There was an increase in the number who bear the Priesthood of 
the Church, both in the Melchizedek and the Aaronic Priesthoods. The 
Aaronic Priesthood members now total, over 90,000. I believe that those 
who have the responsibility of these young men throughout the Church, 
in the stakes and wards and missions, are appreciating more and more 
the importance of training these young men and giving them personal 
consideration, so that they may become imbued with the spirit and power 
of their Priesthood, and be prepared for the responsibilities that will 
come to them in the future. 

GREAT MISSION OF THE CHURCH 

About a year before the Church was organized various men received 
revelations from the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith in some 
of which a particular expression was used. In the revelation given to 
David Whitmer the following words occur: "Seek to bring forth and 
establish my Zion." Now, I appreciate the fact that this work, which 
was declared to them in a prospective way, before the Church was organ- 
ized, and which was revealed, at the time of the organization of the 
Church, as a great and marvelous work that was about to come forth — I 
realize that this work has a great destiny and a great mission before it. 
It has already been expressed in our hearing during these gatherings. 
That mission is especially to promulgate the Gospel to all mankind— to 
bring those who desire to know the truth to a knowledge and acceptance 
of the same ; to promote generally the welfare and progress of mankind ; 
to build better communities in which to live ; and to prepare the way for 
the coming of the reign of peace. 

GREAT MISSIONARY WORK OF THE PAST 

Consider for a moment the fact that during the one hundred years 
that have elapsed since the Church was organized a marvelous work has 
been accomplished. The leadership of the Church, and all the officers and 
members thereof, in the past hundred years, have done a great pioneer- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



73 



ing work, first in the promulgation of the Gospel ; second in colonization 
and empire building ; and third, in cultural growth. Consider the tremen- 
dous effort that was put forth to open the doors of the many nations to 
the Gospel in those times when they were lacking in means and in men, 
with the unfavorable means of transportation and communication ! What 
a wonderful achievement in the spread of the Gospel message in that 
hundred years ! 

PIONEERING AND EMPIRE BUILDING 

Again, in the building of the settlements and the advancement of the 
people in a temporal way, what a splendid pace they set ! We follow them 
from New York, through Ohio, Missouri, Illinois and Iowa ; and then 
out to the Rocky Mountains ; and we remember the growth and develop- 
ment that has occurred throughout the intermountain empire in the mean- 
time. It is marvelous to appreciate ! They were real pioneers. These 
men and women were not daunted by any unfavorable conditions. They 
carried on under the most adverse circumstances. They had persecu- 
tions to meet. Yet new communities were built and the borders of the 
Church extended. Here they were taught to build and beautify homes, 
farms, towns and cities, and to promote their local interests. 

SPIRITUAL AND CULTURAL GROWTH 

Then, in addition to the material growth, the Church members were 
being given spiritual and cultural development through the facilities of 
the Priesthood, the schools that were organized, the auxiliary associations, 
and through musical, dramatic and social features, even in the midst of 
frontier hardships such as we can scarcely appreciate. So the work has 
gone on, and the way has been prepared, in a measure at least, for the 
coming of the reign of peace. 

ANOTHER ERA 

Now we stand at the beginning of another hundred years — another 
era. What shall be the achievements of this people during that era ? We 
are one hundred years nearer the reign of peace and the millennium. The 
results will depend largely upon our initiative — individual and collective. 
Conditions at the present time — men's thoughts and ideas — are changing 
rapidly. We realize to some extent from past experience how the 
thoughts and sentiments of mankind can be changed, but we also realize 
what remarkable changes must occur in human nature before mankind 
can be prepared for universal peace. 

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 

As has been expressed here, there are certain things that are funda- 
mental, — that do not change so far as the Gospel of Jesus Christ is con- 
cerned. Among others the law of morality does not change in any age. 
The ordinance of baptism, as a means of bringing people into the fold of 
Christ, does not change at any time. And so with other eternal principles. 
Only by obedience thereto will promised blessings follow. It has been 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



said that there is nothing so constant as change. There are policies that 
may change, habits and customs that may change, in the progress of 
civilization, to which men must adapt themselves. The Latter-day Saints 
are most progressive in adopting and adapting conditions to the situations 
under which we live, and that without sacrificing anything that is funda- 
mentally important in the Gospel. We accept these changing temporal 
conditions. But the nature of these conditions which affect our temporal 
welfare must conform in principle to our spiritual ideals. 

THE CHALLENGE TO US 

Now, in what respects can we, as Latter-day Saints today, looking 
forward, carry on just as effectively as have those who have carried on 
this work from the beginning ? It seems to me that there are three ways 
in which we should particularly direct our thought and effort not only 
toward ourselves as a people, but to the welfare and progress of men 
generally, and toward the preparation for the coming of the reign of 
peace. These three ways are similar to those referred to in the past 
history of this people. 

BUILD FAITH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS 

First, we should seek to establish the cause of Zion more firmly in 
the hearts and lives of the younger members of the Church. We should 
continue to build a structure of faith upon the solid foundations already 
laid. It is our obligation to increase the courage and determination such 
as has been evidenced by those who have led the people throughout the 
history of the Church. The establishment of Zion now justifies and 
demands even more whole-hearted effort. The entire freedom from per- 
secution which we now enjoy should cause us to put forth our energies 
in larger measure to the solution of various problems which confront us, 
and which interfere with our progress. We should be thankful that 
we are now enjoying the friendliness and consideration of men generally. 
But we do not need in any way to sacrifice any principle in which w« 
believe, in order to enjoy that respect and regard. Being free from perse- 
cution, we should not be lulled to sleep, nor in any way slacken our efforts 
in behalf of the cause of truth. The development of greater faith will 
lead to a fuller observance of all Gospel principles and to greater unity. 
Likewise, in these perilous times we should, as a people, teach more ex- 
tensively and practice the highest standards of virtue and morality. 
If we enjoy the spirit of the Gospel it will produce greater tolerance and 
consideration on the part of everyone of us toward our fellowmen every- 
where. In the same manner we should be willing to forgive and have 
the desire to be forgiven of our shortcomings which will be the means 
of producing finer lives by all who practice such principles. 

ADVANCEMENT OF MISSIONARY WORK 

In the missionary work, just as has been done in the hundred years 
that have passed, it seems to me that there is a tremendous opportunity 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



75 



and responsibility. We have new means of transportation and commu- 
nication, whereby time can be saved and the Gospel can be spread in wider 
circles than ever before. I think those means need to be adopted as 
fully as possible. It would appear that every appropriate facility for the 
spreading of the Gospel should be carefully considered and applied in 
the most effective way. There is a fine opportunity for initiative on the 
part of those who have the direction of the missionary work, to do it in 
such a way that it shall be advanced most profitably. Yet there is a fun- 
damental feature of missionary work which we cannot neglect. That 
is the teaching of the Savior, both in the time when he was upon the 
earth, and in these days by revelation from the Lord, that we should 
preach the Gospel as nearly as .possible without purse and scrip. Ex- 
perience has everywhere proven, I think, that generally the missionaries 
who spend the least do the best work and have the greatest success among 
the people. The personal contact and conversations of the missionary 
with those who may be interested in the Gospel message is the important 
thing for which to strive. The personal testimony of the man who goes 
out in the power and spirit of his calling is most effective. Therefore, 
it seems to me that the distribution of literature and other efforts should 
be a means to the important end which is to get Gospel conversations with 
the people. 

DEVELOPMENT OF FINER CIVILIZATION 

The second way, I think, in which we can help to establish Zion is 
through the development of a finer civilization than has ever previously 
existed in the world. Wjhat makes a good civilization? I conceive it 
to be that condition of society in which every man, woman and child 
enjoys in fairness, equity and justice, the opportunity for steady progress 
in material, cultural and spiritual things, and protection against tyranny, 
oppression and evils of every nature. It is a condition where everyone 
is willing to do his or her part, and where good will and mutual helpful- 
ness prevail. To the extent that any or all of these conditions are lacking 
today it is our opportunity to work together to endeavor to bring them 
about. The Church stands for the progress and welfare of humanity. 
Let us, therefore, apply the Gospel teachings to the improvement oi 
social conditions. 

IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION 

We should strive to promote even better general education for our 
young people, wherein will be inculcated in larger measure an apprecia- 
tion of moral and ethical principles and practices. We need to provide 
also for the application of theoretical instruction, to the problems which 
prevail in our various communities. There should be more vocational 
and applied courses suited to the conditions in the different localities, so 
that the young people may have the opportunity to fit into the local situa- 
tions, and not have to drift away to other places and probably lose oppor- 
tunities that might be theirs. It is to be expected that the teachers in all 
schools shall have characters above reproach and temperaments and habits 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



such that their lives will prove a powerful stimulus for good with their 
students in their preparation for life's activities. 

IMPROVEMENT IN EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 

Again, there is much room for improvement in employment condi- 
tions. It is important to strive to provide for every worker, first, gainful 
occupation ; second, opportunities for recreation ; and third, opportunities 
for religious activities. There should be worked out a basis of fair deal- 
ing applicable to all relations affecting employers and employees. There 
should be adequate means of conciliation and arbitration in all industrial 
disputes, in order to avoid the strife which results from failure to do 
this. I think we should work for conditions which will promote better 
protection for old age and for those who are incapacitated. 

WELFARE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN 

Considerable is being done for the welfare of mothers. There can 
be still better care and protection provided for them. Those who pass 
through the shadow of the valley of death to bring forth life are entitled 
to enjoy safeguards to their health and that of their children. There 
should be suitable regulation of working conditions for women in order 
to insure the physical and moral health of the community. There should 
be assurance of the fullest positive development of every child. All chil- 
dren should be protected against unreasonable labor conditions and ex- 
ploitation. But we must also remember the importance of training children 
under proper conditions to learn the value of work and the danger of 
idleness. I am not convinced of the desirability of the proposed federal 
child labor amendment, as it is drawn, which is now before the various 
states. It provides that "Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, 
and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age." I think 
those provisions are extreme. As former President Lowell of Harvard 
has wisely said : "We all want to stop the exploitation of children in fac- 
tories, mines and industries of that nature. But we do not want inter- 
ference with the home, or with the healthy and improving occupations 
of youth. Some people have no objection to confer such a power on the 
national government, trusting it will not be used. Some of us feel that 
to do so would be a mistake that we might hereafter greatly regret." 

BETTER COMMUNITY BUILDING 

A third way in which I think we can help materially to "establish 
Zion" is by the promotion of better community building, following up 
what the pioneers so splendidly started. There are so many ways in 
which we can work with all of our neighbors and fellow citizens to bring 
about better conditions. For instance, water is the very life blood in the 
growth of these intermountain communities. Therefore we should under- 
take as rapidly as conditions will permit to save every drop of waste water 
by possible storage. This present dry season only emphasizes this neces- 
sity. Careful geologic study should be given to possible sources of under- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



77 



ground water. The conservation of water supplies from year to year 
is very important. Further, there needs to be greater care and economy 
in the use of irrigation, power and municipal water supplies, to avoid, as 
far as possible, losses by seepage, evaporation and waste. Again, greater 
conservation of soil moisture in the maintenance of fertility spells the con- 
tinued welfare and progress of our various communities. 

DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES 

The progress of every community depends upon the opportunities 
for employment either in agriculture, industry or business. Notwith- 
standing the fact that the manufacturing industries are not as general 
in our communities as in some other sections, every possible product that 
can be manufactured locally and sold profitably should be undertaken. 
Everyone in our local communities should undertake to thoroughly sup- 
port our local industries by using their products. This is a very essen- 
tial requirement for growth. Also we need to promote more real co- 
operative enterprises in this territory among producers as well as among 
consumers so that local people shall get the most direct benefit. The 
State of Utah, for example, is one of the richest in natural resources. 
Other surrounding states are, in many ways, similarly blessed. These 
resources should be developed, as far as possible, for the benefit of the 
citizens thereof and for the general progress of this commonwealth. 

MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES ATTRACTIVE 

I think we should continue the pioneering plans of the early settlers 
in the building of desirable communities. The planning should be to- 
ward providing for the welfare and opportunities of the. local people 
rather than toward increasing the population, with consequently greater 
unemployment. We should exercise care in the planning of tree-plant- 
ing so as to provide pleasing effects through the proper location of trees 
on the streets and surrounding the homes, and through the selection of 
the proper hardwood trees to produce the best results. Setting apart 
of suitable property for natural parks and recreation grounds under 
conditions which will permit of very little cost for maintenance would 
mean much to the inhabitants and prove attractive to visitors. Much 
can be done by the united effort of all the residents in promoting public 
health, securing good water supplies, installing sewer facilities, maintain- 
ing sanitary conditions and preventing nuisances. 

BETTER HOMES MORE NEIGHBOURLINESS 

The future welfare of this people as church members and as citizens 
of this nation depends upon the spirit manifested in our homes. Irrespec- 
tive of the cost or the extent of comforts in our homes, the important 
thing is that there should be love, kindly consideration and mutual con- 
fidence among all members of the household. No matter how humble 
the cottage may be, only the desire of improvement and attractiveness 
therein will produce the growth and unity necessary for the greatest joy

and' welfare of the family. In like manner, as love and kindliness pro- 
duce peace and unity among the members of the family, so the practice 
of these same qualities in our relations with our neighbors and all those 
among whom we live will help to produce the same results in the com- 
munity. As we learn to live in good will under these conditions we 
shall be spreading the spirit of peace in ever-widening circles. 

May our efforts constantly be to strive in all possible ways to help 
to "establish Zion," is my earnest prayer, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

In one of the large rooms of the Dresden Art Gallery in Germany 
hang two pictures. One is of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and the 
painting bears the legend : "Napoleon, The Greatest Man of War." On 
the opposite wall is that of Jesus the Master, which has this inscription : 
"Jesus Christ, The Greatest Man of Peace." Those two pictures are 
suggestive of the two great forces that mankind is confronted with today. 
The world is at war; and the world is at peace. Wrong is contending 
against right for the mastery of the souls of men ; and our problems are 
greater now than they ever were before. This is a congregation of peace, 
joy, and sunshine, because we have come up to the tabernacle of God to 
hear the word of life and salvation. This is truly a house of God. 

An ancient psalmist once asked: "Lord, who shall abide in thy 
tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?" Jehovah answered and said : 
"He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh 
truth in his heart." What a power the world would have for right, if 
these principles as taught to the psalmist were lodged deeply in our 
hearts to influence our lives every day. Such a thing can be if we begin 
to teach our children properly in the home. I fear that we are leaving 
the teaching of our children too much to the school and church, and that 
parents are not careful enough what they say and how they teach their 
children within the precincts of the home. It is the home that is the 
center of our social lives ; it is the cathedral of our religious lives, where 
the Lord has imparted to us the knowledge of the immortality of his 
spiritual values : It is character that we must build ; and in Jesus as 
in no other soul, humanity has found its ideal of character before which 
the noblest of the sons of men in all generations since his day have bowed 
their heads in reverence. 

The Old and New Testaments are full of the spirit of joy and 
thanksgiving which comes into the hearts of the people who are seeking 
to do the ways of Jehovah. I am always impressed with the thought 
when I stand before you good people that you are living upright lives, 
and in the battle of life you are playing your parts well. The great need 
today is that we teach our children the finer truths of life, and impress 
them with the ideal that each and every one must perfect himself in his 
spiritual power. Each one must perfect oneself in the sphere in which 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



79 



one is working. One must be taught the glorious words of the Master : 
"Be ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect." Wle parents are 
learning from day to day, and as we learn we are able to impart knowl- 
edge to our children. It is in the home that God makes his covenant 
with us, and we have always new opportunities and new duties. When 
Jesus bade his disciples to receive the kingdom as little children, he meant 
that they should place their faith in God as children place their faith 
in him, because of their conscious helplessness. 

I am reminded here of a character in history who to me stands next 
to the Master in power, faith, and understanding. I refer to John the 
Baptist. John had been in the wilderness of Judea teaching repentance 
and the kingdom of God. "Repent ye," said he, "for the kingdom of God 
is at hand." John was speaking to living Jews, delivering to them for 
all time a message from their God. "Let us prepare our souls," Baruch 
said, "that we may have hope and be not put to shame, that we may reap 
with our fathers, and be not punished with our foes." Now the time 
had come. A prophet had risen once more in Israel. "Prepare ye the 
way of the Lord." John had given all ; he had won all. One day while 
he was teaching his people on the banks of the river Jordan, he saw 
someone coming towards him. John turned to his congregation, and 
said : "Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world." 
John knew the Master the minute he saw him. And why? Because he 
had the spirit of truth and faith which manifests all things divine. Jesus 
was baptized by John, and then retired into the wilderness. The time 
was fulfilled, the kingdom of God was at hand. This kingdom could 
come to earth only through souls that hungered and thirsted after right- 
eousness. 

Jesus began his work among humanity to build it into a civilization 
the like of which the world has never known. That work we are con- 
tinuing today. That fine truth that we may know God only by the spirit 
of the Master is the truth that I fear we forget today. This truth, how- 
ever, is an eternal verity. Jesus told us to be "Perfect even as our Father 
in Heaven is perfect." 

We speak of the great changes that have come about in the world. 
It is an ever-changing world ; and there will be more changes. Our great 
problem will be whether or not our moral and spiritual lives will grow as 
the world moves on. 

Yes, the world will change for the best, spiritually and morally, as 
we come to know that God has laid his hand on souls to whom the Gospel 
has become a burning fire within them, and they speak the word of the 
Lord which has been entrusted to them. In other words, the finer spirit- 
ual life will be brought about by men of faith. They will go forth with 
the spirit of the eternal truths of morality as expressed in the Ten Com- 
mandments and the Sermon on the Mount. These moral truths are 
eternal. They will teach that the "pure in heart shall see God," and that 
Jesus died for the sins of the world. 

You and I, my brethren and sisters, have come up to this tabernacle 
and to this holy altar to hear the word of God and to hear about the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



spiritual truths that live forever. .We wish to show Jehovah that we walk 
uprightly, and speak truth in our hearts. My faith is that the world is 
growing better, and that mankind will be more closely united in divine 
faith. Truth will prevail, and the kingdom of God will come. 

There is a beautiful lesson in a part of the German writer's play 
called "Nathan the Wise." It was written by Lessing, a celebrated Jew 
of the days of Goethe. There is a conversation between a Christian and 
^a Jew. The Jew says in substance, "I know, O Christian, by the spirit 
of Jehovah that the message of Christ to the world is one of fatherhood 
and brotherhood, of spirit and truth." The Christian replies to the Jew 
and says : "And I know by the same spirit that the Jew has borne the 
same great message to the world ! We will be brought together by the 
same illumination, by the same spirit." 

So we realize that truth and goodness can inspire in men an affection 
infinitely more creative and unconquerable than anything else in life. 
The transcendance of the human spirit can conquer all things. 

May God bless us all. May the world understand the word of truth. 
May we all come closer together by the illumination of truth and the 
spirit of Jehovah, and walk uprightly and speak truth in our hearts, I 
ask in Jesus' name. Amen. 

A selection, "Calm as the night," was sung by a ladies chorus. 

ELDER WILLARD L. SMITH 

Former President of the Samoan Mission 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may have your faith and 
prayers during the few moments I shall stand in your presence to report, 
briefly, the labors in the Samoan Mission. I bring greetings to you from 
the members of the Church in Samoa. I believe I am safe in saying that 
they are one of the finest groups of people we have anywhere, in any of 
the mission fields in the Church. Naturally, they are a different type 
from the people we have here in Zion. They are, however, at heart one 
of the finest races of people, as far as they have an understanding of the 
things required at their hands by our Father in Heaven. My little stay 
here in Zion, since returning, has caused me to feel far prouder of them 
as a race than I did during my association with them. 

I thank the Lord that I have had the opportunity of bearing my 
testimony to the sons and daughters of Lehi, who I firmly believe were 
led into that land by divine providence. It is my firm belief that the 
native peoples in the islands of the sea are direct descendants of Father 
Lehi, who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ. I realize 
that it is impossible to find external evidence sufficient to prove that this 
is the case. In spirit, however, I think we all agree with this thought. 

We read in the appendix of the Doctrine and Covenants that it is 
necessary to carry the Gospel even to the islands of the sea. It has 
fallen to my lot to labor and preside twice in the islands of the sea. I 



ELDER WILLARD L. SMITH 



81 



presided at one time over the Tongan Mission and returned home not 
very strong physically. I was there during the World War. I returned 
to Canada, and while laboring there, trying to make a living for myself 
and family, word came to President Wood that we were asked to return, 
not to Tonga but to Samoa. This, of course, was a very great surprise 
to me. I thought that if I ever should return again to those lands it 
would possibly be to the islands where I was best acquainted. 

After I had consented to go I asked President Wood if he had 
forgotten that I returned home unable to carry my suitcase from the 
station. He said he had forgotten all about it. I returned home, how- 
ever, this time perfectly well. 

I thank the Lord, from the bottom of my heart for the testimonies 
which have come to me and my family while laboring among that people. 
We have in the land of Samoa at this time more than four thousand 
members on our records. We have baptized, during the time that I have 
been there, 1,231 souls. So we have been somewhat successful, so far. 
as performing baptisms is concerned. They find it very difficult, how- 
ever, under the trying conditions in that land, to always live the Gospel 
as we would have them do. . 

I wish to report this, however, that those who have received the 
Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthood, are functioning with a great 
deal of efficiency. While there I undertook to labor with the Priesthood. 
I felt that was necessary. Now we have only three branches in all that 
land that are directed by our Elders. We are operating now in some 
forty-two villages, and all the work in these villages can be carried on 
and supervised and directed by our native brethren. 

We also use the young men in the Aaronic Priesthood to teach 
schools, where the government of that land is not able to carry on the 
secular education as is required. I feel now that I was directed, in a 
sense, to labor with these brethren bearing the Priesthood, that they 
might be able to discharge the responsibilities which have come to them. 
We have not as yet sufficient capable men in that land to meet the require- 
ments, but I feel that we have made progress there, although it may have 
been slow. Although we have been far away, we have been directed by 
the same good spirit that has directed the work here in Zion. 

It is not my purpose to take up more of your time, but I bear my 
witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is the true 
Gospel and that it shall never again be taken from the earth. My prayer 
is that my household and I may be able to remain firm and Steadfast 
and support those who preside over us. I ask it in the name of Jestis 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been deeply interested in the teachings of the Gospel during 
this conference, and I am grateful for the privilege of being present. 
During troublesome times like the present, I believe we draw nearer to 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our Father in heaven and to each other. This thought has been expressed 
to me a number of times when visiting stakes of Zion. I have also heard 
many expressions of appreciation for the blessings which we are enjoy- 
ing. While we may be poor in the things of the world, after all we still 
have with us the most worthwhile things of life — the Gospel, our testi- 
monies of its divinity, our loved ones, and our associations in the Church. 
We have much to be thankful for. Henry Van Dyke has said these 
words : 

We should be glad to live because it gives us a chance to love and to work 
. ... to be satisfied, but net content, until we have made the best of our oppor- 
tunities ; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood and meanness', and to 
fear nothing except cowardice ; to covet nothing of our neighbors except their 
kindness of heart and gentleness of manner ; to think seldom of our enemies and 
often of our friends. 

I believe that the teaching of the Gospel is essential in our homes. 
Here there should be implanted in the hearts of our children a love of 
God, a love of fellow men, a love of service in this church, and loyalty 
to those who preside over us. The statement that "example is better 
than precept" is good, but example is not enough, for the teaching of 
the Gospel is vital for the development of the lives of our young people. 

Quite recently I heard the following remark by a young man who 
was reared in a Latter-day Saint home. He said, "I wish I were con- 
verted to the principle of tithing." He was reminded that he had before 
him always the example of his parents. Their example was not sufficient. 
There may be many young people in the Church who feel as did this 
young man. As parents, we have long since learned that the Lord re- 
quires of all those who earn or acquire means, one-tenth of their interest 
to be used for the maintenance of the Church in its various departments 
and for the support of the poor and needy; that it is a voluntary 
offering ; that the payment of tithing should accomplish two things : 
By it we honor the Lord as the giver of all, and we subject our will to his 
law. As parents we are familiar with the law of tithing, but are we 
teaching it to our children and training them to observe it? 

The auxiliary organizations and quorums of the Priesthood are 
assisting us in our family life in teaching the Gospel to our children, but 
the responsibility of training a child "in the way he should go" is the 
duty of his parents. Some people consider that they have done their full 
duty to their children when they have fed and clothed them, given them 
shelter and education, and have put away money for them to inherit. 
More than this is required of Latter-day Saint parents. 

Children were regarded by the Hebrews as "gifts from God." At 
the age of five years, the Hebrew boy was placed under the special care 
of the father and was taught not only the duties of life, but was care- 
fully instructed in the law and in religious obligations and devotions. We 
Latter-day Saints consider that our children are "an heritage from the 
Lord." 

Let us consider the word of the Lord pertaining to the responsibility 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



83 



of parents, as given in Section 68 of the book of Doctrine and Covenants : 

And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes 
which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, 
faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by the laying on of hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads 
of the parents. 

After baptism the duty of the parents is continued : 

And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

The late President Joseph F. Smith expressed himself in these 
words : 

A. great and important duty devolving upon this people is to teach their 
children from their cradle until they become men and women every principle of 
the Gospel ; to endeavor as 1 far as it lies in the power of parents to instill into their 
hearts a love for God, for truth, virtue, honesty, honor, and integrity. It does 
not need argument to convince our minds that our children will be just about 
what we make them. The little one begins to learn after it is born, and all that 
it knows depends upon its environment and the influences under which it is 
reared. 

Too great emphasis cannot be placed upon the early training of the 
child. It is the duty of parents to fit and qualify him for life. Habits 
are acquired and come from repetition. Doing a thing over and over 
again tends to make it a habit. Horace Mann says, "Habit is a cable ; 
we weave a thread of it every day, and at last we cannot break it." This 
thought is emphasized in the following : 

I took a piece of plastic clay, 

And idly fashioned it one day, 

And, as my fingers pressed it still, 

It moved and yielded to my will. 

I came again when days were past, 

This bit of clay was hard at last, 

The form I gave it, still it bore, 

And I could change that form no more. 

I took a piece of living clay, 
And gently fashioned day by day 
And moulded with my power and art, 
A young child's soft and tender heart. 
I came again when years were gone — 
'Twas now a man I looked upon ; 
He still that early impress bore, 
And I could change him nevermore. 

Faith in this great latter-day work and a knowledge of the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel should be instilled in the hearts of the boys and 
girls in their homes. 

While visiting in one of the stakes within the past few months, a 
mother of a family of four boys and two girls gave me her experiences 
in teaching tithing in the home. She was left a widow and had the respon- 
sibility or rearing this family of six children. On the day of each child's 
baptism the mother provided a small box into which the child was 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



trained to deposit as tithing one-tenth of its gifts or earnings. She made 
it a point to see that the child received small sums of money for work 
about the farm, and whether ten cents or more, the mother was prepared 
to change the money so that the proper amount, one-tenth, could be 
placed in the box by her child as the Lord's tenth. This training, she 
said, has had a lasting effect upon the lives of her children. They are 
now grown ; all are married ; several have filled missions ; all are active 
in the Church ; and all are full tithepayers. She testified that this early 
training in the principle of tithing and its strict observance by her chil- 
dren has developed in them a living faith. Is not this method applicable 
in the home of every Latter-day Saint family? 

Through our example and teachings in the home can we not make 
this principle a habit in the lives of our boys and girls? If the child 
commences to pay tithing on its small earnings or income, it will not be 
difficult for it to pay on larger earnings. Parents should encourage their 
children to pay their tithing regularly to the bishop, and he should give 
the child who makes the small payment the same courteous attention 
and consideration that he would give to those who pay him on larger 
incomes. 

To be a tithepayer will strengthen the child's faith in God, for faith 
grows by works. It will increase his interest in the Gospel. He will 
feel a partnership in this great Latter-day work when he contributes of 
his means for the purpose of supporting the Church. It will develop 
in the child honesty, integrity, loyalty, and an appreciation of his parents 
and of the Gospel, and from this training there will come happier and 
better and more devoted men and women. 

Let us be diligent in teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the 
home. Let us with kindness and patience train our young people in the 
payment of their tithes and offerings, so they will be fully converted to 
this principle and enjoy the lasting benefits and blessings that come 
through obedience to this law. May we not only teach the principle of 
tithing by example in the home, but also by precept. This is one of the 
principles of the Gospel with which I am familiar. I know its blessings 
in my own life. 

I am happy to testify that I know this great latter-day work of 
Mormonism is the work of God, brought forth through the instrumen- 
tality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was ordained and appointed 
in the Celestial world to this great work of establishing the Dispensation 
of the Fulness of Times, preparatory to the coming of the Savior to 
rule and reign on the earth. Amen. 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I have no words at my command to ade- 
quately express my appreciation for the honor that has come to me in 
being considered worthy to preside over the great Southern States

Mission of this Church, to succeed President Charles A. Callis, who has 
been called to labor as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. 

I have always enjoyed missionary work. This is the fourth time I 
have had the privilege of going into the mission field, and I have loved 
that work, and love it dearly. 

During this conference, reference has been made to the great work 
which has been established in these latter days, and especially to the 
mission of the Prophet Elijah, who came to turn the hearts of the fathers 
to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers ; and the 
work of Moses, the prophet, who visited the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
brought the keys of the gathering of Israel in these the latter days. Ref- 
erence has been made to the establishment of the Church here in the 
valleys of the mountains, demonstrating how the spirit of Moses has 
moved upon the membership of this Church when they have heeded the 
testimony of the Elders in foreign lands. Many of those who are here 
today have been gathered from the lands of the earth, through the call 
of the missionaries. 

Testimony has been given showing how marvelously those in the 
world, not only members of the Church, but men and women every- 
where, have contributed of their means for the gathering of genealogy, 
and genealogical societies have been organized and records kept, all 
through the spirit that came by the restoration of the keys brought by- 
Elijah the prophet. This great revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
was given in the Kirtland temple ninety-eight years ago last Tuesday, 
at which time the Prophet Elias who conferred upon him and Oliver 
Cowdery the keys, of the Gospel of Abraham, and told them that through 
them and their seed all generations after them should be blessed. As I 
understand it, the mission of Elias, the prophet, relates to the missionary 
work of the Church, to cry repentance to the world, and prepare the way 
for the coming of the Lord. 

During the last three months that I have spent in the Southern 
States Mission it has been a great joy to me to meet the missionaries 
who are laboring there, to hear their experiences, to feel of their faith, 
and to listen to their testimonies. I have gone into the various districts 
of that mission and have brought together the missionaries, told them 
to unburden their hearts and let me know their feelings toward the 
Church, even from their very youth. I want to bear witness to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that if the fathers and mothers of those missionaries 
could have attended our meetings and listened to the testimonies of their 
boys and girls, they would have been grateful to the Lord for the manner 
in which this spirit of Elias, the prophet, of preaching the gospel of 
preparation, is in their hearts. 

I have in mind, at the present time, the testimony given by one of 
the young men in South Carolina, who bore a beautiful testimony of 
the Gospel. After the meeting was over he drew from his pocket the 
picture of a man sitting in a wheel chair, a cripple. He said he was a boy 
of a large family at home, and that he could see no opportunity of going 
into the mission field. One day this brother approached him and asked 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



him if he would be willing to go on a mission, if the bishop would call 
him, and he would pay the expenses. He said : "That man will never 
know the feeling of gratitude I have in my heart toward him, that he 
has made it possible for me to have this wonderful experience." This 
good brother is laboring at home here in Zion, working as a tailor, and 
has chosen this course of gathering up "treasures in heaven, where moth 
and rust doth not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal." 

This spirit of missionary work, I believe, has penetrated into every 
home of the Latter-day Saints, and almost into every heart. From the 
day we carry our little ones up to be blessed in the sacrament meetings, 
we rejoice when the Elders of the Church pray for our boys and girls, 
that they might grow up to become ambassadors of truth in the earth. 

I met another young man presiding over one of the districts, who 
related this incident: He said there was a good Scandinavian sister in 
his town, who wanted to send a missionary into the mission field, so she 
came to him and asked him if he would be willing to go and represent 
her. He is a wonderful missionary, and after he arrived in the field 
this good sister passed away, but before doing so, she left enough money 
in the bank for him to complete his mission. When I heard him bear 
witness to the Saints that his missionary work had been the very happiest 
time of all his life, I could not help but wonder if this good sister might 
not be aware of the wonderful contribution she had made, in making this 
great experience possible for him. 

This spirit of sacrifice for missionary work is not confined to the 
older members of the Church. One young man stated that when he was 
attending college, he and his young lady discussed the advisability of 
getting married, since he had a brother in the mission field in Europe, 
and felt that it would not be possible for him to go on a mission for years. 
This young lady said : "You go on your mission and I will earn the money 
to keep you in the mission field." I believe that young lady is laying 
away treasures in heaven. 

I met a young lady here yesterday who has the spirit of this mis- 
sionary work. She was preparing to go on a mission, and the bishop 
spoke to her married brother about going, but he didn't see how he 
could go without help. So this young woman not only agreed to help 
him on his mission, but also to help his wife and little babies while he 
is away. 

One lady missionary bore witness that when she was called to go 
into the mission field she was in the beauty parlor business with her 
sister, and that they owed $2000. The sister said: "You go," and she 
went. She said that her sister had not only been able to keep her, but had 
also paid off the $2000 while she had been in the mission field. 

One young man said that his mother died when he was a very small 
boy. Before she passed away she called him to her bedside. She said : 
"My boy, I will never leave you ;" and he bore witness that he was 
convinced that his mother had been with him during all his missionary 
labors. He said : "The greatest hope I have in my life" — and tears flowed 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 



87 



from his eyes as he said it — "is that I might return home and have my 
father put his arms around me and say : 'Well done'." 

Another boy said that all his life he had wanted to go on a mission. 
His father had wanted him to go, but his father died recently. He said 
when he received his call he had a dream in which he saw his father, 
and he said : "My son, I will share this mission with you." 

This spirit of missionary work is not only felt in the mission field, 
but one of our young men testified that after he had gone into the mission 
field, two of his older brothers had become active in the Church because 
of the letters he had written home. 

Another young man said his bishop called him to bear his testimony, 
before leaving. He told the bishop he had no testimony. When he 
finally wrote a letter home and said he had received a testimony of the 
Gospel, his brother, who had been inactive in the Church said: "The 
Gospel must be true or he would never say it is." 

Now my time is up. I rejoice in the marvelous spirit of this mis- 
sionary work. I know this work is true, and I thank God, from the 
bottom of my heart, for the privilege of laboring with these fine young 
men and women, your sons and daughters, in the Southern States Mis- 
sion. God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER NEWEL J. CUTLER 

Former President of the Tongan Mission 

My brethren and sisters, this is a surprise to me, to be asked to 
address an audience of this kind. I suppose there are one-third as many 
people in this building as there are in the mission that I presided over. 
The Tongan islands are somewhat scattered. They are composed of 
about two hundred units, or two hundred small islands, and most of our 
missionary work is done on the sea, you might say, or traveling to dif- 
ferent parts of the islands. 

I feel that I am somewhat out of place, talking in English, because 
most of my mature life has been spent in the Tongan islands. I labored 
as a missionary under the direction of President Willard L. Smith in 
the Samoan Mission, for nearly six years, and then went back as the 
presiding elder over the Tongan Mission for a little better than four years. 

The Tongan people are a very good class of people. They resemble 
very much the Samoans, as they have been described here by President 
Smith. There is no question but that they are descendants of Father 
Lehi. Their characteristics resemble those of the Lamanites of this 
continent, or what we call the American Indians. 

I am thankful that I have had the privilege of laboring as a mission- 
ary. It has been the happiest time of my life. I did enjoy my labors 
among those people. 

I have a testimony of the Gospel. I know it is true. I feel as Job of 
old, when he said : 

Oh that my words . . . were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock 
forever !

'For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter 
day upon the earth : 

And though after my skin worms' destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall 
I see God : 

'Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. 

I am thankful that those who preside in this Church have had con- 
fidence in me. I am thankful for my parentage, for those who have 
reared me in the Church of Jesus Christ. This Church means all to me, 
and I hope and pray that I shall remain true and faithful to the covenants 
I have made with God the Eternal Father. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may attend us at all times, that 
our desires for good may increase, and that our determination to spread 
the Gospel of Christ may grow. I bear you this testimony, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I deem it a great privilege to stand 
here before you, and I feel very humble and very weak in accepting the 
responsibility of occupying a few moments of your time, for I know that, 
if computed, those few moments multiplied by the number of persons 
here present, would run into a great deal of human time, for which I am 
responsible. 

I feel very humble, also, my brethren and sisters, in accepting the 
call that has come to me. I feel weak, incapable, of myself, of discharging 
the responsibilities depending upon me in the Mexican Mission. But I 
do have a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony of the 
truthfulness of the words of Nephi, referred to by President Grant 
yesterday. I know that our Father makes no call on any of us without 
he himself prepares and opens the way for the fulfilment and the dis- 
charge of that call. It is only in this testimony and in my testimony of 
the truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that I have the courage 
to accept the call that has been made of me. 

I have also to my advantage a very deep respect and love for the 
Mexican people. It has been my pleasure and my privilege to be raised 
among them, to live among them practically all of my life. As has been 
described to you this afternoon in regard to the natives of the islands, 
the Mexicans, who are also of the house of Lehi — the Lamanites — are 
a good people. They come nearer to living up to their ideals than any 
other people with whom it has been my pleasure to associate. 

I regard it a great honor to work among the Mexican people in the 
Mexican Mission. I feel almost that it is a family heritage. My grand- 
father was a member of the first party of missionaries to the Lamanite 
people. My father, in company with President Ivins, was a member of 
the first missionary party to the Republic of Mexico, and later was asso- 
ciated with the Mexican Mission directly and indirectly all his life. My 
brother, the late President Rey L. Pratt, spent more than a quarter of 



ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 



89 



a century laboring among the Mexican people. I feel that it is my 
privilege and my responsibility to continue the work that they have, up 
to this date, so nobly carried on. 

I feel it an honor to succeed President Antoine R. Ivins as president. 
I am sure that he has established a precedent that it will take my utmost 
efforts and the blessings of my Heavenly Father to live up to. I wish 
to take this opportunity to thank him for his kindly help and cooperation 
and the encouragement he has given me in taking over the mission. 

I wish to bear my testimony before closing, that I know the Gospel 
is true. I know as I know that I stand here before you today that Christ 
lives. I know that he is the Savior of the world. I know that this Gospel, 
established by him while here upon the earth, was taken from the world, 
and that it has now been restored through the instrumentality of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and has been carried down to us. 

I testify unto you that the officers, the presiding authorities, Presi- 
dent Grant, and those associated with him today, are in very deed, as we 
sustained them yesterday, prophets, seers and revelators, representatives 
of our Father in heaven here upon the earth. I beseech each and every 
one of you to give heed always to the counsel, to the direction of these 
brethren, that in the last days we shall not be found wanting. 

I pray the blessings of the Father upon you all, and beseech an 
interest in your faith and prayers, that I may be blessed in the discharge 
of my responsibilities. I do it in Jesus' name, Amen. 

The Liberty Stake Mutual Improvement Association Chorus sang 
The Hallelujah Chorus from "The Messiah." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Edgar B. Brossard, Presi- 
dent of the Washington, D. C. branch of the Eastern States Mission. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday, April 8, 9:30 a. m. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday, April 8. 

Long before the time arrived for commencing this service every 
seat and other available space in the Tabernacle auditorium and galleries 
was occupied. The large Assembly Hall on the Temple Block was 
crowded with people who could not be accommodated in the Tabernacle 
and many hundreds of others assembled on the Tabernacle grounds, 
where amplifying equipment had been installed, by means of which they 
listened to the proceedings of the Conference as they were broadcast by 
radio from the Tabernacle. 

As a prelude to the fifth session of the Conference, a program of 
choral and organ music was rendered from 9 :30 to 10 :30 a. m., featuring 
the Tabernacle Choir and Organ, which was broadcast by radio through- 
out the United States and Canada, over the Columbia Broadcasting 
System, originating over Station KSL. This program was as follows : 

"The morning breaks" (Careless) — Choir 

"Pilgrim's Song of Hope" (Batiste) — Organ. 

"They that Sow in Tears" (Parks) — Choir. 

"The Lost Chord" (Sullivan) — Organ. 

"Glorious Things are Sung of Zion" (Daynes) — Choir. 

"Nocturne" (Grieg) — Organ. 

"God is our Refuge" (46th Psalm) — Choir. 

"Awake" — Choral of the Reformation — (Wagner) — Choir. 

"Choral and Toccata" (Boellman) — Organ. 

"Easter Song" (Stephens) — Choir. 

"Offertory and Prayer" (Friml) — Organ. 

"O Great is the Depth" (Mendelssohn) — Choir. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing of the Choir. 
Organ accompaniments and organ solo presentations were played by 
Professor Frank W. Asper. 

At the conclusion of the Choir and Organ concert President Heber 
J, Grant announced that the Choir and congregation would sing the 
hymn, "Praise to the Man who communed with Jehovah." 

After the singing of this hymn the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Robert D. Young, President of the Manti Temple. 

A sacred duet, "The Morning Land," was sung by Jessie Evans 
and Dolores Seal. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, may the Lord move me and you with the 
spirit of truth during the time that I shall stand before you. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR.

COMPLIMENTS SINGERS AND MUSICIANS 

May I first renew my compliment to our great choir, the organist, 
the leader of the choir, and to Brother Richard Evans for the beautiful 
sermonettes, who Sunday by Sunday spread abroad over the whole earth, 
a message of love, of good-will, of righteousness. From the ends of the 
earth I personally have heard words of praise for their great work. I 
think I never heard them do better than they have done this morning. It 
was a wonderful tribute, I thought, to Brother Evan Stephens that the 
choir could begin with that great fiery challenge from Wagner and pass 
through that to the beautiful chaste and pure Easter song of Evan 
Stephens, and have it so completely in harmony. I am much impressed, 
as always, with the wonderful spirit which manifests itself among the 
singing people of Zion. 

AS A RESULT OF PURITY AND CHASTITY 

Only out of purity and chastity, only out of lives of righteousness 
could there come to us the beautiful singing which we have at all times 
and particularly at this conference. I hope that always they may con- 
tinue their work. It must be from time to time_ a drudgery ; I appreciate 
how they must prod themselves in order that they may do their work. 
But it is as sure as that they live that if they shall do it in a spirit of 
humility, if they shall work day by day and week by week, if they shall 
live lives of purity and chastity, they shall exert a power for good in the 
world which can not be measured. 

Brother George S. Romney has informed us of the broadcast which 
is being made in Chicago by one of our choirs ; Brother Edward P. Kim- 
ball is making a broadcast in the city of Washington over another system. 
These are great missionary instrumentalities, and they call from us, the 
body of the Church, the fullest possible support. 

"THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE" 

I wish today to refer in what I shall have to say to one of the things 
to which President Grant referred in his opening address, and to that 
which others have referred to during the course of this conference. I 
mean the Truth. The Savior, speaking to the Jews who believed on 
him, after he had dispersed by a mere question those who accused the 
woman taken in adultery, said to the Jews : "Ye shall know the truth, 
and the truth shall make you free." 

As has been intimated already at this conference, there is creeping 
amongst us now as always, and probably no more now than always, error ; 
and error is sin. We should be on our watch against error in whatever 
guise it may come. It would be easy to meet and overcome error if it 
came branded as such. The great body of the Church, I am grateful to 
the Lord to say, is able to detect error and sin no matter in what clothing 
it may come. There are a few, however, who need your assistance, and 
mine, and to them should always be open the arms of forgiveness, and to 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



them should always be available kind words, admonition, kind thoughts, 
and sound advice. 

SHEEP WHO STRAY AWAY 

You remember the parable of the lost sheep, and you recall the 
conclusion of that as stated by the Savior when he said that there was 
more rejoicing in heaven over the one sinner that was saved than the 
ninety-nine who had already followed along in the paths of righteousness. 
That by no means, in my judgment, should be taken to indicate that more 
is thought of the one repentant sinner than of the ninety-nine righteous. 
But all of us have had enough experience in life to know the joy and the 
gratitude that come into our hearts when a friend or relative or member 
of the family, who has been somewhat wayward and gone astray, once 
more comes back into the fold of truth. And it is in that way that the 
parable is to be taken. 

In the few minutes which I have at my disposal I want to address 
my remarks primarily to those who are wandering away in the domain of 
error, those few sheep who seem to be getting away from the flock, so 
nearly beyond recall that they may become lost. It is to them I want 
to say a few words. 

SHOULD NOT CHALLENGE TRUTH 

There are a few truths to which I wish to refer, but first let me 
say let us not put ourselves in the attitude of challenging truth. How 
poor and weak are we, how ineffective are we, how limited in our 
knowledge are we, that we should ever presume to challenge truth. But 
truth, on the other hand, mighty and eternal in its nature, challenges 
positively, day by day and hour by hour, every one of us to live in 
accordance therewith. 

THE TRUTH THAT THERE IS TRUTH 

The first truth to which I wish to refer is the truth that truth is true. 
There is some dissemination of doctrine amongst us that all is relative 
and that we have no truth in the absolute. We may not have in all its 
fulness the ultimate truth ; I doubt that if we had it, we could understand 
it. But, my brethren and sisters, what we do have is this : So far as the 
Lord has spoken he has given us the truth. He has not taught us error. 
So the first great truth to which I call your attention, the first truth that 
I want the youth of Zion to have burned into their hearts, is the truth 
that there is truth. 

THE ONLY SOURCE OF SALVATION 

The second truth that I want to call to your attention is the truth 
that salvation, exaltation, can come only by obedience to the laws and 
commandments of the Lord, can come only through the atonement of 
the Savior, and that he is the truth. 

Jesus speaking to the Pharisees, after freeing the woman taken in 
adultery, said : 



PRESIDENT J.REUBEN CLARK, JR. 93 



I am the light of the world ; he that f olloweth me shall not walk in darkness, 
but shall have the light of life. (John 8:12.) 

To Martha — she of the almost full knowledge — Christ said : 

... I am the resurrection, and the life : he that believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live : 

And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou 

this? 

She said unto him, Yea, Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son 
of God, which should come into the world. (John 11:25-27.) 

To the Apostles in the Passover Chamber, the Savior said : 

Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how 
can we know the way? 

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life : no man Cometh 
unto the Father, but by me. (John 14:5-6.) 

Peter, defending himself before the Sanhedrin, said : 

Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under 
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 1 4:12.) 

The Lord has spoken in equally positive terms in our own time, 
repeating in the early days of the Church, over and over again, those 
expressions which he had used while upon the earth. 

THE GREAT TRUTH OF MODERN REVELATION 

Jesus is the Messiah, he is the Savior of the world. Through 
his atoning blood, his suffering, his death and his resurrection, we may 
become perfect beings, and in no other way and by no other means. That 
is the great truth which permeates everything which God has said to his 
children on this earth. Without that we would be as dead bodies and 
dead spirits, shut off from true salvation, from exaltation, from eternal 
progression, the great new truth of modem revelation. We must never 
forget that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world. There is no 
escape from this, my brethren and sisters. Turn, twist, philosophize, 
mass sophistries as we will, this great truth remains. 

MEN WHO ARE NOT LEARNED 

For the third point that I want to make to you, I want to read you 
what the Savior said at the Feast of the Tabernacle, when he began 
teaching the people openly. The Jews had sought him, and the Jews 
had marvelled, saying: "How knoweth this man letters, having never 
learned ?" 

Let us pause here a moment, for this is the challenge of today. 
How can men teach the word of God who are not learned ? My brethren 
and sisters, some of the greatest achievements in pure thought (the 
nearest kin to pure religion) that have ever been made in the history 
of the world, have been made by men who did not know the chemical 
formula for water, nor the mathematical formula expressing the law 
which controls falling bodies. How difficult would have been the work 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of Christ himself had he had to depend upon the learned. The lowly 
only were his reliance ; the learned sought him by night or not at all. 

"The glory of God is intelligence." Intelligence is given to us to use, 
to cultivate, and to develop. Knowledge is the handmaid of intelligence 
and priceless heyond all words, and knowledge implies within it not 
alone learning but experience. Mere learning without knowledge in 
the true sense is of no avail. The Pharisees who made this inquiry 
knew that the Savior had not attended the school of Gamaliel, but the 
Lord did not need to master any curriculum ; the full truth does not lie 
in any one curriculum. Learning is beyond price if it be accompanied 
by the spirit which should follow it. But if the Gospel is only for the 
learned, how few there are of us who could have any use for it. 

MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL LEARNING 

Now, I am not arguing against learning, I am only asking that 
the youth of Zion be relieved from the thought which is growing in 
their minds that a partial mastering of one curriculum is the full truth. 
There is spiritual learning just as there is material learning, and the one 
without the other is not complete ; yet, speaking for myself, if I could 
have only one sort of learning, that which I would take would be the 
learning of the spirit, because in the hereafter I shall have opportunity 
in the eternities which are to come to get the other, and without spirit- 
ual learning here my handicaps in the hereafter would be all but over- 
whelming. 

Rut the Lord has so made it today that we and our children may 
have both, and that is one of the great glories and blessings which we 
have today, that we may be learned in the sciences and the arts, and we 
may also be learned in the spirit. In other words, we may have true 
knowledge. 

THE CHALLENGE OF EXPERIMENTATION 

Answering the Pharisees, the Lord said : "If any man will do his 
will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I 
speak of myself." 

I call to the attention of the young people of the Church that this 
truth of the Master is the challenge of science — the challenge of ex- 
perimentation. The Lord does not ask us to take his truths without trial. 
He asks us to test them. Just as a great scientist may announce a great 
discovery and just as that discovery must be proved, or disproved, by 
related experiments by the discoverer and by others before it may be 
wisely accepted or rejected, so the Son of God invites us to test his truths. 
So I plead with my young brethren and sisters to test the principles 
of the Gospel. Do not throw them over until you have tried them. 
No chemist ever is satisfied with one experiment, even though it give 
an affirmative result. Certainly he is never satisfied with one experiment 
if it gives a negative result. 

So to the youth of Zion I say, Try the Lord, experiment with his 
principles, nor may you be content with one experiment, particularly if it 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



95 



does not give an affirmative result. And just as a scientific experiment 
must be performed under proper conditions of heat and light and pres- 
sure and absolute cleanliness, so the spiritual experiment must be per- 
formed with a pure heart, with a desire to know the truth, with a clean 
body and a clean mind, in order that the one exerimenting may not 
shut himself off from the very things he desires to know. 

NO COMPROMISE WITH ERROR 

Allow me just one more word before closing, — a word of distinc- 
tion and of admonition : The Church must always war on error. There 
can be no compromise on the part of the Church with error. To the 
repentant sinner the Church, and we individuals, have all forgiveness ; 
to the repentant sinner we open our arms in welcome; but against the 
sin which he commits the Church must always war. 

PRAYS FOR UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL TRUTHS 

My brethren and sisters, my time is gone. I hope the Lord will 
give me knowledge, will increase my knowledge of the simple things, 
the simple spiritual truths. 

May the Lord give me his power and his spirit, let me understand 
as fully as I can with my finite mind, faith; let me understand as 
fully as that same mind can, repentance. May I measurably under- 
stand the Lord and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, may I understand my 
existence here, my existence before I came here, the existence which I am 
to have after I go hence. Give me, our Heavenly Father, some knowl- 
edge of these things, and I shall be content, for out of these truths I 
know, that with a life of righteousness, I may go back into thy presence. 

May the Lord bless us always, and ever may he teach us how to 
reach after those who are wandering from the flock. May he give us 
love and charity and forgiveness, may he fill our hearts with devotion 
to him, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

. PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Before commencing my remarks, my brethren and sisters, I desire 
as President Clark has done to express the gratitude I feel that the Lord 
has lengthened out my days to be present at this general conference of 
the Church. The things which have occurred here could not have oc- 
curred in any other place in the world. The music to which we have 
listened, the mothers' chorus which so splendidly rendered their parts, 
and the young men and young women representing the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations of the Church, could not have been found in any other 
place. This Tabernacle choir, and this organ cannot be found in any 
other place in the world. 

The doctrines which have been expounded here you would not hear 
in any other congregation of people outside of the Church. These are 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the things which have impressed me, the things for which I feel grateful 
to my Father which is in heaven. 

SEES RAY OF HOPE 

During the sessions of the conference, various of those who have 
addressed us have referred to a convention of Protestant ministers 
recently held in Chicago. The report of that meeting indicates that a 
majority of them are said to have not believed in a heaven or a hell or 
a devil. That may sound extremely Godless to us, but after all I fancy 
I see in it a ray of hope. These men speak of heaven and of hell and of 
the devil as they have been taught to understand those things, a heaven 
inhabited by ethereal beings, wafting their way from place to place, 
without knowledge of the past or hope of the future, who surround the 
throne of a God without body, parts or passions, and sing anthems 
and play harps throughout eternity; a hell which is a lake of burning 
brimstone and of a devil who goes around with a pitchfork looking for 
victims to pitch into it, where they are to remain forever burning, but 
never consumed. This doctrine never has appealed to me. It seems 
rather hopeful to me that men professing to be teachers of the doctrine 
of Christ are getting away from those things. 

SATAN CAST OUT 

As an introduction to what I would like to say I want to read from 
the twelfth chapter of the Revelation of St. John, seventh verse: 

And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the 
dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. 

And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 

And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and 
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth, and his 
angels were cast out with him. 

In the Bible the word devil is used interchangeably with Satan, 
the tempter, Beelzebub, the prince of this world, the old serpent, all of 
which appellations refer to the same personage. 

A SON OF THE MORNING 

The word devil is a contraction from the Greek word "diabolus" 
which interpreted means a malicious accuser, or demon, and is equivalent 
to the Hebrew word Satan, an enemy or adversary. 

The scripture which I quoted at the beginning of my remarks, 
and the context to which your attention is called, teach us that this per- 
sonage to whom we commonly refer as the devil was Lucifer, a son of the 
morning, an angel in authority, who rebelled against the Father and the 
Son, because of which he was cast down to earth with those who followed 
after him, and became Perdition, the lost one over whom the heavens 
wept. Jesus, referring to his fall, says : "I saw Satan as lightning fall 
from heaven." 

Wherever mentioned in the scriptures the devil is referred to as the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



97 



tempter, the deceiver, the author of lies, the enemy of God, and the 
opposer of all that is good, but at the same time so adroit that the false- 
hoods which he utters appear to be truth. He may even appear as an 
angel of light. 

Shakespeare understood this characteristic of the Evil One when he 
makes Banquo say to Macbeth: "The earth hath bubbles as the water 
has and these are of them, but 'tis strange, and ofttimes to win us to our 
harm, the instruments of darkness tell us truths, win us with honest 
trifles to betray us in deepest consequence." 

HIS CHARACTER AND SUBTLE POWER 

How similar are these words of Shakespeare to the scripture which 
tells us that some of us he bribes with profit, and others he allures with 
pleasures which appear innocent in themselves, but lead us on to trans- 
gression, which is his sole desire. His great effort is to rob God of his 
glory and men of their souls. 

More than three hundred years ago, John Milton, referring to Satan, 
said : "He it was whose guile, stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived 
the mother of mankind." 

Milton pictures Satan in human form with a serpent with dripping 
fangs and forked tongue coiled about his feet. 

The scriptures contain many references to his subtle power. His 
malice is deadly. His activity and diligence are equal to his malice. He 
has a legion of those who fell with him, and have sold their souls to 
him to assist in carrying out his designs. 

In his parable of the sower, explaining its meaning, Jesus says 
that the seed sown is the word of God. Those by the wayside are they 
who hear. Then cometh the devil and taketh away the word from their 
hearts lest they believe and are saved. 

The devil entered into the heart of Judas and prompted him to 
betray the Son of God to those who were responsible for his death. 

The Apostle Peter warns us to be constantly vigilant because, he 
says, our enemy the devil, as a roaring lion is seeking whom he may 
devour. 

SEEKS DOMINION OVER THE EARTH 

, From the time of his fall Lucifer has sought to establish and main- 
tain dominion over the earth and those who dwell upon it, and with few 
exceptions, and then for brief periods only, he has been successful. 

It was his power that interrupted and temporarily prevented the 
full fruition of the mission of the Savior in the meridian of time. His 
triumph, however, was only temporary. Knowing that his dominion over 
the people of the earth is to be broken, and that certain defeat awaits 
him, he arrays himself in the livery of Christ, and masquerading as his 
representative, in the words of Shakespeare, wins the hearts of men by 
honest trifles which are true, while he betrays them, and leads them away 
to deepest consequences. 

The character and mission of Satan is illustrated in the story in 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



•which he appears to our mother Eve, and by flattery and deception 
persuades her to disregard the command of God and partake of the for- 
bidden fruit, declaring to her that she should not die, but become wise. 
She partakes and brings the heritage of death to her posterity. He thus 
proves that he is a deceiver and falsifier. 

DEVIL WORSHIP 

The character of Satan has been so powerfully manifested among 
men that in many countries he has been made an object of worship. It 
was through the serpent that he appeared to our mother Eve, and from 
that time to the present the serpent has been the symbol ' of the devil 
among those who worship him. 

Zoroaster, who is referred to in history as a great philosopher or 
legislator, who some students say lived 6000 B. C. while others place his 
death 500 B. C, was of Bactrian extraction, an ancient people of Asia. 
He was the founder of the Zoroastran or Zarathustrian religion. 

According to Edward B. Taylor, L.L.D., F.R.S., in his book, "An- 
cient Faiths and Modern Religions," the predominant idea in the teach- 
ings of Zoroaster was the existence of two spirits or governing powers, 
one of which constantly seeks to accomplish good, while the other 
strives to accomplish evil. The first of these powers is represented as 
light, life, law, order, and truth — all that is good and pure. 

The other power is his antithesis — he is darkness, filth, lawlessness, 
all that is evil in the world, he is Satan, he is death. Taylor says of 
this people: "While recognizing the good spirit, give their chief rev- 
erence to Satan, chief of the angelic hosts, who now has power to afflict 
mankind. Will not Satan then after death reward the Izedis, who have 
served him during their mortal lives ?" 

Only a few days ago a dispatch was published in the Salt Lake 
Tribune from Kurdistan, in Asia, referring to worship of the devil by 
these people. 

Where devil worship is practiced the serpent is always his symbol, 
and exorcism is resorted to in order that he may be placated and his 
anger abated. 

ONCE AN INTELLIGENT AND MIGHTY PEOPLE 

At the time of the discovery of America by Columbus two great 
empires or kingdoms existed, one the Aztec empire in Mexico, the other 
the kingdom of the Incas, in Peru, South America. The vast ruins which 
exist in both North and South America bear undeniable evidence of a 
once intelligent and mighty people. At one time, living under the code 
of ethics taught by Christ, their life had been happy and prosperous, 
as the following excerpts from their history show : 

And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the 
love of God which did dwell in the hearts 1 of the people. 

And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor 
lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness ; and surely there could not 
be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



99 



There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any 
manner of ites ; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the 
kingdom of God. 

What a change had come to these people when they were discovered 
by Columbus fourteen hundred years later ! Satan had sown tares with 
the wheat, the result being, as it had been many times before, that the 
good seed had been choked out and destroyed. 

IMAGE OF THE SERPENT 

In every city and village the image of the serpent raised his head, 
with his forked tongue and dripping fangs exposed. Human sacrifices 
by thousands were offered to these idolatrous gods of stone, to which 
the people bowed down in worship. 

Dr. August LePlongeon in his book, "Sacred Mysteries Among the 
Mayas and Quiches," says : 

Chichen Itza may be termed the serpent city par excellence. The serpent 
may be found everywhere. It guards the stairways leading up to their temples 
and the doors of their homes. In a single structure recently uncovered near the 
City of Mexico at Xochitl the heads of 66 serpents protrude from the walls, 
guarding approach from all points of the compass. 

Pedro de Cieza de Leon, a Spanish soldier, who served under 
Francisco Pizarro, in the conquest of Peru, kept a careful record of the 
things which he saw and heard. His book is one of the most prized by 
scholars, of all the histories of the conquest. He says : 

All over Peru they call the devil Supay. I have been told that he has been seen 
by them many times. Very great is 1 the dominion that the devil, the enemy of 
mankind, is allowed to have over these people. These people hold it to be certain 
that the devil is false and wicked, and that they obey him more from fear than love. 

The condition of degradation to which devil worship has reduced 
the people of both Mexico and Peru is in many respects too shocking 
to be repeated. 

OPPOSED TO CHRIST AND HIS MISSION 

The malice and jealousy of Satan toward Christ our Lord and his 
mission are deadly. Failing in his plan to dethrone God and deprive 
Christ of his birthright, cast down to the earth with those who followed 
after him, forever banished from the presence of the Father, he loses 
no opportunity to thwart the redemption of man from death, the penalty 
which came to us through his wicked design. He sought the destruction 
of the infant Christ when he prompted Herod the Great to destroy the 
children of Bethlehem. He sought to destroy the purpose of the mission 
of Christ by bribery when he offered to surrender to him dominion over 
the earth on condition that the Redeemer would worship at his shrine. 
Failing in this he inspired the minds of men with malice and hatred, 
which led to the crucifixion. 

.The crucifixion of Christ, instead of accomplishing the purpose 
which Lucifer designed, had precisely the contrary effect. Endowed with 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



power over death, Jesus, on the third day, rose from the tomb, thus 
robbing the grave of its victory and making possible redemption from 
the captivity in which Satan held the spirits of men. 

SATAN STILL LIVES 

To realize that Satan still lives and is busily engaged in his opposi- 
tion to that which is good, one needs only to pause for a moment and 
contemplate conditions in this troubled world of ours. Long ago he 
declared that with gold and silver and armies and navies he would 
control the world. Any person who is familiar with the words of the 
prophets as they are contained in the scriptures knows that holy men in 
ages past, moved upon by the spirit of prophecy, foresaw and declared 
events which were to occur long after the age in which they lived. 

From the many declarations which refer to the activities of the Evil 
One at the time in which we live, I quote the following : 

For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must 
needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his ever- 
lasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish ; 

For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts' of the children of men, and 
stir them up to anger against that which is good. 

And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will 
say : All is well 

And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell ; and he 
saith unto them : I am no devil, for there is none — and thus he Whispereth in 
their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no 
deliverance. 

Wjhile Satan thus seeks to destroy the peace and happiness of 
mankind, Christ strives to draw them to him. The same controversy 
which resulted in the fall of Lucifer persists until the present moment. 
It is the question of the redemption of man from the fall, and the penalty 
of death which resulted from it. 

Lucifer offers redemption to man on condition that the recipient 
give him the honor and credit for that which he receives, and in return 
promises redemption regardless of the character of the applicant, the 
life he has lived, or the example set before others. 

MAN AN AGENT UNTO HIMSELF 

Christ adheres to the word of the Lord, spoken to Adam in the 
Garden of Eden : "This man has become one of us, knowing good and 
evil." He thus becomes an agent unto himself, to choose between good 
and evil, between right and wrong. If he has been a sinner, and repents 
of his evil way, and does that which is evil no more, he may be for- 
given and inherit the blessings of the righteous when he stands before 
the bar of God, to be judged according to his works. If he wilfully 
turns to wickedness and repents not he shall receive the reward of the 
wicked and will go away with Lucifer and his hosts into everlasting con- 
demnation, which will be remorse of conscience that he has allowed 
the day of his repentance to pass. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY IV. IVINS

The battle is being waged today as never before. It is the battle 
of right against might, of justice and mercy against greed, oppression, 
between armies and navies and the gold and the silver of the prince of 
this world and the lowly Nazarene, with the doctrine of his fraternity, 
equality and justice. And this time the Son of God will triumph. 

satan's power limited 

The one encouraging thing to which men of faith and confidence 
in this day of uncertainty and trial look forward is the fact that there 
are certain limits beyond which the power of the Evil One cannot pass. 
This power comes to us through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and 
obedience to the law of righteousness which he taught, and the example 
of his life. 

First, he promises that if any one of us who may be in doubt will 
go to him he will manifest the truth to us by the power of the Holy 
Ghost. John the Baptist, who was the chosen agent of the Lord to admin- 
ister the ordinance of baptism to Jesus Christ, said to those who accepted 
his teachings : 

I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after 
me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear ; he shall baptize you 
with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. 

Among other promises made by Christ to those whom he sent out 
to preach his Gospel was that in his name they should cast out devils. 
Upon their return they testified that this promise had been realized. 
They said to Jesus: "Even the devils are subject unto us through thy 
name." 

AN ARMOR AGAINST SATAN^S POWER 

This precious and indispensable gift, the Holy Ghost, comes to us 
by the laying on of hands by those who have authority to confer it. 
When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the 
word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, and they laid their 
hands upon them and they received the Holy Ghost. Again Paul, finding 
certain converts at Ephesus, asked them if they had received the Holy 
Ghost. They answered that they had not so much as heard that there 
was such a gift, that they had been baptized unto John's baptism. Paul 
explained to them that John baptized with water unto repentance for 
the remission of their sins only. They were then baptized in the name of 
Christ, and as Paul laid his hands upon them and conferred the Holy 
Ghost they spake in tongues and prophesied. 

Authority to confer this precious gift is in the Church today. Every 
baptized member of the Church receives it, after which he is entitled to 
receive and forever retain a fulness of the Spirit of the Lord, and a 
fulness of the Spirit of the Lord leads us into all truth and provides 
an armor which the shafts of Satan cannot penetrate. 

MUST BE CULTIVATED 

While the Holy Ghost may be conferred upon us, and is designed to 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be our guide and support, it is only restrained and manifested in its 
fulness in our guidance and defense in proportion to the degree to 
which we cultivate it and listen to its promptings. We may lose it 
entirely through indifference or transgression, and once deprived of its 
presence we are left in darkness more dense than before its reception. 
Cultivate it, my brethren and sisters, and it will become in reality the 
iron rod, which is the word of God, and will lead us back to him. 

A SCRIPTURAL ANSWER 

This brief and very incomplete review is the answer of the scrip- 
tures to one of the questions raised at the Chicago convention. Another 
question raised is answered in the 20th chapter of the revelation to St. 
John. John says : 

I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God ; and the bocks were 
opened : and another book was opened, which is the book of life : and the dead 
were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to 
their works. 

THE SAME WILY DECEIVER 

Now, brethren and sisters, I come to my concluding thought that 
I wish to leave with you. First I want you to understand thait the 
influence of Lucifer is not broken, that he is here to lead us astray, that 
he is the same wily deceiver that he has always been; that he tells us 
simple truths in order to lead us into error; that he clothes himself in 
the livery of Christ, and pretending to speak in his name, tells us simple 
truths to lead us to most serious consequences. 

Do not go away with the idea that Lucifer does not still live, this 
fallen angel who was a spirit of power. Do not forget that he was cast 
out from heaven. So there must be such a place. Do not forget that 
the pangs of hell will be the remorse of conscience which you will feel 
because of walking contrary to the light which you have had after having 
received it. Cultivate it. It is to you and to me the iron rod which is 
the word of God. Every man and woman that seizes upon it and holds 
steadfastly to it will find themselves back in that place which we call 
heaven, a very different heaven from what these men who renounce 
their faith in heaven have any conception of. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

This is a beautiful sight. At the conclusion of each meeting I have 
felt that it was good to be here, and have not our hearts burned within 
us as we have listened to these living oracles of God, as they have 
spoken and taught us the scripture? 

I am happy to bring you greetings, my brethren and sisters, from 
5,511 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who 
live in the Texas Mission. We have in the Texas Mission eight lady 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN 



103 



missionaries, including Sister Rowan. We have fifteen Seventies, fifteen 
Elders, one High Priest, and one local missionary, making a total of forty 
full-time missionaries who are spending their entire time in trying to 
lead men and women to believe in God, their Father, in whose likeness 
we have been created. 

I am happy to say to you that of this number, nine are engaged in 
teaching school. I believe that one of the outstanding things that is 
being done today in America, in rural sociology and in country life, is 
being developed in the colonies in Texas. I was advised yesterday that 
our school is considered by Government officials in Washington as one 
of the outstanding schools of its kind in the United States. I am happy 
to say to you that we have been fortunate in having Elder Boyle in 
charge of this work during the past six years. He has accomplished a 
most wonderful mission. I have been told by several of the leading 
citizens of Gilmer, Texas, who have lived there for many years, thai 
no other man has done so much good for that country as has Elder Louis 
F. Boyle. This is gratifying to us, because we feel that the work he has 
done there is a "light on a hill." 

We are trying to teach men and women, boys and girls, how to 
live, how to enjoy the blessings of Almighty God, and I am happy to say 
that in the main the Saints who reside in the Texas Mission are happy. 
We have had an increase in our tithes this year. There was an increase 
in the tithing last year over the previous year, and many hundreds have 
paid tithing that had not paid any in the past. You who have been in 
the South realize that in the main those people believe in God ; that in 
the main they believe in the Bible. 

Just a short time ago I traveled a long distance to attend a funeral. 
The Sunday School superintendent had met with the misfortune of losing 
a child by death. This was the third one he had lost. He and his good 
wife were grief-stricken because of this. His father, a very prominent 
man in the country, with a host of friends, had secured a quartet from 
one of the near-by cities to come and sing. Three of these gentlemen 
had never been in attendance at a Latter-day Saint funeral service nor 
had they heard the Elders of the Church speak. We had them sit on the 
rostrum. The quartet sang a beautiful song. The Spirit of the Lord was 
there in rich abundance. It didn't seem that we were in the presence of 
death. The Lord blessed the Elders, and they were able to portray the 
beauties of the Gospel, as it is understood by the Latter-day Saints, and 
to give those Saints comfort and consolation in that which seemed to 
have been a calamity in their lives. 

After the services two of these fine men who were excellent singers, 
one a doctor, the other a county commissioner, said they would like to 
purchase a copy of our song book. We sold each of them a copy of the 
song book. They invited us to come and visit with them. I sent the mis- 
sionaries to call on them. On the 18th of last month one of these 
gentlemen, a doctor, drove a hundred and twenty miles to attend our 
conference in Houston. At the conclusion of the conference I shook 
his hand and welcomed him into our community. Our little new chapel, 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that we recently dedicated, when Brother Joseph Fielding visited our 
mission, was filled to its capacity. I took occasion to introduce this 
gentleman to a doctor who has fellowship in our Church, and I said: 
"Doctor, this doctor is a member of our Church;" and I said: "I hope 
this other good doctor will be led, through his serious, careful, prayer- 
ful investigation, to some time see the light." He said to me: "Brother 
Rowan, I already see the light. I was touched with the Spirit of Almighty 
God as I attended the funeral of that little boy, and I hope that I shall 
soon be a member of your Church." 

Oh, I rejoice in the testimony that I have. I bring you the message, 
brethren and sisters, that your sons and daughters are well and happy. 
They are enjoying the Spirit of the Lord. They are filled with the 
testimony of this work. One of our short-term missionaries recently 
returned from Houston. He said to me, as we were coming on the 
train : "I have been there five months and it has been my opportunity 
to attend a hundred and sixty-nine meetings." This is only an example 
of what the missionaries are doing. I do not say this in boasting, but 
because of the climatic condition the Elders can preach freely on the 
streets. Within the last three months one of the Elders has held sixty- 
three street meetings, a very fine accomplishment. 

Many of the Lord's people who live in that country are hearing and 
accepting the message of Mormonism. May I ask that you who have 
friends in Texas and Louisiana favor us with letters giving us their 
names and addresses. They are a fine people. 

We believe in these living Authorities. We are trying to follow 
their leadership. Our branches, with the exception of one, are all pre- 
sided over by local people. Our Relief Society prganizations are doing 
a commendable work, as are the Sunday Schools and the Genealogical 
Society, all of them officered by men and women who, if it were neces- 
sary, would sacrifice their lives on the altar, because of the testimony 
of Almighty God that has been given to them. 

I know, as I know I am alive, my brethren and sisters, that Jesus 
is the Christ ; that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living 
God. And oh, I am so happy in the testimony that has come to me, 
that these men who have succeeded the Prophet Joseph were indeed 
prophets, seers and revelators, and that in this day we have one of the 
greatest and most mighty men that God has ever chosen, a select and 
wonderful leader. May God bless him. May he bless all of us, and may 
you live in such a manner that you will be able to continue as you are 
doing, to make a favorable impression upon the tourists and those who 
come into your midst. 

We appreciate the good work that is being done by the Bureau of 
Information, and by these marvelous broadcasts that are given every 
Sunday by the Tabernacle Choir. 

May God bless us all. May we have your faith and prayers, above 
everything else. May we, as missionaries, have a vision of our great 
responsibility and our possibilities. May God, through your faith and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



105 



prayers, and our humility, direct us to his children, the honest in heart, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Elders George F. Richards and Stephen L. Richards are absent on 
account of illness. Brother Joseph F. Merrill as you all know is absent 
in Europe, presiding over the European Mission. 

As near as we are able to judge, hundreds of thousands of people 
have listened to the broadcast this morning, and we appreciate very much 
their doing so. I wish to re-echo the fine compliments that have been 
paid to our choir. We appreciate very very much the good work that 
they are doing. 

As a closing number the Choir sang the anthem "Grant us Peace, 
O Lord," — soprano solo by Laurinda Brewerton. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The music to which we have just listened was composed by Evan 
Stephens. I wish that as far as possible we would get into the habit of 
singing our own music, that is, music composed by our own people. 
There are an inspiration and spirit which accompany the music of George 
Careless, Evan Stephens, Joseph J. Daynes and others of our own 
composers that I sometimes think we do not get from those not of our 
faith. 

Elder Henry H. Blood, President of the North Davis Stake, pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference convened Sunday afternoon 
at 2 o'clock. 

At this meeting the great Tabernacle was again crowded to capa- 
city, and in addition thousands of people assembled on the Tabernacle 
grounds and in the Assembly Hall, where they listened to the proceedings 
of the Conference as they were broadcast by radio from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Do what 
is right." 

Elder Edward J. Wood, President of the Alberta Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

The hymn, "O Say, What is Truth?" was sung by the Choir and 
congregation.

IMPRESSIVE NATIONAL BROADCAST 

I do not know that I have ever enjoyed a richer hour, that I have 
had my emotions stirred with deeper religious conviction than during 
the hour of our national broadcast this morning. It was an effective intro- 
duction to a great conference session, and an outstanding compliment to 
Professor Anthony C. Lund, director of the choir, Frank Asper, our 
organist, and also to the devoted, unselfish, and efficient members of this 
great Tabernacle Choir. 

I have thought often and have several times said that music is as 
important a part of religious worship as is the preaching. Our hearts 
were surely opened this morning by that hour of unusual music and those 
calm but impressive words of our radio announcer, Richard Evans. Our 
souls were thus made ready to receive the stirring messages that followed 
by President Clark and President Ivins, and by President Rowan of the 
Texas Mission. 

REMARKS ADDRESSED TO PRESIDENT GRANT 

I want to address a few remarks to President Grant: I was ten and 
he twenty-four when I sat in the gallery of the little meeting house in 
Tooele and heard him deliver that seven and a half minute address of 
which he spoke yesterday. He, a beardless youth, was sent to us to be 
the president of our stake. An outstanding baseball player, he was the 
hero of the boys then and he has been the hero of the youth of the Church 
ever since. I said to him this morning : "I do not know that it is so much. 
President Grant, what you say as what you do that spurs us on and fills 
us with a determination to try harder." For him at this busy time, in the 
midst of this great conference, to walk into our Mutual Improvement 
meeting this morning before eight o'clock (the meeting began at eight) is 
but an example of the quiet but effective way he has of telling us, by his 
actions, how intensely interested he is in the advancement, welfare and 
progress of the young people of the Church. 

M. I. A. WORK 

The work being done by the Mutuals is becoming more and more 
effective and popular all the time. I was impressed with the confidence in 
our young folks, the confidence in the Sunday School workers, as ex- 
pressed by Brother McKay yesterday. And I have already said : 

President Grant, I will be glad to borrow a car and furnish the gasoline if 
you will go with me to any of our stake conferences. I want you to look into the 
faces of the multitudes of young folks who assemble on Sunday night and see what 
great and rapid strides the young people are making, what clean, active and satis- 
factory lives they are living. 

I was at Hyrum Stake a week ago where the Mutual Improvement 
meeting held Sunday night was a music festival. The ward meeting house 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



107 



was packed with 822 boys and girls. Two choruses came forward, a 
chorus of boys and a chorus of girls, and then a mixed chorus. My soul 
was stirred. 

At that conference I was handed a message in the form of a picture 
from President Cardon, of the Cache Stake. No doubt many of you have 
seen it in the Deseret News. Just think of it — a world 'record there 
broken! And then some ask if we are doing effective work with our 
young people. Ninety-six per cent of all the boys of Scout age in the 
Cache Stake are Scouts, registered and active. God bless the bishops, the 
stake presidency, the high council, and all who in that stake are thus 
intensely interested in the welfare, salvation, education, and training of 
our young people. 

While Scouting was adopted as a part of our M. I. A. and Priest- 
hood program before the administration of President Grant began, our 
M Men and Gleaner girl work has all been started since he became 
president, and with his support and encouragement it has gone over the 
Church like a prairie fire and as a result we have all these thousands upon 
thousands of young folks from seventeen to twenty-three who are living 
in accordance with the standards and ideals of the Church. 

Later our Vanguard and Junior Girls with thousands more, ages 15 
and 16, became intensely interested in Church activity. Next came our 
Senior classes — those between the ages of twenty-three and thirty-five. 
And here again we have brought thousands more into intense M. I. A. 
activity. 

An example of the effectiveness of our work is the great music 
festival which was announced in our morning meeting. Three thousand 
singers from all over the Church during our June Conference are to 
practise Friday and Saturday under the direction of Noble Cain, famous 
Chicago leader, and under his direction the festival will be presented 
Saturday evening and the chorus will sing Sunday. The whole Church 
is being stirred by this outstanding national musical event. We anticipate 
that the national hook-up will give the same general satisfaction as did 
our program two years ago. 

You had a little foretaste yesterday of the treat that is coming. Just 
think of it, the chorus of the Liberty Stake alone that sang for us here 
yesterday filled all of these choir seats — nearly 500 now I understand — 
and that was but one stake. We have a hundred and four others. When 
from all of these, a total of a hundred and five, we bring together in this 
Tabernacle their outstanding singers, we will have to do what we did 
two years ago, that is, ask the bishops to keep their people in the wards, 
because there will not be room for them even in this spacious Tabernacle. 

SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT GRANT 

Thus I say to President Grant, as a word of encouragement, that 
he was our hero in the beginning, he is our hero yet. He showed the 
intensity of his interest in our work when he came this morning to our 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



early Mutual Improvement meeting. President Grant, we are more than 
a hundred thousand strong. We stand firmly behind you ! 

Now a few words to the rest of you and to those who are listening in. 

ARE WE GENUINELY CONVERTED 

It is now more than a hundred years since this, the Church of Jesus 
Christ was organized in these last days by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
am wondering how nearly, with what degree of accuracy, the deeds, the 
conduct and the lives of our Church members agree with the exalted 
standards, the principles and ideals of this the Church of the Master. 
Are we doing genuinely, conscientiously and faithfully the will and 
carrying out the wishes, instructions and desires of our Father which is 
in heaven ? 

I am going to undertake to draw to your attention a few of the 
standards of the Church with the hope that each of us for himself will 
conduct an examination and find out whether or not our lives and con- 
duct satisfy these standards and requirements. If they do not, perhaps 
we may be induced to try harder to be better and to do better, especially 
if we have a deep conviction and realization that "the ax is laid unto the 
root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good 
fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire." (Matt. 3 :10 ; Luke 3:9.) 

JUDGING OURSELVES 

And how are we to be able to sit in judgment on ourselves, to tell 
whether or not our acts and conduct, our sense of guilt, will bring into 
our souls sorrow and regret, yes, a feeling of anguish and remorse ? Con- 
cerning this matter St. John in the Book of Revelations says : 

And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were 
opened : and another book was opened, which is the book of life : and the dead were 
judged out of those things which were written in the books, * * * every man 
according to his works. (Rev. 20:12-13.) 

Thus it is stated clearly that we are to be judged by our works, by 
our accomplishments, by what we do and not wholly or primarily by what 
we say. Concerning this important matter Jesus the Son of God himself 
has said : 

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of 
heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. (Matt. 7:21.) 

DOING THE WILL OF THE FATHER 

It is what we do, it is what we are, it is our actual accomplishments 
that are going to count most. As I think of these things, I cannot help 
but wonder if it is possible that even here in our own Church there are 
some who actually draw near to the Lord with their lips but in their 
hearts and in their actions and conduct they are far from him. It is 
not words alone, it is not utterances of the tongue only that count, for to 
paraphrase slightly those impressive words of the Savior, it is not every 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN , 



109 



one that saith Lord, Lord who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; 
but he that doeth the will of the Father which is in heaven. ( Matt. 7:21.) 

With these preliminary remarks in mind, let us now at the end of a 
hundred years of our Church activity, apply a few practical tests to our- 
selves and find out whether or not we are actually believers in the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, if we are genuinely converted, and if we are really living 
in accordance with the teachings and standards of the Gospel. On this 
occasion I propose to submit for your consideration only three of our 
many Church standards and teachings. I do this with a hope that by 
applying these to our own lives and conduct some of us, perhaps finding 
ourselves not measuring up to one or more of these three standards, may 
resolve to struggle a little harder and make our lives and conduct better. 

ARE WE HONEST 

Our 13th Article of Faith begins with the words : "We believe in 
being honest." Measured by this first standard, about which I wish to 
speak, how many who are familiar with us, members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, how many who know and who are 
familiar with our doings and our conduct have a genuine conviction that 
we are "absolutely honest," that we are living in strict and close conform- 
ity with this important requirement, this fundamental teaching of the 
Church ? 

It has been said of Abraham Lincoln by Morse, the historian, that "his chief 
trait all his life long was' honesty of all kinds and in all things ; not only common- 
place, material honesty in dealings, but honesty in language, in purpose, in thought; 
honesty of mind, so that he could never even practise the most tempting of all de- 
ceits, a deceit against himself. This pervasive honesty was' the trait of his identity, 
which stayed with him from beginning to end, when other traits seemed to be 
changing, appearing or disappearing, and bewildering the observer of his career. 
All the while the universal honesty was there." (American Statesmen, Vol. XXV, 
p. 20— Morse.) 

During all of his days, even from his boyhood in the Kentucky cabin, 
through to the end of his life in the White House, Abraham Lincoln was 
known by his intimates as "Honest Abe." But as honest as was Lincoln, 
I have said repeatedly in public and in private, that he was no more frank, 
no more honest, and no more conscientious in his life and in his dealings 
with his fellowmen than is our own President Heber J. Grant. Like 
Lincoln, President Grant's outstanding and unchangeable quality, that 
from which he, in his life and conduct never varies, is absolute honesty. 

This absolute honesty in word, in deed, in thought, has been also the 
outstanding characteristic in the life of every president of the Church. 
These men so lived and so conducted themselves that they had nothing 
to conceal. Their lives were like the contents of an open book. Such 
men say what they mean and mean what they say. Their outstanding 
characteristic is dependability. 

Ar e you, who are listening to my voice, honest as Lincoln was hon- 
est ? Are you honest as President Grant is, and as other presidents of the 
Church have been, honest? Or are we, some of us even members of the 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Church, inclined at times and under some unusual conditions to say with 
our lips what we do not feel or believe or know down deep in our inmost 
hearts to be the truth ? In other words, are we honest, absolutely so ? 

ARE THERE ROBBERS AMONG US 

Do you think, for example, that if a careful examination were con- 
ducted that we could find any among us who have robbed anybody? 
Remember it has been said of a whole nation, "Ye have robbed God." And 
when the people of that nation exclaimed, "Wherein have we robbed 
thee?" the answer came promptly, "In tithes and in offerings." (Malachi 
3:8-9.) 

DUES TO THE CHURCH AND TO THE LORD 

Among you good folks who make up this multitude that I am ad- 
dressing in this historic Tabernacle and among those who are hearing my 
words over the radio, are there some who have not settled in full with 
the Lord ? Are there some who have not paid their dues to the Church ? 
If so, do we in our heart of hearts sincerely believe in being honest in 
our dealings, honest with our fellowmen, honest with ourselves and 
honest with the Lord ? And if we so believe, do we actually practise or 
live in accordance with this belief? Are we practically and earnestly 
and seriously religious? Are we genuinely converted? Have we actu- 
ally shown fruits of repentance and righteous living ? Have we fed the 
hungry and clothed the naked ? Have we visited the fatherless and the 
widows in their affliction? Have our hearts gone out in sympathy to 
the unemployed, or when the hungry have called for bread have we with 
hardness in our hearts merely handed them a stone? 

REAL WORSHIP 

Do we partake of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper regularly 
each week and do we partake of it worthily? This is the second standard 
about which I wish to speak. It is a teaching of the Church and a practise 
of the faithful, as the scriptures say, to love the Lord our God with all 
our hearts, and with all our souls, and with all our minds. (Matt. 22 :37.) 
We are expected to have faith in our Heavenly Father and to worship 
him ; we are instructed to go to our several places of worship on Sunday 
and there partake of the Sacrament — the bread and the water — in mem- 
ory of the broken body and the shed blood of the Master. Are there 
some here today and others within the sound of my voice who are gener- 
ally regarded as being good Church folks who do not take advantage of 
the opportunity to go regularly each Sunday to their respective wards and 
there with bowed heads and prayerful hearts in the Sacrament meeting- 
enjoy genuine worship? 

In these days of depression, the down-hearted, the sick, those who 
are discouraged, the weary and the heavy laden will do well to go to 
their respective ward chapels and there receive comfort, consolation, 
blessing and encouragement. We are told in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
Section 59 : 



ELDER RICHARD R.LYMAN 



111 



Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. 

Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that 
of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 

And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou 
shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day ; for 
verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy 
devotions unto the Most High. (D. & C. 59:7-10.) 

It has been said that no human tongue can speak words whose mes- 
sage is equal in importance to partaking worthily of the Lord's Supper. 
If we are neglecting to take advantage of this outstanding blessing, are 
we converted ? Are we genuine Latter-day Saints ? 

Thirdly: Let us measure ourselves by another Church standard, 
that of watching and praying "unceasingly." The Master said, "Pray 
that ye enter not into temptation." (Luke 22:40.) The Bible says dis- 
tinctly, "pray without ceasing." (Thess. 5:17.) "Watch and pray," the 
Master said again, "that ye enter not into temptation, the spirit indeed 
is willing but the flesh is weak." (Matt. 26:41.) 

To pray without ceasing is a practise that should be followed par- 
ticularly by the youth of our nation today ; in these times our young folks 
are surrounded with pitfalls, yes, with unusual temptations practically 
everywhere and practically all the time. The words of the Savior ought 
to be kept constantly ringing in their ears : "Wlhy sleep ye ? Rise and 
pray lest ye enter into temptation." (Luke 22:46.) 

PRAYING 

"Seek ye the Lord" is another admonition that applies also to the 
people of these days. Those whose lives are well-nigh completed, those 
who have had long years of experience and know with certainty what 
things are and what things are not worth while — these are they who 
ought to call out to the youth of today : "Seek ye the Lord while he may 
be found." Today is the time to call ; tomorrow may be too late. O 
youth of our nation, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call ye 
upon him while he is near." (Isaiah 55 :6.) 

Measured by this standard of praying, of family prayers and of 
secret prayers, how well do you and I measure up? Christ himself says. 
"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will g*ive 
you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me ; for I am meek and 
lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is 
easy, and my burden is light." (Matt. 11 28-30.) With what degree of 
regularity and earnestness do we in prayer struggle to put ourselves 
in harmony with that matchless power, the power of God, that power 
which comes into human hearts and lives as a result of prayerfulness 
and righteous living. 

I realize that many who have paid little or no attention to religion, 
ridicule the idea that the light of heaven may shine into human hearts 
and souls as it shone into the lives of Saul of Tarsus and Joseph Smith, 
or that it may bring into a human heart a conviction like that which en- 
abled Paul to stand before Agrippa and say, "I saw a vision. I saw a 
light." 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But here are Joseph Smith's own words : 

However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought 
since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, 
and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice ; 
but still there were but a few who believed him ; some said he was dishonest, others 
said he was mad ; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy 
the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecu- 
tion under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute 
him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both 
seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make 
him think or believe otherwise. So it was with me." (Pearl of Great Price, p. 49.) 

Experiences like these, it seems, can be understood and most of them 
can be experienced and enjoyed only through the power of faith. A 
satisfying knowledge or faith concerning things spiritual cannot come 
merely through logic or reason, for these come only as a result of right- 
eous, prayerful, religious living. The following familiar words from 
the Holy Book explain briefly and clearly what I mean : 

If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of 
God, or whether I speak of myself. (John 7:17.) 

If we are losing faith, if it seems our prayers are unanswered, let us 
reflect upon these words which the Lord has given to us in Section 101 
of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel ; but, in the day of 
their trouble, of necessity they feel after me. They were slow to hearken unto 
the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken 
unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble. (D. & C. 101 :7-8.) 

I have mentioned but three of the standards of the Church. Meas- 
ured by these, are you and am I doing the will of our Heavenly Father ? 
If we are, the promise says it is our right to know whether or not there 
is life beyond the grave ; whether the doctrines advocated are true, or 
whether these doctrines are false. 

SUMMARY 

Referring specifically again to the three standards which I have 
named, let me ask: 

1. Are we honest, absolutely so? Do we deal justly, honestly and 
charitably with our fellowmen ? Do we pay our tithes and pay our offer- 
ings fully ? 

2. Are we participating in that intense worship which comes from 
attending our Sacrament meetings and from partaking worthily of the 
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper? 

3. Are we participating in family and secret prayers, earnestly, 
honestly and with regularity ? Are we praying always ? 

Humbly I pray that by the power of God we may be able as a result 
of our living in accordance with these and other standards of the Church 
to have faith, to understand, to know and to have a testimony concerning 
the divinity of the doctrines of the Church and the effectiveness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters, I pray that the Lord may guide me 
by his Holy Spirit so that my words may be edifying to all of us and in 
harmony with the Lord's desires. 

AN OCCASION OF GREAT JOY 

Despite the fact that I sense the tremendous responsibility of stand- 
ing before this vast congregation I think there is no one here who is 
enjoying this conference more than I. Since my late boyhood I have 
sought to attend these conferences from year to year, and with consider- 
able regularity I have been able to do so. Because of my absence in the 
mission field I have been able to attend only one of the last twelve general 
conferences of the Church ; therefore I come to this conference hungry, 
hungry for the spirit that I feel comes to me from my fellow-believers, 
hungry for the word of God spoken from this pulpit. 

I am grateful that I am a member of this Church, that I have a 
testimony of the truth of the restored Gospel, and I bear witness to the 
existence of God, the divine ministry of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
and the divine, inspired mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

OUTPOURING OF SPIRIT IN MISSION FIELD 

Do not misunderstand me. While I realize great joy in being present 
at this conference, I must say that in the small gatherings in the mission 
field we have similar outpourings of the Holy Spirit. At times it has 
seemed to me that the spirit that has moved upon those who have spoken 
and listened in the small gatherings in the mission field has been even 
stronger and more powerful, than we feel here at home. It often happens 
that, when far away from home, far from the sheltered protection of 
the temple, the tabernacle, and the stakes of Zion, we draw more heavily 
upon the spiritual forces about us. So, while I am glad to be here T 
bear witness to the splendid spirit that pervades the gatherings of the 
Saints in the mission field. 

THOSE MAKING MISSIONARY SERVICE POSSIBLE 

I have been thinking about the mission field during this conference. 
As I look back over the years spent there I seem to see first of all a group 
of people whom I scarcely know, the fathers and mothers, the brothers 
and sisters, other relatives and the friends who have made possible the 
service of the Elders in the field. There is no time, and here is perhaps 
not now the place, to tell of the rich incidents of sacrifice and love, almos! 
divine love, that have led many of those whom I do not know — fathers 
and mothers and relatives — to give the necessary support to the Elders 
in the field. God bless them and be with them. 

THE MISSIONARY. — HIS DISCOVERIES AND GROWTH 

When I think of the fine men and women missionaries with whom 1 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have labored, young, sturdy, honest, who desired to learn, and who learned 
to love God, I am proud of my association with them. I have seen them 
make the greatest discovery of all time. They have gone into the field 
largely uneducated in the things of the Church. I have seen them dis- 
cover God. I have seen them discover Jesus Christ. I have seen them 
discover the Gospel, its virtue and truth. I have seen them discover their 
own place in the great plan of salvation, and I have seen them return to 
their homes matured in spirit and better able to carry on the great work 
that the Lord has established in these latter days. 

THE SAINTS IN THE MISSION FIELDS 

I think also of the Saints who constitute the membership of the 
missions in which I have labored — thirty thousand faithful men and 
women, trusting in God, bearing witness to the truth of the Gospel, 
feeling an assurance in their hearts that this is the truth, the great truth, 
the everlasting truth, the culminating truth of all the ages, who are 
making sacrifice in many ways to carry forward the work of the mission 
field. These brethren and sisters look upon us in the stakes of Zion as 
examples whom they should follow; and I trust that we are carrying 
that burden and accepting that responsibility, the challenge to be an ex- 
ample not only to the world but to our brethren and sisters who labor 
in behalf of the Lord's great cause far beyond the organized stakes and 
wards of Zion. I love those people as I love you here. They are battling 
for the trujh on the outposts of Zion ; they are extending the boundaries 
of Zion; they are fulfilling the prophecies under which we shall go for- 
ward until we cover the earth. 

THE ETERNAL BATTLE 

There is a new feeling towards us throughout the world. There 
is more tolerance, there is little persecution, as has been said by a number 
of speakers during this conference. Conditions have changed vitally, 
wonderfully, beyond the understanding of those who labored in the field 
a generation or two ago. But do not let us be deceived. It has been well 
pointed out here by other speakers that the eternal battle is still on be- 
tween truth and error, between the Lord and the Evil .One, the battle that 
will never end so long as men have their free agency, so long as error 
is possible, wherever there is truth. We have merely shifted our battle 
ground, we have merely changed our weapons. Three hundred years 
ago humanity fought with spears and shields. Today out of the sky 
poison gas and bombs are dropped on the unprotected cities below. Just 
so, in the mission field today, under the new conditions we must change 
our battle ground and the weapons that we use, but the battle goes for- 
ward. 

The world is looking for that which we have to give them, though 
they know it not. I think that out of my experience in the mission field 
these last few years there comes as my deepest impression a feeling that 
the world is in sad need of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Men 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



115 



walk in darkness, seeking for light, they desire righteousness, for a 
desire for light and truth is in the heart of every man. They walk in 
darkness, trying to find their way out, pleading often for help. 

REFUSED ENTRANCE 

I recall very distinctly the first experience I had as our ship touched 
1 British shores six years ago last December. The official of the British 
government who came on board to stamp our passports, to permit us to 
enter the country, when he came to me and my family and discovered 
what we were about, he refused us entrance. "I cannot permit you to 
enter ; we do not want your kind of people in our country. We may 
tolerate the young Elders, but not you who are leaders." In the course of 
the conversation that followed — I must not take the time to detail it here 
— he said, "What do you intend to teach if I permit you to enter Eng- 
land ?" I answered him, "We intend to teach the British people so far as 
we are able how to win happiness while they live on earth, and how to 
find happiness in the life to come. We intend to teach them the meaning 
of life, where they came from, why they are here, and where they are 
going." 

VITAL QUESTIONS 

Almost in a breath this official stamped the passports and said : 
"Now we are done with that. Let's talk about Mormonism. I belong 
to a church but I am dissatisfied with it. It does not answer the 
problems of my life. It does not answer the questions that lie with- 
in my soul. I want to hear your teachings. Can you really tell 
me whence I came? Can you tell me why I am here? Can you tell 
me where I am going, for I know that life upon earth will end?" He 
became a fast friend — a type of millions of people in the world today 
who walk in darkness, feeling the need of light. Our obligation is to 
these people the world over. 

A PATHETIC CHAPTER 

We seem to be writing today the most pathetic chapter in human 
history. We stand at the pinnacle of human achievement, every natural 
force is more or less under our control. We have the radio, the telephone, 
the electric light, types of a conquest undreamed of in the generations 
gone before ; and yet we stand helpless from country to country, from 
ocean to ocean, before the means of supplying the common needs of 
mankind. We have. harnessed the forces of nature but we are unable 
to apply them and use them to meet human needs. It is indeed a pathetic 
chapter that we are writing. As I have traveled among the nations I 
have become convinced that the trouble with the world is that it still relies 
upon man-made truth, man-made institutions, man-made methods of 
solving the problems of humanity. 

ETHICS VERSUS RELIGION 

We have had in the world throughout the ages two opposing types 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of guides Tor human conduct. One we call ethics and the other we call 
religion. An ethical man is good because it pays him to be good ; because 
it promotes the peace of the community. An ethical man is virtuous 
because otherwise he contracts disease, and disease, personal or com- 
munity is not desirable. Such is ethics — calculating, selfish. Religion 
tells another story : I must be good because in the great economy of 
God, in the great program laid out for the salvation of humankind, in 
which I am involved with all my brethren and sisters, it is required that 
I must be righteous and virtuous. Obedience to the law leads to infinite 
results, both on earth and in the life to come. I must be virtuous, not 
merely because I protect myself, but because I live then in harmony with 
the greater law that proceeds from the author of law. 

The world needs the flaming fire of religion to replace the dead husks 
of ethics with which the nations are attempting to rebuild the fallen 
structure of their governments. We have an N.R.A. ; what we need is 
an S.R.A. — a spiritual recovery activity throughout the earth ; and until 
we launch a campaign for spiritual recovery we shall not fully solve the 
problems that lie before us.' 

SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION NECESSARY 

This may seem far remote from the need of filling the mouths of 
hungry people ; yet it is the only way by which we shall solve the problems 
of the world. The spiritual is ever greater than the material. The Lord 
said to the Prophet Joseph Smith : "All things unto me are spiritual, 
and not at any time have I given you a law which was temporal." A study 
of the condition of the world today shows that we are depending upon 
temporal means and methods for restoring that which we have lost, for 
bringing to us that which we desire so much to achieve. 

I stand here today with a simple message, an age-old message, which 
every speaker here has mentioned, that we must build from the founda- 
tion upward, upon a spiritual foundation which underlies everything that 
is beautiful, virtuous, and truthful. 

THE COMMON MAN'S PROBLEM 

Many men among us are hungry. The common man has decided 
that he shall have an equal opportunity with all other men so far as the 
common necessities of life are concerned. That is a real issue. The 
common man says, "I'll give my time, my strength, but in return I ask 
bread and shelter and clothing." The common man will win ; but he can 
not wholly win until we get back to the spiritual background of the prob- 
lem itself. 

It is well enough to say that we will feed hungry people because 
thereby we shall be better off. That is ethics. However, the Lord has 
said: "Let every man esteem his neighbor as himself." That is quite a 
different proposition. 

THE ONLY SOLUTION 

There will be no solution to the disturbing problems now racking 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



117 



the world until men learn to esteem their neighbors as themselves. It is 
a tremendous demand upon mankind. We of this Church must lead out 
in this as in other righteous matters. The revelations given by God to 
his people in these latter days must be taken at their face value. Our 
destiny is world leadership. There is much suffering among us, as I 
have discovered in the few months I have been home. I regret it, yet 
why should we not suffer ? I was trained in chemistry in my young man- 
hood and I still remember that to purify gold and other noble metals 
greater heat was necessary than to purify the ignoble metals. Perhaps 
we will have to go through a more fiery furnace because we are destined 
for leadership in the solution of the world's problems. 

There is much to be said, but there are several speakers yet to come 
and my time is just about over. The present day offers great challenging 
subjects. This Church looks forward, builds upon the past, invades the 
future, builds here and builds there, upon eternal verities, upon spiritual 
foundations which God has revealed through his children. 

GREATER THAN TRUTH 

The Lord has given us an example that all the world can follow. A 
boy not quite fifteen years of age was troubled in his soul concerning 
the truth. He had a quality which redeemed him above many men. He 
had a surpassing love of truth in his heart. Perhaps I may not be mis- 
understood if I say that there is one thing in the world even greater than 
truth, and that is the love of truth. Without the love of truth men can- 
not prosper even in the possession of truth, and in fact never shall men 
possess truth fully, without the love of truth. This boy went into a 
grove to plead with Divinity for eternal truth, and God spoke to him. 
and also the Son of God spoke to him, and the foundations of the latter 
day work of salvation were laid. The authority of the Priesthood was 
restored. The wonderful gifts and blessings that the whole world is 
beginning to recognize as belonging to this people, were given through 
that initial act on the part of Joseph Smith. 

EVERY MAN MAY KNOW FOR HIMSELF 

In a conversation with one of my brethren a short time ago he said : 
"Well, Joseph Smith had a mighty vision, but it cannot be duplicated. 
I wish I could have it." 

I stand here to declare to you, and there are thousands in this build- 
ing who can voice the same declaration from their own experience, that 
every one of us, every human soul, may obtain the same testimony and 
the same conviction that came to the Prophet Joseph Smith as he knelt 
upon his knees praying in the sacred grove for light and truth. God may 
not come in person, but God has agents. His Holy Spirit has powers 
beyond our understanding, and it is possible for every man and woman 
to satisfy his and her mind and soul and being, every part of them, of 
the truth of this work. When men will do so within this Church, will 
seek to obtain this transcendent testimony, then this Church will assume 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



its rightful leadership. Indeed, it is already assuming the right to lead, 
modest and humble as the Church may be. When the world approaches 
upon its knees the Author of Truth with full love of truth in its heart, 
then shall humanity be able to build toward the perfection of which 
humanity dreams. There is no other way. 

I bear you my testimony that this latter-day work is the truth, the 
eternal truth, and that only through this truth can man's happiness be 
won on earth or in heaven. May God help us to retain the truth in our 
hearts, to win it more completely, to live in accordance with it, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "And then shall the Light break forth," was sung by 
the Choir. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I stand before you this afternoon 
to add my testimony to the testimonies that have already been given from 
this stand. It has been my pleasure during the last two and a half years 
to mingle my voice together with the voices of the other mission presi- 
dents who are sitting on the lower stand this afternoon, in promulgating 
the Gospel in the nations of the earth. We have taken your sons and 
daughters and with their aid have undertaken to introduce to the people 
who are not acquainted with us the principles and truths of the Gospel. 

I wish to congratulate you upon the excellent material you have sent 
us in the mission field. They are wonderful young men and women. 
They come to us usually well established in the faith. However, occa- 
sionally there are men and women who come who might have been better 
prepared before leaving home. And we would appreciate it wonderfully 
if all these young people could be taught somewhat in the fundamental 
routine that they have to follow when they go into the field. It is a 
rare thing indeed, but it sometimes happens, that we have to teach these 
young men how to pray properly, how to ask a blessing on the food, and 
to do such simple things as they should be taught at home. If you would 
take that care and pains with your young men, all of them, I have no 
doubt but that it would establish them in the faith in such a way that 
when they come to us they would be all ready for service. It would 
help them wonderfully in the beginning of their mission. 

Without exception it has been my experience that these men round 
to and leave their missions with strong and living testimonies, having 
done wonderful work. It has been one of the greatest experiences of my 
life to labor with these young people, and it is with somewhat of a 
reluctant spirit that I have surrendered the reins of the Mexican Mission 
to President Pratt who addressed you yesterday. However, we go and 
we come ; when the President of the Church says go, we go ; when he 
says come, we come, with equal good will. I trust that in the new labors 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



119 



that I have to undertake I will have the Spirit of the Lord to guide and 
direct me, that it may be just as pleasant to me as' the work that I am now 
leaving behind. 

We have been laboring with a wonderful people, as you have been 
told, a vast and numerous people who need the Gospel, much more 
perhaps than some of our own races and nationalities do. They have 
been downtrodden for many years, centuries in fact, and they have come 
to a condition where they absolutely need the help that the Gospel can 
give them. Our own people on the contrary have grown up under a 
more liberal teaching and perhaps find themselves not quite in the same 
need that our neighbors on the south do. We have been trying to carry 
the truth to them and it has been a wonderful pleasure. 

I have been very much impressed with the things I have heard at 
this conference, and was especially pleased with the remarks that Presi- 
dent Clark made this morning. We teach faith through the instrumen- 
tality of these young men and young women — faith in God, faith in 
Jesus Christ, faith in the Gospel. There are some things that are not 
reducible to mathematical formula, and these things we must take by 
faith. Brother Widtsoe told us that he was a chemist in his earlier 
years, and one thing I remember most of all about my studies in chem- 
istry is that the instructor began that course by telling us that it was 
founded upon hypotheses, and an hypothesis, he said, is a scientific guess. 
And to show us how the hypotheses that are fundamental to chemistry 
change he got out some of his old books and read to us the story of an 
earlier chemistry — alchemy they call it. And since my days in school 
these hypotheses in chemistry and physics have changed again, and they 
are constantly changing. 

Now the science that is erected upon an hypothesis is no truer than 
that hypothesis. If that he true, the science may be true. If that be 
false, the science is questionable. Before we replace the fundamental 
truths that we have inherited from our ancestors, religious truths that 
have been of so much comfort and help to those who have gone before, 
let us be certain that the things we put in their place are true. 

We maintain that the Gospel embraces all truth. That may not 
mean that any living man may know all truth. It may not mean that 
the body of the Church can properly interpret all truth, but it does mean 
that whenever a truth is established we should accept it as part of the 
Gospel. But let us scrutinize those things carefully before we turn 
down the beliefs of the past and accept a new thing which may be 
founded upon a false hypothesis. That was one of the comforts to me 
when I went to college. I wondered if the study of chemistry, of physics, 
of biology, of geology, and of zoology might upset my equilibrium. But 
I found so many question-marks in the foundations of all of these that I 
believe it did not. And I would like to recommend just that thought 
to you, that perhaps after all we have within the Gospel the fundamental 
truths and precepts upon which these very sciences will in the end find 
themselves standing. I have that faith. I believe that every truth that will 
ever come into the world is part and parcel of the plan that was laid 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



clown by God our Father for the government of this world and man, 
and while he sojourns in it. 

I think we should not be afraid of scrutiny and of friendly criticism ; 
we should welcome it. Man can be saved only so far as he gains intel- 
ligence and understanding and exercises faith. Consequently, I welcome 
criticism if it is made in the proper light and spirit. Unfriendly criticism, 
inimical criticism perhaps is not to be desired because it is always preju- 
diced in advance and never sees a question fairly. That is the one 
thought and idea I had in mind in coming to this stand. I give it to you 
for what it is worth. 

I pray God our Heavenly Father that he will sustain each and all 
of us, that we may carry forward with our heads erect, with a firm tread, 
to a successful culmination of our careers. May God bless us to this end, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

In the few moments that I stand before you I pray that I may have 
the inspiration of God to lead me to say that which he would have me say 
upon this occasion. 

Perhaps it would be well for me to report my missionary experi- 
ences, or some of them. Thirty years ago last month I was called on a 
mission to the Central States and went into the mission the latter part 
of the year. I think I have attended the general conferences fifty-four 
times in that period of time. I have seen many things that have strength- 
ened my testimony and proved to me without a doubt that this is the work 
of God. I went into the mission field with a testimony of the Gospel — 
I knew it was true before I left home. It was an undeveloped testimony, 
it is true ; I had had no experience in the preaching of the Gospel, hut I 
realized its truth as revealed from heaven in these the last days. It came 
to me from my parentage and those pioneers who were led into the 
valleys of the mountains under the direction of Brigham Young and who 
fought the Indians and helped to establish these settlements in these 
valleys. Coming of that lineage I could not but have a testimony be- 
cause of the things that I had seen. 

It has been a great privilege which I have enjoyed to be associated 
with the thousands of men and women I have met in the mission field — 
fine men, clean in their lives, and good women. There were more than 
2500 of them — a great congregation from all over the Church, and they 
labored with me and with my good wife in the mission field. I was 
thinking a few days ago about the success that has come to the Church 
through the ministry of this fine, noble band of men and women. There 
were fewer than three quarters of one per cent of those 2500 missionaries 
who returned home without an honorable release. There were fewer 
than three-fourths of one per cent who lost their lives in the mission field. 
I handled all the funds that came to the mission in all the years we were

there. They deposited their money in the mission office and we kept it 
for them. There was a loss of less than twenty-five cents per missionary 
during all that time. That covered loss on books, literature and money 
that was furnished. They paid their bills. There are few banks in the 
world with that many accounts that could say they had not lost more 
than that amount. I doubt if there are any banks that could say it. In 
addition to that, when the mission was turned over to President Wood- 
ruff every penny of the funds on hand belonging to missionaries was 
returned to them, and there was not one of them who owed the mission 
anything. There had not been an overdraft for more than five years. 

That group of missionaries baptized over 11,000 people, over 9000 
of them being adult converts, not children. They worked hard and 
faithfully, and I give this testimony to the children of men today that it 
may occupy a place in the history of this Church, and may stand to the 
honor and the truth and the integrity of the men and women of the 
Church, covering a period of twenty-six or twenty-seven years. Most 
of these missionaries are now actively engaged at home. Some of them 
could be more diligent it is true, but perhaps that isn't altogether their 
fault. Since returning home I have found them, when I have visited 
the stakes, serving in stake presidencies, as bishops, bishops' counselors, 
in the auxiliary associations ; and in all the places that men and women 
have been called to occupy. They are engaged in positions of trust and 
in presiding capacities everywhere. This is true of representatives of 
all the missions ; I know this about those of the Central States, but I am 
quite sure it could be said about all the missions of the Church. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will never fail. It 
has steadily grown in membership, and it has steadily grown in faith. 
The integrity of the men and women today who go out into the mission 
field is just as great as it was twenty-five years ago. 

There is a great spirit of friendship in the world, and there ought 
to be. W!e ought not to meet the opposition that we did a hundred years 
ago, when those mighty men under the leadership of Joseph the Prophet 
and Brigham Young fought so hard for the establishment of the Church 
and its standards. It was the very opposite of what the people were 
being taught at that time. But a continuation of the practices and teach- 
ings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ has brought about a change in the 
hearts of the children of men. It will continue to be so. I know that we 
will be tempted by the Evil One, as Brother Ivins so well stated this 
morning. I think that Lucifer will fight with more vigor from now on 
than he has ever fought before, but so will God our Eternal Father. The 
battle that was begun in that world from which we came is still going on. 
The men and women who fought for the principles of right before the 
foundations of this earth were laid have been in the earth in the past and 
are today, carrying on under the leadership of Jesus Christ our Lord. 
They are fighting for the right, for the establishment of God's work and 
to bring about the plan that he intended should be accomplished when 
he sent his children into the world. 

There is a fine opportunity for this work to continue. I am not the 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



least bit discouraged about the things we hear — the things that might 
appear to hinder the progress of this Church. There is nothing worth 
while in the world that we can get easily ; we have to work for it. It will 
demand the support and attention of every one who takes part in the 
Church to do that for which the Lord has sent us into th e world — the 
carrying on of this Gospel at home and abroad, so as to fulfil the pur- 
poses of the Almighty as planned by his servants, prophesied by his 
prophets, and taught by those who went out under his name. 

I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I know that 
Brigham Young was the great leader that history says he was. I never 
knew him except as I have read about him. I was not intimately ac- 
quainted with those who followed him, although I remember John Taylor, 
Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow. But my ministry, my intimate 
association with the leadership of this Church, began with President 
Joseph F. Smith, and has continued with President Heber J. Grant. I 
have seen these men on the firing line out in the world, I have seen 
them at home, and I want to tell you that the integrity of the Church 
under the leadership of the men who have been placed at its head cannot 
be questioned. If the world had what we have, if the world could preach 
what we preach, I tell you the institutions of learning would be changed 
everywhere. The power of the Holy Ghost has never come to them : 
when it does it will make them powerful and great agencies for truth. 

I bear you my testimony that this is the work of God. I am glad 
to be home again in the bosom of the Church, visiting in the stakes, and 
to find the men and women there that I do find, associated in the different 
organizations. It has been a great pleasure to visit the various stakes 
and see the young folks of the Church take their part in the different 
auxiliary organizations, and also in the Priesthood circles that T have 
come in contact with. I am happy to be here. I know that the work of 
God is safe in the hands of the Priesthood of this Church. I care not 
for the attacks of the outside. Jesus Christ our Lord won in the begin- 
ning and he will win in the end^ He did it with his sons and his daughters 
before, and he will do it now, for this is his work and it cannot be frus- 
trated. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

In these days of indecision, uncertainty, and confusion concerning 
the things that have to do with the economic life of the country, con- 
cerning education and science, it is not remarkable that men's hearts 
begin to fail them when they stop to consider the question of religion. 
It seems as though men are running to and fro, trying to find their way 
out, but because of the darkness it is more difficult than they anticipated 
to get into the sunshine again. 

As Latter-day Saints we have faith in God the Eternal Father and 
in this great work which has been established in our day. But even with 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



123 



all of the supervision and the knowledge and the guidance that we 
receive, I am afraid that our hearts waver at times and, if we are not 
careful, we begin to doubt regarding some of the things that have to do 
with God and his work. 

It seems to me that there are a few things that will help us hold on 
and steady ourselves, that will stabilize the faith we have in this work. 
One thing essential to the faith of the people is confidence in the leader- 
ship of the Church, in God's servants whom he has chosen to lead and 
direct his people. I say that unless we have that confidence and the 
determination to follow our leaders and accept their guidance andcounsel, 
our faith will grow weaker, we will not have the strength to stand and do 
the things which God would have us do. 

I am not thinking only of the leadership of the General Authorities 
of the Church, but also of the leadership of the Stake Presidencies, of 
Bishops, the Priesthood of our Church, and the men and women who 
have been chosen to guide and direct the auxiliary work of the Church. 
It takes confidence in these men and women if we are to get from the 
spirit of the Church the things that God expects us to get. It is agreed 
that we are human, that we may make mistakes ; but the few mistakes, 
if there are any that may come to us because of this leadership, are not 
comparable to the thousands of fine, splendid things that this leadership 
does for us. Their counsel, their instruction, the wisdom that God gives 
to them, so outweigh any possible harm that if we would keep our faith 
we must believe and have confidence in the leadership that God has 
given us. 

I think I would be the most miserable of men if I had to sit in an 
audience and continually decide whether the leaders of my Church were 
speaking by the gift and power of God or whether they were speaking 
of themselves. I have found in my experience that when I have followed 
the counsel and instruction given to me by my leaders, even though I 
could not understand the thing at the time, I have always come out better 
in the end, and God has blessed me because I have given my allegiance 
and confidence to the men who have a right to guide and direct me in the 
affairs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters, and help us to keep 
in our souls love and confidence for those who preside over us, that we 
shall not be found wanting, that we shall not be found on the wrong 
side, that we shall not be found where criticism is, or allying ourselves 
with those who are trying to destroy God's work by trying to destroy 
our faith and our confidence in these men that we love as life itself. I 
bear you my testimony that these men are men of God, whom he has 
chosen and placed here, that we might find our way safely back into the 
kingdom of God under their supervision and direction. May God bless 
us to this end, I pray, in Jesus Christ's name, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I bring you greetings, my brethren and sisters, from ten thousand 
Latter-day Saints in the Northwestern States Mission. 

Next Saturday and Sunday from seven to ten hundred people will 
assemble in Portland in our annual Mutual Improvement contest work. 
On Sunday evening we will broadcast our Music Festival over the 
Columbia national network, connecting fifty stations from coast to coast. 

Never before in my life, and I have been attending these conferences 
for many years, have I felt the same inspiration and cooperation that I 
have during the sessions of this conference. As I stand before this 
microphone gazing into the faces of thousands of people before me, how 
I wish that television were perfected, so that the world could witness 
this great congregation of people — men before me and behind me who are 
revered by thousands of people as God's servants ; men who have served 
and are now serving their nation in offices of trust and responsibility — 
the governor of our state, and other men associated with him in thv. 
political field. Educators, presidents of colleges, and men from all 
branches of our industrial life are here. Then I look into the faces of 
the most queenly women in all the world. No purer women, no purer 
men can be found on God's footstool than are registered as members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Some weeks ago I listened to a program over the radio at which 
time the minister in his prayer prayed thus. "Oh God, come down and 
make thy reality known!" In a recent magazine an article appeared 
descriptive of the chaotic condition among the Christian churches. The 
writer said the thing that was needed now was for God to come down 
and say "Hello" to the people of the churches. 

I listened to the testimony of our beloved President who in most 
solemn declaration bore witness of the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and of the visit of the Father and the Son who appeared 
to the young man in person. The vision was not an hallucination, it was a 
reality. The Prophet Joseph for seven years was under the divine 
tutorship of holy men, prophets who had lived upon this earth. Under 
their tutorship he was schooled and prepared for his great mission of 
ushering in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. I marvel that the 
world is so blind to the sublime truths. 

I think of the father of our country, George Washington, the man 
to whom we all pay homage, leading the armies of our country, at Valley 
Forge, and later as President of these United States. In the Congres- 
sional Library at Washington there are some 2,'654 books treating more 
or less on his life, while here is a boy born in the humblest of circum- 
stances, uneducated in the colleges of learning, and yet in the archives 
of the Church are to be found some 20,000 volumes giving something 
of the life of Joseph Smith. Many of them however are books from the 
pens of his enemies. 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 125 

Who is this man Joseph Smith ? Who can understand him ? Only 
members of this Church can appreciate that he was and is a prophet of 
God, and we sing with heart and voice, as we did today : 

Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah ! 
Jesus anointed that prophet and seer ! 
Blessed to open the last dispensation, 
Kings shall extol him and nations revere ! 

This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

I rejoice exceedingly, my brethren and sisters, in the privilege of 
again attending a general conference of the Church, in the things that 
we have heard, the testimonies that have been borne, the doctrines and 
principles that have been enunciated. 

This morning I had an hour of infinite enjoyment. I have not 
been blessed with a very sensitive ear. I have not perhaps, therefore, as 
keen an appreciation of musical sounds as have some, but I sat here 
entranced with joy, peace, and comfort in my heart and my soul uplifted 
to think I live in a day and age when such a thing as that could be given 
unto us. Not alone the artistry of the message brought to us by the 
choir and the organ, but the spirit and the power and the vitality that 
accompanied it, bear testimony unto our hearts. I can echo the wish 
that has been here expressed that the world could have been here and 
heard. Much of the prejudice which we contend with now would be dis- 
sipated, because people would see for themselves ; but now they are not 
even willing to listen for fear they may be convinced of something con- 
trary to that which they have always heard. 

We have had a very severe winter in Canada, but milder weather has 
come now, and we are grateful for it. We have had considerable sick- 
ness at various times among our missionaries, but they are now all well 
and very grateful to our Heavenly Father for their health. There has 
been considerable disunity among members of the Church in the past, 
fault-finding and criticism, but much of that has disappeared for which 
we rejoice. 

We have but few missionaries. We had to withdraw from four of 
our districts. We hope the times will change and that more help will be 
given, that we might re-establish ourselves there and continue the work. 

I might say that up until the present time we have had one thousand 
per cent more baptisms this year than we had a year ago during the same 
period. That sounds big, but it is not so big as it sounds. At this time a 
year ago we were able to report but one baptism, and this year we have 
had ten thus far. I wish that we could realize a continuation of that kind 
of increase for the entire year. That is possibly beyond us, but I do pray 
that my brethren and sisters in the mission field, and that you all may 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



exercise your prayers to the end that our labors may be so fruitful there 
that we shall be able to draw the people away from the delusions in which 
they find themselves, and from their self-centered and satisfied feeling. 
One lady expressed it in this wise : "I do not want any of your tracts 
or any of your teachings. I do not think it is fair for us to read or 
listen to anything that will weaken our faith in our own church." When 
they thus set themselves against the truth, do not wish to listen to it, 
lest it might cause some sacrifice to accept it, of course they lose the 
blessing we offer unto them. It touches our hearts, but we can only go 
to others and seek to bring them the Gospel. We have joy in our labors. 
We thank God for the privilege of working in this cause and seeking 
to bring souls unto him, and in a humble way be his assistants in the 
accomplishment of his great and glorious work. 

I have a testimony of the truth and the divinity of this work. I 
obtained it fifty-eight years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, when I accepted 
baptism at the hands of one of our brethren who became a bishop of 
one of the wards in this city, and that testimony has never gone from me. 
I rejoice in it; I treasure it; I know nothing so great in my life as the 
possession of that testimony, and to be assured of the truth, to knov 
where we are going, and that only we ourselves can hinder our progress 
and our advancement, and, eventually, our joy and exaltation in the 
celestial kingdom of God. 

May God bless you and me and all of us who are his covenant people, 
in giving of our means, our talents, and our ability to God's work, that 
this work shall spread and that righteousness and truth may fill the 
whole earth, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

President of the California Mission 

I appreciate this great opportunity and I sense the responsibility. 
I have undergone great anxiety for three days, and now if I can have as 
faithful a prayer offered for me as I have been offering for those who 
have spoken during this conference, I shall be happy indeed. 

To come up here and bring good news from California is happiness. 
If there is any schism or division I have not discovered it. There seems 
to be peace, love, good-will, brotherly kindness in the hearts of the people. 

We have been favored recently with a visit from Elder George 
Albert Smith, and he has brought us a great refreshing. The people 
have turned out en masse to hear him ; strangers have attended. They 
have testified that they have been impressed and more than impressed. 
They have testified that they have been inspired. The friendliness of the 
people is made manifest unto us on every hand. 

We have been blessed with an increased number of missionaries. 
The investigators are more numerous than at any other time during my 
experience. Last year was the most favorable year according to the 
record, so far as baptisms are concerned, in the history of the mission. 
The expense of the missionaries was never so low as now. Through 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



127 



the goodness of the Saints we have been able to care for missionaries 
at an average cost of less than seventeen dollars per month. There is 
a great opportunity to serve. The people want us, they are seeking the 
truth. 

I should like perhaps to mention one incident that I think would be 
interesting to every soul in the Church. A few months ago we sent two 
Elders out into Westwood, up in the mountains in one of the lumber 
camps. We have had people there for years, some of our people, but 
we have never been able to get any foothold. Every foot of ground 
there is owned by the Red River Lumber Company, and every house 
and every shack. We were never able to rent a place where we could 
hold meetings. We sent two Elders there recently, Elder Richards and 
Elder Foulger, under District President DeVaugn Jones. They were 
instructed, "Go and visit our own people, be prayerful and humble, and 
see if we can overcome an adverse situation." We found our own 
people and we visited the resident manager of the Red River Lumber 
Company. There is a community church there, and we said, "May we 
not have the privilege of preaching the Gospel in that church ?" Finally 
that privilege was promised, provided we would be careful about what we 
should say. 

That was not exactly what we wanted. We wanted the opportunity 
first of teaching, training, and helping our own. We wanted the op- 
portunity of having a more humble place and having it where we could 
hold our meetings. Through the intercession of some faithful Saints 
a place was found. The man said : "What would you need ?" We told 
him. "What could you pay?" "The very lowest amount." 

- He finally said to our inquiring Saints, (Elder Young's family) 
"We have a hall for you. It is seated, there is a piano in it, it is heated, 
it is lighted; the janitorial work will be taken care of. Would ten 
dollars a month be too much for you ? We will give you three rooms in 
which to take care of your Sunday School." 

Of course we counted that a gift from God, we counted that an 
answer to prayer. 

When we assembled those Saints who had not been permitted to 
meet before, when they stood up and sang the hymns of Zion, when they 
prayed, when they listened to the words of truth, their hearts were melted 
and their joy was made almost complete. While visiting them recently 
we invited this resident manager to come to our meeting. We hardly 
dared hope that he would favor us with a visit, but to our great delight 
He and his wife took seats immediately in front of the stand, and the 
Elders discoursed under the inspiration of the Almighty. He sat there 
all attention. At the close of the meeting, as I approached him and held 
out my hand, he took me by both hands and said : "I have not only been 
interested, I have been blessed. Where do these Elders stay? Could 
some of them come and stay at our home?" 

We said to the two Elders that labored there, "You go ; you are 
the men who have done the pioneer work," and so they went. 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The next morning as the Elders came back rejoicing we said : "How 
did you sleep?" 

They answered, "We could hardly sleep, the beds were too soft. 
And he gave instructions to the butler to feed us anything that we 
should ask for." 

The mercy of the Lord ! He is going before us. He is being upon 
the right hand and upon the left. This is exemplified every day. Since 
that day we have not only held a Sunday School but we have organized 
a branch and we have baptized converts, and there is joy out in West- 
wood. 

I want to refer to this one incident which I think will be 
interesting to the people of this Church. One of Phineas Young's sons 
lives there, and he said in the evening : "Brother Hinckley, I wish you 
would come and stay at our home. I have something that I should like 
to have you read," and to my delight he pulled out ten letters written 
by Oliver Cowdery to Phineas Young during the time that Oliver 
Cowdery was out of the Church. The letters are dated from 1843 to 
1848. I sat up through the night. I have never had such a thrill before. 

Brother Young said : "I have never read them, the writing seems 
so old-fashioned that we cannot make them out." 

This to my mind seemed peculiar because the writing was clear, 
the paper was good, the ink had not run or faded with age. The paper 
was yellow, it was broken in the corners ; the paper had been folded and 
sealed with sealing wax. The address was on the outside with the 
statement, "postage paid." 

I could never describe to you the thrill that I had as I sat there and 
read those letters. I have read of Oliver Cowdery, I have shed tears 
when I thought of what the man had witnessed and what he had suffered, 
and then what it must have meant to have been excommunicated from 
the Church and to have been outside in the darkness. And so about two 
o'clock in the morning I said to one of the Elders, who had fallen asleep : 
"Wake up and listen to me while I read." 

If I may have time I should like to read this letter to you. It is 
dated Tiffin, Seneca County, Ohio, March 23, 1846, and reads as follows : 

Tiffin, Seneca County, Ohio 
March 23, 1846 

Dear Brother Phineas : 

Yours of the 5th and 9th, and mailed on the 11th, has just been received. I was 
not looking for a letter from you, nor did I expect, when one should be received, 
that it would contain what yours does. I mean that part relative to the second 
Eldership, and Counselorship, etc. 

Before the receipt of this, you will have received one from me, enclosed in 
another to brother Daniel. From which you will discover that your last letter was 
perused with the greatest satisfaction ; and that one received from brother Orson 
Hyde about the same time was either misunderstood, or its' spirit misconceived by 
me. But from your last I am fully satisfied, that no unjust imputation will be 
suffered to remain upon my character. And that I may not be misunderstood, let 
me here say that I have only sought, and only asked, that my Character might 
stand exonerated from those charges which imputed to me the crimes' of theft, 
forgery, etc. Those which all mv former associates knew to be false. I do not, 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



129 



I have never asked, to be excused, or exempted from an acknowledgment, of my 
actual fault or wrong — for of these there are many; which it was always my 
pleasure to confess. I have cherished a hope, and that one of my fondest, that I 
might leave such a character as those who might believe in my testimony, after I 
shall be called hence, might do so, not only f or the sake of the truth, but might not 
blush for the private character of the man who bore that testimony. I have been 
sensitive on this subject, I admit; but I ought to be so — you would be, under the 
circumstances, had you stood in the presence of John, with our departed Joseph, 
to receive the Lesser Priesthood — and in the presence of Peter, to receive the 
Greater, and look down through time, and witness the effects these two must 
produce, — you would feel what you have never felt, were wicked men conspiring 
to lessen the effects of your testimony on man, after you should have gone to your 
long length rest. But enough, enough, of this. I will here say that I cannot fully 
comprehend the purport of Brother Hyde's letter ; but from your last, in referring 
to a conversation by Brother Brigham, about the presidency, I am fully, doubly 
satisfied that all will be right, that my character will be fully vindicated. I write 
thus plainly because I do not intend to mention it again in any of my letters. Let 
the records show what you, Brother Brigham and Parley, say they shall and you 
will be furnished with weapons to use against your enemies hereafter to good 
effect. You say you are to have a meeting on the 6th of April. Brother Phineas, 
I could be with you and tell you about the 6th of April, 1830, when but six 
members only belonged to the Church and how we looked forward to a future, 
I should gladly, but I cannot — only in spirit — but in spirit I shall be with you. 
And then in assembled with [then are some words I could not clearly make out] 
those who are yet alive of that six — How many can you count? 

From my letter to you and brother Daniel, you will see that Brother Thurston 
left, much to my regret, without letting me see him again. I think if he were to 
send me the note that falls due the first of October, 1846, I could get the money 
on it, by giving a share — by this means I could be with you * * * than I know of 
in any other way. You will of course see him on the subject and write me on 
receipt of this. The situation of my family is such that it is not possible for me 
to come with them this spring; but I want to be prepared at the earliest moment. 
We are well as usual. I wrote in great haste. May the God of our fathers bless 
you and yours, and the Church as a body. Such is my prayer. 

I am yours in the New and Everlasting Covenant, 

Oliver Cowdery. 

You will never know the spirit that was mine. 

I stood in front of the monument on these grounds today and 
looked at the Witnesses. In my heart I prayed for the descendants of 
Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, all good men who 
suffered for the truth in the revelation of the everlasting Gospel, which 
has been restored through the mercy of God, and which it is our high 
privilege to proclaim to the world. 

It is fifty years ago today since I first took upon me the respon- 
sibility of the presidency of the deacons — fifty years of joy, fifty years 
of walking safely in the footsteps of the leaders of this Church. For 
fifty years I have been acquainted in a way with every President of the 
Church from Brigham Young to Heber J. Grant, and now with my hair 
white and my experience ripe I testify that the path of safety is in follow- 
ing those whom God has called and appointed to lead the way and to carry 
responsibility in this Church. I testify that they are called of him and 
that they lead by divine authority. The Lord says it is given unto the 
President to have the spirit and to be like unto Moses, a prophet, a seer, 
and a revelator, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



head of the Church. That is what we have, and is what we will always 
have in our leaders. God help us to be true to them, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 

President of the Western States Mission 

I am delighted, my brethren and sisters, to be here to represent the 
Western States Mission. I rejoice in the opportunity that has come to 
me to be called to this responsible position. I love it. It is wonderful. 

We have in our mission some of the noblest and finest Elders and 
lady missionaries ever sent out by the Church. Our work is progressing, 
our baptisms are reaching high numbers. I want to say that during this 
past month we have baptized forty-two souls. Our tithes for last month 
show an increase of 133% over the same period a year ago. 

We love our work, we bring you words of greeting. God has 
blessed our mission. It is a delightful place to be. We hope there will 
be many young men and young women come into our mission. We can 
teach them the Gospel, they will enjoy their labors, and I am sure that 
excellent results will follow. 

I was thrilled with the broadcast .this morning by the Choir, and 
wish to pay a tribute to them. Having been raised in the environment of 
music I can appreciate the wonderful work that they have done. Music 
mellows the heart, softens the soul, brightens the intellect, and increases 
one's interest in eternity. It develops love and brotherly interest, thaws 
out the iceberg soul, permits the tears to flow, and fills one's heart with a 
desire to serve God. 

I thank God that I am a member of this Church. It is marvelous and 
wonderful. I rejoice in the very delightful way the non-members of the 
Church receive us. Prejudice has gone, interest is to be 'found every- 
where. We find friends everywhere we go. The Lord is blessing our 
work. 

I know that the Gospel is true. I know that God lives. I know 
that Jesus is the Christ, and I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and 
the Western States Mission stands one hundred per cent behind the 
President of this Church in their desire to serve and to do their part as 
God directs them. 

May his peace and favor attend each and every one of us in our 
desire to serve him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very sorry that we have had to skip again five or six returned 
mission presidents who have not had an opportunity since their return to 
speak at a general conference. Notwithstanding that three of the General 
Authorities are away we have not been able to hear from all those whom 
we desired to address us. 

I have been pleased beyond expression with the very splendid

meetings we have had. Perhaps we should begin conference at least 
one day earlier ; or else, say, at 9 :45 and at 1 :45, and in this way get in 
an extra half hour each day; then perhaps we could get through and 
hear from all the brethren from whom we would like to hear. 

LAST CONFERENCE THE BEST 

It is a common phrase that our last conference is our best one; and 
I suppose the reason is that we have the proper spirit. Things have 
been so difficult financially during the past years that I believe there is 
a greater appetite on the part of the people spiritually than they had 
a year ago, and that accounts perhaps for saying that we have had a very 
fine conference, one of the best that I have attended since becoming 
the President of the Church. 

FAITH HOW DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED 

I am grateful indeed for the advancement of the Church, for the 
faith of the people. Faith is a gift of God, and faith comes to each and 
all of us who serve God and supplicate him for the guidance of his 
Spirit. There is no danger of any man or woman losing his or her faith 
in this Church if he or she is humble and prayerful and obedient to duty. 
I have never known of such an individual losing his faith. By doing 
our duty faith increases until it becomes perfect knowledge. 

It has been a source of great pleasure to me to listen to the testi- 
monies that have been borne here of an absolute knowledge of the divinity 
of the work in which we are engaged. 

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SELECTING MISSIONARIES 

I wish again to ask the presidents of stakes — I intended to do it 
last night, but forgot — before recommending a man for a mission to 
sit down with him and find out if he is ready to go and if he is capable 
of representing the Church in the mission field. We do not want any 
more missionaries to be sent into the world to be reformed. Do not 
forget this. We do not want bishops to listen to the pleadings of fathers 
and mothers to send us young men who perhaps will smoke before they 
get across the ocean. We want every president of a stake to sign his 
name at the bottom of a recommendation and write a few lines on the 
recommendation form or write a letter with every recommendation, say- 
ing that he has interviewed the person recommended and found him to 
be in every way worthy to go into the mission field. If they do not do 
this we will have to send the recommendation back to them. We want 
them to know by personal conversation, by sitting down and talking with 
the young man or the young woman, that he or she has a willingness 
to go on a mission. I am not asking that they shall have a testimony; 
but I want them to be clean, and I haven't the least doubt on earth, if they 
go out clean and with a desire to serve, that God will give them not only 
faith but a knowledge of the divinity of the work in which we are en- 
gaged.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BLESSES SAINTS 

I think that covers all that I want to say, except that wherein the 
power is given to me, with all my heart and soul, I bless the Latter-day 
Saints. I thank them from the bottom of my heart for their faith, and 
for their prayers in my behalf, and am grateful to have had their faith 
and prayers. I am stronger, and have more vitality, also have greater 
force, than I had thirty years ago when leaving to preside over the 
European Mission. I believe that all true, faithful, diligent Latter-day 
Saints have given to me the best that is in them, in supplicating God in 
my behalf, for his Spirit, for health, for vigor of body and of mind. 
I pray that God's blessings may be upon Israel and upon all honest men 
everywhere. I pray with all my heart that those who have made mistakes 
will repent; and by this we may know that they have repented — they 
will confess their sins and depart from them. 

God help them to do that, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
our Redeemer, Amen. 

The Choir sang an anthem, "The Lord Victorious." 
President Heber J. Grant pronounced the benediction. 
Conference adjourned for six months. 



The singing at the various sessions of the Conference was conducted 
by Anthony C. Lund, assisted by Albert J. Southwick, David E. Smith, 
and Charlotte O. Sackett. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank Wl Asper and Wade N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson 

Clerk of the Conference.

THE FALLING AWAY 

By B. H. ROBERTS 

This new work is a ringing challenge to Christendom and a frank 
: ndictment of the multifarious creeds that are an outgrowth of the dis- 
integrated Apostolic Church. It shows most conclusively and brilliant- 
1 that all the churches had departed from the true pattern of Christ 
and lost the authority completely, long before the New Dispensation 
was ushered in through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. 

Yet the motive of the author is not to tear down, but rather to 
build up; had there been no "falling away," the claim of the prophet 
of the New Dispensation would have been an imposture; if there was a 
"falling away," however, his claim is credible. It was to establish this 
fact sharply and conclusively that these radio addresses were given. 
All who heard Elder Roberts or who will read these published dis- 
courses, will agree that he has accomplished the end in a scholarly and 
convincing manner. 

Though most of the discourses deal with eras of apostasy and 
centuries of discord, the ultimate message of the book is one of hope 
and salvation for the world. The three discourses on the Restoration 
read like the happy outcome of an otherwise tragic story. You feel at 
the end that the author has performed a necessary but melancholy 
task, only that he might invest with true meaning the unique claim of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The Appendix of the new work is an answer to Catholic charges 
that the author had been unfair in his use of evidence and presentation 
of historic facts. His reply is given with enough zestful detail to 
leave the reader without a single doubt.

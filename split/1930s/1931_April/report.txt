ANNUAL 



CONFERENCE 

OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST

CA t&hrilling Story of 

CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 

r ur IF. RE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
LmmJ pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
1kS6£™ with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the Conference commenced at 10 o'clock, 
Saturday, April 4th, 1931. 

All the brethren of the iGeneral Authorities of the Church were 
present and seated on the stands, and the great Tabernacle auditorium 
and galleries were filled, the attendance being unusually large for a 
week-day session of Conference. 

President Heber J, Grant presided and announced the opening 
hymn, "Now let us Rejoice in the Day of Salvation," which was sung 
by the congregation. 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Wilford A. Beesley, 
President of the Salt Lake IStake. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "O Say, What Is Truth ?" 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I do not recall that at a first session of a General Conference held 
on a week day I have ever seen as large an attendance as we have here 
today. I rejoice in the interest of the Saints in our Annual and Semi-An- 
nual Conferences. It is a remarkable thing for people by the thousands 
to come from all parts of the United States, also from Canada and 
Mexico, to these meetings. It shows the interest, the faith and the love 
of the people for the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been revealed in our 
day. On behalf of the General Authorities of the Church I welcome 
you here. I earnestly and sincerely pray that while we are assembled to- 
gether we may be blessed of the Lord, that those who speak and pray and 
sing may do so under the inspiration that comes from our Heavenly 
Father. 

It has been customary for very many years to read to the people a 
statement of expenditures and statistical matters at our Annual Con- 
ferences. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

The expenditures by the Church for the year 1930 are as follows : 
Stake and Ward Purposes: 

There has been returned from the tithes to the Stakes and 
Wards for the construction of Ward and Stake meet- 
ing houses $ 887,678.43 

For Ward maintenance expense 590,792.34 

For Stake maintenance expense ' 271,983.42

for the erection of places of worship and other buildings 
in the missions $916,543.59 



I believe I am safe in saying that at no time in the history of the 
Church has there been so much expended in our Missions as during the 
past two or three years, including the year that has just closed. 
The grand total of these appropriations from the tithes 
and resources of the Church is $3,878,610.1° 

These funds have been taken from the tithes and Church invest- 
ments and returned by the Trustee-in-Trust to the Saints for the main- 
tenance and operation of the Stakes and Wards, for the maintenance and 
operation of Church schools and temples, for charities and mission 
activities. 

Other Charities: 

In addition to charities paid from the tithes as before named, 
there has also been disbursed the fast offerings, other 
charities and assistance rendered by the Relief Society in 
the sum of $464,404.39, which amount, added to the 
$203,091.41 paid from the tithes, makes the total charity 
assistance rendered by the Church $667,495.80 

There has been collected by the various Wards of the Church 

and paid to missionaries to assist in their maintenance. $100,685.08 

STATISTICS AND OTHER DATA COMPILED FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS FOR

Joseph M. Holt, president of the West Jordan Stake. 

I attended the funerals of these two Presidents and the tributes 
paid to them were of the most excellent character. Their labors were 
splendid and their families have our sympathy and our prayers that they 
may follow in the footsteps of these two splendid men. 
Bishops who have passed away : 

William T. Harkness of the Magna Ward, Oquirrh Stake. 

John L. Fish of Lakeside Ward, Snowflake Stake. 
Others who have passed away : 

Peter G. Johnston, one of the Church Auditing Committee for many 
years. 

Benjamin Goddard, formerly manager of the Bureau of Informa- 
tion from its inception until just prior to his death. 

George C. Smith, secretary for many years of the Tabernacle 
Choir. 

Zina Young Card, daughter of President Brigham Young, and 
active in Church work from her young girlhood days. 

Brigham Morris Young, son of Brigham Young, loyal and true 
all the days of his life to the Church and its interests and a worker in 
the Salt Lake Temple from the day it was dedicated until the time of 
his death. 

Evan Stephens, formerly director of the Tabernacle Choir, and one 
of the men tb whom we owe so much — to him and Brother George 
Careless, perhaps more than almost to any other men — for writing our 
beautiful hymns and for taking such a deep interest in all of our musical 
affairs. 

DECRIES PROPAGANDA 

I desire to bring to the attention of the members of the Church 
some very regrettable and most annoying circumstances. I have taken 
occasion in times past to denounce the conduct of persons both within 
and without the Church who have palpably sought to bring disgrace 
upon the Church and reproach to its leaders in the circulation of propa- 
ganda for and the unlawful practice of pretended "plural marriage." 
Notwithstanding the positive, unequivocal declarations which I have 
made from time to time on this subject, and in, spite of the vigorous and 
unvarying prosecution within the courts of the Church, from the tribu- 
nals of the bishops to the Council of the Twelve Apostles, of cases arising 
out of violations of the law of the Church forbidding absolutely the 
practice of plural marriage — notwithstanding all these efforts on the 
part of the authorities of the Church to suppress the unlawful practices 
and propaganda of these people, we find that there are still a number, 
relatively small we hope, who persist in teaching the doctrine and 
maligning the leaders of the Church. 

PUNISHED WHEN FOUND 

Wherever the Authorities of the Church have been able to locate 
such persons and secure sufficient definite evidence to warrant' their 
conviction, they have, without fear or favor, been dealt with and ex-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



communicated from the Church. This procedure is the limit of Church 
jurisdiction. We have been, however, and we are entirely willing and 
anxious too that such offenders against the law of the State should be 
dealt with and punished as the law provides. We have been and we 
are willing to give such legal assistance as we legitimately can in the 
criminal prosecution of such cases. We are willing to go to such limits 
not only because we regard it as our duty as citizens of the country to 
assist in the enforcement of the law and the suppression of pretended 
"plural marriages," but also because we wish to do everything humanly 
possible to make our attitude toward this matter so clear, definite, and 
unequivocal as to leave no possible doubt of it in the mind of any 
person. 

TO PROTECT THE UNWARY 

There are always to be found in any large group of people some 
who are uninformed, credulous, and easily susceptible to the persuasions 
of more forceful personalities. Such persons are often well-meaning 
and at heart very devoted to the Church. It is a matter of sorrow and 
deep regret to us that some such members of the Church have been 
inveigled by designing men and fanatics into the support and practice 
of unlawful relations. It is largely for the protection of such class of 
people within the Church and similarly minded converts to the Church 
that we feel the necessity of stressing this unpleasant subject so much. 

The machinations of the proponents of unlawful marriages are, of 
course, carried on largely in secret. The Church has no adequate way 
of thwarting their endeavors before much harm is often done; although 
the officers of the Church, from the highest to the least, are definitely 
instructed to be constantly "on the watch for such teaching and propa- 
gandists. We have hesitated somewhat to make public statements or 
denials to charges and false assertions published in literature sent out 
by these enemies of the Church and its administration, because we have 
felt that- added publicity to their pernicious statements would he gratify- 
ing to them and probably useless in stemming their activity. There is 
scarcely a man among the leading authorities who has not been defamed 
by them, both in print and speech. 

WIDELY CIRCULATED 

They have circulated their literature as widely as possible with 
their available means, even sending defamatory pamphlets to the mis- 
sionaries of the Church in their fields of labor, extending to Europe. 
We suppose that in sbme instances this material may fall into the hands 
of investigators, weak members of the Church, and others who already, 
by reason of misrepresentation, are prejudiced against us. There are 
some, undoubtedly, among these who give credence to that which they 
read, although, of course, we should be able to expect and we do ex- 
pect that no missionary of the Church would credit such false asser- 
tions. 

FALSE AND SLANDEROUS STATEMENTS 

These publications are not only slanderous of the leaders of the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

! 

Church but they are calculated to cast a blemish on the fair name of our 
State. Their authors are apparently without conscience as to the truth 
of their statements, seeking only to influence those who are uninformed 
and gullible. They have charged me and many of my brethren here with 
the commission of crime and have manufactured circumstances as fic- 
titious as the imagination may conceive. We have felt that it was 
beneath us to make reply to such false and malignant accusations. We 
have believed that neither the people of the Church nor those outside the 
Church with whom we live as neighbors and fellow citizens would expect 
us to answer. If there are any of our brothers or sisters or friends who 
feel that there are any circumstances which warrant an answer or 
defense on our part, we assure any such we shall be glad to satisfy them 
on their request. And when we say our friends we mean our friends, 
not those who write anonymous letters, or individuals who make false 
statements about us. 

Perhaps we are presumptuous, but we feel that our standing in the 
community as men of integrity and honor is a sufficient rebuttal to these 
infamous charges made against us. 

PRESIDENT WIDTSOE MALIGNED 

In most instances the misrepresentations and false accusations 
have been made by way of recital and innuendo, with an apparent effort 
to shield the authors and publishers from legal responsibility. In one 
recent instance, however, they have been bold enough to print a libelous 
attack on President John A. Widtsoe, supposedly because they knew 
of his expected presence here for conference. The circumstances recited 
are wholly fictitious and false, and are presented, undoubtedly, with the. 
purpose of creating prejudice against' him and injuring his work in 
Europe. We think that the high esteem in which Doctor Widtsoe is 
held, not only in the Church but in his State and as a national figure, 
makes unnecessary any reply to such calumny. However, if he desires 
he may have the facilities we can afford to protect himself and to prose- 
cute the defamers of his good name. 

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN 

Now, in conclusion, let me state again, as I have done many times 
before — and my statement is meant for every member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for our neighbors and friends who 
dwell in the communities where we live, and for the whole world — 
that the Church does not countenance, aid, abet, tolerate or sanction 
in any way, shape or form the contracting of so-called "plural mar- 
riages," but that on the contrary it absolutely forbids the members of the 
Church from entering into any such unlawful relations .or teaching or 
encouraging such practices, and that' it will continue in the future as it 
has done in the past to deal with and punish to the extent of its author- 
ity any persons who violate these injunctions. I do not know how to 
make it plainer or more forceful. If I did I would do so. 

As I read this I recall that the statement is made that the leaders 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Church can practice these things. So when this is published I will 
say that this applies to all the General Authorities of the Church and the 
members, for 'fear these falsifiers will start another falsehood. 

IT HE POSITION OF THE CHURCH 

I want the officers of our Church, our missionaries, all who in any 
manner represent us, to know beyond any doubt whatsoever that this is 
the straightforward, honest, unequivocal position of the Church, and I 
want them all to know that any person or persons who question this 
assertion cast reflection upon the honor and integrity of the men who 
stand at the head of the Church as its General Authorities, for this state- 
ment sets forth not only my own views and purposes, hut it is sustained 
in every detail, in letter and in spirit, by each and every member of the 
First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding 
Patriarch, the First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric, 
to whom it has been submitted and by whom it has been unanimously 
approved. 

And I wish to say that I want it understood that so far as God 
gives me power to give His word to the people, it is the word of the 
Lord. 

THE PEOPLES' WELFARE 

Now, I cannot do more. Of course the circumstances to which I 
have called attention are very provoking a,nd annoying to us. It is easy 
to become angry when we contemplate the harm and incalculable injury 
that some of these perverted, vicious men have perpetrated on the 
Church, but I do not speak in anger. I have in mind only the welfare 
and the progress of the great cause which we represent and love, and the 
people who are within the Church and those to whom we are carrying 
the Gospel. It hurts me to see the advancement of the work retarded 
by such regrettable activities within the Church itself. We may always 
expect to be assailed from without, but it seems to me we can reasonably 
hope that within the Church our solemn statements of fact and principle 
will be received at face value. 

It may be that among those who so malign the Church and its lead- 
ers are some who are conscientious in their endeavors. I am sorry that 
they are so simple and misguided as to permit themselves to be allied 
with those who, by reason of their propaganda and activity, are among 
the most malicious enemies of the Church. I pray that their eyes may be 
opened and their course set right. I pray also that all the people of the 
Church in all parts of the world may unite in a determined effort to 
abolish from the inside of the Church at least these insidious efforts and 
unlawful practices which are calculated to bring so much reproach upon 
us. 

DENIES CHURCH IN DEBT 

The same people who are publishing these slanderous statements 
have also said that the presiding officers of the Church have used the 
credit of the Church and involved it in debt to the extent of $23,000,- 
000.00, mortgaging its property to secure this indebtedness. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



The fact is that during my administration no part of the property 
of the Church has e'ver been mortgaged, and the Church itself is entirely 
free from debt. 

In proof of what I have said, I read the statement of the Church 
Auditing Committee, as follows : 

"April 4th, 1931. 

President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, 
Dear Brethren: 

It gives us pleasure )to state that our examination of the reports of the 
First Presidency's office, which covered the Presiding Bishop's department, 
disclosed the fact that the Church is entirely out of debt. 

The accounting system of the Church is modern and complete. 

Respectfully submitted, 
Henry H. Rolapp, 
O. W. Adams, 

Auditing Committee." 

CONTRARY TO LAW 

It is against the law of the land to enter into polygamy. In sec- 
tion 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we find the following : 

"For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land. 

"Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule him that judgeth, according 
to the counsel of his own will, or, in other words, him that counseleth or sitteth 
upon the judgment seat. 

"Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God 
hath no need to break the laws of the land." 

"Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is 
to reign, and sub'dues all enemies under his feet." 

STATEMENT SUSTAINED 

I would like all those in this congregation who feel to sustain tHs 
statement that I have read to you to manifest it as the Apostles and all 
of the General Authorities have done, by raising their right hands. 

(The congregation responded by raising their hands). 

I have never seen such a lot of hands held so high in my life. 

All those who are opposed to this statement will please raise their 
hands. 

(No hands were raised). 

Our enemies do not seem to be here. 

QUOTES PROPHET'S PRAYER 

The Prophet Joseph, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, in 
the prayer offered on that occasion, among other things said : 

"We ask thee, Holy Father, to confound and astonish, and to bring to 
shame and confusion, all those who have spread lying reports abroad, over the 
world, against thy servant or servants, if they will not repent, when the ever- 
lasting gospel shall be proclaimed in their ears; 

"And that all their works may be brought to naught, and be swept away 
by the hail, and by the judgments which thou wilt send upon them in thine 
anger, that there may be an end to lyings and slanders against thy people." 

We say Arnen to the prophet's prayer on that occasion. 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



READS FROM SCRIPTURES 

In my remarks today I desire to read from the holy scriptures some 
of the words of the Savior, and also from the revelations that have come 
to us in our day. 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 

"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit. 

"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into 
the fire. 

"Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them." 

What kind of fruits do the people to whom I have referred bring 
forth? I know of no more outrageous falsifying in my life than has been 
indulged in by these people. One man by the name of Lorin C. Wbolley 
said that Anthony W. Ivins and Heber J. Grant went to Los Angeles, 
that he followed them, that they went into a hotel and that Anthony W. 
Ivins married a plural wife to Heber J. Grant. 

Anthony W. Ivins and Heber J. Grant were never in a hotel together 
in Los Angeles. Heber J. Grant has never suggested to any human being 
during his entire administration as President of the Church that any- 
body should ever enter into plural marriage. On the contrary, every 
man or woman who has ever opened his or her mouth to him on this 
subject he has taught to the contrary. ^ 

"And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand, ; 

"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it." 

Those who have heard my counsel for at least twelve years, to say 
nothing of that of my predecessors and others, to obey the laws of the 
land and do not do it, are building their houses upon sand, and they are 
absolutely certain to fall. 

"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting 
him, and saying, 

"Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 

"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 

"This is the first and great commandment. 

"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 
"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." 

THE BARLOW CASE 

I call to mind that we tried a man by the name of Barlow for enter- 
ing into pretended plural marriage years ago. This man brought to us 
a letter purporting to come from Owen Woodruff, who was dead, 
telling him to send the person to Mexico, stating that Owen Woodruff 
married this girl to him. And there was not a word of truth in it. I 
went to his stenographer and confronted her, and she acknowledged that 



■ l_ 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 11 

she wrote the postscript on the letter herself. After Owen Woodruff 
had been dead for years a man whose name I will not mention because he 
repented of his sins, acknowledged that he performed that marriage. 

What do you think of such falsifiers talking about the leaders of 
the Church apostatizing and that they are the reformers? 

FAITH AND WORKS 

"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works? can faith 'save him? 

"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 

"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled ; 
notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; 
what doth it profit? 

"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 

"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy 
faith without thy iworks, and I 'will show thee my faith by my works. 

"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well, the devils also 
believe, and tremble. 

"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?" 

* * sfc 

"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead 
also." 

The Latter-day Saints are a people of great faith. But I regret 
exceedingly that there are many, among us who fail to ido the works of 
God. We fail to live up to the requirements of the Lord. I am sorry 
that there are scores and hundreds of people who are not living the 
Gospel as they should do and observing to be honest, conscientious tithe- 
payers, observers of the Word of Wisdom, and who are not doing the 
other things that devolve upon us. Let us reform. Let us show our 
love of our fellows by keeping the commandments of God and setting 
an example before them that shall be worthy of imitation in all respect's.

I recall that on the first of June, twelve years ago — we had not 
been able to hold a conference immediately following the death of our 
beloved and revered President Joseph F. Smith in November, because 
of an epidemic of disease that existed — I was sustained to be the Presi- 
dent of the Church, and I wish to quote a part of what I said at that 
time : 

"I feel humble beyond any language with which God has endowed me to 
express it, in standing here before you this morning occupying the position in 
which you have jjust voted to sustain me. I will ask no man to be more liberal 
with his means than I am with mine, in proportion to what he possesses, for 
the advancement of God's kingdom. I /will ask no man (to observe the Word 
of Wisdom any more closely than I will observe it. I will ask no iman to be more 
conscientious and prompt in the payment of his tithes and offerings than I will 
be. I will ask no man to be more ready and willing to come early and to go 
late, and to labor with full power of mind and body, than I will labor, always 
in humility. I hope and pray for the blessings of the Lord, acknowledging freely 
and frankly that without the Lord's blessing it will be an impossibility for me 
to make a success of the high calling whereunto I have been called. But like 
Nephi of old, I know that the Lord makes no requirements of the children of 
men, save he will prepare a way for them whereby they can accomplish the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thing which he has required. [With this knowledge in my heart I accept the 
great responsibility without fear of the consequences, knowing that God will 
sustain ime as he has sustained all of my predecessors who have joccupied 
this position, provided always that I shall labor in humility and diligence, ever 
seeking the guidance of the IHoly Spirit ; and this I shall endeavor to do." 

PLEDGE KEPT 

Twelve years have passed away. But I can honestly and conscien- 
tiously say to this large assembly that I have day by day, month by 
month, and year by year, lived up to that pledge which I made at that 
time. 

COUNSEL FROM THE LORD 

The Lord says: 

"Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and 
ye shall find me ; ask, and ye shall receive ; knock, and it shall be opened unto ypu. 

"Whatsoever ye ask the jFather in my name it shall be given unto you, that 
is expedient for you; 

"And if ye ask anything that is not expedient for you, it shall turn unto 
your condemnation." * * * 

"And as ye all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words 
of wisdom ; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom ; seek learning, 
even by study and also by faith." 

Again from the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"See that ye love one another; cease lo be covetous; learn to impart one 
to another as the gospel requires.* 

"Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; 
cease to sleep longer than is needful ; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not 
be weary; arise early, that your bodies land your minds may be invigorated. 

"And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with 
a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace." 

NOT NECESSARY TO BE COMMANDED 

I would like to read you the whole of this section known as Section- 
Fifty-eight, but I see that the time has practically expired, so I will 
read only a part of it. 

"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all .things ; for he 
that is compelled in all ithings, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; 
wherefore he receiveth no reward." 

I have met any number of people who have said the Word of 
Wisdom is not a command from the Lord, that it is not given 'by way 
of commandment. But the Word of Wisdom is the will of the Lord 
and the Lord says in the words that I have just read that it is not 
meet that we should be commanded in all things. If you love your 
neighbor as yourself, if you love 'God with all your heart, might, mind 
and strength, does he need to command? No. 

Listen to the following: 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness." 

Can you, by your own free will, accomplish righteousness in the 
world as well by failing to obey the will of the Lord as you can by 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



obeying it? I say No. One of the best ways in all the world to bring 
to pass much righteousness is to set an example as a conscientious, God- 
fearing Latter-day Saint, observing all of the requirements of the Lord. 

"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a 
commandment with a doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same 
is damned. ' 

"Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that 
obeys not my commandments? I 

"Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled? 

"I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing. 

"Then they say in their hearts : This is not the work of the Lord, for his 
promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, 
and not from above." 

I commend the entire section for your perusal. 

GRATEFUL FOR KNOWLEDGE 

I rejoice beyond all the power that God has given me to express 
my feelings for the knowledge that God is directing the affairs of the 
Church of Christ. I rejoice beyond all the ability that I have to express 
my feelings that he has given me a knowledge of the divine mission of 
our Savior, the Redeemer of the world, the Son of the living God. I 
am happy beyond expression to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the living God and an instrument in the hands of God of restoring 
again to the earth the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the power and priest- 
hood given to him by the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, who held 
that authority when they were here upon the earth. 

PRIESTHOOD PROPERLY EXERCISED 

I rejoice in knowing that the Lord through the inspiration of his 
Spirit has guided this people through all the changing scenes through 
which (we have had to go. I am thankful that even when the Prophet 
Joseph and others were in Liberty Jail one of the greatest of all the great 
revelations that have come to this people was given to him. I rejoice 
in knowing that all these charges of tyranny and oppression and of a 
dictatorial management of the Church are absolutely false. There is 
not a man of the General Authorities of the Church but' that desires to 
do — what? To exercise the priesthood exactly as the Lord says it 
should be exercised, and I will read the identical words. I really do not 
need to read them as I can repeat them from memory : 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, (by gentleness and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned ; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile— 

- "Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love towards him whom 
thou hast reproved, lest he 1 esteem thee to be his enemy; ' 

"That he may loiow that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly ; then shall thy confidence 
wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall 
distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
forever and ever." I 

The enemies of the prophet could imprison him, but' he had access to 
God Almighty and was inspired and blessed of him. 

May the Lord help every one of us who professes the name of 
Jesus Christ and testifies to the divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged to live it in honor, in virtue, in truth, is my prayer, that our 
example may proclaim by our works the truthfulness of it. I bear testi- 
mony before God to the divinity of this work, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER [SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I endorse fully and unequivocally, my brethren and sisters, every 
word that has been spoken by President Grant this morning. I sense 
the responsibility that rests upon me this morning in speaking to you, 
and trust that I may enjoy your confidence in that which I may say, 
that I may be led to speak those things that are true and helpful. 

EASTER CELEBRATION 

Throughout the Christian world, yesterday, today and tomorrow, 
the most important event in Christian history, and in the earth life of 
Him who is the source of Christianity, is being celebrated. That is 
the crucifixion and resurrection of the Savior. The Latter-day Saints 
are fully in accord with the spirit of this occasion. Not only that, but 
we understand also that this is, actually, the time of year when the 
Savior was born. We recognize that his life and teachings, and the 
doctrines which he declared, are divine. We accept him in every 
sense of the word as the Son of God. We realize that his atonement 
was necessary, that men might come unto salvation, receive forgiveness 
for the transgression of Adam, and be rescued from spiritual death, and 
have the opportunity of gaining salvation and exaltation in the presence 
of the Lord. 

RESURRECTION AND LIFE 

We acknowledge and believe fully in the resurrection from the 
dead— the literal resurrection of the body. The Savior was indeed the 
first fruits of the resurrection. Through him we also may be resur- 
rected. The time of our resurrection will depend upon our works here, 
and upon our faith and action. I would like to speak for a moment 
in regard to the life of Christ. "Though he were a Son," we are told, 
"yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered: and being 
made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



15 



that obey him." He passed through practically every experience that 
is possible for man to experience. He walked the path of humility. He 
said to the people: 

"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
"Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; For I am meek and lowly 
in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
"For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." 

POWER IN HUMILITY 

He taught them the spirit of humility, and exemplified the power 
therein. There is a vast' difference in meaning between humility and 
humiliation. Humiliation means shame. Humility does not mean lack 
of self-respect. It means strength and fortitude. It involves high 
moral courage. It leads to faith, trust in God, and to good works. 
It promotes gratitude. It overcomes vanity. It develops the strength 
to stand for right and truth. It involves clear thinking and sound 
judgment, because those who are humble are not likely to be misled by 
the trickeries of the world. It is evidenced by love of fellow-men. 
Humility manifests none of the elements of hypocrisy or self-righteous- 
ness. Remember the Savior's parable of the Pharisee and the publican. 
Humility is the opposite of highmindedness and pride. In it there is 
safety. Humility tends to keep people level-headed. Pride overbalances 
them. Pride tends to blind the eyes to the light and to close the heart 
against the truth. We are warned continually in the scriptures with 
regard to the dangers of pride, and advised of the benefits of humility. 
We have listened this morning to the testimony of President Grant, 
given at the time he accepted this position as the President of the 
Church, and of his pledge at that time to labor in humility and dili- 
gence for the welfare of this work. 

HUMILITY LEADS TO FAITH 

The very basis of this work is the spirit of humility, of striving to 
understand clearly the work of the Lord, and of righteous living. So 
when I say that humility leads to faith, I am sure that all of you who 
have had experience in the mission field realize that only those who 
are humble in their_ hearts are prepared to receive the truth and the 
light. Those who are proud have their hearts closed, their eyes blinded, 
and they are not willing to receive the Gospel. That of itself is 
evidence of the importance of so living in lowliness of heart that we 
can discern clearly between right and wrong. 

CONTRITENESS OF SPIRIT LEADS TO GOD 

Only those who are contrite in spirit can enter into the presence of 
God. As the prophet Isaiah declared: 

"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name 
is Holy : I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite 
and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart 
of the contrite ones." 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The Savior illustrated this fundamental requirement when he 
placed a child in the midst of his disciples, saying : "Whosoever, there- 
fore, shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the 
kingdom of heaven." On another occasion he declared : "Whosoever 
shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself 
shall be exalted." So humility is a means of triumph, paradoxical as 
that may sound. But that triumph is not' of the nature sought by 
those who are proud at heart. 

HUMILITY A DIVINE GIFT 

A day or two ago I read a newspaper item which told the ex- 
perience of an able and intelligent man, who in the pride of his heart, 
had committed a crime, and had been sent to prison. He had been in 
prison for some time, and he declared, in this newspaper statement, 
that he had finally found humility, and used this expression: "The 
gift of the gods is humility." Whatever his belief in a Divine Being 
may be, he expressed, at least, a true principle, that through humility 
we come to understanding, repentance, and peace of mind. 

i SPIRITUAL EFFECTS OF DEPRESSION 

The economic depression that we have suffered in the last year 
and a half has had a serious effect, not only upon the financial condition 
of the people of the world, but upon their spiritual attitude. Evidences 
are many that, as a result of this adversity, people are becoming more 
humble, are cultivating clearer thinking, and greater sanity. If the 
effect of these unfavorable economic conditions shall be to cause man- 
kind generally to resist arrogance and to promote human welfare, then 
it will have proven a benefit in disguise to that extent at least. Surely, if 
there is anything that is necessary in the world today it is that spirit 
expressed by the prophet Micah : 

"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good ; and what doth the Lord 
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with 
thy God?" 

The tendency of the natural man is toward pride, highmindedness 
and covetousness, a.s, stated by the President this morning. The Spirit 
of the Lord, which should guide men, is the spirit of humility, of faith, 
of clear thinking, of courage, of sound judgment, and oi the desire 
for truth and light. History of nations evidences the extent of their 
progress as a result of their attitude, whether it has been that of pride 
and haughtiness, or whether it has been that of right living. 

PRIDE LEADS TO DESTRUCTION - 

Humility is a state of mind, and not a condition, necessarily, of 
finances. It is too often true that people who gain financial prosperity 
are led away by pride of the heart and the desire for the things of 
this world. As I read history there has been no nation that has ever 
fallen because of prevailing humility among the people. But there 
are many instances of downfall due to pride. So long as nations have 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



17 



maintained a humble spirit they have been able to endure and to grow ; 
but whenever they have become steeped in pride, they have been led 
to destruction. When Mary, who was to become the mother of the 
Savior, came to Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, the latter 
was led to prophesy these words : 

"He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of 
low degree." 

The wise man, Solomon, declared: 

"When pride cometh, then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom. * * * 

"Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 

"Better is it to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the 
spoil with the proud. * * * 

"Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honor is 
humility. * * * ; 

"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life." 

DANGERS IN HIGH PLACES 

There is a tendency very often for men, when they are elected to 
positions in public office by the people, to consider that they possess some 
superior power as a result thereof. I arrj reminded of a statement 
made by former President Calvin Cooldige. He said : 

"It is difficult for men in high office to avoid the malady of self-delusion. 
They are always surrounded by worshippers. They are constantly, and for 
the most part sincerely, assured of their greatness. They live in an artificial 
atmosphere of adulation and exaltation, which sooner or later imperils their 
judgment. They are in grave danger of becoming careless and arrogant." 

Surely we should ourselves maintain, and we should influence 
not only all of the officers and members of this Church, but also, as 
far as possible, the people of this, the greatest nation upon the earth 
today, to cultivate and maintain a spirit of lowliness of heart, in the 
midst of prosperity. If the people of this country will but recognize 
the source of the blessings which they enjoy, realize that intelligence, 
judgment and ability are given them of God, and that they should 
use them for the welfare of mankind, and not solely for their own selfish 
aggrandizement, then this nation will continue to grow and prosper, 
and will be able to overcome the present unfavorable conditions. The 
result will be to promote greater equality among men, and finer con- 
sideration for one another. On the contrary, if the spirit of pride and 
vain ambition shall prevail throughout the country; then the future 
welfare and progress of this nation, or any rtation, under such conditions, 
will be seriously endangered. ! 

With the increase of temporal prosperity among us as a people in 
common with the rest of the country generally during the past few 
years, the continuance of faith and devotion to the Gospel by some of 
those who have been successful in financial affairs is jeopardized. 
Not that wealth necessarily means loss of faith ; but there is an un- 
conscious tendency in the midst of success to supplant humility of 
spirit with high-mindedness. We tend to forget our obligations to the 
Lord, and our need to obey the divine commandments and to impart 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of our m#ans to build up his work. This tendency becomes evident 
not only among parents, but also, and particularly so, among the 
children through indulgence shown them, through the luxuries which 
they enjoy, and through lack of instruction and obedience to divine 
principles. What is the result under such conditions? It follows that 
those who give way to feelings of pride lose the spirit of the Gospel 
and forfeit their enjoyment of spiritual gifts which would lead them 
on to righteousness. The Church suffers through their neglect, but 
they suffer far more through the loss of their spiritual standards. 

INSTANCES OF POWER THROUGH HUMILITY 

If time would permit, there are many instances that could be 
cited of men in high places who have shown their strength by their 
humility. The truly great are possessed of humility of heart. The 
Savior is the most outstanding example. Lowly as a child, strong in 
courage, fearless in declaring the truth, determined to fulfil his respon- 
sible mission, confident of his position, acknowledged by discerning 
men for his capacity, he exemplified fully the power of humility. His 
apostles showed the same spirit. Notwithstanding they were endowed 
with power from on high, yet were they indeed the servants of the 
people. In these days, in the affairs of this nation, the two most out- 
standing characters, Washington and Lincoln, demonstrated this same 
spirit. In the Church, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and every one of his 
successors, as well as the other Authorities of the Church generally, 
have been possessed of that spirit of humility in the midst of their 
great responsibilities. 

THE SPIRIT OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

We have heard from President Grant this morning the recital of a 
part of Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants with regard to the 
spirit to be exercised by those who bear the priesthood. Let me repeat 
a portion of it : 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors' of men. * * * 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by (persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned ; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge." 

The spirit of the priesthood is indeed the spirit of humility, of faith, 
of courage, of diligence, of confidence, of determination, of persistence 
for the right and the truth, and of consideration for our fellow men. 

I desire that the Lord may help us all so to live as to maintain this 
spirit, that even though we may enjoy prosperity and success, we may 
recognize the fact that these things come to us through the blessings of 
the Lord and that we should impart of our metans for the cause of right- 
eousness. If we have the spirit of humility we shall recognize the 
importance of giving of our means and our time for this cause, which 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 19 

makes for the welfare, the progress, and the salvation of mankind 
generally. 

May we (all strive continually "to do justly, to love mercy, and 
to walk humbly" with the Lord, I earnestly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, this is a great gathering of the Latter-day 
Saints for religious instruction, and it is to be expected that we will 
here be taught the true principles of religion. Let me say that religion 
is a serious and solemn thing — serious for the reason that it involves the 
question of salvation, individual and general salvation, and this, I 
take it, is an extremely important matter. 

god's greatest gift 

The Lord spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith, upon one occasion 
— you will find it recorded in a revelation in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, Section 6, the thirteenth paragraph — these very impressive words : 

"If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be 
saved in the kingdom <of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; 
for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation." 

So we see from this that salvation is something that is greatly to 
be desired. 

Permit me also, brethren and sisters, to quote a very significant 
passage from the Book of Mormon, namely : 

"Adam fell that men might be, and men are that they might have joy." 

WHAT SALVATION IS AND HOW OBTAINED 

I think that it is apparent to all that no man could have permanent 
joy without salvation. Joseph Smith, the Prophet, defined salvation, 
in brief, in the following comprehensive language: 

"Salvation is nothing more nor less than to triumph over all our enemies 
■ and put them under our feet, and when we have power to put all enemies under 
our feet in this world, and a knowledge to triumph over all evil spirits in the 
world to come, then are we saved, as in the case of IJesus, who was to reign 
until he had put all enemies under his feet, death being the last enemy." 

It would seem, therefore, that knowledge is a vital factor in the 
matter of salvation, for every one who does not obtain knowledge 
sufficient to be saved, will be condemned. The principle of knowledge 
is given through Jesus Christ. It is impossible for a man to be saved 
~ in ignorance. 1 

■ Salvation comes to the children of men through the atonement 
• made by our Savior, (the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood 
cleanses from all sin, and redeems and saves fallen man in the presence 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of God, always upon the condition of repentance and submission to 
the .will of God. 

THE REWARD OF THE FAITHFUL 

The will of God is set forth in great simplicity, clearness and 
power in the standard works of the Church, the Bible, the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. 

Speaking of those who attain to the highest rewards in the 
kingdom of heaven, the Lord said, in a revelation given to Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, and Sidney Rigdon, dated February 16th, 1832, 
that which follows : 

"And again, we bear record — for we saw and heard, and this is the testimony 
of the gospel of Christ, concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection 
of the just— 

"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his 
name and were baptized after the manner of 'his burial, being buried in the 
water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has 
given — I , ; •' 

"That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed 
from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands 
of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power. 

"And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, 
which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true. 

"They are they who are the church of the first born" — or in other words, 
the Church of Jesus Christ, for he was the first born: 

"They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things — 

"They are they (who are priests and kings, who have received of his 
fulness, and of his glory." 

These words correspond, in spirit and doctrine, with the teachings 
of the Savior and his apostles in the meridian of time. It would be 
well if the Latter-day Saints would give heed to these words, and it 
would be well if the world at large, the children of men generally, 
would give strict heed to these words, because in rendering obedience 
to the will of God they will find salvation. 

TESTIMONY 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, solemnly, that I do know 
that this is the true Church of God ; that Jesus was the Christ ; that 
Joseph Smith was his prophet ; and that it was given to Joseph Smith 
to stand at the head of this last dispensation, the dispensation of the 
fulness of times. I testify to you that whatever authority of God is 
resting down upon this people, has come to them and to us from 
the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Hence I do certainly 
revere his memory, and I regard him as a great man and a great- 
prophet. We know — at least, we believe with all our souls — that Joseph 
Smith now mingles with the Gods in the spirit world, and, with his 
brethren there, is planning for the salvation of the people. 

This is the testimony I bear in all humility, and I do it in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



21 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles . 

The burden of my thought today is that of gratitude. My heart 
is mellowed and deeply touched by the great blessings which I enjoy. 

GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS 

I am thankful for the privilege which I now have to be once again 
in the councils of my brethren; to be associated in general conference 
with the Church ; to stand where I can look into the faces of men whom 
I have come to love and honor and respect. I cannot contemplate my 
membership in the Church, the testimony of the divine authenticity 
of the work in which we are engaged, the high privileges which have 
come to me, to labor in the advancement of the great cause, these 
blessed associations with my brethren in the priesthood, without render- 
ing to God, my Father, the gratitude and thanks of my heart. 

I am grateful for the kindness which on every hand I have met, at 
the hands of my brethren and my sisters. God has been good to me, and 
I now thank you, my brethren in the holy priesthood and my sisters in 
the Church, for your kindness and consideration. 

JOY THAT PASSES UNDERSTANDING ,1 

I am glad once again to be able to engage in the activities of the 
Church. I want to let my voice be heard in proclamation of the holy 
Gospel. I want to bear my testimony to all mankind that God's work 
is established, and that, within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints are to be found the principles of eternal life, the satisfactions 
that are enduring and the joy that passes understanding. 

I have had some time for contemplation and reflection. I have 
had opportunity of introspection and the analysis of my thoughts and 
feelings, and I have definitely reached the conclusion that there is no 
happiness for me except in the philosophy and high conceptions which 
the Gospel of Christ brings^ to me. I enjoy the pleasant things of life. 
I enjoy and appreciate the beauty of the earth and that which it pro- 
vides; but I prize above all these a contentment of mind, a peace of 
heart, brought to me in my testimony of the truth. I know that 
God lives. I know that my pod is my Father — more than a mere 
principle; more than an irresistible, dominating force in nature.. He 
is my eternal parent. Il am his child. My spirit was begotten of 
him. I know that the Savior of this world is the jSon of the living 
God. His existence is a reality to me. The example and the teachings 
of his earthly life constitute the ideals to which I aspire. I ask for 
no higher nor more comprehensive philosophy. 

THE INSPIRED OF GOD, 

I know that the Prophet Joseph Smith was divinely called. I 
know that his mission in life was to restore the everlasting Gospel, and 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I believe in the revelations which God, in his mercy, gave to the Church 
and to mankind, through him. I honor the name of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I feel that no greater and higher honor could come to 
me than to win some day, when my ministry shall have been completed, 
his approval for my labors, because I look upon him as the earthly head 
of the kingdom, the beginner of it, the inspired of God, to receive the 
initial revelations for the restoration of the Gospel. I prize my knowl- 
edge of him, as 1 prize my knowledge of the very Lord of the universe. 
And all the men who in proper order have succeeded him are prophets 
of the living God. Their place in the kingdom has been won and 
established. 

It is so with our present prophet, standing at the head of the 
Church today. We honor and respect and love him for his de- 
votion to the work of God, and for his integrity, his absolute 
integrity to the Lord, to the work, to the people, and to the world. 
I cannot understand how the word of Heber J. Grant can be questioned 
by any living person who knows his life and his record. No more 
honest, aggressively honest man have I ever known, and our confidence 
in his word and in his honor should be supreme. 

CONSIDERATION FOR ONE ANOTHER 

I am grateful for the kindness that the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
brings. All the words of our Savior are kind and considerate. The 
very plan of life and salvation is of the essence of charity and kindness 
and love. There is no compulsion, and one of the most grievous errors, 
in my judgment, into which the creeds and sects of religion have 
almost universally fallen is that of dogmatism, and such rigorous ritual 
as to deprive their proponents of these elements of kindness, and mercy, 
and tolerance, and consideration. Every man is an individual. He 
is entitled to be treated as a separate entity. Into his human tabernacle 
has come an individual intelligence of eternal life and duration, and 
I can conceive of no higher principle, no more salutary conception than 
that of the recognition of the individual differences of men and of 
women. Of these the Gospel, when properly understood and interpreted, 
takes note, and every man, in his place and circumstances, is given 
adequate and individual consideration. We are not all expected to be 
cast in one mould. We are as different in our thoughts and thinking, 
in our capacities and abilities, in our receptiveness, as we are in ap- 
pearance. But the Gospel makes allowance for all of these. It gives 
to each one the opportunity of activity as his capacities and abilities 
may warrant, and it brings to each one a tolerance and compassion 
commensurate with the weaknesses and frailties of each individual. 

THE FRUITION OF GOD'S PURPOSES 

We are not perfect. We make no such pretensions, but we" are 
striving to do good. We are striving for betterment and progression, 
and we are offering to the world the most progressive of all the phil- 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 23 



osophies and programs which have been offered for the advancement 
and improvement of individuals, as well as nations and groups. 

I believe that God is blessing this great work. I believe that 
faster, perhaps, than we know, there is being brought to fruition the 
great purposes which he has announced for the human race. I see 
on every hand the evidences and the testimonies which we are told are 
to follow the testimonies of his chosen witnesses. We do not know 
how soon the ultimate consummation of his work will be effected, 
but we do iknow that we are moving forward, and it is ever my 
hope that all of us may be in the line of progress, that our ser- 
vice may ever be at the disposal of those who preside over us, and 
of the great cause. |I feel that as every man gives his best to this 
high endeavor, he will grow in stature; he will grow in goodness; 
he will grow in love of God and love of the work. 

I desire to give my best. I desire to unite with you in an effort 
to preach the true conception of the Christian doctrine. I desire to 
serve my God to the best of my meager ability. And now I praise 
his holy name for his great and glorious work, for these high concep- 
tions that he has given to us to feed our very souls, to enliven us with 
love and reverence and worship, and the desire for goodness. 

THE SUPREME CHARITY 

I apprehend that the adversary of truth is at work in the world. 
I believe that he is touching and influencing the lives of many men, 
and that their conduct is inimical to the progress of our work, and 
yet I almost hesitate to call them enemies. After all, mankind are of 
one great brotherhood, some weaker than others, and it would seem 
some are vicious and malicious, and intentionally do great harm. 
Thank God I am not the judge of my brother and my sister. I am 
persuaded sometimes to believe with him who says that the supreme 
charity in all this world is to judge not, but to leave the judgment 
of our fellow men in the hands of him who is the great and just 
judge of all. As I desire mercy for myself, I plead for mercy for 
all mankind. "God forgive them. They know not what they do." 

I pray that the spirit of love and tolerance and mercy, which 
the Gospel brings, may ever abide in our hearts, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

The hymn, "Redeemer of Israel," was sung by the congregation. 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Anthon E. Anderson, 
President of the Logan Stake. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock p. m., with President Heber J.. Grant presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "How Firm a Foundation, Ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Thomas A. King, Presi- 
dent of the Garfield Stake. 

The hymn, "Prayer Is the Soul's Sincere Desire," was sung by the 
congregation. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I want to thank my Heavenly Father for the privilege of meeting 
with you this day. In the first place I want to endorse with all my heart 
and soul the remarks that have been made during the morning sesssion. 
I think they were mo^t timely and I wish to say to the people of the 
Church, no matter where they may live, these things apply to our every 
day life and if adhered to will make better men and better women of us. 

NOT ASHAMED OF THE CHURCH 

The examples that we set wherever we go are but one way of 
preaching the (Gospel of Jesus Christ. I have never been ashamed to 
acknowledge that I am a Mormon, if you please, a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in so doing I cannot 
recall one instance in my life when it has redounded to my disadvantage. 
When I see, as I have seen in times past, members of ' the Church 
shrinking in certain society or associations from letting people know 
that they are members of the Church of Jesus Christ, I have only 
pity for them. If the principles of the Gospel were lived by every 
man who professes to be a Latter-day Saint we would be the ideal 
people of the world, and 'I believe that we are even under present 
conditions. 

PROHIBITIONISTS 

Do we believe in prohibition ? T cannot but say, without a question 
of doubt, that there are a greater number of Latter-day Saints who 
not only believe it but practice it than in any other community of like 
number or any other place in all the world. It means so much to us 
and the world, and we profess so much for those who live it. I hope 
and trust that it will grow in the hearts of the people until every man 
bearing the priesthood of the living God dan say, "I am a prohibitionist. 
I am proud of it." Acknowledge it., I testify to you that there has 
never been a place where I have been present, in this country or in 
foreign lands, where it has mortified me in the least degree to acknowl-

edge it by word or action — -I not only profess to be a prohibitionist, 
but that I live that law and have done so all my life, thanks to that 
mother God gave me. 1 

ingersoll's views regarding alcohol 

There has been a great deal of talk lately to the effect that the 
prohibition law [should be repealed. iWould it be better for the world ? 
I do not believe so. No one can claim that Robert G. Ingersoll was a 
fanatic religiously, and I know of no one who has expressed himself 
upon the curse of alcohol stronger than has Robert G. Ingersoll. I 
would that the whole world would study what he said is the result of 
its use. And while this question is before the nation, if you please, 
and many I find, even among our people, believe it would be best to 
have the prohibition law repealed, I want to call your attention to 
what Robert Ingersoll said regarding alcohol : 

"I am aware that there is prejudice against any man engaged in the 
manufacture of alcohol. I believe that from the time it issues from the coiled 
and poisonous worm in the distillery until it empties into the hell of death, 
dishonor and crime it demoralizes everything that touches it from its source to 
its end. 

"I do not believe that any one can contemplate the object without preju- 
dice against the liquor crime. All we have to do gentlemen, is to think of the 
wrecks on either bank of the stream of death, of the suicides, of the insanity, of 
the poverty, of the ignorance, of the destitution, of the little children tugging at ' 
the faded and withered breasts of weeping and despairing mothers, of the wives 
asking for bread, of the men of genius it has wrecked, and man struggling 
with imaginery serpents, I believe every thoughtful man is prejudiced against 
this damned stuff that is called alcohol! 

"Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength and 
age in its weakness. It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting mother, 
extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal love, blots out filial attachments, 
blights parental hope, and brings down mourning age in sorrow to the grave. 
It produces weakness, not strength ; sickness, not health ; death, not life. It 
makes wives widows, children orphans, fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and 
beggars. It feeds rheumatism, nurses gout, invites cholera, imparts pestilence 
and embraces consumption. 

"It covers the land with idleness, misery and crime. It fills pur jails, 
almshouses and asylums. It engenders controversy, fosters quarrels and cherishes 
riots. It crowds our penitentiaries and furnishes victims for the scaffold. It 
is the life blood of the gambler, the element of the burglar, the prop of the* 
highwayman and the support of the midnight incendiary. 

"It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems the blasphemer, it 
violates obligations, reverences fraud and honors infamy. It defames benevo- 
lence, hates love, scorns virtue, slanders innocence. 

"It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring, helps the husband 
to massacre his wife, and the children to grind the paricidal ax. It burns up men, 
consumes women, detests life, curses God and despises heaven. It suborns 
witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles the jury box and stains the judicial ermine. 
It degrades the citizen, debases the legislature, dishonors the statesman and 
disarms the patriot. 

"It brings shame — not honor, terror — not safety, despair — not hope, misery — 
not happiness ; and with the malevolence of a fiend it calmly surveys its frightful 
desolation and unsatiated with havoc, it poisons felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, 
blights confidence, slays reputations and wipes out national honor — then curses 
the world and laughs at its ruin." i 
Is there anyone who can deny these statements? What more 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



trouble and sorrow could come to a mother or a father, a sister or a 
brother, than to have one of their loved ones addicted to the alcoholic 
curse? What right thinking person can believe it should be sanctioned 
by law ? No, God grant that it shall never come to our fair America 
again. i 

I do not say that the present administration of the law is perfect. 
I do not say that it has been enforced to the length it could be. But 
I do say and I do claim that it is a thousand times better than if we 
had today the open saloon, the hell-holes of Satan himself. 

EASTERN STATES MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

There are so many questions of vital importance, my brethren and 
sisters, that could be spoken of and which have been referred to by 
those who have addressed this Conference. If I do trespass a moment 
I want to make reference to the Eastern States Mission, and acknowl- 
edge the splendid work accomplished, by Brother James H. Moyle, 
the president of that Mission. He has made it possible to reach not 
only the few that come to church, but also the thousands who listen 
to our Elders' sermons by radio. The last two nights I have read the 
speeches that have "been delivered over the radio in the Eastern States 
Mission by our Elders. Brother Moyle tells me that the radio speeches 
do not cost the Mission a cent, and I have not the least doubt that they 
have reached tens of thousands of people who had never heard of 
Mormonism or had had one principle of our Gospel explained to them 
by a member of the Church., He informs me that almost all of these 
speeches have been prepared by young missionaries themselves. Many 
of them are masterpieces. It would do this great congregation and 
all the thousands who are listening in over the radio a great deal of good 
to hear them delivered from this stand. 

GOD AT THE HELM 

This work is growing. The God of heaven is at the helm. He 
has never made one prediction through his prophets in any age of the 
world nor in this day and dispensation that will not be literally ful- 
. filled. I know it as I know that I live. God grant his blessings unto 
the President of the Church, the General Authorities of the Church, the 
organizations of the priesthood, and all the people of the Church. 
Remember, brethren and sisters, you belong to the most remarkable or- 
ganization in all the world. God give us power and strength and the 
determination to do our part to bring about the purposes of God in 
establishing His Church in this day and generation, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

About 420, probably 421 of our present era, as we reckon the 
years, Moroni, an ancient Nephite prophet, the last of a long line, 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 27 

closed the record of his people, and left the seal of his testimony 
upon all that had been inscribed upon the metallic plates which were 
made to receive the account of the Lord's dealings with that people, 
from the time they had been led from Jerusalem, across the deep, 
to this American continent. I pray you heed these words of his : 

"And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, 
for they are many ; and they come from the same God. And there are different 
ways that these gifts are administered ; but it is the same God who worketh all 
in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, 
to profit them. 

"For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may teach the 
word of wisdom ; 

"And to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same 
Spirit ; 

"And to another, exceeding great faith; and to another, the gifts of healing 
by the same Spirit; 

"And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles ; 
"And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things ; 
"And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits; 
"And again, to another, all kinds of tongues ; 

"And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of divers kinds 
of tongues. 

"And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto 
every man severally, according as he will. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every 
good gift cometh of Christ. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he 
is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which 
I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long 
as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children- of men." 

THE EVIL GIFT 

And now I pass over several paragraphs of comment upon what 
has gone before, and read you another admonition from this ancient 
revelator : 

"And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay 
hold upon every good gift, and touch hot the evil gift, nor the unclean thing." 

A very strong contrast is here drawn. The principal gifts of the 
Spirit are listed in other scriptures, in the Bible, in the volume of 
latter-day revelation, the Doctrine and Covenants ; but the enumeration 
I have read to you is perhaps as comprehensive as any. The prophet 
plainly proclaims the fact that these are characteristic of the Church 
of Christ. Miracles, as the manifestations of such gifts are sometimes 
called, will not be done away as long as men are receptive to the 
operations of the Spirit of the Lord, as long as men are willing to re- 
ceive and to heed. 

But the admonishment is : "Touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean 
thing." What is meant by that ? Satan from the first has been a great 
imitator ; he is an experienced strategist. Never has the Lord set his 
hand to do a specific thing for the good of his people upon the earth, 
of outstanding feature, but that Satan has attempted to imitate it in 
some degree. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FROM GOD OR FROM SATAN? 

The Lord manifested himself to Moses, and talked to the man 
face to face. Moses records the fact, and adds that he could not have 
looked upon the Lord with his physical eyes, but that the glory of the 
Lord was upon him, and he was able to see with his spiritual eyes. 

Then came Satan, the audacious, the father of lies, and represented 
himself as being the son of God in the distinctive sense. Moses was 
able to discern and perceive. 

"And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said : Who art 
thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; 
and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee? 

"For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come 
upon me, and I were strengthened before him. But I can look upon thee 
in the natural man. Is it not so surely?" 

Oh, that we all had such power of discernment. That is a gift 
of the Spirit, to which we are entitled and we will have it as we live 
for it. With that gift we shall be free, to a great extent, from the 
deception that otherwise might lead us astray. 

As the Lord gives revelations, so does Satan, each in his way. 
'As the Lord has Irevelators upon the earth, so has Satan, and he is 
operating upon those men by his power, and they are receiving revela- 
tions, manifestations, that are just as truly of the devil as was his 
manifestation to Moses, to which I have referred. 

BEWARE OF DECEPTION 

We need the power of discernment. We need the inspiration of 
the Lord, that we may know the spirits with whom we have to deal, and 
recognize those who are speaking and acting under the influence of 
heaven, and those who are the emissaries of hell. Many have been 
led away in this Church. Go back to 1830. In September of that 
year, a few months only after the Church had been organized, Satan 
was at work, and men were receiving revelations which were put forth 
to offset those that were given to the Church through the Lord's chosen 
revelator, the Prophet Joseph Smith. He had been instrumental in 
translating the ancient records, and he had been given the aid of the 
Urim and Thummim. Hiram Page found a peculiar stone, and used 
that, as the devil seems to have influenced him, until the Lord had to 
speak and declare that that which Hiram Page had given unto the 
people was not of him, and that when he had revelations to give to 
the Church he would give them through the man who was sustained 
as the revelator at the head of the Church, and not through somebody 
else. Read Doctrine and (Covenants, section 28. 

Nevertheless the Lord makes plain in the scriptures of these days 
that his wondrous gifts, the gifts of the Spirit, can be possessed by 
those who live for them and they will be given severally, according as 
the Lord will, and he wills to give them unto those who will use them 
rightly, and not unto those who would dishonor them. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



29 



FALSE PROPHETS 

The Lord does not work miracles to satisfy idle curiosity or to 
gratify the lust of the evil-doer. When you hear 3 if hear you should, 
of men who are receiving revelations concerning the conduct of this 
Church, and those men are not such as you have sustained by the 
uplifted hand before the Lord as your representatives with the Lord, and 
as his prophets and revelators unto you, you may know that those 
men are not speaking by the power of God. 

Now, do not be deceived. If men come to you and tell you that 
they have received manifestations and revelations telling of great de- 
velopments that are to come, beware! So live that you may have 
the power of discernment. When they tell you that it has been made 
known to them that great wealth is to be taken out of the hills, under 
their direction ; that they are to bring it forth with the prime purpose 
of using that wealth for the building up of the Church, for the erection 
of a great temple, toward which eventuality the eyes of the Latter-day 
Saints are turned, you may know that they are not of God. No temple 
will ever be built as the result of the gifts of a rich man, or of a few 
rich men. In building temples the Lord requires a specific kind of 
money. It must be sanctified money. It must be the money of sacrifice, 
and he needs the pennies of the faithful poor as much as the .gold pieces 
of the rich. 

We may all have part in building the great temple to which reference 
'is often made, as we have all had the privilege of taking part in build- 
ing the temples that have already been erected. 

SPURIOUS IMITATIONS 

Satan has tried to appear as an angel of light in earlier dispensa- 
tions. He is doing so today. John the Revelator warned the people 
of this very day in which we live. He wrote for our warning of what 
would take place. |He saw evil powers, and he calls them the spirits of 
devils, working miracles and deceiving the people. It was so in olden time. 
While the Lord was speaking through Isaiah and the other great 
prophets of pre-meridian time, Satan "Was at work with his witches 
and wizards, with his soothsayers, giving spurious messages and trying 
to lead the people astray. 

When the Christ came in person manifesting his inherent power 
over men and evil spirits, [when he cast out unclean spirits that 
were afflicting men, there arose many who undertook to exorcise 
the demons, and to imitate the work of Christ so far as was pos- 
sible. 'And (when the Gospel was again brought to earth, and the 
Priesthood restored in (this, the last dispensation, there was a great 
revival and increase in the manifestations called spiritualistic phenomena, 
in the effort to put something forth that looked like the original and 
the genuine, and so lead people astray. 

Oh, ye Latter-day Saints, ye men of mighty testimony, ye women 
of wondrous assurance, shall you, shall we, forget what the Lord has 
given us by way of certain knowledge, and be led away by false 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lights, by those who are receiving spurious revelations, as they call 
them, for guidance? 

SATAN A LIVING PERSONAGE 

Now, I know that it is not quite in accord with the advanced 
thought of the day, according to certain cults, to believe that there 
is a devil, a personage, a reality. Many who pose as super-thinkers 
seek to dismiss, with the old ideas, the old stories, fables they call 
them, that form the bulk of the very word of God recorded as sacred 
writ, the fact of Satan's existence. 

But there is a personage known as Satan. Before he was cast 
out from heaven he was called Lucifer. He is just as truly a personage 
as are you or am f, though he is not embodied. )He js in that un- 
embodied state in which we existed prior to our birth into the flesh. And 
we read, as the Revelator tells us, and as Jude attests, that he was cast 
out from heaven because of his rebellion, and all his angels or followers 
were cast out with him ; numbering a third of the spirit-hosts of that 
particular class in heaven. So they were many, and they are many. 

In the land of the Gergesenes Christ freed a man who was 
grievously afflicted by evil powers ; but first he called upon the demon 
to give his name, and the spirit answered, through the mouth of the 
man: "My name is Legion, for we are many." If we could form any 
estimate of the number of a third of the hosts of heaven at the time 
spoken of by the Revelator, and compare such with the number of 
people living upon the earth at any one time, we would see that the 
great general (in command of them all, Satan, can assign a legion to 
every one of us, and to every human being on the face of the earth, 
to deceive and lead the soul astray, if it be possible. 

Satan foresaw what would come to pass, and the prophet Nephi 
realized fully the claims that would be set up in the last days, these 
days. Read what goes before in the twenty-eighth chapter of Second 
Nephi, before that which I shall read to you, and you will see that 
the prophet is referring to the time in which we Jive. He tells us that 
it will be necessary in this day that the kingdom of the devil shall shake, 
and he foretells that the devil will "rage in the hearts of the children 
of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good." 

"And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that 
they will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and thus the 
devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 

"And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell ; 
and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none — and thus he whispereth 
in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there 
is no deliverance." 

LATTER-DAY WARNING 

In the present dispensation the Lord has warned his people against 
the doctrines of devils voiced by men in the service of Satan. Read 
Doctrine and Covenants, section 46, especially verses 7 to 9. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



I trust that we may have the power of discrimination, the gift 
of discernment, that we may know the spirits with whom we have to 
deal, that we may not |forget the voice of the Shepherd but that we 
may know him, and follow him, and be true to our profession, looking 
to those whom we sustain as being our representatives (before the 
Lord, for through them will come whatever is necessary that this people, 
as a people, that this Church, as his Church, shall receive. I hope that 
none of us shall be defiled through dallying with the evil gift, the 
devil's gift, the unclean thing, which is abominable in the sight of the . 
Lord. I so pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Sixty-one years ago today I first beheld the light, here in this 
valley, and I am informed there was deep snow upon the ground. 
How different from that is the beautiful weather we have today for 
the commencement of our Conference, and how joyful it causes us 
to feel that we can meet together in the name of the Lord Without' 
animosity toward any soul, but with kindness in our hearts for all 
people. We have come into this sanctuary to worship our Heavenly 
Father, to listen to his servants as they speak to us under the inspiration 
of his Spirit. 

HUMBLE BUT GREAT MEN 

It is a wonderful blessing that we enjoy in these times of stress and 
uncertainty to feel sure of divine guidance, to have absolute faith in 
a personal God who is interested in us and who hears and answers our 
prayers. i 

I have been thinking today of the humble but' great men who have 
led this Church from its organization. I have known personally all 
the Presidents since Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Although a small 
child when Brigham Young passed away I knew him ; I have sat upon 
his knee and I remember with deep appreciation his kindness to my 
mother and to me when father was in England as a missionary. I 
have been well acquainted with the other Presidents and believe that 
they were all men of God. It is inconceivable that our Heavenly 
Father would choose any other kind to preside over his Church. > 

I have known the members of the Quorum of the Twelve since 
I was a small boy, and since I became of age I have been intimate 
with all of them. They have heen a remarkable group of men. I can 
testify that those who have remained faithful have indeed been servants 
of the Lord. 

I have been acquainted with most of the First Council of Seventy, 
and they have been good men, of exceeding humility. 

The two Patriarchs of the Church who have served in my time 
have been exceedingly faithful and have indeed blessed the people. 

I have known all the members of the Presiding 'Bishopric since 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I was a youth and have 'been on intimate terms with most of them. 
They have certainly honored their 'bishopric and have sought to be what 
the Lord would have them be. 

It has been my privilege to be personally acquainted with most of 
the Stake presidents during the last forty years and they have certainly 
presided over the people in a way that I am sure the Lord is pleased 
with their service. - ( 

While I have not been personally acquainted with all the bishops 
of the Church since my youth, I have known most of them. They 
have indeed been fathers of the flock, a wonderful group of men. 

The auxiliary leaders of the Church, both men and women, have 
been faithful and true and have ministered for the blessing of our 
Father's children whom they have been appointed to serve. 

UPHELD AND. SUSTAINED BY RIGHTEOUS MEMBERS 

In addition to these leaders, I have known thousands of the rank 
and file of this great Church, men and women of many nations who 
in humility and faithfulness have accepted the Gospel to become identified 
with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both here and in 
other lands. These, too, have prayed for and sustained their leaders 
during the past century, and during my experience in the Church I have 
yet to know of one person who has been observing the commandments 
of the Lord who has raised his or her voice against those who were 
called to preside over this Church. That is really remarkable because 
all have had their agency and could have refused to sustain their 
leaders had there been evil in the men who have been called, to direct 
them. Surely if they had not been good men some of this great army 
of people who are living near to the Lord would have discovered wrong- 
doing and would have made it public. As it is only those who have 
been cast' out because of their unworthiness or who have transgressed 
the laws of the Lord have raised their voices in conderfmation of the 
leaders of the Church. 

One of the greatest testimonies to me of fhe divinity of this work 
is that a multitude of people — not' . only those who assemble here in 
these great General Conferences but all Israel — having the opportunity 
in Stake Conference four times a year to express themselves by voting 
either to sustain or refuse to sustain those who preside over them 
(every one exercising free agency) continue to uphold their leaders. 
Surely the Spirit of the Lord prompts the faithful, humble people to 
sustain his chosen servants. 

I am grateful to know that' the Lord has spoken and that this 
is his Church, and that he will continue to support those whom he 
calls to minister if they will be faithful in the future as they have 
been in the past. 

EXPERIENCES OF EARLY LEADERS 

Within the last few weeks I have been reading a journal of my 
grandfather, George A. Smith who, when a boy seventeen years of 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



33 



age, was a member of Zion's Camp. He was large in stature and slept 
at the foot of the Prophet's bed at night to see that no one should enter 
the tent who did not belong there. I have read his personal experiences, 
some most painful and others miraculous. In his youth he was sent 
out to preach the Gospel of our Lord. His was the experience of other 
men who have been called to the ministry. Those of evil minds made 
false accusations against him and his associates but he continued faithful 
and the Lord vindicated them and magnified them in the eyes of the 
people and gave them a testimony of the divinity of this work that 
was so positive that no task was too difficult for them to undertake 
for the dissemination of truth. Grandfather ,was among the group 
sent to England to preach the Gospel in 1839. There the adversary 
sought to discourage them in every way. Their journals written at 
the time disclose the fact that they were misrepresented by evil men 
and attacked by evil spirits, but ,the Lord preserved them and they 
performed a great labor. Eight of the Quorum of the Twelve were 
there at that time. Among those called to go to England were men 
without means to pay their way but they started from their homes on 
foot. Due to prolonged illness one of these men was too weak to walk 
two miles to take a stage coach but was helped that distance by a friend. 
They had faith in God; they knew that this was his Church and so 
they went their way and friends not of the Church were raised up 
to give them money and pay their passage across the ocean, where they 
delivered their message and many faithful people accepted the truth as 
a result of their ministry. 

TOOLS OF THE ADVERSARY ' 

The journals of these men inform us that even in that early day 
there were those who became identified with the Church who were not 
thoroughly converted ; they did not repent of their sins, and failed to 
keep the commandments of the Lord. While his desires were plainly 
manifested unto them they refused to do what he required at their 
hands. They did not pay their tithing, would not observe the Word 
of Wisdom and were immoral. These the adversary could use and 
he prompted them to criticize and oppose the servants of the Lord 
who were unselfishly laboring day and night to disseminate the truth. 

We may not, therefore, expect the leaders of the Church in our 
day to escape the shafts of the adversary hurled by those who are 
in his service. Righteous people will have no desire to speak evil of 
those who are doing good but the adversary will use those who, having 
transgressed trie laws of the Church and the laws of the land, are 
themselves in darkness. 

WHILE IN A DUNGEON 

I desire to read a portion of Section 121 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. President Grant quoted from it this morning but he did 
not read that which I will refer to. This revelation was given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith while he was a prisoner, in a dismal dungeon in 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Liberty, Missouri. In the anguish of his soul he prayed to the Lord: 

"0 God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy 
hiding place? 

"How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold 
from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and 
thine ear be penetrated with their cries?" 

He knew that the Lord could hear and would understand. He 
knew that the men he associated with were good men, that they suffered 
persecution and bondage, not because of wrong doing but because 
of enemies from without and evil men who were within the Church. 
The Lord answered his prayer as f ollows : 

"My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall 
be but a small moment; 

"And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou 
shalt triumph over all thy foes. 

"Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm 
hearts and friendly hands. 

"Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither 
charge thee with transgression, as they did Job. 

"And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be 
blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before 
the burning rays of the rising sun; 

"And also that God hath set his hand and seal to change the times and 
seasons, and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous 
workings ; that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness ; 

"Also because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are 
willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon 
themselves to the very uttermost; 

"That they may be disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off ; 

"And not many years hence, that they and their posterity shall be swept 
from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the 
wall. i ' 

"Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, 
saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, 
saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which 
I commanded them. 

"But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of 
sin and are the children of disobedience themselves. 

"And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring 
them into bondage and death — 

"Wo unto- them ; because they have offended my little ones they shall be 
severed from the ordinances of ■ mine house. 

"Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, 
and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them. 

"They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after them 
from generation to generation. 

"It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their 
necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea." 

Brethren and sisters, history will continue to repeat itself and 
temptations will be presented to all of us. We should keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord that we may enjoy the discernment of spirits 
that we may be not led astray. 

MARKING THE TRAILS 

This is a beautiful valley in which we are now living but it was 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 35 



a wilderness when the forebears of many of us came here. We are 
enjoying the fruits of their sacrifice and labor and we should remember 
them with deep appreciation. 

Those early pioneers were a remarkable group of men and women, 
most of whom have gone to their reward. A movement has been 
started to mark the route of the pioneer, that those who- now travel 
in comfort may have their attention called to the courage of those who 
blazed the trail and made it possible for us to live in this favored land. 
Opportunity is being offered that we may all make our contribution to 
a fund that is intended to mark the trail over which those heroes came, 
many of whom are buried in unmarked graves. Others struggled into 
this valley, footsore and weary but with undaunted courage, because 
of their faith in the Father of us all. A state-wide committee has been 
organized to plan, and we will be permitted to participate in erecting 
monuments and markers in different places, to call the attention of 
the passerby to those who preceded us, and we should determine that 
they will not be forgotten because of carelessness or indifference on 
our part. 

GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS 

All my life I have been associated with this Church and its faithful 
members and rejoice that I have been considered worthy to be identified 
with them. Men and women such as are sitting in this congregation 
today have been an inspiration to me. I thank you, my brethren and 
sisters, for the joy I have had in being your associate in this work, this 
work that the Lord has given to the earth for the last time, for we are 
assured that it will never again be taken from the earth or given to 
another people. 

I thank my Father in heaven for the knowledge that this is his 
work and that I have enjoyed the benefits that have come to me as 
a result of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It has not been difficult for me 
to see how those who have observed all the counsels of the Lord as near 
as they could, have been happy because the more of his commandments 
that I have kept the happier has been my life. The most contented 
and the happiest people that I know are the members of this Church 
who are conforming their lives to the teachings of our Lord. Knowing 
this I am grateful beyond expression for my membership in his Church. 
I am thankful to be directed by men such as preside over us. I am 
grateful to these men who are the Presidency of the Church for the 
encouragement they give me. I pray that they may live long and be 
happy. I pray that the Lord will bless my associates in the Quorum 
of the Twelve, that he will reward presidents of Stakes, bishops of 
Wards, and mission presidents and all who are unselfishly giving their 
time and the very best portions of their lives to develop faith among 
the children of our Heavenly Father and give them a better under- 
standing of his glorious truths. 

This is his Gospel; it is the power of God unto salvation to all 
those who believe and obey it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Knowing that in the not far distant future I must stand in the 
presence of my Maker, to give an account of the days I have spent 
upon the earth and realizing how serious it might be to me if I did not 
speak the truth, I testify to you that I know as I know that I live 
that this is God's work, and I bear witness of it in the name of Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. Amen. , 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

There came a time, in the life of Paul, when he found the Church 
beset with just such difficulties as have been referred to as existing, 
in some instances, with some members of the Church today, and to his 
associate in the ministry, Timothy, he said: 

"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, 
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 

"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, 
and of a sound mind." 

On another occasion it is recorded in Matthew that : 

"There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great 
signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the 
very elect." 

THE GIFT OF GOD WITHIN US 

Christ regarded the bestowal of the Holy Ghost upon the mem- 
bership of the Church, as the fundamentally important thing he could 
do for them after he had concluded his own personal ministry. He 
would not even allow the apostles to go forth and preach without that 
endowment from on high ; but after the Holy Ghost was come he would 
fully qualify them to understand the truth, he would endow them with 
power to preach it. And what a marvelous change came over the lives 
of these men when they were endowed with this power from on high ! 

The membership of this Church have received that same companion- 
ship. How important it is for us today, as perhaps never before, to 
stir up the gift of God that is in us, that has been given us through 
the putting on of the hands of those authorized servants of God, that 
we, by the guidance of that holy inspiration, may be able in these 
troublesome times, as has been so well stated here this afternoon, to 
enjoy the gift of discernment, to see and understand the spirits that 
are in the world. 

LEST YE BE DECEIVED . 

In the forty-sixth section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants 
I read the following: 

"But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; 
and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do 
in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of 
your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



37 



be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men ; 
for some are of men, and others of devils. 

"Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived 
seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given ; 

"For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love 
me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all 
may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a sign that 
they may consume it upon their lusts." 

SEEK SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE 

I believe, as I have observed, that there has never been a time 
when we needed spiritual guidance as we need it today. This is truly 
a time when the wisdom of the wise has perished in material things, 
and the understanding of the prudent is hid. I am sure that the Lord 
gave the gift and power of the Holy Ghost to the membership of the 
Church for their guidance and comfort in all things, even as he has 
indicated in the revelation I have just read. i 

I believe that it is the privilege of the membership of this Church 
to seek^that guidance, even in material things. There is a key given 
in the ninth section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, which 
would be very profitable for the Latter-day Saints to follow even now. 
You remember the circumstance of Oliver Cowdery translating portions 
of the Book of Mormon, and then all became darkness to him and 
he could not proceed. He inquired of the Lord to know why it was, 
and the answer came that he had taken no thought save it was to ask 
the Lord, and left the burden of responsibility there. 

"Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; 
then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your 
bosom shall burn within you ; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. 

"But if it be not right, you shall have no such feelings, but you shall 
have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is 
wrong" — ■ 

that shall turn your heart away from the thing that you had contem- 
plated, i 

You do not know what to do today to solve your financial problems, 
what to plant, whether to buy or sell cattle, sheep or other things. It 
is your privilege to study it out ; counsel together with the best wisdom 
and judgment the Lord shall give you, reach your conclusions, and then 
go to the Lord with it, tell him what you have planned to do. If 
the thing you have planned to do is for your good and your blessing, 
and you are determined to serve the Lord, pay your tithes and your 
offerings and keep his commandments, I promise you that he will 
fulfil that promise upon your head, and your bosom shall burn within 
you if the thing you have planned to do is right, and you shall know 
by the whisperings of the Spirit that it is right. But if it is not xight 
you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought, 
and your hearts will be turned away from that thing. 

DECEPTIONS OF THE ADVERSARY 

I know of nothing today that the Latter-day Saints need more 
than the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the solution of the problems 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of life. I know also that that same unerring wisdom of the Holy 
Spirit can detect the deceptions of the adversary. I have been led 
recently to feelings of pity for groups of people who have been deceived 
by lying tongues, by deceptive spirits. 

I was in Independence the other day with Brother Bennion, visiting 
the mission, and stood by a foundation that has been partly made and 
has been filled with earth as the rains have been washing in the 
excavations. I conversed with groups of people who claimed to have 
received revelations to build a temple there, and had now come to 
confusion, split up and divided. Across the lot is a large building, 
partly completed, erected by another group who claim they have had 
visions and revelations, and they are in the midst of confusion, doubt 
and uncertainty. 

As I look back over the history of this Church, I find that the 
Prophet himself had to rise up against those who sought to displace him. 
When Brigham Young became President of this Church he said: 
"Let any who want to lead a party away do so, and raise their hand 
against God's authority. They will not prosper." His words have been 
fulfilled. Whether it is in connection with those factions that have 
broken away and gone off to Texas, or anywhere else ; they have come 
to naught, and they will come to naught. Those who broke away in 
this country, under the name of Morrisites, or Godbeites, or any other 
"ites" — what has become of them? Oh, that men and women would 
be wise enough to see what will happen to those who seek to steady 
the ark! 

The Lord promised long ago that the majority of the leadership of 
this Church never would lead this people astray, and they never will, 
and they are not leading this people astray today. Every faction that 
rises will come to naught, just as sure as you and I live. 

How my soul rejoices to see this work progressing, developing, 
going forward, although there are these deceptions. Yes, the elect 
would be deceived, if it were possible, by the miraculous things that 
sometimes appear among others. There were those, in the days of 
Christ, who healed the sick and followed not after him, and some of 
the disciples wanted to know if they should not rebuke and restrain 
these who were thus manifesting certain power. Christ told them to 
leave them alone ; they were not competitors of his. 

It does not disturb me to see evidences of this character today else- 
where, because here is the light, here is the truth, here is the power of 
God, and here is the authority of the holy priesthood. I am sure that 
every Latter-day Saint who is observing the commandments of the 
Lord, not seeking for these things, to consume them upon his own 
lusts, will have witnesses and testimonies of the Holy Spirit that will 
guide him to detect the falsehoods, to detect the deceptions that are 
at work. 

USING NEW METHODS 

We are in a period of peace, so far as the Church is concerned, 
from the outside. You who have been attending these Conferences 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



39 



now for the last few years have been hearing the warning from this 
stand, that when the time of peace came to the Church, and there was 
no enemy from the outside, we should not be lulled into a sense of 
security, feeling that the battles were all fought and won, and that 
the enemy had quit the field; for he would pursue new methods in 
seeking to destroy this work. He has not succeeded in injuring it 
by mob violence. 

I went over part of the trail with Brother Bennion the other day, 
where Zion's camp traveled during the Missouri troubles. I stood 
at the spot where the Prophet, chained, uttered that great rebuke to 
the guards ; I stood at the shrine erected to General Doniphan, who 
was ordered to execute the Prophet, but had the courage and manhood 
to refuse to do it. ; As I contemplated the struggles and sorrows and 
difficulties - and the journeys and the hardships of the hundred years, 
my soul rejoiced that under all these trials the Church was not shaken. 
There stood men and Women in its ranks with clear vision, with 
understanding, and with determination to stand or to die for the truth. 
iThey stood like beaten anvils, unafraid, and have preserved to us our 
heritage, blessings and privileges of faith and standing in the true 
Church until this hour. 

But the enemy is not arraying persecution against us from the 
outside just now. Nevertheless, he is at work, seeking to deceive 
within, for he will by new methods try to destroy this people ; but he 
shall not succeed any more than he succeeded through persecution or 
mob violence. I am sure that the great heart of this Church is sound, 
that we are of a sound mind, and that there is no fear for Zion, for 
her future is glorious. 

|A PERIOD OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 

My visit to two. missions since the last Conference inspired me 
with the thought of great things that are to come to this Church. We 
have not begun to die, but we are entering into a period of growth and 
development that will be extended, and thousands, yea, countless thousands 
of the blood of Israel who have not yet been touched, will be found. God 
is opening the work among the nations of the earth. More people have 
been listening to our messages than ever before. Places are being 
thronged, and I see him at work preparing for the fulfilment of his great 
purposes, for Zion shall arise and shine, and those who seek to stop her 
progress will be as helpless as the dogs that bark; while the Church, 
the mighty caravan of God, goes on majestically towards its destiny. 
No power can retard its progress. 

The only fear that I have is for us as individuals. The work will 
go on. It will succeed. It. will fulfil its holy purposes. The great 
secret is, shall I keep the light burning clearly in my own soul, to 
see and understand the course that I am to take; that shall keep me 
on the good ship Zion, and not fall overboard or run off with some 
whim or will or notion of someone else. 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



MEN OF GOD 

I declare to you, with all sincerity of heart, that I know, per- 
sonally, that the declarations that President Grant made concerning 
the honor, the integrity and the faithfulness and devotion of these 
leaders, are true. I know it. They are men of God. They are not 
living double lives. They are living what they have taught the Latter- 
day Saints to live, and thank the Lord you know it. We don't need 
to argue it with you, for you have a witness, a testimony in your 
hearts, that convinces you that it is the truth. 

Yes, glorious things await Zion, and the evil one knows it, and 
he will try, if possible, to stop the work, try to divide our ranks. He 
will try to disturb us, but he shall not succeed. These little disturb- 
ances will pass. The work will go on. God's glorious purposes will 
be accomplished. I am as sure of it as I am that I live. I bear witness 
and testimony of it to you this day, in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a matter of great satisfaction to me, my brethren and sisters, 
to find that my feelings are in complete harmony with those expressed 
by the speakers in this Conference, both this forenoon and this after- 
noon. I know that they have spoken the truth, that they have counseled 
us in righteousness, and if we will obey this counsel our lives will be 
happier and we will be more secure in our salvation. 

MEN OF GOD 

I have known all of the Presidents of the Church except the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I was sixteen years of age when President 
Brigham Young died. I have been personally acquainted with his 
successors, and with many of the noble men of this Church who have 
been associated with them in the conduct of the affairs of the Church. 

I have seen the work prosper and grow, and truth triumph, and I 
know that these men have been men of God, including those who stand 
at the head of the Church today. I am glad to be associated with them 
and to be in harmony with them, because I know they are worthy 
servants of God ; I know that they are trying to live their religion, to 
live by the principles and the doctrines which they teach. I hope that 
you will not discover in my remarks anything that would lead you to 
think otherwise than that I am in complete harmony with them. 

I want to say that although I did not have the privilege of knowing 
the Prophet Joseph here in the flesh, yet I know, just as well, that he 
was a prophet of God, divinely called and inspired, and the work 
which he brought forth is evidence of that fact. 

SEEKING SALVATION 

I know that the Gospel is true. I have proved it from many 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



41 



angles, to my entire satisfaction, and have had the seal of the Spirit 
of God to impress the truth of it upon my mind. I rejoice in this 
testimony and in the knowledge I have that there are thousands of 
men and women in this Church who are faithful in keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord and in doing his will, who know the truth of 
the work and are trying to work out their salvation in fear and 
trembling before him. 

I remember hearing a president of a Stake, while speaking from 
this stand at one of our General Conferences, make the remark that in 
his Stake there were people who were candidates for every degree of 
glory. That no doubt represents the conditions in the Church today, 
hence the necessity for our speaking of certain simple principles and 
truths, over and over again. 

A STRONG ARGUMENT 

A strong argument in favor of prohibition was brought forth this 
afternoon by Elder Smoot, who read from Robert G. Ingersoll's declar- 
ation of the evil results of strong drink. I thought, in that connection, 
that there is a stronger argument to present to Latter-day Saints than 
all that — one that appeals to me, at any rate, more forcefully and 
convincingly — and that is that it is the expressed mind and will of our 
Father in heaven that we abstain from the use of intoxicating drinks. 
Then too, there are other things referred to in the Word of Wisdom 
which our Father has told us we should not indulge in. Tobacco is one 
of them, and others are strong drinks and hot drinks, which have been 
interpreted by the Authorities of this Church, whom we have sustained 
as prophets, seers and revelators, from the days of the Prophet Joseph 
down to the present time, to include tea and coffee. I accept the 
interpretation of the Word of Wlisdom made by these, the servants 
of God, just as much as if tea and coffee had been mentioned in the 
Word of Wisdom. To me, our Father in heaven has spoken and said : 
"It is my will that you do not use tea and coffee. It is my will that 
you do not use intoxicating drinks. It is my will that you do not use 
tobacco." Have I any respect for the will and wishes of God, my 
Heavenly Father? if I have, and have faith in him, and in the 
revelations that have come to us through the 'Prophet Joseph Smith, I 
will keep that Word of Wisdom as I understand it, and as it is inter- 
preted by the Authorities of this Church. 

There are thousands of men and women in this Church who regard 
this matter just as I do, and who are keeping the Word of Wisdom, 
but I am sorry to say there are thousands of others who seem to have 
very little respect for the will of God as he has given it to us in this 
important revelation. 

WAR IN HEAVEN 

We read an account of a war that took place in heaven. It is 
recorded in the twelfth chapter of the book of Revelation — that a third 
of heaven's hosts, rather than do the will of God, were drawn away in 
rebellion, and were cast out and down, and are not permitted to have 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

bodies for their spirits, or to obtain any degree of glory. On the 
other hand, those who stood with our Captain, our King, our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, on the platform: "Father thy will be done, and 
the glory be thine forever," are here enjoying the blessings of this life 
and are in the way of salvation. One might say that platform pertained 
to the spirit world. It did pertain to the spirit world, but it pertained 
as well to this, our second estate. 

THE WILL OF THE FATHER 

The Savior repeatedly, while here in life, made the declaration that 
he came not to do his own will, but to do the will ofj his Father who 
sent him. After his death and resurrection, when he appeared to the 
ancient inhabitants of this, the American continent, and established his 
Church, and preached the Gospel to them, he renewed that statement 
in a very forceful way, as recorded in the twenty-seventh chapter of 
III Nephi, verse 13. He said: 

"Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I 
have given unto you — that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, 
because my Father sent me." 

Then he goes on with his comments, and in the twenty-seventh 
verse we have this further expression of our Lord : 

"Therefore what manner of men had ye ought to be? Verily I say unto you, 
even as I am." 

I associate the two expressions, that he came to do the will of 
his Father who sent him, and that we have come also to do the will 
of our Father who has sent us. And what manner of men ought we 
to be? Even as he was. If we do the will of our Father, as he did it 
and as he taught it, it will make us like him, and will save us with him 
in our Father's kingdom. If we do the will of our Father it will not 
only be the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, but every commandment 
which he has given will appeal to us as the will of our Father, which 
we must observe. Every law of the Gospel will have the same appeal 
to our souls. 

OTHER REASONS FOR OBSERVING WORD OF WISDOM 

This is the strong appeal : If we will not abstain from the use 
of tobacco, from tea and coffee and intoxicating drinks, because of their 
evil effects upon our bodies, and upon our minds and our spirituality ; 
thai, for the love of God, our Father, and to be in accord with his 
mind and will, we ought to observe that Word. 

There is another responsibility in connection with it, devolving 
upon us, and that is, we owe something to our parents. Men 'and 
women, boys and girls, who have been born in this Church of faithful, 
true, Latter-day Saints, are under obligation to their parents to honor 
them ; and when we do not keep -the Word of Wisdom but indulge in 
these things, we not only do not honor them, but we dishonor them, 
and that we have no right to do. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



43 



God has set his hand to save his children and invites us to assist 
him in this great and glorious work, and when we live contrary to the 
teachings of the Gospel we hinder instead of helping his cause, and some 
of us perhaps will do more injury to the cause than all the good we do. 
None of us, at any rate, can afford to deviate from the word and will 
of the Lord. 

I know that this work is true. I know it is good. I thank God 
that I have lived as well and as nearly to his laws as I have thus far, 
and I hope and pray that I may so continue and make improvement as 
long as I live upon the earth, so that I may be accounted worthy to 
dwell with the sanctified and the pure, so that I will not be disappointed 
when life here is ended. I would like you, my brethren and sisters, to 
enjoy the same blessing. 

In closing, I appeal to those who have not been keeping the Word 
of Wisdom, in the name of the Lord and for his sake and consideration, 
that you hereafter do not use tea and coffee, that you do not use 
tobacco, that you do not use strong and intoxicating drinks. I appeal 
to you in behalf of the President of this Church, God's mouthpiece 
unto us, and those associated with him, that you do the things that will 
please them. If you would uphold and sustain them, observe these 
things. That will give them more encouragement than anything else 
that we can possibly do in this mighty work. 

May God add his blessing unto us, each and all, according to our 
need, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

An American prophet, King Benjamin, whose history we read in 
the Book of Mormon said on one occasion: 

"And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come 
to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and 
have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which 
causeth such exceeding great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should 
remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and 
your own nothingness, »nd his goodness and long-suffering towards you, 
unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling 
on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that 
which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel. 

"And behold, I say unto you, that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and 
be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins ; 
and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or 
in the knowledge of that which is just and true." 

Then we have the words of Jesus as recorded in the thirteenth 
chapter of Mark, the Evangelist, which read: "My words shall not 
pass away." The words and teachings of Jesus Christ, our Lord, shall 
not pass away. They shall live jn the hearts of mankind forever. 
From; Jesus Christ as from no other teacher in the world's history

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



men have gathered an idea of God and his teachings which have 
proved themselves to be the greatest teachings in the history of civiliza- 
tion. They have endured the changes of time and survived the vicis- 
situdes of life. "In him as in no other being, humanity has found 
an ideal of character before which men of all generations bow their 
heads." We are living in a changing, dynamic age. It is called the 
greatest age of the world's history. There are so many influences 
leading mankind into all manner of theories and interpretations as to 
what life means. I have faith, however, in the youth of the world; 
I believe in humanity. There is much more goodness than wrong; 
much more righteousness than evil. Man is divine, and all are children 
of the same God. The iknowledge of the divine will always remain 
to guide us to better spheres. Yet I am not unmindful of the fact 
that there are ills besetting human society. 

There is today an unprecedented challenge to law and authority. 
There is a prevailing hatred between_ nations ; men and men. There 
is a growing aversion to work. There is an excessive thirst for pleasure, 
and a gross materialism seems to be growing ; and as the materialism 
grows man is forgetting the spiritual life that has been taught us by 
Jesus the Christ, and those who have taken up his work and his cause. 
These ills have become common to human society, but there is a power 
in the- world that is destined to overcome them and that is the power 
of God, manifested in the mind and the soul of man. 

When Elder Ballard in his sermon quoted the words of Paul to 
Timothy in which Paul declared that God had not blessed us with the 
spirit of fear, but with power and strong minds, I was reminded of 
Stevenson's lovely story entitled "The Lantern Bearers." In this story, 
Stevenson describes a boyhood game, which consisted in carrying 
beneath one's coat a bulls-eye lantern. Those admitted to the society 
were permitted to carry lanterns, and when the members met on some 
hill or desert waste to talk with each other, their lanterns were the bond 
of fraternity. It united them all as by a sacred cause. When one 
member met another, he would ask: "Have you your lantern ready?" 
Then would come a responsive "Yes," and their coats were unbuttoned 
and the glow of the light revealed. From this (Stevenson derived 
his philosophy of life. I wonder if we have our lanterns aglow and 
ready to show the way. 

I believe that the message of Christ is slowly, gradually, and 
surely touching the hearts of mankind. I believe that ultimately right- 
eousness will prevail over wrong; and the Gospel of Christ prevail. 
Men will stand in the dignity of their divinity, and not only live, but 
declare by their lives the great work and power of the Master. 

Boys and girls in our universities are confronted with all 
kinds of ideas, hut ideas that have been advanced (by men who are 
sincere. If the boys and girls will keep themselves clean and pure 
and unspotted, and look to their best selves, and the best that is in life, 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG

they will be safe, and they will come to a knowledge of the great truths 
of God. 1 i ' . ' 

I remember once in passing the large gate of the University of 
Denmark, in Copenhagen, noticing a beautifully carved eagle above 
the entrance. I suppose it is there to this day. I remember the Latin 
expression beneath the eagle, which reads in English: "The eagle is 
looking toward the celestial light." Every time a University student 
passes through the gate he takes his hat off, looks up to that eagle and 
to the motto, and with thoughtful mind says: "This day may I look 
toward the celestial light." 

This has been the teaching of our fathers and our mothers, to look 
toward the celestial light. In that light, in that illumination which 
is and may become common to us all, there is happiness, and peace, 
and sunshine, and all in life we may ask for. 

The pioneers of Utah, our fathers and mothers, understood the 
joy of divine illumination, for they were men and women of toil, and 
of great faith in God. They understood life, for as they conquered the 
elements, the finer instincts of altruism and generosity and ilove swelled 
in their hearts. They grew in a knowledge of earth and heaven. They 
knew the worth of life. They had their lanterns ever ready I and never 
did they fail to keep to the light which never failed. 

The light of life is Jesus Christ, our Lord. He has told us to deal 
direct with God through his name. The soul is to be unafraid. We are 
to love God. That love becomes tremendous and real. It becomes an 
infinite power. "If thou canst believe," says Mark the Evangelist, 
"all things are possible to him that believeth." And again in Mark we 
read : "Have faith in God." "The time is fulfilled." "The Kingdom 
of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news." Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have received the following greeting from President Castle 
Murphy of the Hawaiian Mission : 

"Aloha to the leading brethren and sisters and the Church in general, from 
the missionaries and the good people of the 'Hawaiian Mission. May you have 
a wonderful outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord in every session of the One 
Hundred and First Annual Conference of the Church, is the fervent prayer of 
each of us who labors in this choice land of love, music and flowers — Hawaii." 

The congregation sang, as a closing hymn, "Do What Is Right." 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder Harold ,B. Lee, President 
of the Pioneer Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, April 5th. 



SECOND DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Sunday morning, April 5th, at 10 o'clock, 
President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, every seat in the great 
auditorium and galleries being Itaken and every available space in the 
doorways and aisles being occupied. Thousands who could not find 
accommodations in the Tabernacle assembled in the large Asssembly 
Hall and on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened by means of 
the radio to the Conference services. 

The Tabernacle Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "We 
Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." • ■ 

Elder J. Emmett Bird, President of the Kolob Stake, offered the 
invocation. 

The Choir sang the anthem, "Let the Mountains Shout for Joy." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I do not remember an occasion, my brethren and sisters, when it 
appeared to me that a greater number of members of the Church were 
present than are here this morning. I feel humble and grateful that 
I am permitted to be here with you, recognized with you, a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

It is a beautiful morning. The sun shines brightly without. As 
I walked through the grounds I noticed that the buds on the trees 
are beginning to burst, to put on their new summer clothing, and awake 
to newness of life. 

Then, when I look at these Easter lilies, with their purity of 
color, I remember that this is the day when Christian people throughout 
the world commemorate the resurrection of Christ, our Lord. It seems 
appropriate that it should come on such a day, that the occasion should 
come when the earth is awakening from its long winter sleep, its frozen 
condition, to new life and new energy. 

EASTER 

The word "Easter" is derived, according to a note which I have 
here, from the Anglo-Saxon word "Eostra," who is the mythical goddess 
of spring. Prior to the seventh century A. D., no uniform date had 
been fixed upon which this event, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, was commemorated. I find that Rome observed the 26th of 
March ; that Gaul observed the 21st of March ; Italy the 18th of April ; 
while Christians of Egypt observed April 27th, as the day on which the 
tomb of the Redeemer of the world was opened, and he came forth 
with his resurrected body. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 47 



Regardless of the date, whether it be upon April 5th, as we com- 
memorate it today, or upon any other day which might be designated, 
it does bring to our memory, and we commemorate it as one of the 
greatest — perhaps I might be justified in saying the greatest event that 
has occurred in the history of the world. 

It is true that the creation of man, and the placing of him here 
upon earth by God, our Father, was the beginning of all things as they 
now pertain to us; but if the decree of death which was pronounced 
upon our first parents, and which has been the heritage of man from 
that time until the present, had been definite and perpetual, if no means 
of redemption from it had been provided, the purpose of God our 
Father in placing us here would have been, to a great degree at least, 
futile. 

A REDEEMER PROMISED 

He promised, in the beginning, that he would provide a Redeemer ; 
that the penalty of death, which was pronounced upon humankind, 
because of transgression, should not be eternal, but that at a time, 
designated as the meridian of time, he would send to earth his Only 
Begotten Son, through whom the bonds of death were to be broken 
and the restoration of the spirit and body of man became an accom- 
plished fact, when mortality would be no longer a burden to us, but 
when with glorified bodies we should stand in the presence of God, 
our Father. 

I am just quoting in a general way, because of the limited time, 
the facts as they are to be found in holy writ. The Bible tells the story 
very definitely and understandingly to those who read. That the Israel- 
.itish people, from whom we are descendants, looked forward to a time 
when a Redeemer would be provided, is a well-established fact. Israel 
had been reduced to a condition of servitude. The independence of 
Judea had passed into other hands. Rome dominated, and the Jews 
were tributary to her. Their prophets looked forward to the day when 
deliverance would come. They expected one to come to sit upon David's 
throne. They looked for a deliverer, a redeemer, who would come sur- 
rounded by the panoply of war, and restore to Israel the kingdom which 
had been wrested from them. The advent of Christ, the humility of 
his birth, the simplicity of his life, did not appeal to them. 

"he who was to come" 

When he was baptized in the River Jordan, John, who administered 
the ordinance, bore witness that he was the Son of God. John had 
preached repentance and baptism; bore witness to the world that one 
would come after him, the latchet of whose shoes he was not worthy to 
unloose. And yet it is evident that John himself was not certain, 
because while in jail at the decree of Herod, the king, he sent messengers 
to our Lord, with this question : Go and ask him if he is really he who 
was to come, or, are we to look for another. Christ answered them 
and said : Go back and (tell to John that which you have seen. The 
blind see. The deaf hear. The sick are healed. The poor have the 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



gospel preached to them. Let the mind of John revert to the words 
of the prophets, who had long "before declared that he should come 
in humility, and not in the glory of the world. 

Christ, our Lord, came to earth first, to break the bands of death, 
and make the resurrection from the dead an established fact. He came 
to teach us the story of human life, for he lived it, as we should live it. 
He came to teach us the source from which we came, and to which 
we shall return. 

THE WITNESS HE BORE 

He bore definite witness that he came from the presence of the 
Father, as we come from the presence of the Father. He bore definite 
witness that he returned to the Father ; that he went to sit upon his 
right hand, as it would be the privilege of all of those who accepted 
and followed him to sit upon his right hand. He bore witness to us 
that whoever had seen him had seen the Father; that the glory of the 
Father was not only manifest in his ministry and the doctrines which 
he taught, but that he was in the exact image of his person. When 
men said to him : "Show us the Father," did he not answer : Is it 
possible that you have been with me so long, and ask this question? 
Whoever has seen me has seen the Father — thus establishing the divinity 
of the declaration made in the book of Genesis : 

"God created man in his own image ; in the image of God created he him ; 
male and female, created he them." 

KING THOUGH HE WAS 

He taught us the doctrine of humility. King though he was, he 
rode into Jerusalem upon the colt of an ass — not in a chariot, not with 
military attendants, not with the blare of trumpets and the beating 
of drums, but under the most humble circumstances that the human 
mind can well conceive. 

He was born into the world as we are born into it, the son of a 
righteous, God-chosen mother. He lived very much as we live. He 
grew up as we grow up, except for the manifestation of his wisdom and 
godly calling which characterized even his childhood, his youth. He 
died very much as we would have died, subjected to the same conditions. 

It appeared, after all, that the end had come. He had taught the 
doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, but his disciples did not 
fully understand, and when they saw him give up the ghost, and laid 
His body away in the sepulcher prepared by his devoted friend, Joseph 
of Arimathea, who is said to have been the uncle of Mary, his mother, 
it appeared to them that the end had come. And they said : After all, 
there is nothing to it. I am going back to my fishery. I shall go 
back to my life as a publican. I shall pursue the avocation that I 
pursued before I knew him. 

HE WAS NOT THERE 

But when the good women came up that Sunday morning which 
we commemorate today, not expecting to find his sepulcher empty, but 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 49 



expecting to administer to him the last rites which it was customary 
among the Hebrew people to administer to the dead, he was not there. 
An angel of the Lord was there. The great stone which Pilate had 
ordered to be placed before the opening of the sepulcher, and sealed 
with a Roman signet, had been rolled aside. The body of their Lord 
was gone. The linen cloths were there, in which his head had been 
bound. The angel asked them why they sought the living among the 
dead. 

You are all familiar, you who read the scripture, with the story of 
his glorious resurrection. You all know that his disciples could not 
believe it when word was taken to them that he had been raised from 
the dead. To them it appeared to be an impossibility. While they were 
met together, with the doors closed, and he appeared before them, they 
looked upon him in wonder and some doubted. Thomas said : I will 
not believe until I see the marks of the nails in his hands and feet, and 
the wound |pf the [Roman sspear-thrust in his side. And he did see 
them. Then he bowed down and worshipped him as his Lord and 
God, just as we worship him today. 

He taught us the doctrine of forgiveness. He said to the sinful 
woman when her own people would have stoned her to death : "Go thy 
way and sin no more." Among his last words he said, of those who 
. were responsible for his death: "Father, forgive them. They know 
not what they do." 

HE LIVED AGAIN 

He lived again. It was after his resurrection that he authorized 
his disciples to go into the world and preach his gospel, and promised 
them that the signs should follow — not during his mortal life had he 
given them such general authority. 

The Bible bears witness that not only the body of Christ arose 
from the grave, but that many of the graves were opened, and people, 
with their resurrected bodies, went forth into the great city, and ap- 
peared unto many. 

He appeared after, with his glorified body, to the inhabitants of our 
own continent. They saw him. They heard his voice. He taught them 
the same doctrines that he taught to his people in the promised land, or 
in Jerusalem. So we know that he lived again. 

My brethren and sisters, this is the great lesson that he teaches us: 
This is what I have endeavored, in few words, to present to you: 
Just as Christ lived and died and was resurrected from the dead, so do 
we live and die, and so are we resurrected from the dead, or else there 
is no truth in the revealed will of ithe Lord as it is written in the holy 
scripture. 

IT WAS A REVELATION 

. I admonish you all to read the last book of the Bible, the revelation 
given to St. John. We call it the Apocalypse. Reflect for a moment on 
the manner in which it came. John tells us that it was a revelation of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord; that he sent and communicated it to him 
through the agency of an angel— he did not go himself ; and then the 



so 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



wonderful revelations which are made regarding the earth and its in- 
habitants, the future which is before us, were delivered by this personage 
to John, the divine disciple of Christ our Lord, who had been banished 
to the isle of Patmos by decree of the Roman governor. 

And what did he tell John? John says: He showed me these 
things. I saw that the graves were opened ; and the dead came forth, 
that small, and great arose from them ; that they appeared before God 
to be judged according to the things which are written in the books, 
according to their works. All men, he declared, are to be the bene- 
ficiaries of the redemption wrought out by Christ, our Lord. The sea 
gave up the dead which were in it. The graves were opened, and the 
dead came forth, and death and hell gave up the dead that were in them. 
They came to judgment, every man and woman according to the works 
done while they were in mortality, as we are in mortality now. Re- 
vealing to us definitely the obligation that we are under to God, our 
Father, to live righteous lives, to accomplish good purposes, to fulfil 
the mission for which we have been sent to earth, in a manner that 
will be pleasing to God our Father, and justified when the balance 
sheet is struck. 

"no more death" 

And then what else did John tell us? — I saw a new heaven and 
a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had passed away. 
And there was no more death, neither weeping nor sorrow, for all of 
those things had been done away. 

Does this bring a degree of resignation to us? Does it bring 
happiness to us in time of trouble and sorrow? What does it all 
mean? It means that every wife who has stood at the bier of her 
husband, whom death has called, has hope that the separation is only 
temporary. It means that every husband who has laid away his wife has 
that same hope, if he understands. It means that mothers who have 
mourned the loss of children, relatives who have mourned the loss of 
friends that have been separated from them by death, have joy and 
consolation in the knowledge, the definite knowledge which has come 
to us, that there will be restoration from death in the life to come. 

It is a wonderful thing to me. I glory in it. So I bear witness to 
this large congregation of people that we are redeemed from this change 
from mortality to immortality, which we call death, through the re- 
demption wrought out by Christ our Lord. He is our Redeemer. He 
is our Savior and if we are true to him, we will be entitled to sit upon his 
right hand in the mansions of God our Father, when our mortal lives 
are ended. Every covenant, every promise made to men and women 
upon earth, which is sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, will go with 
us into the life to come. 

A MAN OF SORROW 

Who was this man that made all of this possible? He was not a 
man of wealth. He was not a man of great national notoriety. He 
had no home to call his own. He had no place to lay his head. He 
was not a man who sought the praise of the world, not one to magnify 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 51 



himself to the exclusion of others ; but one who, while in reality a king, 
was not a king as we interpret that word to mean in human life. He 
washed the feet of his humble followers. He was not well known in 
Jerusalem, where he ministered ; it was necessary that someone point 
him out that the officers of the law might know who this man was that 
was making such great disturbance. A man of humility ! A man of sor- 
row! It is said of him that no one ever heard him laugh, but many 
people saw him weep, weep because of the sins of the world, weep 
because of his love for an unbelieving people, his own people, to whom 
he came but who rejected him as a malefactor and an imposter. 

THE EARTH IS HAPPY 

My brethren and sisters, these are things which these Easter lilies 
have brought to my mind. These are things which this springtime 
day recalls. How like our own lives ! How like mortality is the earth 
itself ! Winter time comes. The earth appears to die. Ice and snow 
enfold it. Should it continue so, the earth would not be habitable. It 
would become like the frozen country to the south of us which Byrd 
has so recently explored, devoid of vegetation, devoid of life, bleak, 
hopeless, uninhabitable. But the Lord has so provided that the sun 
comes back to us, or the earth moves back to the sun, the winter 
snows and ice are melted, and springtime comes. These trees, barren 
now of leaves, shoot out their buds, and put on their summer garments. 
The birds sing again. The earth is happy. So do I see our own lives 
illustrated in these things of mortality with which we are surrounded. 
God help us all to appreciate them. God help us all to understand that 
the resurrection from the dead is a reality, not a mythical thing, but a 
reality; and that it may apply to us all, I pray, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

Secpnd Counselor in the First Presidency 

It is a great responsibility, my brethren and sisters, to stand before 
a congregation like this, and I feel the need of your faith, your 
sympathy and your prayers, for of myself I am not able to enlighten 
your minds ; but if the Lord will favor us, and will favor me with the 
power of his Spirit, then by that power the mind is enlightened. 

I bear witness to the truth of that which has been delivered by 
President Ivins. iWe believe literally and truly in the resurrection from 
the dead. It is taught in our books of scripture — the Book of Mormon 
and the Doctrine and Covenants, as well as the Bible. So we have 
good ground for our belief with respect to that. 

ON STRANGE TIMES 

The world has fallen on strange times. The times are out of 
joint. Troubles have been ere now, and many of them, in the history 
of the world. But history gives us no example of anything like the 
world-wide troublesome conditions that prevail at this very day. There 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is perplexity of nations. And it is in fulfilment of the word of the Lord. 
The Elders of this Church for a hundred years have been preaching this 
Gospel, from the Bible, from the Book of Mormon, from the revelations 
given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and proclaiming that the 
time of the end is nigh at hand, that the Savior of the world, our 
Redeemer, would come again, and that the time of his coming was nigh. 

AS A YOUNG MISSIONARY 

I myself, sixty-two years ago this summer, went from this city as 
a young missionary, twenty years of age, to proclaim this very doctrine, 
•bearing witness that the Book of Mormon was true, and that Joseph 
Smith was in very deed a prophet, raised up to warn the world in this 
last dispensation — the dispensation of the fulness of times. Of course 
many times we were not listened to, even with tolerance. Wte were 
ridiculed, decried ; contumely heaped upon us. Nevertheless, the Elders 
persevered, knowing of a certainty that what they went forth to preach 
was true, was revealed from heaven. They were converted by the 
same spirit that Peter said converted the Apostles. The Savior asked 
the Apostles : 

"Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 

"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some Elias; and 
others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the 
living God. 

"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: 
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in 
heaven. 

"And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build 
my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." 

What rock? The rock of revelation. And by the spirit and power 
of revelation, the spirit and power of the Holy Ghost, the Lord has made 
us to know and understand in this day that this is indeed and of a truth 
the work of the Lord. 

TROUBLE AND DISTRESS 

This nation of ours, which is the best in the world, the freest, the 
most choice land upon all the earth, so we are told in the Book of Mor- 
mon — "a land choice above all other lands" — is going through a series 
of troubles. All is not well with us by a long way. I don't think we are 
as badly off in these mountain valleys as they are in many other parts 
of the United States. I think there is a little more of a feeling of safety 
right here than I can find anywhere else in the country. At least I 
feel it so, and I believe many others do. 

IN EFFECT AN INCREASE 

Certainly a very large proportion of our community have been 
kept steadily at work and their wages have not been reduced. Among 
these could be mentioned all of the. federal employes in the state, 
including all postofhce employes and mail carriers. And there has been 
a considerable proportion of our people employed by the state, by the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY 53 



different counties, and by the different municipalities. Also a very 
large number of school teachers throughout the state, and employes in 
hundreds of different companies, large and small, have remained un- 
changed. And the same with all Church employes in offices, schools 
and temples. 

All these taken together would probably amount to one hundred 
thousand men and women drawing the same salaries that they were 
paid in 1928-1929. Now the government's bulletin states that prices 
are thirty-two per cent lower than they were in 1928. That means then 
that these people, instead of having their wages reduced, have had in 
effect an increase of wages of thirty per cent or better. So taken all 
together Utah is not in such a bad fix, after all. 

But the country as a whole is going through a period of trouble 
and distress. 

"after your testimony" 

As I have told you, we young Elders preached that this was the 
dispensation of the fulness of times — the last dispensation; that there 
would be no other following this dispensation of the Gospel. The Lord 
has given notice that these are the last times, and the people must be 
warned. "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every 
creature," and so forth. We have been trying to do that faithfully. 

Among other things, in warning the people, we have quoted — many 
of our Elders have done — from the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, beginning with the eighty-eighth verse : 

"And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 

"For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall 
cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and 
shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice 
of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea 
heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail 
them; for fear shall come upon all people." 

These are among the warnings that were given and have been 
given with the preaching of the Gospel. I myself have felt : "O, well, 
it is true ; I know it will come to pass ; but it will not come in my time ; 
I am not likely to be troubled with it." Well, the last few weeks, the 
last few months, the last year, the world has witnessed what it has 
never witnessed before in its history. So many of these calamities that 
this revelation calls our attention to have come upon the children of men, 
and fear begins to enter into the hearts of the people. 

I do not think it is a good thing to frighten people. I don't preach 
this doctrine in this way. I only call attention to these truths, for they 
are true — these prophecies are true. More and more will these things 
occur in our history, as time goes on. For the Lord's work will be 
accomplished, and he will accomplish it in his own way. 

A FAMINE IN THE LAND 

Meanwhile it is our work to build up the Church and kingdom of 
God, to preach the Gospel. I said last evening in the priesthood meet- 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ing: "What a dearth there is for missionaries to preach this Gospel!" 
Do you know there is a famine in the land, you elders of Israel, bishops, 
presidents? Positively there is a famine in the land, "not a famine of 
bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord." 
You presidents of missions and others testify of it. People are hunger- 
ing for the word of God. A perfect famine exists, and this Church 
is the agency by fwhich that can be supplied, and the only agency in all 
the world that can supply it. We are somewhat derelict in our duty in 
respect to this matter. There is no use mincing words, brethren and 
sisters. You sisters can do much to encourage the brethren, and you do. ' 
I think you are better than the men are, more faithful. The splendid 
work that these sisters do in the Relief Society, Sister Robison and 
her helpers, Sister jFox and her helpers, Sister Anderson and hers — 
the great work they are doing in helping along these matters is worthy 
of all praise. And sisters, you can say to your husbands, your brothers, 
your sons : "We can spare a missionary. We can sacrifice that much 
for the Church." 

SACRIFICE AND SAVING 

I have begun to think lately that there is not a sufficient spirit of 
sacrifice among us. There are two things that we have lost lately — 
sacrifice and saving. We don't know how to save a dollar now, to put 
away a dollar for a rainy day. Not one family in a dozen thinks of it. 
They will tell you : "Oh, we don't have enough to live on as it is." 
The wife or the daughter will say : "Why we haven't any money to 
spare. I haven't had a new dress for so and so, and so and so." 

Senator Smoot told us the other day that of all the nations of the 
earth the one that suffered the most in blood and treasure in the late war 
— France — is the most prosperous nation in all the world today. And 
why are they prosperous ? I will tell you in two words : they work and 
save. We won't be prosperous, and no other people will be prosperous, 
only upon those conditions. We have lost the idea of saving. I know 
many families, in fact most that I do know — their children see more 
picture shows in a month than I ever saw — well of course we did not 
have picture shows in my day. They have money to spend to fill these , 
picture shows. I do when I am dragged into one by some of my chil- 
dren and I try to laugh and enjoy it, and sometimes do get a laugh out of 
it. But, oh, there is so much trash in it all. And yet these places are 
full every day. They are full today you will find if any of you should 
go there. I hope you won't go and spend your money so foolishly. 
But we fill these picture houses. If you were to say to the mother of 
those children that must see everything that comes to town: "Why 
not practice a little self-denial and have these children do without a 
picture show. Save that money and put their names on the tithing 
record," she would very likely reply, "Oh heavens, would you want to 
stop the children from going to a picture show, a little thing like that?" 
So I repeat, we have lost the forcefulness of these two words— sacrifice 
and saving. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 55 



' WORTH EVERYTHING 

I believe with all my heart that this Gospel of ours, this Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this priesthood of the Son of God 
that has been conferred upon us is worth everything. I ought to be 
ready to sacrifice everything for it. I covenant in my prayers time and 
time again to "dedicate all unto thee." Yet the words are meaningless, 
if I am not ready to say : "I will go on a mission ; glad to go ; glad to 
sacrifice for the work." The children wouldn't be able to see so many 
picture shows, but they will be just as good children, let me tell you, 
just as able, and I believe more so, because a lot of what we call 
education is not very good education. I would rather have faith im- 
planted into the hearts of children, faith in this work, a true testimony 
of the Gospel, than mere intellectuality. Do not misunderstand me. 
I am in favor of education. I believe in it. ' If there is any people in 
the world who have proved they are in favor of education the Latter-day 
Saints have proved it by the millions of dollars that we have poured out 
for education. I wish we had educated men with degrees everywhere — 
if only they would retain their faith as they get their degrees. For this 
faith is worth more than degrees. That is the point I would like to 
send home. 

"give us faith" 

Oh God, increase our faith, and give us faith enough, power enough 
that we may be able to sacrifice, and in order to make the sacrifice that 
we will save dollar by dollar first and then be ready and willing to say : 
"Here it is. I am going to spend it for the upbuilding of the kingdom 
of God." 

There is a famine in the land, again I say, not for bread, but for 
the word of God, and the responsibility, my brother, my sister, rests 
on you and me and all of us to supply this want, this extreme need. 

That the Lord will give us faith and persistence and courage ; that 
he will stay the powers of evil from us ; that we may be kept as in the 
hollow of his hand ; that all things may be overruled for the good of 
them who serve him and keep his commandments, is my most humble 
and earnest prayer. 

God 'bless you, my brethren and sisters. You are the best there 
are, after all is said and done. You are the salt of the earth, because 
you and your fathers and mothers have sacrificed. They knew what 
the word meant and they ifollowed it, and they lived through it. My 
parents did, far more than I have had to do, but they did it, and that is 
why I am here, because of their help and their example. 

Now, derelict as we may be in some things, we are the chosen of 
the Lord. You bishops and counselors, you presidents of stakes, 
presidents of missions, great responsibilities rest upon you. You are 
called of God, brethren, and sisters likewise, called in the same way, 
by the same power. Let us honor that call. Let us be faithful. Let 
us resolve anew, here and now, that we will, God helping us, keep his 
commandments. And we will sacrifice, and we will save our means, 
and be prudent and frugal and wise in all things.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are favored today by having with us Dr. H. E. Barnard, of 
Washington, D. C, Director of the White House Conference on Child 
Health and Protection. We will ask him to please come to the stand 
and address us. , - . , 

DR. H. E. BARNARD 

Director of the Wihite House Conference on Child Health and Protection 

Oh, how I wish every father and mother, every lover of children 
in this great country of ours, could be here with us this morning, to 
sit, as I have been sitting, and receive the inspiration given you in 
your great Church, from your leaders ; to hear this wonderful music 
swelling out from this great Tabernacle! I am sure they would all 
realize, as I realize, that our children are in good hands, and that the 
citizens of tomorrow will be finer citizens even than the citizens of 
today. 

I speak to you as a messenger from Washington, representing the 
White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. How for- 
tunate it is that this conference, called by the Governor of Utah, will 
be held in_this city immediately following this great conference of your 
Church. Certainly there has never been a time more opportune to 
hope for the children of the future everything which is guaranteed to 
them by the Children's Charter, adopted at the close of the White House 
Conference in Washington last November. 

May I read to you the first paragraph of that great Charter, because 
I know every member of your Church, and every citizen of the country, 
wishes for every child spiritual and moral training to help him to 
stand firm under the pressure of life: 

"For every child understanding, and the guarding of his personality as his 
most precious right; and for every child a home, and that love and security 
which a home provides." 

May I, speaking for the twelve hundred members of the White 
House Conference, who have labored for a long time to bring together 
facts on which we can build a finer world for our children, bring you 
my grateful thanks for the , opportunity you have given me to stand 
before you this morning. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles and President of the 
European Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I must confess that during- the 
last few years I have thought with longing of you and these great 
assemblies, when the time of the General Conferences has arrived. The 
■opportunity to mingle with you now, and to feel of your spirit, and 
this day to declare with you my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, fills my 
heart with gratitude. 

THE SAME SPIRIT AND PURPOSE 

I am grateful for the testimony of the truth of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which has been given me — the greatest gift that I possess. 
I rejoice this day that the spirit which I have felt in these gatherings 
yesterday and today is quite the same spirit as that which I have felt 
in the small gatherings in the various European countries. The Latter- 
day Saints who live the Gospel of Jesus Christ speak and hear by the 
•same spirit. They understand one another by that same spirit. This 
is one great church, whether in Salt Lake City or in the far distant 
branches of the missions, one people, with one understanding, with 
one purpose, with one holy desire to please the Almighty Father. 

I think I am safe in saying that the work of the Lord is going 
forward satisfactorily in the European missions. Never before, because 
Of the new inventions and discoveries for the dissemination of truth, 
has the testimony of the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
been so widely spattered, and made to reach so many people, as at 
this time. 

GREETINGS FROM THE EUROPEAN MISSIONS 

I bring you greetings from the faithful, devoted, intelligent 
mission presidents who have charge of the affairs of the European 
missions. They and their wives are doing splendid work. Your sons 
are safe in their hands. 

I bring you greetings from the Elders themselves, young men, but 
desirous of doing their work with all their might, and accomplishing 
a wonderful work, through the assistance of their Father in heaven. 

And I bring you in particular greetings from the membership of 
the Church in the European lands, a body of faithful men and women, 
loving the Gospel just as we love it here; ready to sacrifice and to save, 
if they can, as President Nibley has suggested ; ready to do whatever 
may be demanded of them, insofar as their strength permits. They live 
in the outposts of Zion, but they are ready and willing to labor there, 
and to help maintain and retain those outposts until such time as in 
the providences of the Lord we may have larger units of the Church, 
teven in those far-distant countries. 

A NEW DAY 

Opposition and oppression have very largely vanished from • our 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



work in the European lands. A new day has dawned, and it seems 
to us, who labor there, that if the Lord will only bless our efforts it 
may be possible, in the near future, to bring a convincing message of 
the truth of this work to the hearts of thousands in those lands who 
are honest in heart. 

SPIRITUAL INDIFFERENCE 

We have many difficulties ; there is no question about that ; there 
are difficulties on every hand ; the greatest difficulty, perhaps, that we 
have to contend with is the spiritual or religious indifference of the 
present day. It is an indifference which seems to cover the earth 
everywhere. It takes the form of a resentment or revulsion against 
organized religion — not so much a contempt for religion itself, for 
the principles of it, but rather a contempt or near-contempt for the 
organized forms of religion, for the churches themselves. Every man 
seems to be willing to do as best he can under the law, to live a 
wholesome and a proper life, but unwilling to conform to the regulations 
and practices of any church. 

It is commonly said throughout the world that there is no need 
of a church today. In pondering upon this subject the thought has 
come to me and has lingered with me, that perhaps this rebuke of 
organized religion is a rebuke to the fundamental conception of religion 
as taught in the world today. 

MAN-MADE GODS 

Out of the thunderings of Sinai came the word of the Lord. The 
first commandment wa|S : "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." 
Throughout the long ages after that command was given, men gradu- 
ally forsook their graven images, their worship of stock and stone, 
and gradually Jehovah, the God of Israel, became the God of many, 
or perhaps most of the foremost people of the world. Gradually the 
simple conception of God as the father of humanity prevailed, or began 
to prevail upon the earth. Then, after the days of Jesu,s, when men 
(should have known better, when the Christ, and God through him, had 
been revealed, men again departed from the truth, and made unto 
themselves gods, this time in an immaterial realm, but man-made just 
as truly as the man-made gods of wood and stone and iron of earlier 
ages. 

I believe that the spiritual resentment in the world today has 
resulted from the idolatry which still lingers upon the earth, the attempt 
to force men to worship a God that is man-made, an incomprehensible 
God, an essence, one who is so far from us in understanding that 
men cannot bow down before him a,s they should, and pray to him 
as a child should pray to his father. 

THE TRUE GOD 

The Latter-day Saints are able to answer this great need of 
humanity and to define God properly. In the mission field, whether in 
Europe or elsewhere, it is the greatest message that the Church has to 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



59 



give to the world today — the true definition and the true conception 
of God our Father, the maker of the heavens and the earth. He as 
a personage who is literally our father in a pre-existent state, to whom 
we can speak as sons or daughters speak to their father; with whom 
they can take counsel and be' intimate; a God to whom we may express 
our inmost desires, and from whom we may expect answers from 
time to time to satisfy our hearts' inmost desires. 

. I pray in my heart and by word of mouth that the true conception 
and knowledge of the Father of us all, may, through our agency, be 
spread abroad among the nations, to make happy the many thousands, 
tens of thousands and millions of honest souls who today are lost in 
a modern type of idolatrous worship. It is perhaps a strong word to 
use, but a thought or conception may be as man-made as is a material 
thing. 

IWe find, as we travel about in the European missions, that men 
respond to a correct doctrine concerning divinity. They are eager to 
learn the truth about their Maker. When the superstitions of the past 
and the crust, of misunderstanding and false teaching are broken 
through, then men and women rejoice in the new understanding of 
man's relationship to the Maker of us all. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S FIRST VISION 

I rejoice in the glorious first vision given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, the greatest of the visions and teachings of these latter days. On 
that occasion God himself and his Son Jesus Christ stood before the 
boy, kneeling in humble, earnest prayer, in the little grove in New 
■York State. Joseph then held converse with God. In humility and 
simplicity he dared to state his heart's need, and God spoke to him, 
and commissioned his Son to speak yet further to him, so that the 
lad might understand and might be prepared for the great work for 
which he had been chosen before the foundations of the earth were laid. 

This is a glorious gift of these latter days, and we must stand upon 
it firmly, without yielding. We must teach forever and to all people 
the truth of the fatherhood of God, of the sonship of man, of the 
eternal relationship of God and man. Then we shall be blessed, and 
God will look down upon us in mercy and give us strength to do the 
things that we are required to do, that we may win full salvation on 
this earth and in the life to come. 

AUTHORITATIVE LEADERSHIP 

Men ask for more than a knowledge of God. Men do not know 
the truth of themselves. Men are suffering, hungering for authoritative 
leadership. Men have been led by men so long, churches have been 
made by man so often, things have come through human agencies for 
so many years, that in this day of high intelligence, of the greatest 
knowledge of the world, men resent the thought that when they deal 
with the greatest of all realities, religion and all that pertains to it, 
they must follow man-made leadership — leadership that is of one type 
in one church, of another type in another church ; leadership that may 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be subject to parliamentary debate and rule, that may be determined 
by the voice of a community. 

The world is hungering and reaching out for authoritative leader- 
ship. Mankind has long followed the prophets of old, which indeed 
have been of human service, but today men say : "Moses was a great 
prophet ; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Malachi, were all great prophets, but they 
belong to the past. We live today. We want the same authoritative 
leadership today that was enjoyed by the people of the past." 

The world is asking for a living prophet, one who can interpret the 
prophets of old "to the people and generations of this day. We have 
this very offering to make to the world. We are able to give humanity 
what they need in the way of authoritative leadership; for we declare 
in all solemnity, without hesitation, that God not only spoke to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, but conferred upon him the power and author- 
ity of the eternal, everlasting, unchangeable, indestructible Priesthood 
of Almighty God, the power by which the heavens were made, and 
the earth was made, and all the things we know were made. By that 
power, or the portion that was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
work that the Lord intended for the salvation of mankind will be 
established and conducted and continued until the purposes of the Lord 
have been completed. 

TEACEfERS OF THE WORLD 

The world is looking for such authority. We must stand upon 
our feet as men and as women possessing the true knowledge and 
authority of God, and teach it without hesitation to all the world. 
We are not to be taught of the world. We are the teachers of the 
world. We must be as interpreters, as men and women who, with 
full knowledge and authority, fit the knowledge of the world into the 
great scheme of salvation. 

The Lord said to the Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in the early days of the Church : 

"Again I say, hearken, ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed : 
Ye are not sent forth to be, taught, but to teach the children of men the things 
which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit. 

"And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall 
be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken." 

This is a wonderful message to all Latter-day Saints, to the 
Elders of Israel, who preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not 
here to be taught ; we are here to teach. Whatever offering of good the 
world may make to us, we must use in declaring faith and repentance 
and the other principles of the Gospel, and the consummation of the 
purposes of the Lord. We are not to be taught by the world. We 
are the teachers of the world. 

At the head of this Church stands a living prophet, one who speaks 
with authority. He is the mouth-piece of God to this generation. He 
is a man, it is true, as every prophet who has spoken, but a man who 
possesses the authority of the prophetic power, and who has the right, 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



61 



in this day, to interpret the things of humanity for the good of the 
cause of the Lord. 

We have the authority of the priesthood. We are teachers to all 
the world. As we magnify our commission and rise to the full possi- 
bilities of world teachers, we shall be blessed and made powerful. Joy 
will fill our hearts ; power will come to our hands, and the things that 
need to be done we shall be able to do. 

So run my thoughts as I consider the work that has been done 
in European lands during the last few years. I am happy that I have 
had the privilege of laboring in those lands. I am grateful to President 
Grant and his associates for that great privilege. 

THE SEARCH FOE ETERNAL TRUTH 

Men seek a religion that may be used in daily life, but they want 
that practical feligion tinged, suffused, mingled and mixed with 
eternal truth. They want everything in terms of the truth which has 
accumulated throughout the ages, and the truth which God has in his 
keeping to give to his children in the future. 

The purpose of man's life is happiness and joy. "Men are that 
they might have joy." A simple purpose, but difficult to attain, so the 
history of the world has shown. Yet, if we take eternal truth as the 
woof of the pattern, and human experience as the warp, just as we 
make a pattern of linen or of cotton, making truth go this way, 
and human experience the other way, then we shall weave into it that 
thing which we call human happiness, a joyful life— the desire of man 
since the world began. 

I pray the Lord to bless the Latter-day Saints, to bless each one 
of us within his own home, in his own place of residence, within his own 
field of labor, that we may rise to the authority, understanding and 
sacrifice that should be practiced by the people of this Church. May 
we all be messengers of joy to the people of the world, to assist in their 
redemption, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

' THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD 

In what I am about to say, I hope I shah have the Spirit of the 
Lord. It is all-important that we should possess that Spirit, whether 
we preach or sing or pray. Prayers unprompted by it do not ascend to 
Heaven; sermons uninspired by it fail to touch the heart of the 
hearer; and the songs that are sung in our worshiping assemblies, if 
not in tune with it, are but discords in the ear of Deity. 

GOD'S GREATEST GIFT 

The Savior, when instructing his disciples regarding the Sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper, told them to partake of it in remembrance 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of him, and he promised that if they remembered him they should have 
his Spirit to be with them. 

Why did he not promise them gold and silver, houses and lands, and 
all the other "good things of this world?" These were his to give; 
for "the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof," and he gives 
it to whomsoever he will. But he had something better to bestow than 
that which perishes with the using, and he wanted his dispicles, his 
choice friends, to have it. So he promised them the Holy Spirit — the 
power to lay hold upon eternal life, his greatest and most precious gift. 

A SPIRITUAL FEAST 

The Spirit of the Lord is the food of our spirits. Without it 
they would starve. In the Eucharist, as it is called, we partake of 
Christ ; but it is a spiritual, not a temporal, partaking. The bread and 
water, or bread and wine, used in that ordinance, are not, as some 
suppose, the . transubstantiated body and blood of our crucified Lord. 
They are but emblems, symbolizing his sacrificial atonement. "Eat, 
this is my body; drink, this is my blood"- — the alleged words of the 
Savior when instituting the Sacrament among his Jewish disciples, are 
to be interpreted, not literally, but figuratively. If not a mistranslation, 
they are certainly a misinterpretation. 

THE SOURCE OF LIFE AND LIGHT 

The Spirit of the Lord is the life and light of the world. It is 
the fountain of revelation, manifesting eternal truth and making known 
to man the mind and will of his Maker. 

"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of 
man, the things which .God hath prepared for them that love him." 

So says Paul the Apostle, and he adds: 

"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth 
all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of 
a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God 
knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God." (I Cor. 2:9-11.) 

And that Spirit is given to every member of the Church of Christ, 
so that he or she can comprehend divine purposes and be led and guided 
into all truth. The eye that sees not, the ear that hears not, the heart 
into which the things of God have not entered, are the eye and ear and 
heart of "the natural man," who "is an enemy to God," as the same 
Apostle declares. Those to whom the Spirit has revealed the Truth 
stand upon another plane entirely. 

LETTER AND SPIRIT 

The Spirit of the Lord interprets the Word of the Lord, and those 
who take that Spirit f or their guide cannot be deceived so long as they 
heed its promptings. If they do not heed, but allow their own selfish 
desires to influence them ; or if they take the dead letter for their guide, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



63 



and ignore the living spirit, they are liable to be led astray. "For the 
letter killeth but the spirit giveth life." (2 Cor. 3 :6.) 

The good old Bible, which the Latter-day Saints accept as "the 
word of God as far as it has been translated correctly," contains many 
passages which, if only the letter be relied upon and the spirit ignored, 
are bound to be of a misleading character. 

THE WORD MADE FLESH 

One instance has been cited, that pertaining to the Eucharist. 
Here is another. In the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. 
'John, its author is made to say : "No iman hath seen God at any time" 
(1 :18), a statement which, if taken literally, not only puts the Beloved 
Disciple in the attitude of disputing Moses and the prophets, but actually 
makes him contradict himself. For the very same chapter in which that 
surprising statement is found, opens with this declaration: "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word 
was God. * * * And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, 
(and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the 
Father), full of grace and truth." (1 :14.) Jesus Christ was God in 
the flesh. "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." 
(Col. 2 :9. ) And He was seen by multitudes of men. 

But long before the divine Word was "made flesh," men had 
seen God, and none knew it better than John. Adam had seen him, 
Enoch had walked with him, Abraham had conversed with him. 
Moses and Aaron, with Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of 
Israel, "went up into the mountain and saw the God of Israel." So 
says the Bible. But all this would have to be blotted out if the saying 
were literally true, that "no man hath seen God at any time." There 
could be no surer way of tearing out the foundations of the Christian 
religion and destroying all our hopes of salvation, than to establish as a 
fact this fallacy. 

In the Pearl of Great Price (Book of Moses 1:11) that prophet 
and seer, having seen God, tells how he saw him in these words : 
"Now mine own eyes have beheld God ; but not my natural, but my 
spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld ; for I should 
have withered and died in his presence ; but his glory was upon me ; and 
I beheld his face ; for I was transfigured before him." 

john's true meaning 

What John meant to say — and probably did say — was this: No 
man with his natural eyes hath seen God at any time. Or, as Joseph 
Smith puts it : "No man has seen God at any time, except quickened 
by the Spirit of God" — which means precisely the same thing. (Doc. - 
and Cov. 67:11.) That John was mistranslated, or misinterpreted, is 
evident. 

We all have spiritual eyes — the eyes of our spirits. By means of 
them we "walked by sight" and "kept the first estate" — our pre-existent 
spirit life; thus earning the right to a second estate — this mortal life, 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



where we "walk by faith," with our spirit sight temporarily obscured. 
But when a seer is needed, "a choice seer," God sends one into the 
world ; puts his power upon him, and thus enables him to use his spirit 
eyes and "see out of obscurity," to behold (God if need be, and to 
comprehend the things of God in the only way that they can be com- 
prehended. Such a seer was Moses, and such a seer was Joseph Smith. 
They both saw God. 

SPIRITUAL THINGS SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED 

It is not man's native intelligence nor his scholastic culture, that 
enables him to understand spiritual things. They are spiritually dis- 
cerned, and the Spirit that discerns them can be had only in one way — ■ 
God's way, not man's. Hence, after faith, repentance and water 
baptism, comes spirit baptism, whereby the Holy Ghost is given to 
those who become members of the Church of Christ. 

The things of God should be surveyed by the light of the Spirit of 
God, not by the flickering candle of human wisdom. In our attitude 
toward divine revelations, the laws and ordinances of the Gospel, we 
should never take a shallow, material dollar-and-cent view, but always 
the higher, broader, deeper, spiritual view. 

A CASE IN POINT 

Many years ago, when I was a Ward Bishop, I was sitting with 
my counselors one evening for the settlement of tithing. A brother 
who was a member of the Ward came in, tossed a roll of bills upon the 
table, and when asked the usual question, "Is this a full tithing?"- — 
a question necessary at such times, in order that the reports may be full 
and accurate — he answered, "No it is not; but you may be thankful 
to get that much." 

"Thankful," I echoed, "What makes you. think I ought to be 
thankful for it? You are not paying it to me. I am only an agent 
to receive and pass it on to the higher authorities. I am glad, of 
course, to know that you pay your tithing even in part; but I do not 
see why I should thank you for it. I pay my tithing in full, but nobody 
thanks me, nor do I want any thanks for it. I esteem it a privilege." 

WHEN THANKS ARE OUT OF PLACE 

Now, I believe in commendation and encouragement. I love to 
hear kind and generous expressions of appreciation for any good thing 
well done by anybody. But I do not believe in thanking people for 
keeping the commandments of God, nor for rendering service to him 
in any capacity. We do not thank them for coming into the Church. 
We rejoice over them, but a vote of thanks in such a case would be 
ridiculous. And it is just so with other things. To hold office in the 
Church of Christ is a great honor — none greater. A vote of thanks 
could add nothing to it, and would be entirely out of place. 

We do not confer a favor upon the Almighty by obeying his 
laws, by receiving his blessings ; though we please him, no doubt, by so 
doing. And when we stand before him at the last day, having "come 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



65 



up through great tribulation" and made our calling and election sure, 
I think I can hear Him say: "Well done, good and faithful servant, 
or good and faithful handmaid — enter into the joy of thy Lord." But 
I cannot by any stretch of imagination, conceive Him as saying: 
"Thank you, my child, for coming to Heaven!" 



Now, as to the Law of Tithing. What we render in obedience to 
that divine law, is not ours ; it belongs to the Lord. We may consider 
it ours, if we will, up to the point of dropping it into his treasury; 
but right there even our apparent ownership ends. And it is unseemly 
in anyone to consider it his or hers, or to complain of the use made of 
it by the Lord's servants, those appointed by him to receive and 
disburse it according to his will as made known to them. 

Moreover — and this is the great desideratum — the main fact to 
which I wish to call attention. You know it as well as I do, but we 
all need reminding. When we obey the Law of Tithing we do it not 
to please men, but to honor God, and we draw from Him, in return, a 
spiritual dividend far more precious and of much greater consequence 
than the dollars and cents or other means that we part with in rendering 
unto the Lord his own. 



The Law of Tithing is sometimes referred to as the revenue law 
of the Church — and such it is; for it provides means to carry on the 
Church's work in some of its most important phases. But in taking 
that view, let us not lose sight of a higher consideration. The Law of 
Tithing was given to supersede, for the time being, a greater law 
known as the Law of Consecration, the object of which was and is 
to sanctify the Lord's people and "prepare them for a place in the 
celestial world." To that end it was designed to do away with selfish- 
ness, greed, pride, envy, poverty, and all the ills that spring from such 
conditions. For none of these things can be admitted into the kingdom 
of heaven. It was to institute an order of equality and consequent 
unity, in which every man, employed at that for which he was best 
fitted, would be "seeking the interest of his neighbor and doing all 
things with an eye single to the glory of God." It is an ancient law. 
It was practised By Enoch and his people, and later by the Apostles and 
their proselytes at Jerusalem, and by the followers of Christ, both 
Nephites and Lamanites, upon this chosen land. A brave attempt to 
practise it was made by the Latter-day Saints, soon after this Church 



rise to the occasion. Selfishness within, and persecution without, 
prevented a perfect achievement. So the Lord withdrew the Law of 
Consecration and gave to his people a lesser law, one easier to live, 
but pointing forward, like the other, to something grand and glorious 
in the future. That lesser law, the Law of Tithing, is as a schoolmaster, 
a disciplinary agent, to bring the Saints eventually up to the practise 
of the higher law, and meanwhile to keep their hearts open for its re-

THE LAW OF CONSECRATION

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ception when it returns. Those who obey the Law of Tithing 
will be prepared to (live the Law of Consecration. Those who 
do not obey it will not be prepared. That is the whole thing in 
a nut shell. We are tithed that the iChurch may have means 
to build and maintain temples and tabernacles, to found and sustain 
missions and schools, and otherwise carry on its great work throughout 
the world. But that is not all. The spiritual dividend that we draw 
from heaven as the reward of our obedience, is the principal purpose 
for which the Law of Tithing was instituted. All* the rest is'incidental 
or secondary. 

WHY WE FAST 

The same argument applies to fasting. We are not required to 
fast merely to provide the bishop with means whereby to feed or 
otherwise minister to the poor. That is not the main object. We fast, 
primarily, for the purity of heart, the clearness of mind, the spiritual 
strength and uplift that comes from the observance of this sacred 
requirement. We are benefited physically, mentally and morally, by 
temporarily abstaining from bodily food, and thereby securing the 
spiritual food that more than takes its place. And, as an indirect 
result of our act of self-denial, the bishop, by means of the fast offerings 
(which should equal the cost of the food ordinarily used during the 
fasting period) is enabled to care for the poor that we "have always 
with us," and always shall have until God's higher law is practised by 
his people and there shall be "no poor among them." 

BODY AND SPIRIT 

The body as well as the spirit is essential. The two combined, 
"inseparably connected" by the resurrection, constitute the immortal 
soul ; and it is the soul that goes on to perfection — the Gospel's para- 
mount aim from the beginning. But the spiritual is above the temporal, 
the substance greater than the shadow that follows it ; and happy is the 
man who recognizes this truth and honors the divine injunction : "Seek 
ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things 
(food, drink, clothing, etc.) shall be added unto you." 

THE SICK WORLD'S PANACEA 

What do you suppose is the matter with this sick world at the 
present time? And what is the panacea that will restore it to perfect 
health? The matter is, that it has turned away from God and exalted 
the material over the spiritual. Like the dog in the fable, crossing the 
brook with a piece of meat in his mouth, and losing it in an attempt to 
possess what looked like another piece of meat in the mouth of another 
dog, but which was only a vain reflection of himself in the water — 
even so this selfish, greedy, money-loving world has grasped at the 
shadow and lost the substance. As a result the Ship of Human Pro- 
gress is lopsided and in danger of going on the rocks. The cargo, 
unevenly bestowed, has unbalanced the vessel, and the pilot has been 
thrown overboard. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 67 

Right the ship, ye would-be arbiters of human destiny ! Right 
the ship! Put the temporal under hatches, and place the spiritual at 
the helm, where it belongs ; and the danger will disappear. That is 
the panacea, and there will be no relief — no permanent relief from the 
evils that afflict and threaten this world, until that sovereign remedy 
is applied; until proud, self-sufficient man, acknowledging his own 
weakness and his own folly, turns to (the Source of all power and all 
wisdom, in response to the sweet invitation of the Savior: "Come 
unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden ! and I will give you 
rest." Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish to read for the benefit of our distinguished guest, Dr. 
Barnard, the following : i i 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ, the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, 
the sin be upon the heads of the parents. 

"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes 
which are organized. 

"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And. they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it 
holy. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as 
they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in 
remembrance before the Lord. 

"Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there 
are idlers among them." 

We very much appreciate having our eminent visitor here, and 
would have been happy had he seen fit to make further remarks. 

As a closing number, the iChoir sang the anthem, "The Heavens Are 
Telling." i 

After the benediction, which was pronounced by Elder Walter A. 
Jensen of the Lost River Stake, Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

SECOND DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference commenced promptly at 
2 o'clock p. m. 

The attendance at this meeting was similar in number to that at 
the'mormng meeting. 

President Heber J. Grant, who presided, in calling the meeting 
to order announced that: the Tabernacle Choir and. the congregation 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



would sing the hymn, "Praise to the Man Who Communed With 
Jehovah." 

After the singing, Elder 'Henry W. Henderson, President of the 
Pocatello Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

The Choir then rendered the anthem, "Send Ye Swift Messengers." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I believe that I realize as much as I ever did the responsibility which 
is upon me in standing here to address this assembly. It is a great 
honor to have this privilege. It is also a great responsibility, for I 
realize that those who occupy this position at a General Conference of 
the Church should have something to say that will be edifying, strength- 
ening and encouraging, that will build up the members of the Church 
in their faith. 

I pray that I may, have the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord, and 
your faith and prayers, for the few moments that I stand here. 

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL 

I have rejoiced in the admonition, the testimony, and the presenta- 
tion of the principles of the Gospel, as they have been declared by our 
brethren who have spoken. In my heart I feel thankful that I have 
the opportunity of living in this day, when the Gospel in its fulness, 
its simplicity and jts power, is on the earth. Today all men have the 
opportunity of receiving the truth, for the Gospel is being proclaimed 
among the nations of the earth and the privilege is granted to those 
who repent and accept the Gospel of receiving the remission of their 
sins, through the ordirfance of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
through the laying on of hands of those who have the authority of 
the holy priesthood. The Lord has made the promise to all who will 
repent and remain faithful, exercising a spirit of humility and diligence, 
that they will be entitled to the guidance of the Spirit of God. Tthis 
Spirit will lead them and direct them throughout their lives. 

TO AVOID DECEPTION 

We are living, as it has already been stated, in a day of trouble, of 
tribulation, when men's hearts are failing them. The Lord pointed 
out this day while in his ministry, and admonished by prophecy those 
living now to watch and pray, that they might not be led astray, that 
they might not be found unprepared, should they be so fortunate as to 
be here at the great day of his coming. 

Much has been said by way of warning and for the guidance of this 
people by the previous speakers, so that we may be prepared to discern 
between truth and falsehood, and that we may detect those who speak 
falsely and do not love the truth. I would like to present another 
phase of this matter, because I feel that it is timely. Several times 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 69 

within the past three months I have been approached by individuals 
and have received communications through the mails, making inquiry- 
concerning a certain purported revelation said to have been given many 
years ago to President Joseph F. Smith, in which he saw the destruc- 
tion of many great cities and many countries of the world and other 
very unusual things. Inquiry has also been made regarding a pur- 
ported vision given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in relation to the 
same things, and which has been in circulation for many years. It is 
evident that these things are again being circulated and many of the 
people are becoming agitated over them wondering if they are true or 
not, and some of the people have been deceived. 

BRANDED AS FALSE BY PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 

At the October Conference of the Church in the year 1918, which 
was the last General Conference attended by President Joseph F. Smith. 
I made some remarks in relation to these two so-called visions and 
pointed out the fact that they were not true. At the close of my 
remarks President Smith arose and also spoke of them. Let me say 
that this communication that has come into my hands recently, and 
about which I have been asked for advice, was being circulated very 
extensively at that time. It is a purported revelation given to Joseph 
F. Smith many years ago. 

As I have said, at the close of my remarks at that General Con- 
ference of the Church, President Smith arose and said : 

"Again I feel that it is an opportunity for me to say a few words. This 
wonderful, mysterious revelation, that I have been said to have received a great 
many years ago, was given in French, and I never knew but two or three words 
in French in my life. Consequently I could not have been the originator of that 
revelation. I want you to understand that I have denied it, I suppose a hundred 
times, when people have inquired about it. It was gotten up by some mysterious 
person who undertook to create a sensation, and laid the responsibility upon 
me. I am not guilty. When the Lord reveals something to me I will consider 
the matter with my brethren. When it becomes proper I will let it be known 
to the 1 people, and not otherwise. 

"The ridiculous story about the red horse, and the black horse, and the white 
horse, and a lot of trash, that has been circulated and sent around as a great 
revelation given by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is a matter that was gotten up, 
I understand, some ten years after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, by 
two of our brethren, who put together some broken sentences from the-Prophet 
that they may have heard him utter from time to time, and formulated this 
so-called revelation out of it; and it was never spoken by the Prophet in the 
manner in which they have put it forth. It is simply false, that is all there is to it." 

Now, I think we are, fortunate in having President Smith's own 
expression in regard to these purported revelations. It seems strange to 
me that now, some twelve years later, we still find them in circulation. 
But the thing that astonishes me more is the fact that members of the 
Church seem to be bewildered and in wonderment whether or not 
these purported revelations were indeed given to the Prophet Joseph 
and to President Joseph F. Smith. 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

FALSE SPIRITS IN THE EARTH 

In a revelation given to the Church in May, 1831, when matters 
of a similar kind were being circulated among the people, the Lord said : 

"Hearken, ye elders of my Church, and give ear to the voice of the living 
God; and attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you, 
according as ye have asked and are agreed as touching the Church, and the 
spirits which have gone abroad in the earth. 

"Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits which are false 
spirits, which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world. 

"And also Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you." 

Then the revelation goes on further to give instructions in regard 
to the receiving of revelations, and the duty of members of the Church 
in regard to matters of this kind. 

A KEY FOR OUR GUIDANCE 

I would like to say, for the benefit of the members of the Church, 
that we have a key given us by revelation, by which false spirits may 
be known, by which false revelation may be known. There is only 
one man in this Church, at a time, who has the right to receive revelation 
for the Church. The Lord has said that his house is a house of order, 
not a house of confusion, and therefore one is appointed to speak. 
One has the right to receive the word of the Lord and give it to the 
Church. We all have the right to receive revelation for our own 
guidance. A president of a Stake has the right of revelation for the 
guidance of his Stake. But no man has the right to receive revelation 
for this Church, except the one whom the Lord has called. If he 
receives a revelation it will be declared without question, if it is in- 
tended for the Church, in a manner by which we may iall know the) 
source from whence it comes. And when we find people secretly 
distributing what are said to be revelations, or visions, or manifesta- 
tions, that have not come from nor received the approval of the 
Authorities of the Church, we may put it down that such things are 
not of God. 

We do not need to write to ask questions in regard to these things. 
We do not need to question them for a moment, because the Lord is 
not going to give a revelation to any high priest, any elder, or seventy, 
for this Church. It will come through the one who is so appointed. 
And if the Lord is not going to choose those who have standing in 
the quorums of the priesthood, you may be certainly assured that he is 
not going to choose some one who does not hold the priesthood at all. 
So our minds may be at rest in regard to matters of this kind. 

BY THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH 

Furthermore, in this same revelation to which I have made refer- 
ence, the Lord also says : , 

"Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that 
receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth, receiveth it as it is preached by the 
Spirit of truth? 



I 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH • 71 

"Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, 
and both are edified and rejoice together. 

"And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. 

"That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth 
in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until 
the perfect day." ' ■ 

Now, think of that. If we will follow the spirit of light, the spirit 
of truth, the spirit that is set forth in the revelations of the ,Lord ; if 
we will, through the spirit cff prayer and humility, seek for the guidance 
of the jHoly Ghost, the Lord will increase our light and our .under- 
standing ; so that we shall have the spirit of discernment, we shall under- 
stand the truth, we shall know falsehood when we see it, and we shall 
. not be deceived, j 

Who is it that is deceived in this Church? Not the. man who 
has been faithful in the discharge pf duty ; not the man who has made 
himself acquainted with the word of the Lord ; not the man who has 
practiced the commandments given in these revelations ; but the man 
who is not acquainted with the truth, the man who is in spiritual 
darkness, the man who does ^not comprehend and understand the 
principles of the (Gospel. Such a man will be deceived, and when these 
false spirits come among us he may not understand br be able to dis- 
tinguish between light and darkness. 

But if we will walk in the light of the revelations of the Lord, 
if we will hearken to the counsels that are given by those who stand 
in the councils of the Church, empowered to give the instructions, we 
will not go astray. 

"whoso treasureth up ,my word" 

In the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, as the Lord revealed 
it to the Prophet Joseph Smith, not as you find it in the Bible, but as 
you find it in the Pearl of Great Price, we find this expression: 

"And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of 
Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound 
of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from 
the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." 

I repeat : "And whoso treasureth up buy word shall not 'be deceived." 
Therefore let us go to with our might in the labor of this Church, and ( 
in the study and understanding of the (principles of the 'Gospel, these 
principles of light, and as we study them the Lord will reveal to us 
further light, until we shall receive the fulness, in due time, of the 
perfect day, and we shall not be under the necessity of being subject 
to doubt and seeking for advice when confronted by matters of this 
kind, because the Spirit of the Lord itself will teach us. 

The day is coming, so Jeremiah says, when it will not be necessary 
for one man to teach his neighbor, saying, "Know the Lord," for they 
all know him, from the greatest to the least. And that will come when 
we, in all full purpose of heart, are willing to serve the Lord and keep 
his commandments and hearken to the counsels that come to us from

those who preside ; which I pray we will do, in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

THE WORLD'S GREAT NEED 

The greatest need of the world today is religion. The greatest 
need of the people ,of the United States is religion. At this moment 
mankind needs most the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The heavens have 
been opened, the voice of the Lord has been heard, the angel spoken of 
has flown through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, 
"Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come." 

To supply this vital need, the Department of Education, under 
the direction of the Presidency of the Church, has prepared a course 
in religious instruction to be given side by side with the training 
of the public schools. 

ASSIGNMENT OF WORK 

To the Primary organization has been assigned the task of giving 
this religious instruction to the children of the first six grades. In 
the junior seminaries, religious education is given to the children of the 
7th, 8th and 9th grades ; in the seminary, to those who attend high 
school ; and institutes are being established to give a proper appreciation 
of religious truth to our sons and daughters who go to college. 

ATTITUDE OF COLLEGE MEN 

The indifference, if not the actual antagonism, toward religion on 
the part of many who are college-trained, is due primarily to the fact 
that their religious education has been neglected. Their religious ideals 
and motives have not been developed along with the growth of ideas 
and ideals in science, literature, and the arts. Our aim, therefore, is 
to produce a generation of college men and women who will understand, 
appreciate, and enjoy Gospel incentives, motives, and ideals, with the 
same interest, enthusiasm, and devotion that they develop for the new 
ideas they acquire in science, literature, and art. 

IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT 

To any who regard training in science, language, and mathematics 
as most valuable, I put these questions : Is not religion more weighty 
than other subjects? Is not character of more consequence than a 
knowledge of science? Honesty of greater moment than a knowledge 
of mathematics? Dependability more important than a knowledge of 
languages ? 

Give your children all the training you can in these other subjects, 
but see to it that along with their school instruction they are given this 
most valuable branch of education — a study of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, a study of the life and teachings of our Lord and Savior. For 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



73 



the prime purpose of this line of Gospel education, this training in 
religion, is to make people happier and better. 

FAITH IS THE BASIS 

Let me make it clear and definite that religion is not founded 
primarily on logic ; religion is founded on faith. Faith, like electricity, 
is hard to define; but, like electricity, it has tremendous power. Faith 
is that satisfying something which comes into humble human hearts 
as a result of prayerful life and righteous living. 

Affection, like faith, is not based on the logical operations of the 
human mind. It does not obey the dictates of the will, neither is it 
controlled hy the rules of logic. 

HAPPINESS THE AIM 

We are endeavoring to teach faith — faith in our fellowmen, faith 
in God, faith in a life beyond ,the grave. 

It is said that the most lonely, lonesome, and unhappy individual 
is he who says he does not know — the man who has no faith in God, 
no faith in a life beyond. We are aiming so to bring up our young 
folks that they will escape the unhappiness of unbelief. And while 
the faith of which I speak is not often created by reason, nevertheless 
reason can justify this faith, and can ward off attacks which may be 
made upon it. In the language of the scripture (Heb. 11 :1), "Faith 
is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." 

. HONESTY MEANS PROGRESS 

Outstanding among the elements in the Gospel plan is common, 
every-day honesty. "Wie believe in being honest." 

Men who do not keep their word, who fail to fulfil their contracts, 
or who can scarcely do business without cheating, are men who obstruct 
the progress and prosperity of the country. 

Imagine a community made up of such people. However gifted 
they might be mentally, they could not prosper ; one man could not 
trust another. Nothing could be bought or sold without the closest 
inspection. There could be no cooperation. Everyone would have to 
spend a great deal of time watching his dishonest neighbors. Honesty, 
therefore, when it is practised by an entire community, is a great labor- 
saving device. 

Lincoln's chief trait, sail his life long, was honesty. Pervasive 
honesty was the outstanding mark of his personality. From the begin- 
ning to the end it stayed with him. "When other traits seemed to 
be changing, this universal honesty w&s always there." (Morse.) 

NOBILITY OF HONOR 

Our nation is united in teaching Boy Scouts the value, the nobility, 
of honesty and of honor. "On my honor I will do my best to do my 
duty to God and my country." This is their chief lesson. 

"I .cannot do so in honor." With these words — words which will 
be remembered forever — King Albert of Belgium refused to let the 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



German army pass through his country. As long as there are mothers' 
tongues to teach their children, just so long will mothers hold up with 
pride and commendation the honor, the honesty, the integrity, of the 
Belgian people, who, against Itremendous odds, "stood to their guns and 
maintained their honor, intact and immortal." (Van Dyke.) 

Our own Karl G. Maeser had the highest regard for honor. 
Though a great teacher of science and literature, he was most of all 
an instructor in the Gospel, a builder of character. He used to say: 
"'Place me behind prison walls ever so high, ever so thick, ever so 
strong, yet in some way, at some time, I may escape ; but draw a chalk 
line around me and have me give my word of honor not to cross it, 
can I ever escape ? No, never ! I die (first !" / 

WHY AMERICA HAS PROSPERED 

Our country has had a growth and prosperity no other country has 
ever known. These unusual blessings have come because of honor, 
honesty, dependability — qualities which religious training brought into 
the lives of the people. 

While many of our countrymen who are rich ridicule religion, a 
wise man (Babson) has said that these same prosperous Americans are 
indebted for all they possess to the family prayers once held daily in 
the homes of their fathers. 

SOBRIETY INDISPENSABLE 

Next to honesty, one of the most important elements in the Gospel 
is sobriety. 

"In the rudimentary state of society," says Carver, "where each individual 
worked and acted most of the time alone, and where, therefore, there was little 
interdependence, drunkenness was not so vicious as it has now become. But in 
our interlocking civilization, no personal habit or vice, except lying, so unfits 
a man for useful service as does drunkenness. If you had to take your choice 
between riding behind a locomotive engineer addicted to drunkenness, and 
addicted to any other vice, there is not much doubt as to which you would choose. 

"Apply a similar test to anyone in any other responsible position, and you 
will reach the conclusion that the person who is addicted to drink is about 
the least dependable, and the least desirable, citizen you can name. There are 
fewer places where he is of use and more places where he is a menace than is 
the case with the victims of almost any other vice." 

THE HIGH VIRTUES 

Honor, honesty, dependability, sobriety — these rank high among 
the virtues. Living in accordance with them has brought to our country 
a growth, a prosperity, unknown to other nations. 

Before taking public office in state or nation, every official is 
required solemnly to swear that he will support, obey, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of his own State. 

It is said that among our public officials there are some who hold 
their hands toward high heaven and take this sacred oath of office one 
day, and break their solemn pledge the next. The story of Wash- 
ington and the cherry tree told to every American child, the honesty 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 75 

of Abraham Lincoln told to every American youth, the OBoy Scout 
oath, the honor of King Albert of Belgium, the sterling worth and 
character of our own Dr. Maeser — these in the past have been the 
standards of our country. Have our ideals changed ? Have we given 
up these old-fashioned virtues? Do some public officials have no 
regard for the most solemn oath that public men can take ? Are there 
officials who regard the Constitution of the United States as only a 
scrap of paper,? Can this nation — the land of Washington, Franklin, 
Lincoln, Roosevelt, Wilson — the nation founded on honor, honesty, 
and dependability — can it endure if this undermining of its very 
foundation continues? I say it cannot. Nothing enduring can be 
built upon falsehood. Without honor, without honesty, without de- 
pendability, no nation can stand. 

A PLEDGE TO OUR COUNTRY 

I have personally made a solemn public pledge not to participate 
in any function, social or otherwise, where the law is broken — I refer 
particularly to the prohibition law ; and furthermore I am working on 
a program whose purpose is to seek out those who also are willing to 
invite good citizens to come to the support of the Constitution of the 
United States. 

You who are willing to cooperate are invited to get signatures 
to the following pledge : 

I hereby pledge to the Republic of the United States and to myself : 

1. Not to participate in any function, social or otherwise, where 
the law is broken. 

2. Not knowingly to cast my vote for any candidate who does not 
live in accordance with the law. 

WHAT ONE INDIVIDUAL MAY ACCOMPLISH 

The influence of a single person who will live in accordance with 
the law and who will work to get others to do likewise is effective and 
far-reaching. 

A few examples : 

"Mr. Chairman, since I stand with Abraham Lincoln for the law," said 
one committee member, "and, further, since I have pledged myself, as have 
President and Mrs. Hoover, not to participate in any function iwhere the law is 
broken, if you are going to serve liquor on this occasion, I shall ask to be 
excused from this meeting." 

The liquor was not served. 

"But just a minute," said one of those who had been invited. "I do not 
desire to create a scene at your fine ;dinner, nor do 1 i.wish to make myself 
appear ridiculous or non-appreciative; therefore, if liquor is to be served, I shall 
ask lyou now !to excuse me, since I cannot in honor participate in a function 
where the law is broken." 

No liquor was served. 

A WHOLE CONVENTION RESPONDS 

At a convention recently, where nearly a thousand delegates were 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



registered, wine was served in unlimited quantities. Before the next 
convention, one member wrote the following to the officials of the 
organization: "I am for the law. I appeal to you to recommend to 
the Society that at our next meeting we pass a resolution informing 
the people of the United States that this Society stands for the Constitu- 
tion and the laws of- our country ; and that, while some of our members 
may not like the Prohibition law, yet while it remains on our statute 
books we pledge ourselves to live in accordance with its provisions 
and to assist the President and other officials in their efforts to enforce 
it." 

No liquor was in evidence at the next convention. 

If one prominent business or social leader who breaks the law 
were placed behind prison bars, this one act would create for the law 
an immediate respect so strong that it would reform a whole city. 

A CALL TO PATRIOTS 

Thus, "in these last days," and "from the top of the mountains," 
as a representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
I appeal to the people of the country to come to the support of the 
Constitution of the United States. 

And in accordance with the motto of our nation may we in God 
so trust that "government of the people, by the people, and for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth." 

At the request of President' Grant, the Choir and congregation arose 
and sang the first verse of the hymn, "The Spirit of God Like a Fire 
is Burning." 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, to be present upon 
this occasion. I don't remember having ever attended a Conference 
that was more blessed of the Lord. I have been thrilled with the 
testimonies and remarks of all the brethren, and with all the songs that 
have been sung. The Spirit of 'the Lord, and the spirit of the Gospel 
have touched my heart in testimony of their divinity. 

I am thankful for the wonderful privilege of associating with 
men who the Lord has chosen to stand in the leadership of the 
Church in this important time of the world. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH SACRIFICES OF OTHERS 

For several months past, about the most important meetings of a 
public character which I have attended have been funerals. I have 
attended a number of them of late, due to the fact that a great number 
of my relatives have recently passed away. . At these services, of course, 
the addresses and the remarks of the brethren have been largely 
tempered with the spirit and teaching relative to the resurrection, the 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



77 



great mission of life, and the great blessings that have come to the 
human family through the atonement of Jesus Christ. 

I am always impressed with the spirit of devotion and humility 
when I hear my brethren and my friends speak in remembrance of the 
great experiences, sometimes called sacrifices, which our parents and 
forefathers endured, that we, as younger members of the Church 
might enjoy the multiplicity of blessings and privileges of the present 
time, for many faithful souls gave their, lives for the cause of this 
Gospel. 

Personally, I am grateful for the blessings which have come to me, 
because of the sacrifices of others. I feel my unworthiness of the 
great blessings that have come to me, the great privileges and oppor- 
tunities, especially the responsibilities. I do not say this in any manner 
of boasting, but I wish to say it by way of reporting the growth of the 
Church as seen from my particular viewpoint. 

HELPED BY PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS 

I think my predecessor, the late John Smith, holds the record in 
point of time for any officer holding one position in the Church. He 
was Presiding Patriarch for over fifty-six years. During that time 
he was instrumental in administering to members of the Church some- 
thing over twenty-one thousand recorded blessings. During the last 
nineteen years nearly twenty-one thousand recorded blessings stand to 
my credit in the office. 

A great many faithful Latter-day Saints are struggling with their 
responsibilities in life. Many times they have come to the office, fasting, 
with a prayer of faith and a keen desire for help to guide them in 
handling those responsibilities. And in their patriarchal blessings 
many have received the desired consolation. 

ANSWERS TO PRAYERS 

I am grateful for the faith and the prayers of the members of 
the Church. I believe in prayer. I know that the Lord hears and 
answers prayer. I have heard little children pray, and almost im- 
mediately have seen the answers come. I have seen adults and older 
people pray with faith, and have seen immediate and soul-satisfying 
results. I am converted to the devotion and the practice of prayer. 
I believe in it, and I practice it myself. I teach my children to pray. 
They pray for others as well as for themselves. My children, all of 
them, pray for the President of this Church, and for his associates, for 
the members of the Church, for the missionaries, for the sick and for 
all who need the favors of the Lord. 

Through the kindness of the Lord, a great many testimonies have 
come to us in our home relative to the answering of our prayers. I 
will not take your time to tell these stories, but our family history is 
replete with testimonies that are soul-satisfying, relative to the answering 
of our prayers. So I believe in prayer. 

I thank you for your prayers, my brethren and sisters. I have 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



felt the benefit myself. I am very grateful to you personally for your 
faith and prayers. , 

I regret very much that I am physically unable at the present 
time, and have been for some time past, to visit with the people, and 
to carry on my duties as I would like to do. However, I feel very 
grateful that my strength is returning, and I hope to be able soon to 
discharge my duties in full. 

I pray that the Lord will bless you, my brethren and sisters, 
throughout the Stakes, Wards, and Missions, and in the auxiliary 
organizations. My heart is filled with blessings for your success, for 
your happiness, for your peace in carrying on the great work. 

A STRIKING EXAMPLE 

I realize that we are living in a peculiar time, when conditions are 
not just as we would like to have them : many are out of employment. 

A very striking example came to me only a few days ago. A 
convert to the Church, a well educated man, who was trained for the 
ministry in one of the religious organizations of the land, left his family 
at home in Canada, .and came here to Salt Lake City, where he received 
his patriarchal blessing. After searching in vain for employment he 
decided to "hike" back home, a distance of two thousand miles, which 
he covered in eight days, he reports. He found his patriarchal blessing 
of great value in overcoming his despair. He acknowledged the hand 
of the Lord in his blessings, for he realized that he had been spared and 
blessed ; and that he and the Church were still good friends. 

This example is only one of thousands who manifest faith in their 
blessings and who acknowledge the Lord as the Giver of them. 

FOR COMFORT AND BENEFIT 

I commend to you the faith and the devotion of the good men 
who are authorized, in the Church, to administer the ordinance of 
patriarchal blessings. These blessings are for those who understand 
them and who have a knowledge of their use and value in the Church. 
They are indeed valuable instruments for the comfort and benefit of 
faithful members of the Church. 

My heart is filled with sympathy and a desire to bless the entire 
membership of the Church, to see the Lord's work prosper, and to 
see faith increase in the hearts of our fellow members. 

I pray the Lord to magnify, bless, inspire, protect, preserve, and 
spare those who preside over the Church and who stand as its leaders 
today. 

BLESSES THE PEOPLE 

In the name of the Lord, I bless you all with peace and with pros- 
perity, notwithstanding the uncertainty of things at the present time. You 
will go to your homes, and plant, cultivate, and reap, but not in vain, for 
the harvest will be satisfying and satisfactory; the blessings of the 
Lord will be upon your lands, and upon your possessions, and upon 
your faithful labors. Therefore, be honest with the Lord in your 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



79 



tithes and in your offerings ; that the great promises concerning this land 
and its people may be fulfilled. 

I pray God to grant these blessings, that they may be upon the 
Church, its leaders and its members, and all the organizations in the 
Church, to the honor and glory of the Lord and his work, and I do it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In his farewell address to the American people George Washington 

said : 

"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion 
and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the 
tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human 
happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. _ ■ 

"Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds 
of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that 
national morality can prevail in the exclusion of religious principle. 

"Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be main- 
tained without religion." 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

"Simon, sou of Jonas, lovest thou me?" 
"Lord, thou knowest that I love thee." 
"Feed my lambs." 

"Jesus said to him the second time : "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me ? 
* * * Feed my sheep." 

This was one of the last and one of the most important injunctions 
that Jesus gave his apostles, following the resurrection. The Savior's 
charge to watch over the flock and to feed the lambs is as applicable at 
the present time as it was in the days of Peter. The Church of Christ 
must particularly accept this responsibility. 

During the few moments that I stand before you I desire to direct 
your attention to the work that the Church can do in this regard and at 
the same time co-operate in the great national movement of Child Health 
and Protection. 

THE LOST AND' FOUND 

In the fifteenth chapter of St. Luke there is recorded a very signifi- 
cant message from Christ, relative to the lost and found. That message 
is embraced in three remarkable parables, one the parable of the lost 
sheep ; another, the lost coin ; and a third, the prodigal son. 

In the first the straying one seems to have become lost through 
stupidly wandering away for the necessary things of 'life. Perhaps the 
wandering was prompted by just a desire to seek the necessary things 
of existence. 

The second, however, relates to a different kind of lost one — -one 
that seems to be wholly unconscious of having wandered away ; and the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



third, to another class, one who deliberately and wilfully becomes 
estranged from- God. 

I am not sure that I have applied these parables properly, but 
certainly there are just such classes of young men and young women 
who wander away and become lost. There are those in the world who 
become so absorbed in gaining a livelihood, and so interested in the 
material things of life, that they lose ;sight entirely of the religious 
ideals, the significance of which President Grant has just called to our 
attention, as other speakers have during this important Conference. 

Of the second class, those who are unconscious of being in the 
dark, there are many such — speaking of the nation at large. It is ad- 
mitted that in the United States there are twenty-seven million children 
who, though nominally Protestant, are not receiving any religious in- 
struction. There are eight million children, if I remember rightly, less 
than ten years of age, who receive absolutely no religious instruction. 
I think we may consistently place this large group in the second class 
named, — little children growing up in darkness, unconscious of the 
light. They are like this Easter lily before it blooms. They have an 
existence but are struggling out of the darkness of humanity. They 
may never Hoom into the sunlight of the Holy Spirit. Now, that is a 
tragedy. 

Of the third, we see around us every day young men who wilfully 
and deliberately choose the pathway of indulgence, which leads them 
away from the Holy Spirit, and leads them away from the testimony 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is a great mission, the greatest in 
the world, to reach out after these young people, to extend a hand to 
the child, following Jesus' injunction to Peter to bring the lambs into 
Christ's fold. Indeed, there is nothing greater. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH A MISSION 

I think the President of the United States expressed the importance 
of such a mission most impressively when he said : 

"These questions of child health and protection are a complicated problem, 
requiring much learning and much action, and we need have great concern over 
this matter. Let no one believe that these are questions which should not stir 
a nation, that they are below the dignity of statesmen or government. If we 
could have but one generation of properly born, trained, educated, and healthy 
children, a thousand other problems of government would vanish. We would 
assure ourselves of healthier minds in more vigorous bodies, to direct the 
energies of our nation to yet greater heights of achievement. Moreover, one 
good community nurse will save a dozen future policemen." 

TWO PICTURES 

In accordance with the spirit of the White House Conference on 
Child Health and Protection, Elder Fielding K. Smith, a local artist, 
at a suggestion, drew two pictures which I have in my office. One is the 
picture of a home out of which comes a young man, a youth just 
entering his teens, but he doesn't follow the pathway that leads to good 
citizenship, through the school, the church, supervised recreation, etc. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



81 



He wanders back and forth until he comes in contact with a rough- 
looking character, with his cap pulled down over his face, who entices 
him to the "easy way." Standing a short distance away is a policeman, 
ready to take the two of them into custody, and back farther in thte 
picture stands the prison: Over that scene is written the cost to the 
country of that kind of supervision, necessary, it is true. 

In the other picture another young man is coming out of the same 
home, walking straight along the pathway until he meets his day-school 
teacher, who leads him into the path of learning. He meets a Sunday 
School teacher, and other officers in his church. You see him in super- 
vised play, developing into a good citizen, and over in the back ground 
is the school-room, the church, the playgrounds, trips to the woods, 
association with older people. 

THE COST 

The first is costing the United States Government today $16,000,- 
000,000 annually. Mark O. Prentice who organized the National Crime 
Commission in 1925, says that when we include all the cost of crime 
the figures come close to $20,000,000,000. "Every year the United 
States loses more money in its war on crime than the $11,000,000,000 
advanced to Europe during and since the war." It is stupendous. 

The cost of training the child, if we can reach him properly and 
in time, is less than one-fifth that amount annually, and yet the cost 
of punishing the criminal is centered upon only about one million of 
our citizens ; this other, upon the other hundred and nineteen million, if 
we take the entire population ; and the majority of the one million are 
at an age that averages less than twenty years. 

Here is a real challenge to America! I rejoice with you that the 
chief executive has accepted the challenge and determined to call the 
attention of the nation to the prevention of crime, rather than to its 
punishment. ,: 

WHAT THE CHURCH CAN DO 

Now, what can the Church do? Much. iAs I stand before you 
today my heart is filled with gratitude to God for having revealed this 
organization. When I think how easily we may reach every child within 
our domain, when I think that we can go to him with the assurance 
that we can lead him into the presence of God, if he will but live up to 
the principles of the Gospel, I feel a spirit of appreciation overwhelm 
me. Thank the Lord for his revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith! 
When we realize that the Church, almost in its entirety, was given be- 
fore Joseph Smith was twenty-five years of age — a few other revela- 
tions came later ; when we think of the utter dependence of that youth 
upon God for his wisdom, not having the learning of man, it seems to 
me we are forced to the conclusion that he received light from a higher 
source than any man could give him ; and we know that is true. 

How may we reach these youth ? In some of the organizations of 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Church every boy and girl should be enrolled. His name or her 
name should appear on some record, if not on several records, through- 
out the Church, and some teacher or some officer has the obligation of 
coming in contact with that individual boy or girl. 

PERSONAL INFLUENCE 

There are two ways to stem criminality. One is by united, con- 
centrated public opinion. The other, and more effective, is by personal 
contact. There are many in this audience who can look back with 
gratitude to the visit of some kind man, somebody who put his hand 
on your shoulder and said : "Don't do that," or "I commend you for not 
doing this, my boy." Some word of commendation, some gentle hand 
led you back into the path that has given you the success to which you 
have attained. Personal influence, — we must not lose sight of it. That 
organization which can supply that personal influence with the least 
waste of effort, and with the highest degree of efficiency, is the most 
potent organization in the world. 

You have before you, bishops, the following means in your hands : 
the Priesthood, Relief Society, Sunday School, Young iMen's and 
Young Ladies' and Primary Associations, not to name the Church 
schools and seminaries. I say bishops, because the bishop is the head of 
these organizations, and if the bishop will accept the responsibility of 
formulating and of assigning the list, as I am going to outline it, there 
need not be a boy or girl who within two months may not have had 
a personal visit from an efficient officer or teacher. 

For example, we have in the Priesthood quorums of the Church 
approximately 10,411 officers. 

We have in the Relief Society 10,000 teachers. That excludes the ' 
20,000 visiting teachers. I am naming only the others. 
The Sunday Schools, over 27,000. 

The Young Men and Young Ladies, combined, 25,000. 
The Primary, 13,500. 

Now there are some duplications in this, of course, for which we 
should make allowance. That makes a total of over 86,000 officers and 
teachers; and I haven't included the instructors in the Priesthood. 
These are just the officers — 86,000. If we assign to each of these but 
five persons, you can see at once that that army of officers and teachers 
could come in contact with over 430,000 men and women, boys and girls. 

SEEKING THE LOST ONE 

But many of those 430,000 need not the personal visits. The 
ninety and nine are safe within the fold. It js the one that is ljotet 
whom we should seek. 

The Chief of Police of Berkeley, who visited this city recently, 

said: 

"Our investigations reveal the fact that we have four hundred in our schools 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 83 

who need personal visiting. The others are going along without much concern, 
but these four hundred are the potential criminals in our city." 

So we find in each group there are one or two, three or four, 
who need special care, special guidance. How best can we reach them? 
In this way : Let every teacher in the quorums, every teacher in these 
auxiliaries, have before him the list of these potential delinquents. Be 
not satisfied with the good class you have Sunday morning or Tuesday 
night, but feel that the work is not done until you have carefully con- 
sidered that other list which you hold in your hand, in regard to which 
you will report to your bishop at least once a month your success in 
reaching those whose names are found thereon. \ 

We know you can't bring them all in. We have tried it. But you 
can bring some, "and if you labor all your days," says the Lord through 
the Prophet, "and bring, save it be one soul unto a knowledge of 
the truth, how great shall be your joy in the presence of your Father!" 
And who knows what that soul may be in that kingdom? Through 
loving effort you might discover some "inglorious Milton." 

"I passed a stagnant marsh that lay- 
Beneath a reeking scum of green, 

A loathsome puddle by the way, 
No sorrier pool was ever seen. 

I thought, how lost to all things pure, 
And clean and white, those foul depths be ! 

Next day, from out that pond obscure 
Two queenly lilies laughed at me. 

"I passed a hovel, round whose door 

The signs of penury were strewn. 
I saw the grimed and littered floor, 

The walls of logs from tree trunks hewn. 
I said, 'The gates of life are shut 

To those within that wretched pen.' 
But lo ! from out that lowly hut 

Came one to rule the world of men !" 

ACCOUNTING FOR EVERY ,QNE 

I have touched upon only one phase of this great national move- 
ment, which is one of the cardinal activities of the Church of Christ, 
and that is the duty of accounting for every one. God inspire us as we 
go from this Conference, to bring into the fold every child, every 
youth, and as : far as possible, every man and woman, for there isn't 
one who is not God's child. And when we are thus working we are 
carrying out the great purpose of the Almighty, the very purpose for 
which he established his Church on earth, namely, to bring to pass 
the immortality and eternal life of man. 

I bless you, my fellow workers, that you may be inspired to co- 
operate, not only with the officers who preside over you, not only with 
the President of the United States, but with the Savior, who said of 
old, as he says today : "Lovest thou me ? Then feed my lambs." 

God help us to follow that injunction, 1 (pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am laying aside the remarks that I had prepared to deliver 
during this Conference, should I happen to be called upon, and this 
for special reasons that have occurred to me during the last few 
minutes. In the first place, I realize that this congregation has been 
together for a long time. It has been a strenuous day throughout, 
and according to the announcement of President Grant, I am to be 
the closing speaker of this meeting. 

It has been, to me, a glorious day. Many great and important 
themes have been developed. I was thrilled with the beautiful discourse 
of President Ivins on the subject of the resurrection, and pleased with 
the reassertion of our faith in that simple story that he developed 
chiefly from the New Testament. And in all the other addresses there 
has been more or less of. intensity of thought in reference to organized 
effort to achieve righteous ends. All through, I repeat, this has been 
a strenuous day in our worship. • 

It seems to me that if I could get the spirit of it, it could be a 
fitting close to proceed in a manner that would permit us to relax a 
little the intensity of our intellectual effort. So I am going to proceed 
an a way that perhaps may have that effect. I trust it will. 

To begin with, there is no reason on earth that I know of why 
I should refer to the opening address of President Heber J. Grant, on 
the first day of our Conference, because that was a complete thing in 
itself as he delivered it — in the introduction of it, in the development 
of it, and in the closing admonitions of it. From my youth I have been 
delighted in the defense of the faith and of the Saints, and have made 
some efforts, humble ones, of course, in that direction. I was pleased 
beyond all expression that at this time, when falsehood had reared its 
head, and slanders would spread their baneful influence to hinder the 
progress of the Church, the Church itself was able, through its Pres- 
ident, to make a complete and comprehensive denial and denunciation 
of all those things. I am sure President Grant has created for the 
Church, at this Conference, a permanent document that will be useful 
in all time to come as a standard to which we can refer in denial of 
false charges, now and hereafter on the points treated; because I do 
not suppose that the enemies of the Church will cease their efforts; 
and others will arise — even if these present ones were supposed to be 
crushed — others will arise to perpetuate their evil work. 

Yesterday afternoon, as I entered the building, you were singing 
that wonderful hymn of Montgomery's on "prayer" : 

"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
Uttered or unexpressed." 

I presume that it is inconvenient, and perhaps hardly tolerable to 
sing all the eight verses of this beautiful hymn, though each verse is in 
itself a gem ; but if we may not sing all the eight verses, I have often 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



•thought that I would like to see the Church adopt the practice of singing 
the last verse of that hymn. If we could put that in with the others 
usually sung, I should be happy over it. It runs as follows : 

"0 Thou by whom we come to God, 
The Life, the Truth, the Way! 
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod; 
Lord, teach us how to pray." 

One of the sweetest incidents related in the New Testament is 
that one where the disciples gather about the Christ and say to him : 
"Master, John taught his disciples to pray. Teach us how to pray." 
And it was in answer to that petition of theirs that the Christ gave bis 
very wonderful instructions on prayer, and then introduced that classic 
of devotional exercise, the Lord's prayer; and then continued his 
comments upon it. He taught them how to pray, and moreover, he 
set them the example of prayer. 

The prayer known as the Lord's Prayer may not be the prayer 
that would be suitable for all occasions, although it is so comprehensive 
and covers such important matters. I think he intended that it should 
be rather a sample of prayer, in simplicity, in brevity, in spirit, and 
you will note perhaps that it was a universal prayer. It was not a 
strictly Christian prayer, in that it was not offered in the name of Christ, 
but was an address unto the "All Father," and has become a universal 
prayer, given to the world through which every cult, sect or division of 
■religion could express its attitude towards God. It is valuable chiefly 
for the very universal spirit that is in it. 

But I call your attention to this great request, "Lord, teach us how 
to pray." I want to call your attention to the fact that this New 
Dispensation has not been left without instruction on that subject. You 
will find in the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith a rather singular 
declaration. Speaking in the early part of October, 1831, the Prophet 
Joseph said: "I received the following prayer, given through revela- 
tion." But it is more than a revelation to be called a prayer. It is in 
■reality a revelation on prayer, and that is quite another matter. , Very 
little has ever been said of it. It just seemed to drop out of the clear 
is)ky, into the record of the Prophet: but as I said, it is not only a 
revelation called a prayer, but it is a revelation on prayer, in that the 
Lord outlines for us the things, I think, he would have us hold nearest 
to our hearts and comprehend in our deep and earnest desires con- 
cerning the work of God in the earth. 

Because it has been so infrequently referred to and used by the 
Church, I thought that we could now just relax our tense nerves, and 
could close this meeting, on the accepted anniversary of the resurrection 
of the Christ, by the reading of this wonderful prayer, and go hence, 
influenced with the spirit which I am sure it will leave; and let us 
indulge in the feeling of divine worship while we consider the beauty 
and grandeur, and express the desires that are given through revelation 
to this New Dispensation Church on the great theme that God would 
have our minds dwell upon. 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



During my short experience in the army I learned to appreciate 
the psychology of standing at attention before the officers of the army. 
-There was a wonderful spirit that went with that custom of the army, 
and it tended much to improve the corps d' esprit of the companies and 
of the battalions and regiments and divisions into which the army was 
divided. 

Now, what I am going to suggest is that in our spirits, at least, 
we here assembled draw our minds to attention to these great things 
that God revealed, through his prophet, to the Church. I read : 

"Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty 
and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice 
is unto men." (The foregoing, of course, has reference to the Christ.) "Prepare 
ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

"The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the 
stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has 
filled the whole earth. ( 

"Yea, a voice crying — Prepare ye the way 'of the Lord, prepare ye the supper 
of the Lamb, make ready for the Bridegroom." 

Here the scene shifts, and this revelation on prayer becomes a 
commandment to pray: 

"Pray unto the Lord, call upon his holy name, make known his wonderful 
works among the people. 

"Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that 
the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, 
in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness 
of his glory, to meet 'the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth. 

"Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven 
may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that 
thine enemies may be subdued ; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever 
and ever. Amen." 

So pray we, in thy words given to thy Church through the revela- 
tion of thy servant Joseph on prayer, and ask thee, O God, to accept 
these divine expressions concerning the going forth of the kingdom of 
God on the earth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, and the two 
be joined, to the glory of God and the salvation of the world. We 
so pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

As a closing number the Choir sang the anthem, "The Lord Now 
Victorious." , 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Jesse W. Richins, Presi- 
dent of the Twin Falls Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, April 6th.

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I feel as I have always felt relative to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Lattar-day Saints. I have no doubt in my heart that this is the 
work of the Lord. Surely we who have faith believe that the .Lord's 
arm is not shortened, that he is amply able to direct and carry On this 
great /work. 

I realize the responsibility coming to any person who is called 
to speak to this people. I have sat on the "anxious bench" now for 
two days, and I feel this morning that everything I have heard and read 
and know has oozed out of me. I want you to know that I antedate in 
age and in service as one of the First Council of Seventy all of the 
Council of the Twelve who sit in front of me. I feel honored and 
have always felt honored to associate with the General Authorities 
of the Church. I desire to say to the people, the presidents of Stakes 
and their counselors, the high councilors, the bishops and their counsel- 
ors, you have always extended to me the greatest courtesy and respect, 
and whenever I have attended a conference and returned home I have 
felt that I amounted to something. But after I wandered around here 
in Salt Lake I sort of lost that feeling, .sometimes, and felt like a 
stranger among strangers. 

I desire to refer back to a time when I was about thirteen years 
of age, when Heber C. Kimball sent word to my brother, Joseph 
Kimball, who is now in the Church (Office Building, and myself, to 
come to his office. When we arrived there, mere boys, he said to us : 
"If you want your father's blessing you be at the endowment house 
in the morning and have your endowments." 

Of course we were frightened nearly to death. I do not know 
how people feel when they are going to be executed, but that is the 
sort of feeling I had, not knowing and having no conception of what 
it all meant. However, we were there and we had our endowments. 
I did not remember much of that which transpired, but I was awed, 
and the impression was burned into my soul of the sacredness of that 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



place, and the sacredness of the covenants which I had entered into 
when almost a child. When I was fifteen years old our father passed 
away, and we were left as many children are left to wander and fight 
our battles as best we could. 

My father, Heber C. Kimball, trained fourteen years in the military 
service. In an excerpt which I have copied from his biography he 
remarks with honest pride that he was never brought before a court 
martial for neglect. He further says : "I was a Free Mason at the 
age of twenty-two in the Lodge at Victor and received the first three 
degrees of Masonry." He said: "I have been as true as an angel ,to 
my covenants with the Masons. No man was admitted into the Lodge 
unless he bore a good moral character and was a man of steady habits. 
A man would be suspended for getting drunk. I wish that all men were 
Masons and would live up to their profession. The world would be 
much better for it." This was said at least ten years prior to his bap- 
tism as a member of the Latter-day Church. 

Now the point I want to reach if I can, if the Lord will give me 
his Spirit, is just this : Heber C. Kimball made the following statement 
which deeply impressed me: "I would that all men and women who 
enter these holy temples could be made to understand that we are placed 
under obligations to God." Whenever we are permitted to enter the 
holy temples and perform those ordinances 'We make covenants with 
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost." 

I cannot conceive of a more sacred covenant made by mortal 
man. That is the impression I desire to impart to you good people, 
especially those who hold the holy priesthood, and I think it is high 
time that every man who is so honored of God should understand his 
office and calling. I understand my calling as one of the First Council, 
a Seventy in the Church of Jesus Christ. 

President Brigham Young said at a priesthood meeting in Logan, 
the same year that he died, that the Prophet Joseph Smith said to them 
in early days: "Brethren, you are going out to ordain Seventies, and 
you are to ordain them to the high priesthood. You are to ordain 
them to the High Priesthood and ordain them Seventy-Apostles." 

President Young said: "That is the language I use, and that is 
the way." I think none of us would question President Brigham 
Young, who was privileged above most men to associate with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I understand what it all means. It means 
that we Seventies are under the direction of the Twelve Apostles and 
the First Council of !the Seventy, lit means that they are to open 
the doors to all the nations of the earth and proclaim the truth; that 
we are under their direction, and "whenever they need assistance they 
are to call upon the Seventies instead of any others." It simply means 
that Seventies have the apostolic calling as witnesses and preachers 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world. 

I am not ignorant of the fact. I know what the trouble is. 
I want to convey that idea to you. We have 185 quorums 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



89 



of Seventy. They tell me that they number 10,741. There are 
Seventies by the hundreds in this Church who can be prepared to 
go out as witnesses for the Lord and preachers of righteousness under 
the direction of the Apostles, but the fault is not wholly with men, it 
is a financial question, almost entirely a financial question, because 
the rule is that many of the Seventies have filled missions and their 
sons, also. A number of Elders have filled missions and have come 
home and been ordained Seventies who have married wives and cannot 
for the present go on a second mission. That is the chief reason. Any 
time the Lord moves upon his servants to call upon the Seventies, I 
assure you they will respond for I am as familiar with the quorums 
of Seventy as any man in the Church. I have labored among the 
Seventies for nearly forty ryears, and I love the work and 'God has 
given me the spirit of my office and calling when laboring among them. 

It is not my province nor intention to preach. I have something 
here that I would like to read to you but time will not permit. It is 
scripture ; it is the word of God, and I would advise myself and every 
other man and woman in this Church to read the Bible. It is not read 
as much as it should be. The same is true of the Book of Mormon, 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. You will 
find within the lids of those great bocks many prophecies and revela- 
tions, and if you will go to God and ask him in humility if these things 
are true he will give you the testimony and you will know. God bless 
you. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I very greatly rejoice, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord has 
permitted me to be in attendance at this wonderful Conference. But I 
think that most of all I am thankful for the fact that I find myself 
in every way in harmony and agreeing with the admonitions, counsels 
and teachings of this splendid Conference. It has certainly been an 
inspiration to see the wonderful attendance yesterday and the day before. 
It is not so large today, due, I feel sure, to the fact that many of our 
brethren and sisters from this city and nearby settlements are under 
the necessity of returning home and taking up their labors in the 
pursuit of a livelihood. 

But as I have meditated upon the matter the thought has come to 
me, surely there have been great multitudes who have listened to the 
teachings of this Conference, for through the instrumentality of the 
radio, many thousands have been brought in touch with the advice, 
counsel and admonitions that have come to us from the Lord through 
his chosen servants. / 

As my mind has gone back over the history of the Lord's people 
from the remote past to the present, I have reflected that it has been 
the disposition of men to stray away from the paths marked out by 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Lord and of some to prefer to walk in bypaths. It has always 
been necessary for the servants of the Lord, through him inspired, to 
admonish the people, to counsel them, to reprove ithem and bring 
them back, if possible, into the right road, where they would walk 
in the ways of the Lord and seek after him and keep his commandments. 

It is true, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord has given us our 
free agency. iWe are not forced, but we are admonished and taught. 
So it seems to me there is no excuse for us if we stray away. 

The Lord, in speaking to his prophet, Ezekiel, reminded him that 
when the people set' up a watchman to watch over their interests — and 
the Lord admonished him that he had been called as a watchman over 
Israel — and that watchman saw the enemy coming and danger threaten 
the people, it was his duty to sound a warning and blow his trumpet and 
advise the people of the impending" danger. Then he goes on to say 
that if he does so and warns the people, if danger comes and they are 
overtaken in their sins and perish, the responsibility shall be upon 
their own heads. But if the watchman discharges not his duty and 
' warns not the people, and danger comes and they are destroyed, and 
even if they die in their sins, yet will the Lord hold responsible the 
watchman that he has placed over them. 

, Truly, my brethren and sisters, as a people we have reason to 
rejoice that the Lord has placed watchmen over us who, in times past, 
and particularly during this Conference, have advised the people of 
impending danger, and in no uncertain terms. Surely, with no equivo- 
cation, we have been told where we might walk with safety and 
wherein danger lies ; so that the responsibility of our actions in regard 
to the things spoken of during this Conference, I take it, now rests 
upon the people, upon each of us individually, and my hope and prayer 
is that we may walk in the way of the Lord. 

It has been my experience throughout my life until now that 
the Holy Spirit, if left to operate freely in our lives, will most surely 
make known to us what is true and what is false; and it is only by 
quenching that Spirit that man can be led away. I admonish the people 
to seek for the Spirit of the Lord, to stir up, as Paul says, the gifts of 
God that are in you through the laying on of hands of the Elders who 
have confirmed you members of the Church and who have bestowed 
upon you, after your water baptism, the Holy Ghost. It is the witness 
of the Father and the Son. It is the witness of all truth, and its 
mission is to reveal unto us all truth as pertaining to things past and 
present, and it will make known and reveal to us that which we should 
know pertaining to things that are yet to come. * 

All true things might be duplicated. In the history of the Lord's 
people we have found that miracles wrought by his servants and by 
his power have been so closely duplicated by the evil one that they 
are hard to detect from the genuine. And in the last days, as a sign 
of the coming of the Savior of the world, we are admonished by him 
that there should be false teachers, that there should be false prophets, 



ELDER REY L. PRATT , 



91 



that there should even be false Christs ; and they shall work wonderful 
and mighty miracles, even to the extent that they shall be able to call 
' down fire from heaven and deceive if possible the very elect. So 
that it is not safe, brethren and sisters, for us to tie our faith to miracles. 
But I believe sincerely and firmly that there is one thing that Satan 
cannot duplicate, and that is the witness of the Holy Ghost, the witness 
that burns within us and makes us know when a thing is true. That 
witness is yours to have if you will live in harmony with the teachings 
of the Gospel of 'Jesus Christ. 

As I said in the beginning, I am happy to find myself in harmony 
and in accord with the teachings of the Church, in accord with the 
Gospel as it has been restored through the instrumentality of Joseph 
Smith. I have not one word or thought of criticism to offer as to 
the policy of the Church now or in times past. I feel perfectly secure, 
'my brethren and sisters, in following the teachings of those whom I 
bear witness to you are prophets, seers and revelators unto this people. 
And it is a serious and a dangerous thing for us to set up our desires 
or our judgment contrary to that which comes through the servants 
of the Lord, particularly when spoken, as have been the admonitions 
of President Grant during this Conference. 

I bear you my witness that the Gospel is true. I am happy in 
my ministry. I shall be delighted to continue as long as the Lord sees 
fit to use me as an instrument in the spread of the Gospel among the 
nations of the earth, and I am particularly happy to be laboring among 
the Lamanite people. I rejoice to bring to you greetings from them, 
particularly from our people in the far-off land of Mexico, where for 
nearly six years now they have not been permitted to have the associa- 
tion and the ministrations of the Elders from Zion. But they are 
happy and are growing and progressing in the work. The local 
priesthood have risen to the occasion, and our district presidents, our 
branch presidents and our missionaries from among the people of that 
land, who are actively engaged in the land of Mexico, are doing a 
wonderful work, and their ministry I am sure is acceptable to the 
Lord. They are building meeting houses. Since this crisis has come 
in the affairs of Mexico that has kept' us from sending our Elders 
there and made it impossible for us to hire halls freely in which to 
hold services, due to the fact that the law requires that 'services must 
be held in a building dedicated exclusively as a Church building, our 
Saints have erected four meeting houses near the vicinity of Mexico 
City and are endeavoring to provide themselves with places in which 
they can worship the Lord freely and not be handicapped in any way. 

There is no disposition on the part of the Mexican government 
to prohibit our work as long as we comply with the law of the land. 
There is no disposition to trv to prevent the spread of Mormonism, or 
for that matter the free exercise of any religion in the land. They 
do require, however, that those who minister in churches in Mexico 
be citizens of the country and that they register with the government, 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



also that all places of worship be dedicated as such and be registered 
with the government. ! 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may continue with his people 
everywhere, that the Gospel may spread, and that the Church may grow 
until ultimately the cause of right shall triumph in the earth. This 
is my prayer, which I ask humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

of the First Council of Seventy 

My heart is full, made so by the spirit of this great Conference, 
for we have been fed the bread of life. 

My thoughts have been led to consider the holy scriptures, the 
word of the Lord, and I shall take the liberty of quoting a few of 
those precious words which are found in Holy Writ. 

Let me start at the beginning : 

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the 
face of- the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 

"And Gcd said, Let there be light: and there was light. 

"And God saw the light, that it was good ; and God divided the light from 
the darkness. 

"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And 
the evening and the morning were the first day." 

What a glorious beginning t'o the great work of creation ! What 
tremendous forces were turned loose with the utterance of that great 
command: "Let there be light!" 

It seems from this passage of scripture that light played a most 
important part in the creation of the heavens and the earth. How was 
that all accomplished? The Apostle Paul gives us a little idea of it, 
for he tells us, this great Apostle to the Gentiles, in his letter which 
he wrote to the Hebrews, not only how it was done, but' also how it was 
not done. Says he: 

"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word 
of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." 

No, they were not made in this way. This is man's way. When 
we build our homes to house our families, our wives and children and 
see our home in its completed form, we conclude at once that it has 
been made out of the things which do appear ,around about' us. We 
gather the rock — quarry it from the mountain side. We hew the 
timbers from the forests, we gather the sand and slack the lime to 
make the mortar, and we gather clay and make it' into bricks ; and thus 
• we build our homes. But not so with God. He has a better way — 
a more effective way — in creating the home of his children. 

In the very beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
What for? He created „the worlds t'o become the habitation of his 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



93 



children. When, therefore, he considered us who were born of him 
in the spirit before the world was, as he stood in our midst he said 
unto those who were with him : "We will go down, for there is space 
'there, and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth 
whereon these may dwell." (Abraham 3:24.) The materials were 
not created ; they were already there, but they were without form 
and void — the elements are eternal, but God understands the constitu- 
tion of matter and the forces of the universe ;. so, looking out upon 
the great expanse, he says : 

"Let us go down and make an earth whereon these may dwell." 
"These" meant you and me, my brethren and sisters, and the many 
millions who inhabit this globe, and the many other millions that have 
inhabited it from the very beginning of time. 

And how did he do it? By the word of God, through faith. "Let 
there be light," was the beginning. There must then be something in 
this light possessing creative power. Let us seek a little more light 
by quoting more scripture: 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the 
Word was God. 

"The same was in the beginning with God. 

"All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made 
that was made. 

"In him was life ; and the life was the light of men. 

"And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehendeth it not." 
"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the 
world." 

This then was the Word that was with God in the very beginning 
and by whom, through his unbounded faith, the worlds were framed, 
and without whom was not' anything made that was made, and in 
whom was life itself, and this life was the light of men and is the 
"light that shineth in darkness." This light even penetrated that dark- 
ness that was "upon the face of the deep" and there are ninety-three 
million miles of it between us and the sun, and how many more millions 
of miles there are between us and the dwelling place of God, where 
"He sits enthroned in the midst of all things in the bosom of eternity," 
we may not even guess. Science teaches us, however, that utter dark- 
ness prevails throughout the boundless space; but when God says: 
"Let there be light," it penetrates it all and shineth in it but the darkness 
comprehends it not'. 

Again I quote from the first chapter of John: "No man hath 
seen God at any time." This was quoted and properly explained yester- 
day by Apostle Orson F. Whitney in his excellent address, by citing 
these words added by the Prophet Joseph Smith : "unless quickened 
by the Spirit of God." Surely this clarifies it and makes it harmonize 
with the scriptures wherein are recorded the many appearances of God 
to his servants the prophets. And yet, I think there was another thought 
in the mind of the beloved disciple John when he wrote this paragraph 
which I infer from the remaining part of this verse. Let me quote it 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in full: "No man hath seen God at any time; the, only begotten Son, 
which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." 

Who was it that created this world ? Have we not read it was the 
Word that was with the Father in the very beginning, and that 
all things were made by him and without him was not anything made? 
He it was then that created the heavens and the earth. He it wais 
then who, under the Father, created Adam and Eve and placed them 
in the Garden of Eden. He it was, this Son of God, known then as 
Jehovah, who appeared to Abraham upon the plains of Mamre. He 
it was who called Moses up into the mountain and delivered unto 
him the law of the Lord, ,the law of carnal commandments. He it! 
was who came in the meridian of time and was born of the Virgin 
Mary. Thus he was made flesh. This Son .of God, the Only Begotten 
of the Father, full of grace and truth, who now sits at the right hand 
of the Majesty on High from whence proceed eth the light to fill the 
immensity of space, even "the light which is in all things, which giveth 
life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, 
even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the 
bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things." (Doc. and Cov. 
88:13). So John to whom the heavens were opened, seeing these 
wonderful achievements of his Lord and Master but having God the 
Father in mind, declares "No man hath seen God [that is the Father] 
at any time ; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, 
he hath declared him." 

From these scriptures which I have quoted and. many more 
that might be cited, it is evident that our Redeemer, known to ancient 
Israel as Jehovah and to us as Jesus Christ, was the One who appeared 
to the prophets and although the voice of the Father had been heard 
as at the baptism of the Savior: "This is my beloved Son in whom I 
am well pleased," not until the spring of 1820 do we have any account 
of the appearance of the Father, when both Father and Son appeared 
to Joseph in the , Sacred Grove, when this latter-day Prophet, then 
less than fifteen years of age, being transfigured before them and 
quickened by the Spirit, not only beheld them both, observing that' 
the one was the express image of the other, but also heard again his 
voice declaring: "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." A most 
wonderful vision which, although most unusual, was doubtless made 
necessary in order to dispel forever the false conceptions of the modern 
religious world regarding the personality of God. 

What unanimity there is in the utterances of the inspired apostles 
and prophets of God ! One of the characteristics by which we are able 
to recognize all true prophets of God is this : They all teach the same 
thing — they do not contradict each other but uniformly bear witness 
to the same fundamental truths. Let me now call your attention to some 
of the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith and we shall 
discover that same unanimity, the same incontrovertible evidence that 
he too was a true prophet of the living God. Let me read : 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



95 



"He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, 
in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all 
things, the light of truth; 

"Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the 
sun, and the light of the sun, and tne power thereof by which it was made. 

"As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power 
thereof by ;which it was made; ' 

"As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were 
made; 

"And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you 
stand." (Doc. and Cov. 88:6-10). 

If the former prophets and apostles have been even in the smallest 
degree obscure regarding the "Light" and the part it performed in 
the creation and as to who that Light was, then these paragraphs which 
I have just read remove all dubiety and declare unequivocally that 
Christ was that Light which animated the universe and by which 
through faith the worlds were evolved or framed by the Word of God. 

Now let me read a little more from John: 

"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld 
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth." 

And again : 

"He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 

"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons 
of God, even to them that believe on his name; 

"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the 
will of man, but of God." 

Here we are told that power was given to them that believe on 
him to become the sons of God. That applies to all true believers. 
What was that power to which he refers ? It was the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, through obedience to which we may become both sons and 
daughters of God; thus as iPaul tells us the Gospel is the power of 
God unto salvation. But how are we to become his sons and daughters, 
we who were born "not of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of 
the will of man, but of God ?" No, there was only one that was thus born, 
"the only Begotten Son;" he was the only one 'begotten in the flesh 
but we were also born not of flesh nor blood but of God. Clearly this 
can only refer to our pre-existence where we were born of God in 
the spirit, but he gave them that believe on him the power through 
obedience to his (Gospel to become his sons and daughters, both in 
body and spirit, and members in his household. I 

He came to his own and not only did they reject him but they 
crucified him, and on the third day he rose ifrom the tomb, having 
overcome death and the grave, thus becoming the Redeemer of man- 
kind. And how was that' accomplished? The answer is plain: The 
principle of life was in him by which he became our Creator, for "in 
him we live and move and have our being." By that same power he 
becomes the resurrection, overcomes death and makes alive again for 
"as in Adam all men die so in Jesus Christ shall all be made alive again." 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The incident recorded in the eleventh chapter bf John makes this 
plain. It will toe remembered that Lazarus, the brother of 1 Martha 
and Mary, the friend of Jesus, died when the Savior was in another 
part of the country; tout when he came up to the home of Martha 
and Mary, Martha came out to meet him and isaid this : 

"Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died." 
"Thy brother shall rise again." 

"I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day." 
Then the Lord makes this declaration : 

"I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live. 

"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest 
thou this? 

"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ, the 
Son of God, which should come into the world." " 

Now let me give one more illustration of the perfect' unanimity 
among the prophets, but in this instance as between this statement made 
by the Savior which I have just read and a revelation given to Joseph 
Smith wherein the ILord makes known to him the same truth. It is 
told in entirely different language and was given under entirely different 
circumstances and yet it sets forth in great plainness the same truth : 

"And the spirit and the body are the soul of man, 

"And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. 

"And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things." 

In other words, he is the resurrection and the life. Here we also 
learn that the redemption of the soul which is the resurrection from 
the dead is through him who quickeneth all things, or in other words, 
it is through him who is "the light which is in all things which giveth 
life to all things, Which is the Jaw toy which all things are governed, 
even the power of God," as I have already quoted from Section 88, of 
the Doctrine and Covenants ; or as John states it : "In him was life 
and the life was the light of men;" and as we read further in the. 
Doctrine and Covenants, he is also the light of the sun, the moon and the 
stars and the earth upon which we stand and is the power thereof by 
which they were made ; and when we look out upon this beautiful world 
and behold the splendor of the starry heavens, the morning and the 
evening red, the different forms and colors of the clouds and particularly 
at this time of the year when we see the swelling of the touds, the 
unfolding of the leaves, the (blossoms and the flowers and all nature 
bursting into life, we may know from these numerous quotations which 
I have read from the revealed word that all this is through him who 
was in the beginning with the Father, even the Lord, our Savior, the 
Redeemer of mankind. As we contemplate these things let our hearts 
rejoice, let us lift up our souls in grateful adoration to God that he 
has so beautifully and inimitably adorned his great creation work. Amen.

I had not expected to be called on to address this Conference, 
but I do appreciate the privilege and the honor that is bestowed upon 
me in thus being called. 

What President Wells has said today has been in my mind and 
heart throughout the Conference. The thought that the light shineth 
in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not is apparent in all 
the world. ■ 

When the treasurer of the queen of Ethiopia was returning 
from Jerusalem, to which place he had gone to worship, he was 
reading from the prophet Isaiah. Phillip, an inspired servant 
of God was impressed to come near unto him and inquire if he under- 
stood what he read, to which he replied, "How can I, except some 
man teach me?" 

Around the Eunuch was this spirit which has ever shone in dark- 
ness. Being unable to get into contact with it, he could not understand 
the word of God. But this servant of God, endowed with the priest- 
hood and the authority to teach, was able to make that which to him 
was darkness, plain and as light. 

As I conceive it, that is the responsibility of the missionary. The 
light shineth in darkness in all the world, and there are honest souls 
reaching upward for the light. It is our earnest prayer that the Lord 
will bless us and inspire us and help us to seek them out and find them 
and bring them to the light, that they may see the truths of the Gospel 
and rejoice in them. 

We feel in the missions — I am sure that all the missions feel alike— 
that the prayers of the Saints and of our brethren are the great sustain- 
ing influence behind us in our work. Therefore, I make this appeal 
to you this morning, to continue your prayers in behalf of the missions, 
that the Lord may inspire his servants who have the task of seeking 
out those who want to know the truth. There are many of them. 
We do not know how to find them except we be led to them. Will 
you pray for us ? Will you continue to sustain us as you have done ? 
We in turn will do the best we can to carry the message. 

I am happy to be able to say that the mission over which I have 
the honor ko preside seems to he doing very well. The Saints are 
faithful, the missionaries are faithful, and they are all enjoying health, 
strength, . happiness and joy. 

May the Lord bless you. May he bless Zion and his servants who 
preside over the Church, and help them to be strong. May we love 
and sustain them, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I feel grateful to my Heavenly Father 
for this opportunity of being associated with you and enjoying with 
you this wonderful Conference. 

As I look over the strength of the Church and observe that all 
the General Authorities whom we love, revere and sustain are here, 
and that we have had an opportunity of listening to the inspired words 
as they have come from the lips of these living oracles of God, my 
heart has swelled with gratitude. I feel indeed grateful to my Heavenly 
Father for the many blessings that have come to me in my life. 

It has been my pleasure to labor for ten and one-half years in a 
Stake of Zion, and during that period I have learned to love and revere 
each and every one of these brethren whom we sustain as our General 
Authorities. I have learned to respect and admire those who stand at 
the head of the various auxiliary organizations, and I feel greatly 
honored of our Heavenly Father in being called at this time to help 
carry this work into the nations of the world. 

I am happy to say to you, brethren and sisters, that I bring greet- 
ings from the Saints and missionaries of the Texas Mission. Our 
Mission comprises the States of Texas and Louisiana. The Mission 
covers approximately 314,402 square miles, or is about as large as 
Utah, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. We have 22,990 square miles more 
than Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio combined. Within the State 
of Texas we have 253 counties, fifty-seven of which are larger than 
the State of Rhode Island. And yet in that great field- 1 find that 
the people generally speaking are anxious to meet the servants of 
Almighty God, and I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to say to 
you that each and every missionary laboring in that field is enjoying 
good health; that they are all enjoying the spirit of their calling; that 
they are laboring zealously and earnestly to disseminate the Gospel 
truths ; and that the people are receiving their message in a very fine 
way. 

I am happy to be with you, and I bear you my testimony in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I know that this is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ; that I know that he lives, that God our Father actually 
exists, and that we have been created in his image. 

May the Lord bless you and may he bless us. May you in Zion 
so live that the tourists as they come into our country may see that you 
are absolutely sincere, that you are genuine in the things that you 
believe ; and then I am sure you will make it more pleasant and more 
fruitful for the missionaries in the world. God bless you all, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

If Brother J. Golden Kimball, with all the years of experience 
he has had and the many times he has been in this stland, has been 
"upon the anxious seat" during the past two days of this Conference, 
you may know to some extent how I feel at the present moment. 

I am reminded, while standing here at this west end of the 
tabernacle, that some fifty-four years ago I sat in ithe gallery of this 
house in the first seat just behind where the clock is now fastened. 
At that time I was an |immigrant boy, just over from far-off Stockholm, 
Sweden, unable to speak the language. The only words of the language 
I knew were "yes" and "no". 

Remarkable as it may seem those two words have been of con- 
siderable importance in my life. It is a matter of regret that I have 
not always been able to say No when that was the answer that may have 
been required, but I appreciate and am |thankful to my Heavenly 
Father that I have been able to say No as often as I have done; 
Ithat I have been able to (retain the faith and the testimony of the> 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that has come to me. 

It is a matter of still greater appreciation that every time when 
I have been expected to say Yes I have been able to do so. I do 
remember also in my life that there was a time when I very much 
desired a "yes," and she gave it. For the past forty-six years we have 
been living together in love, affection and happiness. 

I have been upon two missions, one in the Southern States, and 
one in England. On those occasions I had to go as it were alone, except 
for the assistance of my Heavenly Father, which I need as much now 
as ever. This time I have the privilege of having her with me, and 
it is a pleasure and a matter of wonderment to me the way she has taken 
to this work and this mission. 

I rejoice in the privilege of accepting the call that has come to 
me to preside over the Canadian Mission. I recognize the responsi- 
bility and I feel very humble in seeking to follow in the footsteps of 
those who have preceded me in that work, when I see the labor they have 
performed, the work that has been accomplished. 

i I cannot enumerate the number of States that could be covered by 
the area that comprises the Canadian Mission, but I did learn this 
much, that if one should take the lands within the Canadian Mission 
and divide them up between the men, women and children that com- 
prise the membership of the Latter-day Saint Church in the Canadian 
Mission, each one would be entitled to 700,000 acres. From that you 
can decide whether the mission is extensive or whether the membership 
is small. As I find it, both are the case. 

I rejoice in the work, and I do pray that the Spirit of God may be 
with me in that work, that in the labors that come to us that Spirit may. 
ever attend us ; that a love for the children of God shall be in our 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



hearts; that we shall spare no effort, no labor, no toil, in getting to 
them the message of life and salvation which has come into our hearts 
and has given us joy, happiness and satisfaction. 

When we see the hundreds of thousands of people gathering at 
shrines in other churches, we regret the fact that it seems to us they 
are as yet impervious to the message of the Gospel that we have to give 
them, which would give them more truth than they have now, more 
light and knowledge, and greater opportunity for advancement, progress, 
glory and salvation in 'God's kingdom. But all we can do is to seek 
our Father for the strength he can give unto us and bend every energy 
to cleanse our garments of the blood of this generation by neglecting 
no opportunity to preach the Gospel unto them and give them the 
opportunity to reject or accept, to have joy and gladness come into their 
hearts, or to have to wait another time and for other methods by which 
to receive it. 

We pray our Heavenly Father that he may inspire the hearts of 
the fathers and the mothers who are here at home that they may feel 
to sacrifice and send their sons and daughters into the missions, that 
we may not go as short-handed as we are at the present time. We have 
at present fifty-two missionaries in the Canadian Mission, while we 
had eighty-two last year, a loss of thirty. We have five District 
Presidents who are at present working alone. In the State of New 
Hampshire we have but two missionaries. The field is great and the 
laborers are few, and we depend upon the brethren and sisters at home 
who have a love for the work and an appreciation of the responsibilities 
that are upon us, to carry the message of the Gospel to the world. May 
we do all that lies in our power to discharge this responsibility. 

I bear my testimony to the truth and the divinity of this work, 
that that which the world calls "Mormonism" is indeed the work of 
the Lord, restored to us in these last days, which gives to the world 
an opportunity of knowledge and understanding and a better concep- 
tion of God and our relationship unto him, the purpose of our being 
here and what we may accomplish. May we be blessed with his Holy 
Spirit to give unto them that message, and to discharge our duties 
and responsibilities in humility. That God may give us strength to that 
end, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

It seems necessary at times that we must have skirmishes from 
the enemy to serve notice on us that our forces must be well organized 
and well trained if we hope to make the battle of righteousness decisive, 
The proceedings of this Conference so far have impressed me with this 
thought. We have in the Church an unlimited amount of defensive 
material at hand, and each day increases our store. 

At the Priesthood Meeting Saturday evening, President Ivins called 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH . 101 

our attention to an article published in the Popular Science Monthly of 
January, 1930. His watchful eye is always looking for such informa- 
tion. The mere mention of the ancient American inhabitants will 
immediately attract his attention. He is always happy to talk about 
them. His knowledge of and interest in them has been a source of 
inspiration to me. He called my attention to this article soon after its 
publication. I quote : 

"With records cut in imperishable stone the Mayas suddenly made their first 
appearance upon the historical scene on August 6, 613 B. C. On that remote 
day — the oldest date in American history — they put into operation a workable 
and astonishingly accurate calendar system which has been the marvel of the 
scientific world since it was deciphered. Why on August 6, 613 B. C. ? Where 
were the Mayas on August S ? Had they lived, tilled the soil, developed their 
wonderful astronomy and admirable architecture, pursued their other arts and 
sciences on this continent before they carved that first inscription? If so, for 
how long? If not, whence did they come? Nobody knows. Step by step, along 
trails of tangible remains, science has been able to trace the evolution of the 
Egyptian and other ancient peoples back to their earliest and crudest beginnings. 
But not so in the case of the Mayas. So far as any concrete evidence is 
concerned, they might as well have dropped down from Mars or some other 
planet on the morning of that 6th day of August, 2,542 years ago." 

Nephi, the historian of the Book of Mormon, tells us that in the 
commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of 
Judah, there came many prophets to Jerusalem prophesying unto the 
people that they must repent or the great city Jerusalem must be 
destroyed ; and that his father, Lehi, was warned to take his family and 
flee into the wilderness. He also tells us that according to the word 
of the angel, the God of Israel, whom men should trample under their 
feet, would come in 600 years from the time his father left Jerusalem. 
Nephi stated that he would not write all details, for said he, "It matter- 
eth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things 
of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates, for I desire 
the room that I may write of the things of God." To me these state- 
ments of Nephi answer the question, "Where were the Mayas on 
August 5, 613 B. C. ?" To get the full story, one must read the Book 
of Mormon. Recent years have brought forth many evidences to sup- 
port this claim. 

I have only a few minutes in which to address you, and during 
this time I desire, if the Lord will help me, to mention some of these 
evidences. Through the writings and traditions of the ancient Amer- 
icans, historians and archaeologists have preserved for us a most won- 
derful story, a story that harmonizes perfectly with the story of the 
Book of Mormon. I shall not attempt to make a detailed comparison. 
My time will not permit. 

Nephi tells us his record is written in the language of his father, 
which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the 
Egyptians. (1 Nephi 1:1-2.) Compare with the following: 

"The Mexicans had more than one method of writing. Not only did they 
use hieroglyphic signs 'figurative and symbolic,' but like the ancient Egyptians 
they had also phonetic signs representing not a thing, an action, or an idea, 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but a sound. From thence to the alphabet is but a step, or, rather it is the 
alphabet already ; but they made far less use of the valuable discovery of phonetic 
signs than did the Egyptians. They confined themselves almost entirely to the 
figurative and symbolic. The result was that the writing had to be greatly 
aided by the memory." ("History of Mexico," Claverijo, Volume 2, page 43.) 

Lehi had four sons. Nephi became the leader. Baldwin in his 
"Ancient America," on page 264, makes the following statement : 

"It (this civilization of South America) was originated, he says, by a people 
led by four brothers who settled in the valley of Tuzco and developed a civiliza- 
tion there in a very human way. The youngest of these brothers assumed 
supreme authority and became the first of a long line of sovereigns." 

"They believed in God. Human in form and feeling, and yet most divine, 
were the gods and deities of the ancient Seneca and other Iroquoian peoples. 
While the divine, social, and political organization was necessarily, for psycho- 
logical reasons, a close reflex or replica of the human, and although both gods and 
man derived descent from an original first parent, yet the first divine ancestor 
was a self-existing god and the first man was the creature of one of these divine 
powers." (Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 1918.) 

"They believed the soul to be immortal. They distinguished three plans for 
the soul when separated from the body." ("History of Mexico," Claverijo, 
Volume 2, page 3.) 

"They believed in an evil spirit, the enemy of mankind, which they called 
the rational owl, and said that he often appeared to men for the purpose of 
terrifying or doing them an injury. The Mexicans, with all other civilized 
nations, have a clear tradition, though somewhat corrupted by fable, of the 
creation of the world, of the universal deluge, of the confusion of tongues and 
of the dispersion of the people ; and had actually all these events represented 
in their pictures." (History of Mexico," Claverijo, Volume 2, page 2.) 

"The Aztecs believed that two persons survived the deluge, a man and his 
wife. Their heads are represented in ancient paintings, together with a boat 
floating on the water, at the foot of the mountain, a dove is also depicted, 
with the hieroglyphical emblem of language in his mouth which he is distributing 
to the children of the survivors. The people held the further tradition, that the 
boat in which their Noah escaped, was filled with various kinds of animals and 
birds. After some time a vulture was sent out from it, but remained feeding 
on the dead bodies of the giants which had been left on the earth as the water 
subsided. The little humming bird was sent forth and returned with a twig 
in its mouth." ("Conquest of Mexico," Prescott, page 385.) 

Speaking of the pyramid of Cholula, Prescott says : 

"Popular tradition in regard to its building is that it was erected by a family 
of giants who had escaped the great inundation, and designated to raise the 
building to the clouds : but the gods offended with their presumption, sent fire 
from heaven on the pyramid and compelled them to abandon the attempt." 

Referring to Quetzalcoatl, they say : 

"He it is that was born of the virgin that is called Chimalmar in heaven. 
This Quetzalcoatl was he who they said made the world, because, they say, that 
this supreme god who resides in the most high heaven, when it pleased him, 
breathed and begot this Quetzalcoatl. To this being they built the round churches 
that have no corners at all. They say that it is he who made the first man. 
A god that was called Titlalacomac, sent a messenger from heaven with a message 
for a virgin that lived in Tula, that was called Chimalmar. This virgin conceived 
a son without knowing a man, the which was called Quetzalcoatl, and they say 
he is the god of the air." (Cortez Mess. Rios, No. 3738, page 25.) 

"Quetzalcoatl was among the Mexicans and all other nations of Anahuac, 
the god of the air. He was said to have once been high priest of Tula. They 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



103 



figured him tall, big, and of fair complexion with an open forehead, large eyes, 
long black hair and a thick beard, from a love of decency he wore always a long 
robe. He was thought to possess the greatest industry and to have invented 
the art of smelting metals and cutting gems. He was supposed to have had the 
most profound wisdom which he displayed in the laws which he left to mankind ; 
and above all to have had the most rigid and exemplary manners. Whenever he 
intended to promulgate a law in his kingdom, he ordered a crier to the top of 
the mountain near the city of Tula whose voice was heard at a distance of 300 
miles. All his subjects were rich, and to sum up all in one word the Mexicans 
imagined as much happiness under the priesthood of Quetzalcoatl as the Greeks 
did under the reign of Saturn." ("History of Mexico" by Claverijo, Volume 2, 
page 14. Compare with 3 Nephi 11.) 

"Quetzalcoatl after being twenty years in Cholula, resolved to pursue his 
journey to the imaginary kingdoms of Tlapatla, carrying along with him four 
noble and virtuous youths. In the maritime province of Coatzacoalco he dismissed 
them and desired them to assure the Cholulas that he would return to comfort 
and direct them." ("History of Mexico," Claverijo, Volume 2, page 12. See 
3 Nephi 18:38, 39.) 

Referring to the destruction at the time of the death of the Savior, 
we have the following statement : 

"There had been a very great error among these natives and very general 
throughout all this new state, for they said that this world had had two endings 
and that the one had been by flood and tempestuous waters, and that the world 
had been turned upside down and that those who at that time had lived had been 
giants whose bones are found in the broken places, and thus, they say also that 
there had been another ending of the world by wind and hurricane that were so 
great that all there was in it was destroyed, even the plants and trees of the highest 
mountains, and that the men of that time were seized and taken up from the 
ground until they were lost to sight, and that a few people of those that escaped 
were converted into monkeys and lost the use of reason and lost their speech 
and became as we now see them. They believe as certainly that there is to be 
another ending and that it is to be by fire." (Historiatlaxcola Mexico, 1892, page 
153. See 3 Nephi 8.) 

"Some Mexican writers are persuaded that the gospel had been preached in 
America some centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. The grounds of that 
opinion are some crosses which have been found at different times which seem 
to have been made before the arrival of the Spaniards ; the fast of forty days 
observed by the people of the new world ; the tradition of the future arrival of 
a strange people with beards." ("History of Mexico," Claverijo, Volume 2, 
page 14.) 

In referring to the first visit of Cortez to Yucatan, Prescott says : 

"The houses were some of them large and often built of stone and lime. He 
was particularly struck with the temple in which were towers constructed of the 
same solid material and rising several stories in height. In the court of one of 
these he was amazed by the sight of a cross of stone and lime about ten palms 
high. It was the emblem of the god of rain. Yet, it must be regarded as a curious 
fact that the cross should have been venerated as the object of religious worship 
both in the new world and in the regions of the old world where the light of 
Christianity had never risen." 

Concerning the belief of this people that their god Quetzalcoatl, 
when he departed, promised to return again at some future date, 
Prescott makes "the following statement : 

"In a preceding chapter I have noticed the popular tradition respecting 
Quetzalcoatl, that deity with a fair complexion and flowing beard, so unlike 
the Indian Physiognomy, who, after fulfilling his mission of benevolence among 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Aztecs embarked on the Atlantic Sea for the mysterious shores of Tlapallan. 
He promised on his departure to return at some future day with his posterity 
and resume the possession of his empire. That day was looked forward to with 
hope or with apprehension, according to the interests of the believer, but with 
general confidence throughout the wide borders of Anahuac. Even after the 
conquest, it still lingered among the Indian races 'by whom it was as fondly 
cherished, as the advent of their king Sebastian continued to be by the Portugese, 
or that of the Messiah by the Jews. A general feeling seems to have prevailed 
in the time of Montezuma, that the period for the return of the deity, and 
the full accomplishment of his promise, was near at hand. This conviction is 
said to have gained ground from various preternatural occurrences, reported with 
more or less detail by all the most ancient historians." ("History of Mexico," 
Prescott, 218.) 

"At the arrival of the Spaniards on the coast of Anahuac, the Mexican gover- 
nors of those coasts were confounded at the sight of vessels so large and men 
of so strange an aspect and figure." 

Nephi calls our attention to the fact that his people built large 
buildings of cement and stone. Historians have preserved for us the 
following statement : 

"In many other ways the Mayas uncannily anticipated modern methods. 
They discovered the use of concrete in the construction of buildings. It appears 
that they erected wooden forms against which were laid blocks of stone, cut 
smooth in front only, to serve as a facing. Then a mixture of crushed rock 
and liquid mortar was poured into the space between the facing and the inner 
wooden form. This produced a strong monolithic wall. In their painting, they 
embodied the principles of perspective and foreshortening, and even developed 
a certain technique in presenting a three-quarters view. And devotees of the 
Sunday comics may be surprised to learn that the Mayas, in their carvings of 
human figures in conversation, originated the 'speech-balloon' without which no 
modern 'funny' is complete." (New Clues to the Mayan Riddle, Popular Science 
Monthly, January, 1930.) 

"The pyramid is nearly 30 feet high and at the base measures about 100 by 
120 feet. The flattish summit preserves nearly its original dimensions, having 
been protected by a firm cement floor and measures 60 by 80 feet. Resting on 
this is a low mass of earth about 5 feet high having near the middle remnants 
of a Spanish building, probably a church. This massive pile is composed of stone 
of various sizes and shapes imbedded in adobe as in many of the north side 
structures, but we cannot at present say whether the facings were of stone or 
cement. The most noteworthy feature of this pyramid is the cement or concrete 
floors of the terraces which are so firm and fixed as to stand out in places far 
beyond the crurnbling slope." ("Ancient Cities of Mexico," Holmes, Vol. 1, 
page 275.) 

"Mortar, made of lime and sand, and cement-like mixtures composed of 
mortar tempered with gravel, pounded stone, etc., were extensively used and 
their durability is remarkable. Numerous floors and roofs are still preserved." 
("Ancient Cities of Mexico," Holmes, Vol. 1, page 25.) 

We are told that upon the arrival of Cortez on the coast of Yucatan 
the people were greatly alarmed when they saw the large ships with 
white sails. Cortez, having heard of the tradition of the people, it is 
said, caused his cannon to be fired. This had the effect upon the natives 
of making them believe Quetzalcoatl, god of the air, had returned as 
promised. The smoke ascending into the heavens, the roar of the 
cannon, the appearance of the white men with beards, seemed to bear 
out this fact. Claverijo records this in the following statement: 

"Montezuma was extremely disturbed on hearing their account; but, to 



ELDER DAVW A. SMITH 



105 



avoid any rash step in an affair of such consequence and alarm, he held a 
council with Cacamatzi, king of Acolhuacan, his nephew, Cuitlahuatzur, lord of 
Iztapalapan, his brother and other twelve personages his ordinary counselors. 
After a long conference they concluded unanimously, that he who had landed 
upon that shore, with so great an army, could be no other person than Quetzal- 
coatl, the god of air, who had for many years been expected in that country ; 
for there prevailed among those nations, as we have already mentioned, an 
ancient tradition, that such a deity, after having, by his beneficence and innocence 
of life acquired the esteem and veneration of the people in Tatlan, Cholula, and 
Onohualco had disappeared to them, promised to return after a certain period 
to govern them in peace and render them happiness." 

After a long conference with Cortez, it seems the natives had not 
been favorably impressed with their doctrines or teachings regarding 
God. Montezuma made the statement that their god was similar to 
that described by the Spaniards. 

"But," says Prescott, "there seems to have been much division of opinion 
in that body. Some were for resisting the stranger at once, whether by fraud 
or by open force. Others contended that if they were supernatural beings, 
fraud and force would be alike useless. If they were, as they pretended, am- 
bassadors from a foreign prince, such a policy would be cowardly and unjust. 
That they were not of the family of Quetzalcoatl was, argued from the fact that 
they had shown themselves hostile to his religion, for tidings of the proceedings 
of the Spaniards in Tabasco it seems had already reached the capital. If 
Montezuma had resisted their visit to his capital it was because he had heard 
such accounts of their cruelty, that they sent the lightning to consume his 
people or crushed them to pieces under the hard feet of the ferocious animals 
on which they rode." (Prescott, page 221.) 

Yesterday, on these grounds, a few descendants of these Lamanites 
held a short service. They sang and prayed in English and their native 
language. Nephi saw in a vision that through wickedness his people 
should become a dark and loathsome people. He also saw that in the day 
when this book he was writing should come into the hands of the 
Gentiles and should be delivered to his people they should again become 
a white and deirghtsome people. These Lamanites, whom we met. yester- 
day, are dark like their forefathers, but their souls are white. They 
have faith in the living God, that faith which leads to eternal life. 

In conclusion I shall read a statement from Lord Eingsborough 
concerning these people. He gives the following reasons why he be- 
lieves they are descendants of the Hebrews : 

"Because of their division into tribes ; their worship of Jehovah ; their 
notions of theocracy ; their belief in the ministration of angels ; their language 
and dialects ; their manner of counting time ; their prophets and high priests ; 
their festivals, fasts and religious rites ; their daily sacrifice ; their ablutions and 
anointings ; their laws of uncleanness ; their abstinence from unclean things ; 
their marriages, divorces, punishment of adultery ; their several punishments ; 
their cities of refuge ; their purifications and ceremonies preparatory to war ; 
their ornaments; their manner of curing the sick; their burial of the dead; 
their raising of seed to a deceased brother ; their choice of names adapted to 
their circumstances and the times; their own traditions, the accounts of our 
English writers, and the testimonies which the Spanish and others have given 
concerning primitive inhabitants of Peru and Mexico." 

A song of their ministral as interpreted seems to have been 
prophetic. To us it is prophetic.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Enjoy the fragrant flowers that spring 

Around thy kingly state ; 
A day will come which shall destroy 
Thy present bliss — thy present joy — 
When fate the scepter of command 
Shall wrench from out thy royal hand 

Thy moon diminished rise ; 
And as thy pride and strength are quenched 
From thy adherents shall be wrenched 

All that they love or prize. 
When sorrows shall thy truth attest, 

And this thy throne decline — 
The birds of thy ancestral nest, 

The princes of thy line — 
The mighty of thy race — shall see 
, The bitter ills of poverty — 

And then shall memory recall 
Thy envied greatness, and on all 

Thy brilliant triumphs dwell; 
And as they think of bygone years 
Compared with present shame, their tears 

Shall to the ocean swell. 

And those, who, through a royal band, 

Serve thee for crown, or plume, 
Remote from Culhuacan's land 

Shall find the exile's doom, 
Deprived of thee — their rank forgot, 
Misfortune shall o'erwhelm their lot. 
Then fame shall grudgingly withhold 
Her meed to greatness, which of old 

Blazons and crowns displayed; 
The people shall retain alone 
Remembrance of that triple throne 

Which this our land obeyed." 

My brethren and sisters, I am thrilled when I read the Book of 
Mormon. The more I study it the more I see in it of worth. It is 
one of the most wonderful evidences of the divinity of this work which 
God has placed in our hands. I plead with you to read it and study 
it with a prayerful heart. Read the last chapter first. Follow that 
instruction to the letter, and the Lord will be with you, for he has so 
promised. 

God help us in our efforts to carry on in his great work, is my 
prayer, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission. 

I earnestly pray that the word of the Lord that has been delivered 
to us at this Conference will take hold of us. It seems to me, brethren 
and sisters, that the beauty and power of this Gospel are revealed in the 
lives of the Latter-day Saints as much and probably more than they are 
revealed in the books. 

Two or three days ago I saw a happy mother walking along Main 
Street. Her face beamed with maternal pride, for at her side, walking 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

with her, was her son, a manly young man who had been recentljy: 
honorably released from filling a mission. With every step that mother 
took she seemed to say, "I am the mother of this boy." 

These wonderful mothers in Israel are not astonished at the grati- 
fying progress their splendid sons and daughters make in the mission 
field, because they know that the testimony of the Gospel and the power 
to preach it were born with them. These mothers believe in their sons 
and daughters. My brethren and sisters, we cannot do very much with 
young people except we show them that we do believe in their integrity 
and power to fill their missions. 

Recently a married man came into the Mission. After he had labored 
for three or four months he received the sorrowful news that his only 
child, about two years old, had died. The bishop comforted the grief- 
stricken mother and told her that if it would help her to bear her grief 
he would send for her husband. But she replied, "No, bishop. Ever 
since we have been married I have prayed and worked and saved in 
order that my husband could fill a mission, and if he were to come home 
now the happiness he would bring me would not equal the joy that fills 
my heart because he is preaching the everlasting Gospel." 

Such a spirit, brethren and sisters, is unconquerable. It is invin- 
cible. And in that spirit of sacrifice, devotion and self-denial this glo- 
rious Gospel is being preached. 

A Presbyterian minister said a short time ago : "The church that 
evangelizes America will be the dominating factor in evangelizing the 
world." Noble words. Magnificent ideal. The mission of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to preach the Gospel to every 
nation and kindred and tongue and people, to bring about the glorious 
consummation, when every knee shall bend and every tongue confess 
that Jesus is the Christ. And how will the Church accomplish thSs? 
"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts." 

God help us all to work in the spirit of sacrifice and devotion. Let 
us send out our splendid sons and daughters to "wake up the world for 
the conflict of justice," I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR GAETH 

President of the Czechoslovak Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I bring you greeting from the 
smallest mission in the Church, consisting of thirteen of your sons and 
eleven members. I am happy to be here to enjoy the spirit of this 
Conference, happy that I was able to come and obtain a companion who 
will return with me, so that we can continue in pur work in building 
up that mission of the Church. 

We are happy to be able to labor among the Slavic people — 
among the Czechs and the Slovaks — a people who have been religiously 
persecuted for centuries. They first received Christianity in the ninth 
century, when two Slavs, missionaries of the Byzantine church, came 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to them, and under the reign of Wenceslas, that famous Christian king 
in whose honor we sing one of our religious songs, they were prac- 
tically Christianized. From that time on Christianity was a powerful 
factor in their history. But so well did the predominant church know 
how to inculcate the ideas of its religion into the lives of those people 
and into th&r affairs that by the fourteenth century it controlled prac- 
tically one-third of all the lands, and most of the people were serfs and 
peasants under its dominion. 

It was said at that time that the Archbishop of Prague controlled 
one-third of the Province of Bohemia, and he had a large retinue of 
priests and f ollowers who spent a good deal of their time in riotous 
living. This greatly incited the feelings of honest men and women who 
believed in the message of Christ. 

One of these was the famous reformer, John Huss, who began to 
preach against the corruption within the Church. He gained a following 
among the common people and the movement became so powerful that 
the attention of the Popes in Rome — and at that time there were two — 
was attracted to this movement. Huss was asked to come to trial on 
the shores of Lake Constance. His friends warned him and told him not 
to go, but he had a motto, the motto of the Bohemian people today, 
"Truth will conquer." 

And so with two or three followers and with a promise of safe 
passageway from the king of the Empire at that time, Sigismund, he 
went on to Constance. There, at a mock trial, he was condemned to 
death and was burned at the stake. 

Huss died, but his spirit lived on among the people, and for two ' 
centuries after that they were a Protestant nation. But at the beginning 
of the Thirty Years' War the Catholic forces came into the country 
and at the battle of White Mountain the Bohemians were defeated and 
were put in bondage. There were more than two million Bohemians 
living in the country at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, and 
at the close, thirty years later, that number had dwindled to less than 
one million. The rest had been killed or forced into exile. For three 
hundred years after that they lived in bondage, spiritually. They 
were forced to accept teachings for which they had no desire and in 
which they did not believe. But slowly these things became a part 
of them, and the mass of the people became members of the Catholic 
church. 

Then the World War came and that people succeeded in gaining 
their freedom and in establishing religious liberty. The educated 
people began to break away from the church. They began to go off 
into the paths of skepticism and agnosticism. The masses still remain 
in that church and are remaining so probably because they feel they 
must have some kind of a cloak and that the cloak they are wearing 
now is probably as good as any they could get. But the leaders and the 
educated people are opposed to organized religion. They want nothing 
of it, because the experiences they have had with organized religion have 
taught them that it has meant bondage to them. 

We are laboring among the more educated people of the country, 



ELDER ARTHUR GAETH 



109 



a skeptical people who weigh everything and who are paying attention 
to teachings and investigating them because they are interested in the 
development of their people and their country as probably no other 
leaders in Europe are today. They have gained their freedom. The 
spirit of liberty permeates their souls and they work and slave and ac- 
complish. That is why the country of Czechoslovakia has made more 
progress in re-establishing and reconstructing since the war than any 
other country that participated in the war, except probably France. 

We are proud to be engaged in service among those people. We 
are thankful to our Heavenly Father that we can work there, and 
we feel that the time will come when the teachings of the Church, 
because they are practical and can be applied in every day life, will 
take hold among those people and we will be able to bring many of 
them into the fold of the Church. We are only a small group, fourteen 
of us laboring among fourteen million seven hundred and twenty-five 
thousand people. We feel that we have a great mission and that we 
need help. (We ask the Lord to bless you here at home so that you 
may be able to send your sons and daughters out into the world to 
preach the Gospel, where they can gain the experiences so valuable to 
life, and at the same time preach the true and everlasting Gospel to the 
many nations of the world who are hungering for truth. 

May the Lord bless you and help you, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I too rejoice and am grateful with all 
my heart for the privilege and honor that has come to me as a mission- 
ary of this great Church, and for the opportunity of bearing my 
testimony along with those already borne at this Conference. 

In the North Central States Mission we are well, and busy, and 
happy in our work, and the Lord is blessing our efforts. Last year, 
despite its many handicaps, we had more baptisms, more tithing paid, 
and more people paying tithing than ever before in tour history. This 
year (1931), notwithstanding a reduction of more than one-third (from 
SO to 50) in our missionary force, !we ifeel and hope results may be 
even better. We are proud of our missionaries and of our Saints and 
friends. All that we need is more of each. There are many good people 
in the world. Given more missionaries, for whom we hope and pray, 
we shall strive earnestly to find them, and 'with the help of the Lord, 
to teach them the truth. 

A book has been written by Bertrand Russell and others entitled, 
"If I had ibut one sermon to preach." If we of the North Central 
States Mission had but one sermon to preach to the world it would 
be an humble testimony that God lives, the same wise, kind Heavenly 
Father, who in the beginning "Created man in his image," and who 
continues to be interested in all his children; that Jesus of Nazareth 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lives, a resurrected, immortalized, glorified member of the Godhead; 
that Joseph Smith, the prophet of this dispensation, was privileged to 
converse with these two heavenly personages, Father and Son, and of 
them was instructed in the manner of the organization of the only 
authorized Church of Christ upon the earth today; that this is that 
Church; that in it, under the administration of President Heber J. 
'Grant, seventh in succession from the Prophet Joseph, are held and 
exercised all the keys of authority in the priesthood that characterized it 
in the early days. 

Such, my brethren and sisters, is our testimony to the world. And 
if, as upon one occasion long ago, some should be "pricked in their 
hearts" and should isay, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" the 
answer is ever the same: 

"Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For 
this promise is unto you, and unto your children, and to all they that are alar off, 
even as many as the Lord our God shall call." (Acts 2:37-39). 

If we could preach but once to the youth of Zion it would be, 
in humble adaptation of the third, great commandment: "Thou shalt 
not take the name of the Lord thy God IN VAIN." In vain? What 
do we mean — In vain? 

Consider for a moment the splendid oath and promise of the Boy 
ScoUt : 

"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and to my country, 
and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; and to keep 
myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight." 

Suppose the Boy Scout, having given this splendid commitment 
to service, should go his way forgetful that "A scout is Trustworthy, 
Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, 
Brave, Clean and Reverent." He shall have taken the Boy Scout Oath 
IN VAIN, shall he not}? ; 

Let us not, my young brethren and sisters in particular, take the 
name of the Lord our God, in vain. Who cares to become a deacon, 
a teacher, a priest, an auxiliary worker, or a missionary of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints IN VAIN ? Nobody. Last of 
all the youth of this day and age in the Church. 

"O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all 
your heart, might, mind, and strength, that ye be found blameless before God 
at the last day." 

Such, my young friends, the vision toward which our fathers wrought; 

Such their proud hope and faith in us, that we should carry on, 

Nor carry on IN VAIN, the work by them begun. 

So shall we prove ourselves in very deed their sons. 

So shall we prove to skeptic friends, "This is the Place;" 

This is his Church; and this the greatest day, 

(Though perhaps also the most critical and dangerous of days), 

That ever yet has dawned. 

God bless and keep the youth of Israel. God bless and magnify 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING

his missionaries in every land and clime. God bless and save the world, 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

Singing by the congregation, "Come, All Ye Sons of Zion." 
The closing prayer was offered )by Elder Joseph F. Merrill. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The (Closing session of the One Hundred and First Annual 
Conference of the Church convened at 2 o'clock Monday, April 6th. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "O Ye Mountains High." 

Elder George H. Brimhall offered the opening prayer. 

The hymn, "The Time is Far Spent," was sung by the congregation. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Never in my life have I felt more humble and dependent upon 
the Spirit of the Lord than I do at this time. I was just as positive 
as of anything in the world that I would be the first speaker this after- 
noon. Something seemed to whisper that to my soul. You brethren 
who have never had this experience will probably never know with what 
feelings of timidity a man stands in the presence of these holy men to 
edify those present and say the things that should be said to this great 
body of priesthood, servants of the Lord. 

It seems to me that the great burden of this Conference has been 
the burden that is incumbent upon us as Elders in Israel, namely, the 
proclaiming of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. As we were 
singing the last hymn, my mind reverted to a revelation given through 
the Prophet Joseph to Peter Whitmer, June, 1829. I should like to 
read it. 

"Hearken, my servant Peter, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, your 
Lord and your Redeemer. 

"For behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine 
arm is over all the earth. 

"And I will tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone — 

"For many times you have desired of me to know that which would be 
of most worth unto you. 

"Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which 
I have given unto you according to my commandments. 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of most 
worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may 
bring souls unto me that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father." 

I am honored, my brethren and sisters, in' being called to preside 
over the Northwestern States Mission, one of the grandest missions of 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this Church. Millions of people live within the boundaries of this great 
mission. Their attitude towards this Church is changing rapidly. Hun- 
dreds of them are seeking for the truth. They are reading the truth 
.as your sons and daughters are delivering it to them from day to day, 
in the various parts of that mission, so far as our force will permit us 
to visit. Wle are limited in man power and in the strength of our women 
who have been doing missionary work and are doing missionary work 
there today, as is no doubt the case in all missions. Obviating that 
handicap we are calling a number of our local brethren and sisters within 
the immediate confines of the mission, to the service, and they are 
spending some time — some of them part of their time, others all of 
their time — and thus helping in overcoming the great shortage of 
missionaries today. 

I realize the sacrifice that you parents are making. I appreciate 
the hard times that we are going through financially ; yet I realize too 
that God can overrule all things for the good of his people and for 
the promulgating of his work. 

Not long ago one of the Elders laboring in the Northwestern States 
Mission was worried over financial conditions at home, although his 
father had never mentioned finances to him. Yet, away up in Alaska 
he felt that all was not well. So, one evening he went out by himself 
to pray and he asked the Lord to remove this feeling from him that he 
might know of conditions at home. To his astonishment, that night 
when he retired a vision as it were came to him. Just as plain as the 
noonday sun he saw his good father going away from home and in 
seclusion kneeling in prayer, telling the Lord that he had a son in the 
mission field and his finances were such that he was worried as to 
whether he could retain him there longer or not ; and he asked that 
this condition be overruled if it were the Lord's will. 

The next morning the son wrote a letter to his father and outlined 
in detail that which he had seen in vision. A few weeks later came a 
letter to the son, and he in turn sent it to me. That good father said : 
"Son, the very night that you had that vision, I was out there in 
seclusion away from home, praying, telling my troubles to the Lord, 
and he heard me. The next day as I went along the street I met a man, 
not a member of the Church, who voluntarily asked me if I did not 
need a little money, that he had some with which he could help me. 
His letter said, "Son, you remain on your mission as long as you 
are needed." 

These things, my brethren and sisters, are happening to the mis- 
sionaries in the Northwestern States. They are kind, sweet, honest, 
willing young men and women. They are acquitting themselves ad- 
mirably of the responsibilities that rest upon them. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. Oh, may he bless these 
men who preside over Israel! May we, brethren and sisters, stand 
back of them, every man and every woman, that Zion may grow 
through the united efforts and support we give these noble servants 
of God. I bear witness to you that I know this is God's work. Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, and this work will never be overthrown

nor given to another people. This I do in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NOAH S. POND 

President of the Northern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, the spirit of this Conference I am sure will 
extend to the extreme portions of the world, farther perhaps than 
missionaries or the representatives of the Church may be able to travel. 

While all these glorious truths have been presented for our con- 
sideration I have thought how wonderful that God, the great 
Creator, the Engineer, the Architect, knew the material from which 
he would create this earth, and the material from which he would 
create his sons and -daughters to become inhabitants upon this earth. 
He knew Adam and selected him as the progenitor of the human race. 
Our Father knew Abraham and selected him to be the father of the 
faithful. He knew Noah and placed him as the replenisher of the 
human race after the deluge. He knew Moses and selected him as the 
great law-giver. He knew the Son of God as the Savior of the world, 
as his Beloved Son, upon whom he could place the responsibility for 
the redemption, salvation and exaltation of the inhabitants of the world. 

God knew the prophets and apostles, the inventors and discoverers, 
and he called them each in his day and time. God knew the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and he knew you and me, and this is proven by the fact 
that we are here. 

To Latter-day Saints it isn't so much a matter of chronology — 
when these goodly men and servants came or when these things oc- 
curred — as it is to know the actuality of them and to know that they 
did occur. These men came in their dispensations and accomplished 
their work. 

The Northern States Mission is doing its work as creditably as 
it is within the power of the humble servants of the Lord who labor 
there to do it. The incident related by Brother Sloan might be dupli- 
cated in the experiences within our observation, but it was a goodly 
mother instead of a father who knew her son was upon the operation 
table — he needed her. She prayed and she heard his voice 'calling 
her, and he heard his mother's voice. In checking the time both 
mother and son knew of the prayers of each other and that they could 
be together in spirit although three thousand miles apart. 

We have 77 organized and partially organized Branch and 
District Sunday Schools, in which there are enrolled 4,845 out of 
a membership of 7,000 in the mission. We have twenty-three 
Relief Societies over which Sister Pond presides, and nearly one 
hundred per cent of our, good sisters are maintaining their Relief 
Society Magazine in which the lessons for the mothers are presented. 
Sixteen thriving Mutual Improvement Associations, with an enrollment 
of 741, participated recently in contest work in a way that would be 
creditable to any of the Wards or Stakes of Zion. We have 23 Neigh- 
borhood Primaries taught by local people and our sister missionaries.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I bear to you the testimony of my heart of the truthfulness and 
beauty of the Gospel of ijesus Christ that has been so forcefully 
preached to us during the sessions of this Conference; and say to you, 
brethren and sisters, that your missionary sons and daughters are 
doing true, active missionary work and enjoying the spirit and calling 
of their missions. 

May our Father's blessings be upon the leadership of this great 
work, those that we, hold in respectful remembrance of the past, and 
the Presidency and Apostles and other presiding authorities who guide 
and direct his work today, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Ihis Conference has been a very profitable one for me. I have 
listened with deep interest to the speakers and enjoyed the beautiful 
music. I hope that I may be able to recall many of the things that the 
brethren have said, so that I may use them in His service. We have 
been admonished and advised regarding our duties and responsibilities, 
and no doubt we shall return home determined to take advantage of 
all this counsel, so that we may become more firmly established in the 
Church. 

Many testimonies have been given to me. I have a testimony of 
the Gospel. I have been blessed with the knowledge that this is the 
work of the Lord; that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world; that 
he came in the meridian of time to redeem us from the fall of Adam and 
laid down a plan of redemption through which we may obtain eternal 
life. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the living God ; that he 
came and established the dispensation of the fulness of times. 

I deeply appreciate my brethren and sisters with whom I labor. I 
appreciate my presiding brethren, the First Presidency, the Council of 
the Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, and my Presiding Bishop, 
Sylvester Q. Cannon, and his counselor, Bishop David A. Smith, both 
of whom labor diligently. No one could labor harder it seems to me, 
than does our Presiding Bishop, for the welfare of the youth of Zion. He 
utilizes his time, talents and energy for the building up of the kingdom 
of God, giving special attention to the Aaronic priesthood. I sincerely 
appreciate the feeling of mutual helpfulness and confidence of my 
brethren in the Stakes and Wards, particularly the bishoprics, for upon 
them rests so much of the labor of developing the youth of vZion, ad- 
ministering in temporal things, receiving and handling the tithes and 
offerings, caring for the poor, and many other duties connected with 
their calling. I also appreciate the close association with the Relief 
Society. Sixty-five thousand devoted women, presided over by an able 
presidency, have zealously labored during the past winter to relieve 
suffering and poverty in all of its phases. President Grant said that 
large sums have been paid out for charity. Some people say we waste it. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



115 



I hardly think so. , We treat our brethren and sisters who are tese 
fortunate than ourselves, as our neighbors, in harmony with the spirit 
of the Gospel. 

The subject 1 of tithing is very near to my heart. I have been de- 
lighted during this Conference to hear Elder Orson F. Whitney and 
some of the other brethren discuss this principle. I feel that it is im- 
portant for us to get into the habit of right thinking along this line. We 
are flooded with magazines and newspapers, so much that many of 
us spend a great deal of our time in reading and thinking superficially. 
We should train ourselves to think straight, and when we think straight 
we shall be in harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The world 
is passing through a crisis. How long it will last none of us knows. The 
time of the coming of the Savior is near at hand. Whether we shall 
entirely recover from this serious business depression, we shall have 
to leave in the hands of our Father. But I appeal to you not to let 
these hard times and misfortunes be an excuse to neglect the payment 
of your tithes and offerings. We must discipline ourselves to meet 
these situations and in spite of our misfortunes to pay the Lord hfe 
one-tenth first and trust that his blessings may rest upon the 90% left. 

In one of the Stakes of Zion, a few years ago, after I had spoken on 
the subject of tithing, a group of young men waited for me after the 
meeting and asked, "How are we to know how much tithing to pay when 
we don't know what our living expenses will be?" , I said, "If you wait 
to pay all your living expenses first, you may then not have enough 
left with which to pay tithing." 

Now, my brethren, when the Lord gives us means, monthly or other- 
wise, why not sit down with our conscience, alone if necessary,! and 
find out on the first or last day of each month what the Lord has given 
us, and then and there tithe it and not wait until the end of the year 
or the end of the season. Give the Lord an opportunity to bless the 
90%. This is what I call straight thinking in relation to the law of 
tithing. 

What are we doing with the 150,000 young men and women in this 
Church between the ages of 12 and 20? Are we, as parents, teaching 
these children the importance of the law of tithing ? Are we impressing 
upon them that this is a fundamental principle of the Gospel ; that it will 
add to their joy and satisfaction in the Church; that the payment of 
tithing will give them greater faith and greater interest in the work of 
the Lord? We should teach our children from the time they ajre 
baptized that whatever the Lord gives them, whether dimes or dollars, 
it should be tithed monthly. The bishops in this Church are happy 
and glad to see these young people come with their tithes and 
offerings. When a boy is ordained to the office of a deacon, he should 
be taught to obey this important law, so that it will become a habit 1 
of his life. Good habits fixed in childhood or early youth are dominating 
factors of the lives of men and women. We owe it to the Church to 
teach them this principle.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The great prophet and statesman, Joshua, succeeded Moses. The 
book of Joshua records that after the land of promise had been occupied 
and when Joshua had become old, he called upon the chiefs of the tribes 
of Israel to meet him in the land now known as Samaria. There, on the 
hillside, he recited to them his labors and what the Lord had done for 
the Israelites to bring them into that goodly land. He called attention 
to the worshiping of false gods, and then closed with this statement: 

"Now therefore fear the Lord and serve jhim in sincerity and in truth : * * * 
Choose you this day whom ye will serve : * * * but as for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." 

Now, brethren, heads of households, give heed to your families, 
and may this counsel of Joshua be our motto. Let us serve the Lord. 
May we remember him with our tithes. 

I pray that we may grow in spirituality and in the service of the 
Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I certainly feel my weakness this afternoon, my brethren and 
'sisters, in attempting to report the activities of the missionaries in the 
East Central States Mission. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having the privilege of laboring with your 
sons and daughters and your husbands who are engaged in the work of 
jthe Lord in that part of the Lord's vineyard. It is pleasing to me 
to meet with those who have returned from the mission field and 
hear them express themselves to the effect that they would like to be 
back in the service of the Lord again ; showing that they had been 
imbued with the spirit of their work and that they still have that 
spirit with them. 

I would like to say to the Bishops of Wards and to the Presidents 
of Stakes of Zion where these young men and young women reside 
that I would appreciate it very much if you would find something for 
them to do to keep them active in the work, because they are active 
while in the mission field and have endeavored to do their duty to the 
best of their ability. 

About a year ago a message came from the mother of one of our 
missionaries, who is still laboring in the field, to the effect that his 
father had passed from this life. In that message the mother expressed 
the wish that her son remain in the field and complete his mission, and 
he chose to do so. Just a short time ago, two years, which is the 
usual term of missionary service, had passed, and learning of the finan- 
cial condition at his home, I wrote to this young Elder and told him that 
his labors were acceptable" to the Lord, and that he would be honorably 
released, to return home so as to be in attendance at this Conference. 
In answer to my letter he said : 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 



117 



"President, I have been very careful with my means. I have practiced economy 
and have saved enough to maintain me for another two months, or more. While 
I do not like to suggest it, if it would be permissible and agreeable I would 
like to remain for at least that length of time." 

It is needless for me to say that that Elder is still in the field. He 
has work ahead of him and prospects that he wants to see consummated 
before he returns to his home. 

Just two or three weeks ago a message came from President Grant 
and his counselors to the effect that the father of one of our very able 
lady missionaries had met with a serious accident and was taken from 
this life. The message was forwarded to her. Her companions rallied 
to. her support, as did also the good Saints in that district, and com- 
forted her. I received a letter in answer to one that I wrote to her just 
a few days afterwards in which she too expressed herself as wanting 
to remain and complete her mission before returning home. She is 
still in the mission field. 

My brethren and sisters, it fills my heart with thanksgiving when 
-I see the faith that is exhibited by the young men and young women 
who go into the mission field. They are interested in the work. They 
want to accomplish their work in a way that the Lord will be pleased 
with their efforts, and I am sure that they are succeeding. 

My brethren and sisters, encourage the young people to prepare 
themselves for the mission field, for as President Nibley said yesterday, 
"there is a famine in the land, not for bread nor a thirst for water, 
but for hearing the words of the Lord." The harvest is great and the 
laborers are few ; the time is far spent and there is little remaining. 

I pray God to bless you with every needful blessing. May he 
bless President Grant and his counselors, the quorum of the Twelve 
and all those who are engaged in this great latter-day work. I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I have rejoiced, my brethren and sisters, very greatly at the 
speeches and the music we have heard at this Conference. We have 
been truly fed the bread of life and by the spirit thereof, and I have 
felt to thank the Lord for the gift that each of our brethren has possessed 
at this Conference in being able to give us the measure of the word 
of the Lord that has been given. 

It was a strong indictment against intemperance that was read at 
one of the sessions, and yet after experience in each of the three great 
departments of government I am persuaded that that indictment is not 
overdrawn. I have in memory the picture of a man indicted and - 
convicted of murder being arraigned for the judgment of the court, 
and when I asked him if he had any legal cause to show why the 
sentence of the court should not be pronounced upon him, in a solemn 
and dramatic manner which I shall always remember, he declared 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that he had killed the best friend he had on earth and did not know it 
until he was awakened the next morning from his drunken slumbers. 
He appeared to be sincere. A little later he had to be committed to 
the insane asylum, he worried so over the fact that he had taken the 
life of his dear friend and left a widow and children to mourn the loss of 
a husband and a father who was providing for them. 

I think that what we need in this country is more regard for* 
law, constitutional law and laws passed in accordance with the Con- 
stitution of the United States. I frequently have had an opportunity to 
speak on the Constitution of the United States as a divinely inspired 
instrument, and have brought forward the testimony of such dis- 
interested witnesses as William E. Gladstone, Premier of England, and 
Sir Thomas Bryce, the author of the monumental work on- American 
. Commonwealths. 

There are other great Americans who enjoyed inspiration in 
framing the institutions of this country, and in saying this I am not 
denying the room for inspiration in the formation and guidance of 
other countries. We pray for their guidance and the guidance of 
the officials of not only our own nation here in America hut the rulers 
of other nations. I have thought sometimes we have neglected some 
of those great characters who were instrumental in shaping the founda- 
tions of our country and those who have made comments upon them. 
I know that we are familiar with the work that 'Franklin, Jefferson 
and others did in connection with the framing of the Constitution of 
our country, but we are less familiar with the work that the great 
Chief Justice John Marshall did. The formation of the Constitution of 
the United States is really spoken of as the greatest single achievement 
of the eighteenth century. There was that about it that inspired 
Daniel Webster to love it, "to have a profound passion for it," "to 
cherish it' day and night," "to live on its healthful saving influence," and 
"to trust never to cease to heed it until he should go to the grave of his 
fathers," "to earnestly desire not to outlive it." 

Judge Marshall of Wisconsin in the case of Borgnis vs. Falk 
County, in a decision written by him for the Supreme Court of Wis- 
consin, said: 

"At no period has appreciation of the great work of the fathers been more 
important than now. We need to sit anew at their feet, revive knowledge that 
the result was wrought by a body of men, representatives of the great seat of 
learning of the English speaking races of two hemispheres, and otherwise men 
of broad exjperience, many of whom had been students of all federal govern- 
ments of all prior ages in preparation for the special task — as the historian 
declared, 'the goodliest fellowship of lawgivers whereof this world has record,' 
a body dominated by specialists, inspired by ennobling love for their fellow-men 
and the thought that they wrought, not for their age alone, but for the ages 
to come, and so sought to avoid the infirmities of previous systems of govern- 
ment by the people, by carefully providing that no change in letter or spirit should 
occur except in a particular and most deliberate and conservative way." 

John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



119 



United States, performed an inspired work in the framing of the Con- 
stitution of our country. 

You read the 101st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants. I 
will not take time to read it here, the seventy-ninth and eightieth 
verses, and then consider the work that Marshall did in connection 
with the interpretation of this great document. 

Marshall was not only a great man in his own age and country, 
but he would be considered a great man in any age and clime. Webster, 
in 1814, in a letter to his brother Ezekiel, said : 

"There is no man in the court who strikes me like Marshall. I have never 
seen a man of whose intellect I had a higher opinion." 

Again Webster said of him that if there was ever a human being 
who did not argue from the obscure to the more obscure it certainly 
was Chief 'Justice Marshall. 

George R. Peck of the Chicago bar said of 'Marshall : 

"Take him for all in all, he was the greatest judge that ever lived. By 
the common and unfettered judgment of the bar, lay the unanimous voice of 
statesmen, jurists aind scholars. He was the oracle of our Constitutional law, 
the interpreter, the expounder and in a certain sense the maker of the Con- 
stitution. * * * Our profession looks upon him with a somewhat idolatrous 
feeling, but I do not think it excessive. When we consider what might have 
been our fate if another and not he had occupied that great seat we may well 
believe that providence watched over the republic." 

Justice Joseph Story, a very great justice of that Supreme Court 
of the United States, who knew Marshall very well spoke of him and 
said : 

"His life speaks its own best eulogy. It had such a simplicity, purity, 
consistency and harmony that the narrative of the events in their natural order 
invests it with an attraction which art need not seek to heighten and friendship 
may well be content to leave with its original coloring. He learned to love 
the Union with a supreme unconquerable love, a love which was never cooled by 
neglect or alienated by disappointment; a love which survived the trials of 
adversity; and still more dangerous trials of prosperity; a love which clung 
more closely to its object as it seemed less dear or less valuable in the eyes 
of others, a love which faltered not, fainted not, wearied not, on this side the 
grave. Yes, his thoughts ever dwelt on the Union as the first and best of all 
our earthly hopes. The last expressions which lingered on his dying lips 
breathed forth a prayer for his country. Such in that moment as in all the 
past, 'O save my country, Heaven,' was then his last. * * * He was one of those 
to whom centuries alone give birth, standing out like beacon lights on the 
loftiest eminences to guide, admonish and instruct future generations as well 
as the present." . - 

It has been truly and forcibly said pf him : 

"Marshall found the Constitution paper and made it a power; he found it a 
skeleton and he clothed it with flesh and blood." 

I remember hearing a great orator and judge once express the hope 
that he might have the leisure sometime before he passed away to read 
one great decision each day from the Supreme Court of the United 
States. If one were going to do [that he might well select from the 
great decisions of the Supreme Court such cases as Marbury vs. 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Madison, Gibbons vs. Ogden, and McCulloch vs. the State of Maryland. 
All these are great landmarks showing the growth of the Constitution of 
our country. 

What we need most in this country is more respect _f or the Constitu- 
tion of the United States and its laws and la deep conviction of the 
necessity of being law-abiding. 

I rejoice in the testimonies that have been given in this Conference. 
I want to add my testimony to that which has already been given by 
s'o many in such a splendid form at this Conference. I ask the blessings 
of the Lord upon us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

I rejoice in the work in which we are engaged. For some reason 
I am impelled to say — though it is manifestly unnecessary, as President 
Grant needs no defense from me, but I think it 'is proper — that I am 
not only in hearty accord with his declarations relative to the enforce- 
ment of, and obedience to law ; but that I have known him for nearly 
half a century, lived in the same Ward, associated with him in business, 
socially, religiously and even politically, and there has been nothing 
more characteristic of him than his frankness and above-board expres- 
sions. Any man who knows him will not say to the contrary. May 
God bless him,- and may he live long to continue the splendid work 
which he is doing, and those also who are upholding his hands. 

The Eastern States Mission is in a very healthy condition, espe- 
cially the missionaries. Our winter was as open and mild as it was 
severe here. Branches of the Church are in a very healthy condition. 
I know of no better evidence of that fact, than that last year there 
was paid something over thirty per cent more tithing than was ever 
paid before in the mission, and the amount paid the preceding year 
was largely in excess of that of any former year. If there is anything 
that tests honesty and sincerity, it is the payment of tithing. iWell 
may the old prophets have said : "Will ye rob God in tithes and 
offerings?" We can account for the maintenance of the payment of 
tithing to some extent, if not largely, because our people are generally 
employed by large institutions with many employes ; and although 
hundreds of thousands, even millions, have 'been thrown out of em- 
ployment, the honest tithepayers, I testify, as a very general rule, 
have not. Their sincerity, their honesty, have been so reflected, I 
am sure, in the stability and value of their characters that their em- 
ployers have recognized the same. 

The Mission has been exceptionally blessed during the past year. 
Indeed, I think a marvelous work has been done through the providence 
of God, which was commenced in this building, by broadcasting sermons 
and organ recitals. The hearts of the people of the East have softened 
marvelously in the last two years. The press has materially changed 
its attitude. A different atmosphere very largely prevails. We were 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



121 



deeply impressed with the importance of utilizing modern agencies in 
the dissemination of the truth. 

We organized three new departments of our activities. The first 
and most important, broadcasting of sermons over the radio ; second, 
exhibiting Mormonism in a practical way in exhibitions and fairs. The 
largest of these exhibits was at the Eastern States Exhibition where all of 
the states in our mission meet annually. They have permanent buildings 
at Springfield, Massachusetts. Our exhibition was in a booth in the 
main building over which was displayed in large letters the name of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in still larger 
letters, "See what God hath wrought." In the rear of our exhibit we 
had a small replica of the Salt Lake Temple. The booth was appro- 
priately decorated. Streamers were used leading to the Temple, on 
which pertinent data were displayed concerning the Word of Wisdom, 
our system of educating the young, and our unequalled charity system. 
On a table at the entrance was an ample supply of tracts. There we 
distributed in eight days over 25,000 tracts. A half dozen missionaries 
distributed thousands of tracts daily, making friends, having conver- 
sations, and reaching people who would not permit them to come into 
their homes. They could not get past the butler, or the servant, ordi- 
narily. 

Then we went to the country fairs. The young artist, for such 
Elder Carl E. Olson (whom we made Director of Exhibitions) proved 
himself to be, skilfully designed, out on the green, an old oaken bucket 
well, over which he had written in large letters, "The well of living 
water," with the name of the Church above it. It attracted a great 
deal of attention and thousands of tracts were again distributed. 

Time will not permit more on that line. I should like to tell you 
more about other things. We are desperately in need of missionaries 
and especially singers. If we are not supplied with some singers soon 
to take the places of those who are leaving, we shall have to give up 
some of the stations over which we are broadcasting the Gospel every 
Sabbath day. The prediction of Isaiah is fulfilled, wherein it says 
that " A little child shall lead them," and that the Lord would take "the 
weak things of the world to confound the mighty," and accomplish 
his marvelous works. Also the prediction in the Book <^f Mormon 
that the Gospel will be preached from the housetops is being literally 
fulfilled. 

The first missionary who broadcast for us over the radio was 
Elder Carrol D. Parkinson of Preston, Idaho, a nineteen year old 
missionary We had to pay for the privilege so gave it up temporarily. 
That was on the 11th of April last, and immediately following the 
great Centennial celebration in this city. We sent President Grant 
over a thousand clippings from newspapers; some of the largest, like 
the New York Times, had lengthy articles. 

This great organ has been making us friends. The intelligent 
realize that such music can come only from a people of intelligence 
and elevated ideals, and not from ignorance and bigotry. And thus 
1 interest has been aroused in our people. It is certainly marvelous that 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



where we found an opening we had without previous thought the best 
talent available. 

The first real opening was at Wilkesbarre, Pa., a city of nearly 
one hundred thousand population, where two of our young elders were 
laboring — Elder D. Glen Brown of Provo, twenty years of age, 
who has been with us only seven months, and his companion John M. 
Anderson of Logan. They did the real pioneering, persisting in their 
efforts to obtain the privilege of speaking over the radio without cost. 
Finally the station, the oldest in the city, and the largest, was in need 
of something to fill in with, and the privilege was given to these young 
men. Notwithstanding the short notice, they met the occasion splen- 
didly. A quartet of our missionaries sang some of our hymns which 
with the address was so pleasing, that they were invited to continue, 
and every Sabbath evening since the 18th day of May last, we have had 
a half hour, during which we sing the hymns of Zion and preach a 
sermon. 

On September 10th, Elder Brown, with only two years education 
at the Brigham Young University, was made editor and director of 
radio work for the mission. 

The next opening was at Wilmington, the largest city in Delaware. 
Sister Mary Wioozley, from Malad, had won the friendship of the 
members of a Scottish society, partly by her piano playing; and ever 
since the 31st of August we have likewise broadcast there, Elder George 
F. Williams, of Ogden, another nineteen year old missionary, being 
the principal address writer and speaker. That station is the largest 
in the State of Delaware. It has a population of over two million 
within a radius of one hundred miles. 

They say that there are more than thirty million people in our 
mission. It is the great center of wealth and of the leading educational 
institutions of the nation. It is singularly appropriate that in the very 
section where the Gospel was introduced, the most modern and effective 
methods should be utilized in proclaiming the Gospel. We have only 
about three missionaries to a million of people to preach the Gospel 
in this mission, but they can and are doing a marvelous work over the 
radio. 

The next opportunity came in a still larger city, Syracuse, which has 
a population of more than two hundred thousand. There, another young 
man, Elder Earl H. Martin, was located, the only solo singer in the 
Mission. He won the hearts of the radio listeners by singing for 
several months without doing any preaching. Finally, we decided to 
use him elsewhere unless they permitted us to also preach. Then they 
gave us an hour on Sunday evening and called it a vesper service. 
Sometimes we deliver two sermons during the evening, with music 
intervening. This so aroused the other churches that they demanded 
the same privilege, and now we have to take turns with them. 

There is no place in the Mission, where an opportunity has been 
given us to preach over the radio, that the privilege has been taken 
from us. If you will give us the missionaries, especially those who 
can sing, we can accomplish a great work. We have thus, in ten 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



123 



months, delivered 212 Gospel messages over the radio in the Mission in 
important and prominent cities of the East, without cost to the Church ; 
and the work has been splendidly done by youths generally under 
twenty-two years. To me it is nothing short of marvelous. For some 
time, as we contemplated and discussed this matter, I thought that 
unless we could have Dr. Talmage, President Roberts or some such 
speaker and writer, it would be useless for us to try. They could not 
come to our aid. The desirability of attempting this work was pressed 
upon us so strongly that we concluded to utilize the material that we 
had at hand. If the Lord ever blessed missionaries he has those in 
the Eastern States Mission who have participated in this work, for 
they were all young and inexperienced. Some of our indifferent mis- 
sionaries who could sing or write have been aroused to greater activity. 
Forty-one of pur missionaries, some of them quite uneducated, have 
written addresses. Twenty-eight of them have spoken over the radio. 
Young ladies have written splendid addresses. Two of them have 
spoken over the radio. I say it is marvelous. But more marvelous and 
important — and more do I value it above all else — is the knowledge 
that I have of the divinity of this work, that God lives, that his servants, 
when in the performance of their duty under the call of the priesthood 
of God, have the inspiration of the Lord with them. He is with us, 
and there is a joy, a happiness and a consolation in the performance 
of duty, in the service of the Lord, that is inexplicable. 

May we appreciate our opportunities and blessings, and may you 
send us missionaries who can sing, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The nationial broadcast of the tabernacle choir begins at 4:15 this 
afternoon. It is important, therefore, that this meeting close promptly ' 
at four o'clock, in order to permit those who desire to leave the building 
to do so before that time, so that the doors can be closed and absolute 
quiet prevail during the broadcast. 

The national broadcasts of the tabernacle choir number to date 
approximately ninety. These have covered practically this entire nation 
as well as Canada. They have been transmitted to some extent at least, 
by short waves, to Europe. Many thousands of letters have been 
received expressing appreciation for these broadcasts. Some such 
letters have come from England. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
California Mission 

I sincerely hope that the blessings of the Lord may attend me 
during the few moments I occupy this position. 

Some of the other brethren have referred to the sensations they 
have had during the past three days. I have passed through all of 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those sensations and some I think in addition. To sit for three days 
not knowing what moment you are to speak is an anxious time. 

I desire to read a few words given by way of revelation at the 
opening of the great Gospel dispensation in which we now live. The 
Lord says : 

"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on 
high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from 
afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape ; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, 
neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow ; for their in- 
iquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 

"Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish 
unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. 

"Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have 
decreed in them shall be fulfilled." 1 

And the Lord says further : 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the 
inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake 
unto him from heaven and gave him commandments ; 

"And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these 
things unto the world ; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written 
by the prophets — 

"The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty 
and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the 
arm of flesh — 

"But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the 
Savior of the world; 

"That faith also might increase in the earth ; 

"That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

"That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the ,weak and the 
simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

* * * * 

"And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth : I the Lord 
am willing to make these things known unto all flesh ; 

"For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace 
shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own 
dominion. 

"And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their 
midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself ; 
and though the heavens andi the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, 
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my 
servants, it is the same. 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record and 
the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever." 

I would like to call the attention of this congregation to the fact 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMiURRIN 



125 



that in this very first revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants 
the Lord has said that the weak things of the earth should be chosen 
to accomplish this marvelous work to which reference has been made. It 
may seem a little ridiculous in the eyes of those who do not believe that 
the Lord God of heaven has placed his hand to bring to pass in these 
latter times that marvelous work which has been sung about by all 
the prophets, that this revelation should say, "Fear and tremble, O ye 
inhabitants of the earth," because of the weakness of the men and 
women who are called to represent the work of God in the preaching 
of the Gospel. 

In my mind's eye I see standing in a little river, just fifty years 
ago this year, one of those weak missionary boys who had been appointed 
by hfs traveling companion to administer the ordinance of baptism to 
one who had been convinced of the truth. As he stood there in the 
river and thought of lifting his hand to make the declaration, "Having 
been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," how weak that poor 
instrument was ; and in his soul he cried out to God, "Father, if there 
be aught wrong in this act that I am about to perform, forgive thy 
servant, who believes that he is possessed of divine authority." 

There could not be a weaker instrument, it seems to me, on the 
face of the whole earth, and that humble and frightened instrument 
was Joseph W. McMurrin. 

I have met a great many of these weak men right here in Salt Lake 
City who have been assigned to the California Mission, and sometimes 
as I have hearkened to them and have noted their weakness, they 
could hardly make answer to simple questions because of the fear that 
was in their souls. I have thought, "What can this man or this woman 
do in the mission field?" I am a witness that shortly after meeting 
them here I have met them in the mission field changed and improved. 
I would not want to convey the thought that they had suddenly become 
strong, educated, powerful men and women. No. But there had 
something come into their souls that had driven out fear; they had 
learned to know for themselves concerning the divine authority they 
possessed, that they had actually been called by the Lord God of heaven 
to represent him in the preaching of the holy Gospel, and that they 
were of a surety servants of the living God. Men may well tremble 
at the authority and power of God that has been given in this dispen- 
sation to mortal men. 

I want to tell you that when men and women become possessed in 
their own souls of this thought, there is a strength about their presence, 
and about their testimony, and about their faith in God, that is mar- 
velous and beyond my power to describe. I thank God that the promises 
are being fulfilled. No matter how weak we are we do bear divine 
authority, and through the help and blessing and power of God, and 
the companionship of his Spirit we are making our way, little by little, 
among those with whom we come in contact ; and God is convincing us 
in our very souls that we represent him. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is my testimony concerning the ministry that is being carried 
on by these weak vessels in the California Mission. We are perishing 
because of the lack of help. One of the First Presidency has made a 
declaration that has been referred to : "There is a famine in the land." 
He made it especially to the bishops, stake presidents and presiding 
men, and he' said, "You are not meeting your responsibility." In 
attestation of the truth of this declaration I would like to say that the 
California Mission has been operating with ISO to 200 missionaries in 
years gone by, and we are now reduced to about eighty-five. We would 
like you brethren who select missionaries to take this declaration with 
you, and! hope it will ring in your ears — eighty-five. There is a famine 
in the California Mission because of the lack of men to proclaim the 
glorious Gospel of the Son of God. I hope the necessity will be" met. 
You presiding men can change it, if you will. 

God bless all, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and (sisters, to be present at another 
Conference of this Church. The great testimonies that have gone forth 
from the speakers will add, I know, to the stability and strength of the 
membership of the Church, and men and women will become more 
convinced that the Spirit of God is with these men. who stand at the 
head and have the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ to administer in the 
ordinances of the Gospel. 

When President Grant was addressing this congregation at the 
opening session the words of Solomon came to my mind : "Where there 
is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is 
he." It is through obedience to this principle that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints has advanced and prospered. For a century 
of time it has maintained a steady growth because its people have kept 
the laws of God. 

I was more than happy to hear the President say that (the Church 
is out of debt. It maintains a great army of men both at home and 
abroad who give their time unselfishly, paying their own way, for the 
building up of the Church and kingdom of God. They are taken 
away from the great earning power of its membership for years at a 
time; yet (we find the Church strong, strong in faith, wonderful in 
power, out of debt, paying its way. There is nothing else like it under 
the shining sun. 

I draw the attention of the people of the world who have known 
this Church for many years and who have not been obedient to its 
teachings to the fact that they need the gospel of repentance, and unless 
they do repent they cannot inherit the glory that was promised by 
the early leaders to those who would accept the truth. 

I know the Gospel is true. It never was so wonderful as it is today. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BEN N ION 



127 



There never was more to do. Surely there is a famine in the land. , 
There has probably never been a time when there was more money 
or more food produced, or more clothing manufactured, than at the 
present time in this land of America. But there is a great famine, not 
for bread nor if or water, but for the hearing of the word of God. Elders 
are needed everywhere. The missionaries are working hard and doing 
perhaps twice the amount of work that ever was done before. We need 
more missionaries. We have but sixty-eight in the Central States 
Mission, which is one of the very oldest missions of the Church. We 
wish that more could come, but we will have to leave that in the 
hands of the Lord and with those in authority. 

I endorse all that has been said in regard to the strength of the 
leadership of our Church. It is the Church of God in the earth. It 
will win, it will lead, because God our eternal Father has not forsaken 
it, and the power of his Spirit has been felt among our leaders, as 
each president has come and gone. And this Spirit has been with the 
membership, too, as is evidenced in the testimonies they have borne 
in all parts of the world, from the inception of the work until now. 

I pray our Father's blessings upon us in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I asked all the Mission /Presidents jwho have just addressed us, 
with the exception of Brother Moyle, to occupy only ten minutes each. 
Every one of them complied with my request. They spoke from 
three and a half to eight and a half minutes each, and for the first time 
in four lor five years there is a little spare time at the closing session 
of Conference. 

GEMS FROM THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 

I felt impressed that the splendid things contained in Section 88 
of the Doctrine and Covenants ought to come before this Conference. 
I had several passages copied and intended to read them, but I was 
very pleased to hear nearly every word of them quoted by Brother Rulon 
S. Wells. There is, however, in that section something further which 
I think it well to read to you : 

"For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; 
truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy 
hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course 
and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon 
the throne and governeth and executeth all things. 

"He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things 
are round about him ; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through 
all things, and is round about all things ; and all things are by him and of him, 
even God, forever and ever." 

And this from ^Section 84: 

"And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither 
darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall 
to the ground unnoticed." 

President Grant then presented the General Authorities and Officers 
and General Auxiliary Officers of the Church who were voted upon 
and unanimously sustained as follows :

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice exceedingly in the testimony of Brother James H. Moyle. 
He pleaded, oh so hard, for Brother Talmage or Brother Roberts or 
someone else to come to his mission and speak over the radio. We 
could not yield to his pleadings. We rejoice that during the last six 
months the Lord has seen .fit to magnify the young men and the young 
women in the Eastern States Mission and that he has inspired and 
blessed them in the marvelous way he has done. 

OBEY THE LAWS OF GOD 

We hear a great deal about obeying the Constitution of the United 
States. What is the matter with our obeying the constitution of the 
Church of Jesus Ghrist of Latter-day Saints? What is the matter 
with us being honest in obeying the laws of Almighty God by paying 
our tithing? There are a great many people who are very active in 
preaching this Gospel who fail to obey it themselves. Let us obey it, 
and then we shall find that there is no power on earth or beneath the 
earth that can stop us in good works. 

LOYALTY IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL 

I do not believe that one missionary in every twenty that are 
sent into the mission field has had previous experience in missionary 
work. It seems to me that there should be more loyalty in preaching 
the Gospel than exists at the present time. I remember that when I was 
a young man the IChurch.did not send boys on missions as it' has to 
do today, but men of experience made sacrifices to go into the mission 
field. Men laid down almost anything that they were doing when the 
call came to go upon a mission. But now, if there is any excuse under 
heaven that we can make to stay home many of us are staying. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



131 



I want to endorse all that has been said that is calculated in its 
nature to inspire the leading men of this Church, all over the Church, 
and the members, to make sacrifices and prepare themselves to proclaim 
the Gospel. 

THE BEST CONFERENCE 

I am very happy indeed over all that has been said and done in 
this Conference. I pray earnestly and sincerely that the Lord will 
sanctify to our blessing all that we have heard. I rejoice in the fact 
that I have heard on all sides as far back las I can remember, "Well, 
we have had the finest Conference ever." It shows that the people have 
the spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; that when they are fed the 
bread of life their hearts are warmed. Tears of gratitude come into 
their eyes for the authority of the living God, for the power that comes 
to the people, and it does seem as though the last Conference is always 
the best. ! 

May God help us each and all to live in such way and manner 
that his Spirit may be our constant guide and companion, I ask in 
the name of Jesus and in the authority of the priesthood of the living 
God that I hold. May God bless the people ; may he bless the General, 
the Stake and the Ward .authorities and the officers of the auxiliary 
organizations throughout the Church. May he bless the misssionaries 
at home and abroad, and may he inspire the people to do missionary 
work. 

TO WARN OUR NEIGHBORS 

I would like to call the attention of President Joseph W. McMurrin 
to the fact that there are three (Stakes of Zion in California, that there 
are residing in California today probably twenty thousand members of 
the Church. We should remember that the Lord has told us that it is 
our duty to warn our neighbors and to preach this Gospel — that duty 
is upon all of us — we should be missionaries. There are very many 
men in the Church who are devoting nearly all their time outside of 
their daily vocations in an endeavor to bring people to a knowledge 
of the Gospel, although they have not been called Upon missions. There 
are some of our Bishops who ; not only do their duty in their Wards, 
but when they find someone whom they can interest in the Gospel they 
preach it to him. II think one of the best preachers I have known ever 
since he came home from his mission as a young man is Bishop Thomas 
A. Clawson of the Eighteenth ,Ward. He is zealous in keeping his 
returned missionaries at work. 

Let us all realize that this work belongs to each and every one of 
us, and let us do all in our power for its advancement. 

"the song of the heart" 

May the Lord bless our singers, not only those who belong to 
this great tabernacle choir, but our singers throughout the entire Church. 
There is no other people in the world who take greater interest in 
music, in singing, and in advancement along those lines than do the 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Latter-day Saints. Why ? Because we realize that the Lord has given 
a revelation wherein he has said that his soul delighteth in the song 
of the heart, that it is a prayer unto him, 'and that it shall be answered 
with a blessing upon our heads. Let us remember the kind of songs 
the Lord likes, songs with the IGospel in them. I have gone to con- 
ferences where I have heard three or four anthems, with the words 
of which I could not agree. They were sung to good music but they 
were not good doctrine. 

May the Lord guide us by the unerring counsels of his Spirit, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, Amen. 

The congregation sang, as a closing number, the hymn, "Come, 
Come, Ye Saints." 

Elder John W. Hart, President of the Rigby Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

The singing at the meetings on Sunday was conducted by B. Cecil 
Gates, Assistant Conductor of the Tabernacle Choir, and at the other 
sessions of the Conference by Edward P. Kimball. 

Accompaniments and interludes were played on the great organ 
by Edward P. Kimball and Frank Asper. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

A veritable epic of empire-building 



The Life Story of 
Brigham Young 

By SUSA YOUNG GATES AND LEAH D. WIDTSOE 
WITH A FOREWORD BY HONORABLE REED SMOOT 

"This book presents the life story of a New England cabinet-maker, 
who, well into his thirties, entered upon a career that made him an empire- 
builder of the West; the founder of a hundred cities; the governor of one 
of the territories of the United States; and one of the outstanding figures 
of the nineteenth century." 

Thus does Senator Smoot begin his enthusiastic foreword to this notable 
biography. "A graphic, gripping story," he terms it, and every reader 
undoubtedly will agree with his definition of this life of the indefatigable, 
indomitable Brigham Young, which was written by one of his daughters 
and her daughter. The entire record of the great Mormon leader is un- 
folded from his birth in a little Vermont town to his death at the age of 
seventy-seven as head of the church, the success of which was due to his 
courageous and arduous leadership.

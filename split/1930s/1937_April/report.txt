ONE HUNDRED SEVENTH 

Annual 

Conference 

OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST 
OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 



Held in the Tabernacle 
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 

April 4, 5, 6, 1937 

With Report of Discourses 



Published by the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 



A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

addition, thousands assembled on the Tabernacle grounds and in the 
Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle, where, by means of

Number who paid fast offerings in wards 76.4% 

Number who paid fast offerings in missions 25 % 



Total who paid fast offerings 68% 

Average per capita fast offerings in wards 120% 



The following wards merit worthy commendation for 
leading the Church in the payment of Fast Offerings. 
You will remember that the Church Security Plan was 
not inaugurated until April — practically May — 1936. 
Please keep in mind also as I read these figures that the 
value of Fast Offerings lies in membership participa- 
tion. Everybody denies himself or herself for the good 
of those in need. The amount per capita in these wards 
is not the result of any large contribution from one or 
two men, but from many who have conscientiously 



paid their offerings : 
81 wards paid over $1.00 per capita. 
Wards showing highest per capita fast offerings: 

Manhattan Ward, New York Stake $ 1.91 

San Francisco Ward, San Francisco Stake 1.79 

Grant Ward, Rigby Stake 1.77 

Rosette Ward, Curlew Stake 1.53 

Missions showing highest per capita fast offerings :

Organ accompaniments and organ solo presentations were played by 
Frank W. Asper. 



The Choir sang the hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way." 
PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I feel that a great mistake was made in announcing that there are 
10,000 people here ; I am sure the number is nearer 12,500, if it is not 
15,000. This building seats 8,000 people comfortably, and there are 
many of you that are not very comfortable now. 

Brother Richard Evans has given me a subject. I had not fully 
made up my mind what to talk about here today. I have marked a half 
dozen passages in the Doctrine and Covenants, and I have thought of 
three or four poems that I repeated this morning before leaving home 
and also before getting out of bed. I take the following from the con- 
tinuity used by Brother Evans : 

Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against 
the workers of iniquity. 

For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green 
herb. 

Trust in the Lord and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and 
verily thou shalt be fed. 

******** 

A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many 
wicked. 

I receive regularly any number of anonymous letters. I receive any 
amount of advice as to what I should do, even over the signatures of 
Latter-day Saints. 

GRATEFUL FOR SUPPORT OF MEMBERS 

I am very grateful to know, as I am entering upon the eighty-first 
year of my life, that the Latter-day Saints are behind me. I believe 
and acknowledge here today that the remarkable and splendid health 
that I enjoy is due principally to the faith and the prayers of the Latter- 
day Saints, and to God hearing and answering those prayers. 

Since we last met I have celebrated my eightieth birthday, and 
since that time I have put in as many hours in working, if not 
more than the average in years gone by, and have done so without 
fatigue and without feeling the least injury by reason of the labor that 
I have done. I desire here to render to the Latter-day Saints, from 
Canada on the north to Mexico on the south, and in the islands of the 
sea and our missions all over the earth, my sincere and heartfelt grati- 
tude and thanks for the many wonderful letters of congratulation that 
I received for my eightieth birthday. 

I am truly grateful to all those who saw fit to contribute articles 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to the November number of the Improvement Era. I am particularly 
grateful to Brother Richard L. Evans for the great amount of work 
and study and research that he has given, and for the work that he did 
in asking people to contribute articles for that issue of the Improvement 
Era. 

ACTS WITH FULL APPROVAL OF OTHERS 

I want the good people to know that I am not wasting any time or 
any sleep, in thinking or planning because of the anonymous letters that 
I receive and the advice that I get from a great many good Latter-day 
Saints, first-class Latter-day Saints, full tithepayers, who think that I 
am making a mistake. I want you good people who are here assembled, 
and all the members of the Church, to know that I shall do nothing but 
what I have the approval of my counselors and of the Council of the 
Twelve Apostles. I want you to know that from the day that I became 
the President of the Tooele Stake of Zion, in 1880, I have desired to 
know the mind and the will of the Lord. In humility and in prayerful- 
ness I have sought for that, and I pledged myself in Tooele to give the 
best that was in me for the advancement of the work of the Lord in 
that Stake of Zion, and I have fulfilled that pledge. I made the same 
pledge to the people who were assembled in this building when I first 
became the President of the Church, over eighteen years ago, and I rejoice 
that I have kept that pledge. I have but one desire and that is the 
advancement of the work of God and the individual salvation of those 
who have received the witness of the Holy Spirit. My constant prayer 
is that my ideas and desires shall be subordinated to the desires of God. 
I am anxious only that the will of our Father in heaven shall be 
carried out in all the works of the Latter-day Saints. 

CHURCH SETS EXAMPLE TO WORLD 

I am grateful for the loyalty of the Latter-day Saints. I believe 
there is no other spot in the world where an audience of this kind can 
be brought together — in fact, I am sure of it — in which, almost without' 
exception every one has an abiding testimony and a knowledge that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that in very 
deed Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith went willingly to martyrdom for the cause, and 
made the statement that he was going like a lamb to the slaughter, but 
that he had a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards 
all men, and that it should yet be said of him that he was murdered in 
cold blood. I believe that that fact is acknowledged today all over 
the world. 

To me one of the greatest of all the great evidences that he was a 
prophet of God is shown by the wonderful revelations that were given 
to the people before the Church was organized. Revelation after reve- 
lation tells that the field was white already to harvest, and those who 
would thrust in their sickle should reap. It is marvelous when we 
contemplate the way in which this hymn that we have sung here today, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



"God Moves In A Mysterious Way," has been fulfilled by the record 
of the Latter-day Saints. This was the favorite hymn of the late Presi- 
dent Wilford Woodruff. He loved it. We sang it, I am sure, some- 
times twice a month in our weekly meetings in the Temple, and very 
seldom did a month pass by when that song was not called for by Brother 
Woodruff. He believed in this work with all his heart and soul, and 
labored with all the power that God gave him for its advancement. That 
hymn is an inspiration. 

HYMNS FOUND AID IN GOING TO SLEEP 

This morning I repeated ten hymns while lying in bed, trying to 
go to sleep. Sometimes I can get to sleep before I can repeat all the 
verses of "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief," — seven long verses. Gen- 
erally I can get to sleep by the time I have repeated four verses ; but I 
tried to get to sleep this morning by repeating ten first-class prayers to 
the Lord. The song of the righteous, we are told, is a prayer unto the 
Lord, and I rejoice in praying to the Lord in those songs morning after 
morning, and have done so, I am sure, for thirty long years. I have 
learned that by repeating hymns, and taking some exercises, and then 
sitting up and talking to a dictaphone I become level enough in my mind 
to go to sleep. After trying for about two and one-half hours to go to 
sleep this morning I finally did get to sleep. 

By the way, something else that I generally repeat nearly every 
morning while I am lying awake in bed is a revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, after, please remember, a court martial by the 
entire forces of the State of Missouri had tried him and had condemned 
him to be shot to death the next morning, as I remember it, at nine 
o'clock. But he told his friends they need not worry, that God had 
told him his day had not come. To my mind, one of the greatest of all 
the revelations that he received was given to him while he was lying 
on a stone floor in Liberty jail. 

, QUOTES FROM MEMORABLE REVELATION 

I quote from that revelation : 

How long can rolling water remain impure? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri River in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder 
the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And. why are 
they not chosen? 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we under- 
take to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to 
exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children 
of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



themselves ; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, 
Amen to the Priesthood or the authority of that man. 

Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the 
pricks, to persecute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, 
they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

Hence many are called but few are chosen. 

Now mark this: 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness and by love unfeigned ; 

By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the 
soul without hypocrisy, and without guile — ■ 

Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost ; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward 
him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy. 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords 
of death. 

Let thy bowels, also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine 
of the Priesthood shall distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow 
unto thee forever and ever. 

VIRTUE SHOULD GARNISH THOUGHTS 

What a marvelous revelation ! What a wonderful word from God 
to us through His prophet ! How I wish that the Priesthood were always 
exercised with love. How I wish that virtue garnished our thoughts 
unceasingly. How I wish that no man holding the Priesthood of the 
living God was ever guilty of allowing any words to fall from his lips 
that he could not repeat in the presence of his mother. Then he would 
be, to a very great extent, in that straight and narrow path that leads 
to life eternal. 

There are very few things in all the world that are more demor- 
alizing than what are known as "shady" stories. There is nothing in 
all the world of the same value as a love of God and a desire to /do those 
things that we know would please God. 

USE OF LIQUOR 1 VIOLATION OF GOSPEL 

Let me say to you Latter-day Saints that any man or any woman 
professing to be a Latter-day Saint who keeps liquor in his or her home 
is not living the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We know that there are girls — 
good, fine, true, virtuous girls — who have lost their virtue because of 
liquor in the homes of Latter-day Saints. They lose their senses, 
become drunk, stupid, and then they lose their virtue ; and I know what 
I am talking about.

DRUNKENNESS SINCE PROHIBITION REPEAL 

With the help of the Lord, to the very best of my ability, I warned 
this people not to vote for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. I 
warned them against lies that were being circulated to the effect that 
there was more drunkenness and more use of liquor than there had been 
when we did not have Prohibition. Millions of dollars of money, I am 
sure, was expended to have the Eighteenth Amendment repealed. I 
have seen scores and scores of drunkards since it was repealed, and I 
have seen women go into restaurants and sit down and drink those things 
that we as Latter-day Saints know they should not drink. I never saw 
a drunken man in Idaho during all the times that I went there to attend 
conferences when we had Prohibition, but on the second trip I made 
there after Prohibition was repealed I got on a bus at Pocatello and 
there were two drunken men on the bus going from Pocatello to Idaho 
Falls. I waited fifteen minutes as I remember it, at Idaho Falls, in the 
early morning, about six o'clock, and I saw three more drunks, before 
the car arrived to take me to Rexburg. We see them now on all hands. 
The money that is being expended in Utah for liquor would take care 
of those that need help if used for that purpose. 

CRITICISM SHOWS FAILURE TO OBSERVE LAW 

The Lord God Almighty gave to us a revelation, and there is seldom 
a conference when someone does not take it upon himself to tell us: 
"Please do not speak on the Word of Wisdom. We hear it so much, 
we are sick and tired of it." Let me tell you something : No mortal man 
who is a Latter-day Saint and is keeping the Word of Wisdom is ever 
sick and tired of hearing it. When a man leaves a meeting and says (I 
have heard it in the dark) : "Can't they find something else to talk about 
besides the Word of Wisdom ; I am sick and tired of it"- — of course he 
is, because he is full of stuff that the Word of Wisdom tells him to 
leave alone. In the slang of the town, he could not "give himself away" 
any plainer than when he says he is sick and tired of the Word of 
Wisdom. I thank God nearly every day of my life for the Word of 
Wisdom. 

I never thought of speaking regarding the Word of Wisdom in my 
remarks today, until now, but here it is : 

A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, 
assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion— 

We are here in Zion. 

To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint — 

Some people say, "It is not given by commandment or constraint, and 
therefore I can take just a little sip." But what does it say? 

"WILL OF GOD" TO BE EMPHASIZED 

Not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation, and the word 
of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God — 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The will of God! Write it down, underscore it three times, and 
then, if there is anyone here who is not keeping it, get down on your 
knees and pray to God with all your heart to help you keep it in the 
future, that your example may perhaps save some pure, innocent, sweet 
woman from losing her virtue. 

Showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation 
of all Saints in the last days — 

The money that is expended for tea, coffee, tobacco and liquor would 
take care of all the poor people in the world, it would save the world, 
financially. 

Given for a principle with promise. 

For whom is it adapted? 

Adapted to the capacity of the weak and weakest of all Saints, who 
are or can he called Saints. 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence of 
evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men 
in the last days, I have warned you and forewarn you, by giving you this 
Word of Wisdom by revelation. 

HIGH SALARY PAID EXECUTIVE 

"Evils and designs." I have read that one million dollars a year in sal- 
ary is paid to the president of a tobacco company. As I remember it, 140- 
odd billion cigarets were consumed last year, and the tobacco interests are 
now planning to make it 200 billion in the next two years. What is a 
billion, speaking in dollars ? The great New York Life Insurance Com- 
pany had its actuaries make a calculation during the World War, and they 
announced that one billion dollars was the equivalent of a dollar a minute 
for every minute' from the time of the birth of the Saviour until the 
World War ; and we put over our share of the six billion dollar Liberty 
Loan drive in Utah, and I was the chairman of the Liberty Loan com- 
mittee. 140-odd billion cigarets were smoked in the United States of 
America in one year — the equivalent of 140 a minute for every minute 
from the time of the birth of the Saviour until the World War and 
now they want to make it 200 billion. 

AVOID HAVING WINE IN HOMES 

That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, 
behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father. 

Speaking of wine, we happen to know that in a Latter-day Saint home 
wine made from our own grapes made some people drunk. Wine is just 
about the finest thing in the world to make people drunk. Home-made 
wine is just as bad today as the other kind if you keep it long enough. 
Don't have it in your house, and then your children can not drink it. 
Once more I say: no true Latter-day Saint will have anything of this 
kind in his home for young people to drink. We happen to know of 
cases — I wish I could tell them all to you — that would make your hearts 
ache. Perhaps these things might come home to somebody's own child 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 15 

if we do not learn to study the word and will of God and then try to 
keep it. 

LIQUOR, TOBACCO FOR OTHER PURPOSES 

And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing 
of your bodies. 

And, again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is 
not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used 
with judgment and skill. 

We arrest people if they set houses on fire, but we do not arrest 
them if they burn up millions upon millions of dollars in tobacco and in so 
doing destroy their vitality. 

And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath 
ordained for the constitution, nature and use of man — • 

Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season 
thereof ; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, 
have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they 
are to be used sparingly. 

And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in 
times of winter, or of cold, or famine. 

WORD OF WISDOM, PRAYERS AND HEALTH 

I think that another reason why I have very splendid strength for 
an old man is that during the years we have had a cafeteria in the Utah 
Hotel, I have not, with the exception of not more than a dozen times, 
ordered meat of any kind. On these special occasions I have mentioned I 
have perhaps had a small, tender lamb chop. I have endeavored to live 
the Word of Wisdom, and that, in my opinion, is one reason for my good 
health, and another, for which I thank the Lord, is the prayers of the 
Saints that have been offered and answered in my behalf. 

All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff 
of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls 
of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth. 

And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger. 

All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; 
that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground ; 

Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the 
horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the 
field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also . 
other grain. 

BENEFITS ACCRUE FROM KEEPING COMMANDMENTS 

And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel 
and marrow to their bones. 

And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures. 

And above all, they shall be successful financially. One of the main 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



things — no, it is not the main thing — the main thing is that they will 
grow in a love of God ; they will grow in a testimony of the divine mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith ; they will grow in ability and strength 
to set examples before their children, that they will have those children 
eternally, instead of perhaps setting examples that will cause their chil- 
dren to depart from the faith. I call to mind the sons and daughters of 
some of my nearest and dearest and finest friends, that started with a 
little cigaret; then that was not strong enough and they used a strong 
cigar or a pipe ; in time they started drinking whiskey ; and finally they 
were excommunicated from the Church because of losing their virtue 
while under the influence of liquor. 

And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
50,000 COPIES OF PAMPHLET DISTRIBUTED 

We published and distributed 50,000 copies of a pamphlet containing 
the remarks of Creed Haymond, Paul Kimball and Joseph J. Cannon, 
proving by demonstration in rowing and in running foot races the ful- 
filment of this promise. 

And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. 

CHURCH LEADERS BLESSED 

Do you want to live a long time ? I do. I would like to stay here 
at least another twenty years, and I would like to work every day during 
that twenty years ; and I expect that maybe I may do it, if I live as I 
ought to live. The Lord has been very good to men who have stood at 
the head of this Church. 

Did you ever stop to reflect upon the fact that Brigham Young was 
a man of great strength, physically, when he was called away. I am sure 
he had appendicitis, and we knew nothing about appendicitis at that time. 
Did you ever stop to reflect upon the fact that John Taylor was 70-odd 
years of age when he came to the presidency of this Church? Did you 
ever stop to reflect upon the fact that Wilford Woodruff was over 80 
years old when he came to the presidency of this Church, and he gave us 
ten long years of splendid work? Lorenzo Snow came to the head of 
this Church when he was 85 years of age, and in three years he accom- 
plished some of the most remarkable and wonderful things for the 
Church that have ever been accomplished. President Joseph F. Smith 
was past the time of retirement, according to some people, and should 
have been drawing a pension for two years, at the time he came to the 
presidency of the Church. He was 62 years old, and he lived to be 80, 
giving to this Church 18 years of vigorous, strong, forceful leadership. 
I came to the presidency of this church when I was 62 years old, and, lo 
and behold, everybody tells me I look younger and stronger and better 
than I did 18 years ago. Let us remember a poem that I have repeated, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



17 



first in San Francisco, and later in New York, Detroit and in many 
other places : 

Age is a quality of mind; 

If your dreams you've left behind, 

If hope is cold; 
If you no longer look ahead, 
If your ambitions' fires are dead — 

Then you are old. 

But if from life you take the best, 
And if in life you keep the zest, 

If love you hold; 
No matter how the years go by, 
No matter how the birthdays fly — 

You are not old. 

EXPERIENCES IN EUROPE 

I can prove that. I went up to Scotland, when I was presiding over 
the European Mission, and an old lady asked me my age, and I told her 
that if I lived so many weeks I would be 50. She said : "Oh, nae, nae ; 
nae, nae, President Grant; never see 65 again." 

Brother Charles W. Penrose arrived in Liverpool to take my place 
as the President of the European Mission, and he brought with him a lot 
of Elders, 25 or 30, and we had about the same number of missionaries 
going back to their homes that very day. In those days we used to send 
100 to 150 emigrants to America in a company. They could come here 
and go up into Idaho and other places, preempt a piece of ground at $1.25 
an acre and have a fine farm that afterwards became worth $100.00 an 
acre or more. But that is all stopped now. We had a company going to 
America that very day, and we were very busy. 

At night the shipping firm with whom we had done business for 
many years sent us four tickets to the Shakespeare Theater. When Sir 
Henry Irving, and Ellen Terry, or some other great actor was there they 
would send us tickets. They did this two or three times a year and even 
oftener. I turned to my wife and said: "I wouldn't go to the finest 
theater on the face of the earth. I am tired. I am going to bed to rest 
and sleep. You take a missionary to bring you home from the theater, 
and a couple of the daughters, and use these tickets." 

Brother Penrose spoke up and said, "Sister Grant let the old man go 
to bed ; I will take you to the theater." (Laughter). 

I had just purchased, with the approval of President Joseph F. 
Smith, a very fine home, much better than anything we had had while 
I was there. He came over to England. I told him what I wanted to do, 
and took him into the place. The minute he went into it he said, "Buy it 
quick, Heber, before they change their minds." I had written him plead- 
ing with him to let me come home, that I had something to tell him, and 
I felt I could not do it by mail. I was afraid that I would not be able 
to get what I wanted. And, lo and behold, he was on the ocean at the 
time I wrote that letter. He said that I should not only buy the place 
but I should get all the furniture I could at the same time. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We were so busy that day, with 100 or more emigrants and 25 or 
more new missionaries, and 25 or more elders going home, that I did 
not even have an opportunity to show Brother Penrose his new home, 
although all we had to do was to walk up a few steps and over a wall, 
and we were in the backyard of the new home. Immediately after break- 
fast the following day I took him to the new home, and somebody asked 
the man who was moving his furniture out to guess our ages. He looked 
us over carefully, and he said, "I should say that Mr. Grant is 65, and 
that Mr. Penrose is 60." 

I said, "I have heard that a man is no older than he feels, and a 
woman no older than she looks. I felt so old that I went to bed last 
night because I was tired, and this old man here, 25 years older than 
I am — so, you have only made a mistake of 30 years — took my wife 
and daughters to the theater." 

The next Sunday I thought that I would get that corrected. I did 
not appreciate those three compliments. While at Birmingham I asked 
the president of the branch who he thought was older, Brother Penrose 
or myself — expecting to have a correct answer — and he said, "The idea 
of asking such a ridiculous question; anybody can see you are very 
much older than Brother Penrose." (Laughter) 

I hit the table, and said "That settles it, no old man will ever take 
my wife to the theater again," and he never has. (Laughter). 

HEEDS ADMONITION TO LIMIT LENGTH OF REMARKS 

I should very much like to occupy the other twenty minutes, but I 
firmly believe that if you hire a man to do a certain work, and he knows 
how to do it and you do not, it is a wise thing to let him do it. Now, I 
have a very dear friend who is my doctor, George W. Middleton, and he 
tells me that 40 or 45 minute speeches should be about my limit, and I 
have only two more minutes. 

BLESSINGS AND ADMONITIONS 

The Lord bless you and help you to keep his commandments, and 
to set an example of honesty, integrity and devotion; and to be willing 
to take care of yourselves, and not to ask anybody else to do it — if you 
have strength to do it yourself. And above all, may he help you so to 
live that there will not be a thing in your home that you can not go down 
on your knees and thank God that it is there, and that you will not do 
or say a thing that will be displeasing to the Lord. I do not expect 
any of you to ask God to bless you for keeping wine or making wine in 
the home and letting it get old and strong enough to make your children 
drunk; but if you cannot ask God to help you in what you do, repent 
and so live that you can. With the help of the Lord I will never do a thing 
that I can not get on my knees and plead with God to help me to do it, 
and I ask no more of any man than I am willing to do myself. 

God bless you all is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
our Redeemer, Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



19 



The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn "For the 
Strength of the Hills." 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am delighted to be here this morning, my brethren and sisters, and 
to have listened to the stirring address of our President. If the Latter- 
day Saints will follow his instructions and advice, the voice of the Lord 
will come to them through his Holy Spirit and they will be impressed 
anew with the grandeur of this latter-day work and they will realize that 
a mighty power came into the earth when the Lord revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the Gospel in this dispensation. 

A short time ago a prominent man in our country — a financier — 
made the assertion that there can be no successful operation of religious 
work without the cooperation of all the people, and that one church 
organization would be the thing to accomplish it. He expressed the wish 
that all the different churches might get together and become united. 
Naturally, as an organizer and leader of men, the benefits which would 
result from such a union of the churches appealed to him from a business 
point of view. 

But this gentleman did not realize that the mere coming together to 
join their interests and to find common objectives and principles of 
belief would not in reality make the churches one. Such a movement, if 
promoted with sincere intent and in brotherly confidence and love might 
indeed be a step in the right direction ; but more, far more than this is 
necessary to unite men in the Church of Christ. Divine authority is 
necessary to declare and make plain the Gospel plan with its principles 
and ordinances for man's salvation ; the gift of the Holy Ghost is requisite 
to give witness to the people that the plan is true and divine ; and it is 
essential that there be an organization of men holding the Priesthood of 
God to teach and administer the same. 

In the days of Christ and the Apostles the Church was set up and 
the Gospel preached for the very purpose of uniting the Saints, and all 
men were invited to come into the fold, under one great head, that there 
might be one Lord, one faith and one baptism. 

I remind you of the words of the Apostle Paul when he said that he 
gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and 
some, pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work 
of the ministry, until they should all come to a unity of the faith, unto 
a knowledge of the Son of God. 

In the days of our Savior's ministry he called men to the apostle- 
ship. He gave Peter the keys of the kingdom. He placed him at the 
head of the Church, and gave him power to seal on earth and to seal in 
heaven, to perform the work that he should do himself, had he remained. 
He brought forcefully to our attention the need of leadership and unity. 
Upon one occasion he said : 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am ? 

And they said ; Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some, Elias ; 
and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
of the Living God. 

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon 
Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father 
which is in Heaven. 

And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 

And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and 
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatso- 
ever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 

But the gates of hell prevailed against Peter. It has been taught 
that he was to remain, that his power was to be in the earth. Well, 
that is true so far as the influence of the doctrine he taught was concerned 
but the gates of hell did prevail against Peter, prevailed against the work 
of God. Christ himself suffered death, and his apostles also, whom he 
had chosen to represent him in the earth. The establishment of his work 
was accomplished in the day and generation in which he lived. 

And there came an end in that dispensation to the power of the 
Priesthood, for the power of the evil one destroyed the individual, Peter, 
who held the keys of the Kingdom, who had the power to seal on earth 
and to seal in heaven. 

But the power to reveal anew was still in force, for the Savior said : 
"Upon this rock I will build my church" — the rock of revelation — and 
the gates of hell could not prevail against that. When the time came for 
our Eternal Father to establish again that which had been taken from 
the earth, he did as he said he would, and he revealed the truth anew 
to men in the earth. He spoke to one man and to another as he did in 
the days of Abraham, and he re-established the plan by which the children 
of men might be saved, by which men and women might become enlight- 
ened and work out their own salvation, in obedience to the plan of our 
Eternal Father. 

He instituted again the true interpretation of repentance from sin 
that has been stressed here this morning by President Grant. He brought 
into the world again the ordinance of baptism by immersion. He revealed 
unto the children of men the truth that there should verily be one Lord 
and one faith and one baptism, one God, the Father of us all. This is 
indeed the great plan by which the children of men may work and ac- 
complish the things that they came forth to do, when they came from the 
presence of our Eternal Father into this world. 

So this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been 
established with apostles and prophets, and they are here for the perfect- 
ing of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, until all men shall come 
to a unity of the faith. 

There can be a unity of the faith, a universal acknowledgment of our 
Father's work, if men and women will only listen to the revelations of 
God that have come to the children of men in this dispensation of time in 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



21 



which we live. If they will make an investigation, in full, of the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of Christ, that he himself established in the day when 
he walked among men, if they will make an investigation of the words 
of the prophets that were spoken from the day of Adam until Christ, 
they will find recorded here in the earth at the present time the fulness 
of the everlasting Gospel, the plan by which our Eternal Father revealed 
that men should be saved, and in no other way. 

If they will become acquainted with the history of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they will discover that here is the 
Church under whose banner all men may unite. There need be no diver- 
sity of opinion; there need be no such thing as antagonism, for the 
Lord's work does not admit of diversion or contention or antagonism, 
only against the powers of evil. They will find in this Church that there 
is salvation for the living, salvation for the dead : that the power of God 
is vested again in the Saints ; that the power of his Priesthood is com- 
plete, that his commandments are certain, and that his ways are sure. 

If there is anything in the world that is precious to me it is the 
great truth which our Lord has revealed. There isn't a single thing in it 
that is weak. It is the strongest evidence of our Eternal Father's plan. 
It will stand the most rigid analysis. It is the thing that will bring men 
and women together, and cause them to repent, and do away with the 
things which destroy the human family. It will give them character and 
energy and power to carry on as individual sons and daughters of God 
ought to do and came in the earth to do. 

I pray the Lord to bless us in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

"Doxology" was sung by the Choir and congregation. 
Elder Franklin S. Harris, President of the Brigham Young Uni- 
versity, offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference was held Sunday afternoon at 
2 o'clock. 

Once more the great Tabernacle was crowded, every available space 
being occupied, and again thousands of people congregated in the Assem- 
bly Hall and on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened to the Con- 
ference proceedings as they were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "Now 
Let Us Rejoice." 

Elder Thomas M. Irvine, President of the North Weber Stake 
offered the opening prayer. 

An anthem, "Prayer of Thanksgiving," was sung by the Choir.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

PAYS TRIBUTE TO SINGERS AND MUSICIANS 

My brethren and sisters, I am indeed honored to be with you again 
and to partake of the spirit of this conference. 

I should like again to pay my tribute, for I feel they richly deserve it, 
to this great Tabernacle Choir mission. The influence which they are 
radiating for good, and the prejudice which they are overcoming cannot 
be measured. I am grateful for the devoted service of every member of 
the choir, for the devoted service of Brother Cornwall, their leader, of 
Brother Asper, the organist, and of Brother Evans who makes the an- 
nouncements. Each is doing a splendid job. 

During the course of the conference I believe we are to hear again 
from the Singing Mothers, under the direction of Sister Lottie Sackett. 
I should like to pay to them my respects and my assurances of apprecia- 
tion of the great work they are doing. They are indeed becoming one of 
the great musical institutions of this Church. May the Lord continue his 
blessings unto them. 

SAVIOR HAD TWO GREAT MISSIONS ON EARTH 

When the Savior came upon the earth he had two great missions ; 
one was to work out the Messiahship, the atonement for the .fall, and the 
fulfilment of the law; the other was the work which he did among his 
brethren and sisters in the flesh by way of relieving their sufferings, and 
again by teaching to them the great spiritual facts out of which by observ- 
ance may come eternal life. He left as a heritage to those who should 
come after him in his Church the carrying on of those two great things — 
work for the relief of the ills and the sufferings of humanity, and the 
teaching of the spiritual truths which should bring us back into the pres- 
ence of our Heavenly Father. 

This afternoon I wish to speak somewhat concerning matters which 
are directly related perhaps to the work of relieving our sufferings and 
our human ills, and I shall leave to others primarily the instruction with 
reference to those great spiritual truths which shall bring us back into the 
presence of God. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF AUTHORITIES 

I want to read you the last verses of the first chapter of Jacob in the 
Book of Mormon, and the second verse of the second chapter, as indicat- 
ing to you the responsibility which I regard the Authorities of this Church 
to be under as between themselves and yourselves and between all of us 
and our God. 

For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests 
and teachers of this people by the hands of Nephi. 

And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the 
responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR.

we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, 
by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments ; 
otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not 
be found spotless at the last day. 

Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility 
which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that 
I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day 
that I might declare unto you the word of God.'' 

I am not proposing to talk to the people about their sins, but I am 
hoping to say to you by way of warning and admonition some of the 
things which have come within my knowledge and of which I feel under a 
solemn duty to tell you. 

Recently I have had opportunity to discuss world conditions with 
men from both sides of the Atlantic who are leaders in industry and 
finance. 

BY WAY OF WARNING AND ADMONITION 

Pursuant to the responsibility of which Jacob spoke, I deem it my 
duty to tell members of the Church, by way of warning and admonition, 
of what the near future may bring insofar as these men can foresee. I 
devoutly hope they may be in error in their judgment ; I fear they may 
speak too near the truth. But whatever the eventuality may turn out 
to be, I am now giving the soundest human forecast of which I know. 

MILLIONS SPENT ON WAR MATERIALS 

European industrialists make these statements : That European 
countries are now spending eleven billions of dollars a year on military ar- 
mament; that Great Britain alone is spending two billion dollars; that 
European nations are piling up enormous quantities of raw materials used 
in war, particularly the metals ; that one nation has placed an order for the 
total world output of a certain metal for a year and a half ahead ; that 
stocks of raw materials of all war-like sorts now accumulating are many 
times greater than were gathered together at the end of the World War. 
On this statement it is clear that these gathered materials are not now 
destined for any useful purpose ; that they are not for the service but for 
the destruction of man ; that if they shall be used in war, they will be just 
that much human labor burned up without beneficial return to man — just 
as if so much money were burned up in a furnace. It will be a tragic and 
wicked waste. 

PURCHASES REACT UPON COMMODITY PRICES 

These men also assert that these tremendous purchases of war stocks 
have advanced prices of the materials concerned; that these price ad- 
vances have reacted on other manufactured commodities, the prices of 
which have also advanced ; that these advances have resulted in advances 
of labor costs ; and that on account of all these advances, there will be in 
the immediate future a period of prosperity or inflation, which ever you 
choose to call it, in which the costs of living will go up, and we shall pay 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



more for food, clothing, fuel and shelter. American financiers say this 
means the value of the dollar will go down — that is, a dollar will buy less 
and less of the necessaries of life. 

EXTERMINATING WAR AND/OR CHAOTIC DEPRESSION 

These experienced financiers and industrialists further say that this 
prosperity period will be over — some say in two years, some say in 
ten, that if war shall come, the period will last till the end of the war; 
but that if the war does not come, then this prosperity period will end 
so soon as the nations feel reasonable security in a period of peace. 

These same authorities declare that if war shall come, its ending will 
leave the world in a state of exhaustion heretofore unknown to modern 
times ; that the depression from which we are now emerging will be but as 
a shadow of the real hard times which will then come. They affirm that 
if war does not come, but instead this sense of temporary security, that 
then the nations will dispose of their excess war materials, that this will 
close great industries and bring idleness ; that the resulting loss of markets 
and trade will bring ruin to industries, and that the depression and in- 
dustrial paralysis which follows will be the full equal of that which would 
follow another World War. They feel that this next world depression 
will be near, if not quite, a chaos which will, in the existing state of mind 
of the peoples of the world, threaten the very existence of government, of 
property, of human rights, of liberty, even of the family itself. 

Everyone who reads the newspapers knows that the naval and mili- 
tary leaders of all nations believe the next war will look to the exter- 
mination of nations, not the destruction of armies ; that not alone shall the 
able-bodied soldiers be cut down, but that innocent babes, their mothers, 
the aged, decrepit, and infirm are to be slaughtered. Great Britain is 
providing a gas mask for every man, woman, child and infant in the 
United Kingdom, and the people are being trained to use them as a pro- 
tection against the poison gas their enemies are expected to use. The 
next war will not be a series of battles, but of butcheries. 

EUROPEANS PLAN TO HAVE U. S. PAY FOR WAR 

Notwithstanding the fact that our former associates in the World 
War owe us the money which we lent them amounting to over ten bil- 
lions of dollars, and also owe us the great bulk of the interest which we, 
the people of the United States have been paying on that loan, and 
notwithstanding they took tremendous loot from Germany at the end of 
the War of which we did not, I am proud to say, take a cent, war loot, 
counting the German colonial possessions, many, many times greater than 
the money they owe us, nevertheless there is strongest reason for be- 
lieving that some of the most skilled, astute, and shrewd diplomats, politi- 
cians, and statesmen of all Europe are now planning to have the people 
of the United States finance the next European war either before the 
war begins or during its progress. 

Furthermore, certain of these same diplomats, politicians, and states- 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 25 



men are planning to entice the United States into an offensive and de- 
fensive military alliance in order that we shall participate in that next 
world war by sending our young men to the battlefields of Europe The 
argument they now plan to use to bring this about is that in this way 
only can the peace of the world be preserved While this is a most 
profound fallacy, it will unfortunately find a sympathetic ear among 
many of the people of this country who do not fully understand inter- 
national relations. It will require the wisest statesmanship on our part 
to prevent the United States from becoming again the victim of a 
world military catastrophe. 

TERRIBLE DEPRESSION INDICATED BY SIGNS 

We shall hope and pray that these men who predict such a dire 
future are in error. But whether or not these men are seeing false 
visions or are peering accurately into the future, yet I know of no 
responsible authority who challenges the forecast that within the next 
few years we shall, in the normal course, suffer a depression far more 
serious, affecting intimately far greater numbers of the people, than the 
one we are now finishing. 

This prospect gives a new significance to the Church Security Plan 
and gives the final but unneeded evidence of the inspiration which led 
President Grant to inaugurate that great and far-reaching movement. If 
that chaos shall come which these men fear, then those only will survive 
who shall extend the one to the other a mutual, brotherly, loving, unselfish 
help. In this view we may not believe we are at the end of the Security 
Plan ; we are only at the beginning. 

These men to whom I have referred bemoan with united voice this 
great world-wide tragedy which they feel they clearly foresee, but which 
they assert they have no power to avert. Indeed, one feels, rather 
than sees, that no human power can cope with and ward off this threaten- 
ing cataclysm. 

Reading together the Scriptures and the signs of the times, and re- 
membering that the measure of time with God is not the measure of time 
with man, one cannot but consider whether we be not now in the very 
times foretold by the Savior in his great discourse on the Mount of Olives, 
and predicted by the prophets from most ancient times. Are not the 
anti-Christs now walking the earth ? 

STRENGTH NEEDED TO MEET EMERGENCY 

When we see how far beyond the reach of human mind and hand 
the world today has gone, when we calmly ponder and reflect upon the 
crumbling of human ideals and institutions no matter how sacred they 
have been heretofore held, and when we peer down into the unfathom- 
able abyss into which man seems ready to plunge, unless in God's mercy 
he shall be drawn back, we do glimpse darkly and in broadest outline 
only, the working of those great infinite forces of right and wrong which 
had their birth, so far as we know, when Satan and his hosts were thrust 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



from heaven, and truth and falsehood began their millenniums of conflict 
for mastery. May the Lord give us strength to meet this test if it shall 
come. 

PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES SUGGESTED 

What may we as a people and as individuals do for oureslves to 
prepare to meet this oncoming disaster, which God in his wisdom may 
not turn aside from us? 

First, and above and beyond everything else, let us live righteously, 
fearing God and keeping his commandments, that we may in part claim 
his blessing as of right, and not as of mercy only. Along this way only 
lies happiness and salvation. For the Lord has said : 

Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is 
not full. * * * * 

Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but 
care for the soul, and for the life of the soul. 

And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess 
your souls, and ye shall have eternal life." (Doctrine and Covenants 
101 :36-38.), 

Let us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague ; where we are now 
in debt let us get out of debt ; if not today, then tomorrow. 

Let us straitly and strictly live within our incomes, and save a little. 

Let every head of every household see to it that he has on hand 
enough food and clothing, and, where possible, fuel also, for at least a 
year ahead. You of small means put your money in foodstuffs and 
wearing apparel, not in stocks and bonds ; you of large means will think 
you know how to care for yourselves, but I may venture to suggest that 
you do not speculate. Let every head of every household aim to own 
his own home, free from mortgage. Let every man who has a garden 
spot, garden it ; every man who owns a farm, farm it. 

Let us again clothe ourselves with these proved and sterling virtues 
— honesty, truthfulness, chastity, sobriety, temperance, industry and 
thrift ; let us discard all covetousness and greed. 

MAN MUST WORK 

We must purge our hearts of the love of ease ; we must put out from 
our lives the curse of idleness. God declared that mortal man should earn 
his bread by the sweat of his brow. That is the law of this world. In 
the past it has taxed our economic strength and system to keep the 
relatively very few idle rich. That task shows us that no great groups can 
be kept in idleness. It surely is not natural to believe that they may. People 
have been insufficiently fed and clad with every one working who was 
able to work. Why delude ourselves into thinking that a third of us 
may live in idleness and all of us be better off ? If a third may be idle, and 
all be better off than now, then why not a half idle and increase the pros- 
perity; and if half, why not two-thirds, and if two-thirds, then all of us 
idle and have every man a millionaire, and nobody working. 

Furthermore, to provide by law that a third shall live off the two- 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



27 



thirds, is to set up a legal slavery of the two-thirds who work. As one 
within the age of the proposed idle class, I protest with all the spirit and 
strength I possess against the infliction upon me of such a curse. May 
the Lord forbid that this shall come. 

For the decrepit and infirm, from any cause, I have, we all have, 
the deepest sympathy, as also for those in distress from causes beyond 
their control. To all such we owe a sacred duty to help. God's law has 
always been "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self." This we must 
do. But side by side with this law is that other law, declared from the 
beginning, that while man can work, he must work. These are the two 
great laws, the two fundamental principles behind the Church Security 
Plan. The aim of that plan is to put those two great truths into the lives 
of all of us. 

May God give unto us the power always to see the truth. May he 
increase our faith day by day. May he enable us from hour to hour to 
live more nearly to him, to keep his commandments, to follow along the 
lines which he has marked out for us. May he give us wisdom to foresee 
and to vision the future. May he give us the strength and the power of 
the Spirit, to prepare for that future, whatever it may be. That these 
blessings may come to us, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

This morning as I listened to the sincere and earnest appeal made by 
President Grant to the people of the Church to obey the Word of Wis- 
dom and other commandments of the Lord, I was reminded of a signifi- 
cant saying of Jesus recorded in the 7th chapter of Matthew. This 
afternoon I wish to associate this passage also with the warning and 
admonition given by President Clark : 

Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, 
I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; 

And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew 
and beat upon that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon 
a rock. 

I commend this passage of the Savior to every Latter-day Saint, 
and trust that we may be not forgetful hearers, but doers of the word. 

A number of these have come to my mind, each of which is worthy 
of consideration at this conference, but none seems to me to be more 
timely and of greater significance than respect for law. Our twelfth 
Article of Faith says : 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and mag- 
istrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. 

MORAL SENSE BASIS OF ALL SOCIAL LAW 

Law, particularly in a democracy, is a system of social order estab- 
lished and enforced by society. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Divine law has its origin in Deity ; social law sprang primarily from 
the moral sense of the community. In a democracy in which the will of 
the people is sovereign, law is successfully operative only to the extent 
that the moral sense of the community is in sympathy with it. 

The three significant words used in the 12th Article of Faith express 
the proper attitude of the membership of the Church toward law. These 
words are — obey, honor and sustain. 

The Article does not say we believe in submission to the law. Obedi- 
ence implies a higher attitude than mere submission, for obedience has 
its root in good intent ; submission may spring from selfishness or mean- 
ness of spirit. Though obedience and submission both imply restraint on 
one's own will, we are obedient only from a sense of right ; submissive 
from a sense of necessity. 

Honor expresses an act or attitude of an inferior towards a superior. 
When applied to things it is taken in the sense of holding in honor. Thus, 
in honoring the law, we look upon it as something which is above selfish 
desires or indulgences. 

To sustain signifies to hold up ; to keep from falling. To sustain 
the law, therefore, is to refrain from saying or doing anything which will 
weaken it or make it ineffective. 

We obey law from a sense of right. 

We honor law because of its necessity and strength to society. 
. We sustain-law by keeping it in good repute. 

One of the principal functions of religion is to develop a sense of 
confidence in man, and faith in God as the Father of men. If the Church 
(of Jesus Christ) cannot do these things, then it will have failed in ful- 
filling its divine destiny. However in efforts to establish confidence in 
man and social institutions, we must not shut from our minds certain un- 
pleasant facts which tend to undermine confidence and disintegrate the 
very foundation upon which society is built. 

DISRESPECT FOR LAW AMONG WORST OF EVILS 

Disrespect for law is among the worst of such evils. It is regrettable 
that the United States today has the reputation of being one of the most 
lawless of nations. This unsavory reputation is attributed largely to the 
shattering during the World War of long-cherished ideals and the lower- 
ing of moral standards ; and it is true that "the war was in every respect 
a vast school of demoralization." Every rule of morality, public and 
private, was openly infringed. 

There are those who blame Prohibition for the wave of lawlessness 
that has been sweeping over the country, but since repeal, the illicit 
traffic in booze still continues unabated. Drunkenness is increasing, and 
so is the number of intoxicated drivers who imperil the lives of innocent 
people on the public highway. In the use of tobacco the law is flagrantly 
violated and dishonored. 

Note the following : "Any person who sells, gives or furnishes any 
cigar, cigaret or tobacco in any form, or any opium or other narcotic in 
any form to any person under 21 years of age is guilty of a misdemeanor." 



PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 



29 



And again, "Any person under the age of 21 years who buys, accepts or 
has in his possession any cigar, cigaret or tobacco in any form, or any 
opium or any other narcotic in any form is guilty of a misdemeanor or 
shall be deemed a delinquent child as the case may be." 

VIOLATIONS BODE ILL FOR SOCIETY 

It augurs ill for society when in the face of such a law on the statute 
books, many high school boys from 15 to 19 years of age indulge openly 
in this pernicious habit. That such violations occur constantly in our own 
community none can deny. 

Petty thefts, holdups, and robberies of various kinds and degrees 
are all too common. 

Illegal possession of corporate property is a new menace. Millions 
of dollars are being lost to laborers, and bitter animosities engendered by 
sit-down strikes, a new weapon in the hands of unionism which may prove 
a boomerang to honest labor. If lawlessness or even disregard for the 
rights of employes on the part of employers is the cause of sit-down 
strikes, then the menace of such strife to the stability of society is only 
increased. 

These things which I have merely named indicate the trend to dis- 
regard law and order. Of all crushing taxes that impede the economic 
recovery of the American people, the crime tax is the greatest. The cost 
of our crime has now reached the staggering sum of 13 billion dollars a 
year, an amount equal to the entire revenue of the United States. Every 
year twelve thousand persons are murdered, three thousand are kidnaped, 
100,000 are assaulted, and fifty thousand are robbed. 

America is a land of boasted liberty, but liberty may be either help- 
ful or fatal according to the use made of it. Is it liberty when a group 
of men with threats of violence prevent an employer from entering his 
own property ? No ! Liberty is shackled and violence rules ! "Liberty 
is an atmosphere of the higher life, and it is only by a slow and patient 
inward transformation that one becomes capable of breathing it." 

MAN MUST BE MADE WORTHY OF LIBERTY 

Liberty ? — it is respect ; liberty ? — it is obedience to the inner law ; 
and this law is neither the good pleasure of the mighty, nor the caprice of 
the crowd, but the high and impersonal rule before which those who 
govern are the first to bow the head. Shall liberty, then, be proscribed ? 
No ; but men must be made capable and worthy of it, otherwise public 
life becomes impossible, and the nation, undisciplined and unrestrained, 
goes on through license into the inextricable tangles of demagoguery." 

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are 
explicitly enjoined to uphold the law. The Lord says in Section 58 of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, "Let no man break the laws of the land, 
for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the 
land." 

Reverence. Akin to the respect for law and a contributing factor 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



toward it is reverence for sacred things. It has been truly said that 
reverence is the noblest state in which a man can live in the world. If that 
is true, then irreverent man has a crudeness about him that is repellant. 
He is cynical, often sneering, and nearly always, iconoclastic. 

RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH CHILDREN REVERENCE, OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

Reverence and obedience to law should begin at home. Indeed, too 
much emphasis cannot be laid upon the responsibility of parents to teach 
their children reverence for God in all things sacred, and to honor and 
uphold the law. 

The true expression of reverence is found in the Saviour's admoni- 
tion— "Love the Lord thy God with all thy might, mind and strength, 
and thy neighbour as thyself." 

As a Church in our worshiping assemblies, we have much room for 
improvement in this regard. Stake officers, Bishops, Quorum Presidents, 
Auxiliary leaders should make a special effort to maintain more reverence 
during hours of worship. Children should be impressed with the inap- 
propriateness of confusion and disorder in a worshiping assembly, and 
should be made to realize that it is the height of rudeness to leave service 
before dismissal. Young people who ignore such proprieties are two 
hundred and fifty years behind the times. They should have lived in 
colonial days when just to make sure that they stayed out the service, 
young men were locked in their pews by their superiors. 

REVERENCE ON DECLINE AMONG MANY 

Charles Edward Jefferson, the author of "The Character of Jesus," 
says: 

We are not by nature or by training a reverent people. There are those 
who say we become less reverent as the years go on. The older people are 
constantly lamenting that they miss a certain beautiful respectfulness, a 
lovely reverence which were more common many years ago. There are 
wide areas of American society from which the spirit of reverence has been 
banished. Men and women in many circles are clever, interesting, brilliant, 
but they lack one of the three dimensions of life — they have no reach up- 
ward. Their conversation sparkles, but it is frivolous and often flippant. 
Their talk is witty, but the wit is often at the expense of high and sacred 
things. 

He has come far down in the scale of being who in order to display 
his powers finds it necessary to ridicule those things which have been 
prized by all good men. When one enters the world of our present-day 
reformers he is impressed by the large number who lack the upward look. 
Many of these, men are tremendously in earnest, they see the crying evils 
of the world; their sympathies are wide and their zeal is hot, but they 
have no sky above their heads. They aim to glorify no Father who is in 
Heaven. Some of them claim to admire the Man of Nazareth. They 
extol His character and His teachings. Yet strange to say, they do not 
imitate His reverence, or cast a single glance in the direction in which 
His eyes were always looking. One finds this lack of reverence even in 
the Church. In every community there are those who treat the house 
of God as they treat a street car, entering it and leaving it when they 



PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 



31 



please. Even habitual Church attendants often surprise and shock one 
by their irreverent behavior in the house of prayer. Those persons are 
not ignoramuses or barbarians ; they are simply undeveloped in the virtue 
of reverence. / 



Why is it that reverence is apparently in a state of decadence? Is 'it 
due to our improper reading? The press is constantly exploiting the 
sordid side of human nature, calling our attention to moral collapse and 
degradation, and it may be that our familiarity with vice in its varied 
forms is taking off the edge of our sensibility so that we no longer 
respond readily to the things which are noble and high. What has the 
stage to do — do you think — with our loss of reverence? It is lamentable 
that so large a proportion of plays move in that border-land which lies 
between decency and indecency. The openly immoral play cannot as 
yet be endured, but the play that is most popular is often a play which 
skirts the edges of the realms of the indecent. Theater audiences seem 
to like a sentence now and then which looks in the direction of the unclean, 
and to relish an occasional insinuation or remark which leads down to the 
mud. Our imagination may be so coarsened by the realism through 
which it travels as to lose the capacity for feeling the rapture of the 
sense of awe. 



If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar : for he 
that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom 
he hath not seen? 

And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God 
love his brother also. 

I speak of Reverence in connection with obedience to law because 
a reverent person is law-abiding. No one can love God sincerely and 
harbor in his heart enmity for his fellow men. Enmity is sin and "who- 
soever committeth sin doth lawlessness ; for sin is lawlessness." 

Brethren and sisters, the time calls for Latter-day Saints everywhere 
to demonstrate by deeds as well as by words that we love God, revere 
sacred things and places, and obey, honor, and sustain the law. God 
help us in our efforts so to do, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



The Choir and the congregation sang the hymn, "O, Say, What is 
Truth?" 



I have been enjoying to the fullest extent the fine meetings of this 
General Conference. I bear witness that we have listened to servants of 
the Lord giving us instruction. They were inspired by him who is the 
Author of our being. Unselfish advice has been offered to us by those 
whom the Lord has called to teach. 

Conditions in the world at the present time are a problem to me 
because of the diversity of interests that seem to be operating every-

where. Selfishness, jealousy and hatred have taken possession of the 
human family to a remarkable degree and warfare is in the air. 

HELPED BY WISE COUNSELS 

When I was a child I had great satisfaction in hearing those who 
addressed us in this building. As a youth I used to come quite regularly 
to the Sunday afternoon services held here and listen to the great choir 
and organ and to the instructions of the servants of the Lord. Most of 
those men have finished their work and passed to the other side, but 
from their wise counsels I received much that has helped me in my life to 
choose the better part, and to obtain happiness in the companionship of 
our Father's children. 

I learned while young to revere those who have been called to direct 
us in this Church and have continued so to do. 

It is only six months ago that sitting here with us was our beloved 
brother, Alonzo A. Hinckley. We did not know at that time that he was 
to leave us so soon. One by one, stalwarts who have given the best that 
was in their lives to encourage, uplift and bless us are called home to their 
reward. Others are raised up to take their places who are willing to carry 
on, and notwithstanding the responsibilities are great and the burdens 
heavy, men and women just as fine as the world has ever known have 
accepted the call to service in this Church, and many today are serving 
unselfishly for the blessings of our Father's children. 

SCRIPTURE TEACHINGS APPROPRIATE TODAY 

President Clark referred to the words of Jacob in the Book of Mor- 
mon. I feel to repeat a portion of what he read to us : 

Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility 
which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, that I 
might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day, 
that I might declare unto you the word of God. 

I recommend that when you go home that you read the second chap- 
ter of Jacob, all of it, for it is full of excellent advice and counsel, and 
if Jacob had been speaking today it could have been no more appropriate. 
He realized the responsibility of his. leadership among the people and 
had the courage to counsel them. 

'We are living in a day when we must choose for ourselves as did 
one of old. Read what this prophet said to Israel in the 24th chapter of 
Joshua. Read it all. It is excellent advice to us today. In warning the 
people Joshua said, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve, * * * but 
as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." 

THE PURPOSE OF CONFERENCES 

As I look into the faces of this great congregation of wonderful 
men and women and listen to the tuneful voices of these sons and 
daughters of the living God, and realize that we are all here in the house 
of the Lord to worship and to be instructed, not by man only but by 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



33 



the inspiration of our Heavenly Father, who is 'the Author of our being, 
my soul is refreshed. 

If we have come in the spirit of repentance and humility, we have 
a right to receive instruction that is necessary for our development. If 
we have come to worship with the prayer in our hearts, "Father in 
Heaven, teach us," we are entitled to receive the promise that he has made 
that "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I 
in the midst of them." 

We are here, not two or three, but a great multitude, privileged 
as are few of our Father's children in the world. We are living not only 
in the day in which he has spoken, but we are offered the opportunity to 
listen to the voices of men who receive his inspiration when they teach us. 
If therefore we fall into by and forbidden paths we will not be able 
to blame anybody but ourselves, because if we are teachable, if we are 
humble, if we are willing to do what the Lord would have us do, we have 
the information at hand, not only in the records that have been handed 
down to us by those who have given their lives that we might have the 
truth, but we also have the privilege of listening to the voices of living 
oracles who are as unselfish and faithful as those that we revere because 
of the records that they have left behind. 

The adversary is not asleep. He is deceiving many and leading them 
to sin. Reference has been made to the fact that in our own community 
there are those who fail to appreciate their privileges. There are some 
who are teaching false doctrine ; and some who are seeking to persuade 
men and women to violate the commandments of our Heavenly Father. 
There are those who pretend to be inspired and who would take the 
leadership of the people, if they were so permitted. Of course they are 
not capable to lead and in their own lives are living improperly, and the 
adversary is using them as tools by which others may be deceived. 

THE PATH OF SAFETY 

There is only one pathway of safety for me in this day and that 
is to follow those whom the Lord has appointed to lead. I may have my 
own ideas and opinions, I may set up my own judgment with reference 
to things, but I know that when my judgment conflicts with the teachings 
of those that the Lord has given to us to point the way, I should change 
my course. If I desire salvation I will follow the leaders that our 
Heavenly Father has given to us, as long as he sustains them. 

If the members of this Church who find fault with the leaders of 
the Church and criticise those who are giving their very lives to bless 
and benefit us would only pause long enough to ask prayerfully, "Which 
of these teachers is it safe to follow ?" they would have no difficulty in 
finding their right course and would sustain those whom the Lord 
sustains. 

We are living in a day when we need humility, when we need 
charity, when we need patience, and we are living in a time when it is 
the privilege of every man and every woman to do great good by setting 
righteous examples.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I feel sad sometimes when I hear the unkind things that are spoken, 
not only of people in our Church, but of people in the world. Unkind 
things are not usually said under the inspiration of the Lord. The Spirit 
of the Lord is a spirit of kindness ; it is a spirit of patience ; it is a spirit of 
charity and love and forbearance and long suffering ; and there are none 
of us who do not need all these virtues that are the result of the pos- 
session of the Spirit of our Heavenly Father. 

KINDNESS TOWARDS THOSE WHO ERR 

There are those who will make mistakes. There are those among 
us today that have gone astray, but they are the children of our Lord 
and he loves them. He has given to you and to me the right to go to 
them in kindness and love and with patience and with a desire to bless, 
seek to win them from the mistakes that they are making. It is not my 
privilege to judge some of these that have made mistakes and are still 
making mistakes, unless I am so called by reason of the authority that 
may be conferred upon me. But it is my privilege, if I see them doing 
the wrong thing, to in some way, if possible, turn them back into the 
pathway that leads to eternal life in the Celestial kingdom. 

The Presidency of the Church have counseled us today. They are 
the representatives of our Heavenly Father, not only to this people, 
but they represent him to all the people of the earth. We would do well 
if we would magnify and honor these men he has placed at our head. 
They are men with human frailties, they will make mistakes, but if we 
will be as charitable to the mistakes that they make as we are to our own 
failures and mistakes, we will see their virtues as we see our own. 

UNKIND CRITICISM UNBECOMING IN LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I stand here to plead with you, my brethren and sisters, not to 
permit words of criticism or of unkindness to pass your lips about those 
whom the Lord has called to lead us. Do not be found in the companion- 
ship of those who would belittle them or weaken their influence among 
the children of men. If you do, I can say to you that you will find your- 
selves in the power of the adversary. You will be influenced by him 
to go as far as possible from the pathway of truth, and if you do not 
repent you may find when it is too late that you have lost the "pearl 
of great price." Because of your selfishness and your blindness you 
will have been led away, and your loved ones who have given their very 
lives in order that you might enjoy the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ will be sorrowing on the other side of the veil because of your 
weakness and your folly. 

You know we are all tied together by the great work that is being 
done in the temples of our Father, where families that have not been 
united before are brought together by the power of the Holy Priesthood. 
The Lord intended that every one of his sons and daughters should have 
the opportunity to be blessed, not only here upon the earth, but to enjoy 
eternal blessings. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



35 



Think of the devotion and the faithfulness of those who day after 
day go into these temples and officiate for those who have passed to the 
other side, and know this that those who are on the other side are just 
as anxious about us. They are praying for us and for our success. They 
are pleading, in their own way, for their descendants, for their posterity 
who live upon the earth, many of whom, because they have been unwise, 
have been betrayed into fighting the Church and Kingdom of God and 
opposing those who are its leaders. 

INFLUENCE OF HOME 

Brethren and sisters, I plead with you that when you return to 
your home you see to it that your children are properly taught. Only 
a few days ago I saw a letter from a man who had probably lived half his 
life. In writing to his father he said: "Your consideration for your 
loved ones, your teaching of me, the examples that you set me, have been 
an inspiration for me to do what the Lord would have me do. I have felt 
in following in your footsteps I would be safe." That was a wise father, 
that was a blessed father, who could plant in the mind of his son such 
confidence. The son has lived much in the world, but because of the 
conduct of the father — at least he gave his father credit in his letter — 
because of the example set in his home, he is today one of the stalwarts 
of this Church. He can live in the world and keep the commandments 
of the Lord. His anxiety to do good was inspired by the home in which 
he lived. He did not discover selfishness in the home, but unselfishness. 
The parents were not anxious to get all that they could and hold it 
selfishly for their own, but they went about seeking those who needed 
them, encouraging and blessing them. All the talking in the world would 
not have put into that man's heart that which he has today, but it was the 
example that was set by his parents, by those who lived in the home in 
which he lived. 

I have no doubt there are hundreds of men and women, thousands 
of them, perhaps, in the communities in which we live and in the world, 
who would say the same thing of the teachings of their fathers and their 
mothers. But I fear there are some of us who are influenced by the 
customs of the world and are obsessed with the idea that we have to 
follow the crowd regardless of what they believe or do. In that case our 
example will not be a blessing but may destroy the happiness of our 
children. 

Permit me to direct your attention to chapter 8 of 1st Nephi in the 
Book of Mormon wherein the Lord showed to Lehi in a dream or vision 
the condition of the people of the world and the influences that did and 
would exist among them. A few would seek righteousness but the mul- 
titude would seek pleasure and unrighteousness. He saw an iron rod 
along a path that could be followed that would lead those who held to it 
into a place of safety and happiness. Those who held on to the iron rod — 
and they were the minority — found the tree of life. The majority went 
into a large and spacious building that was shown to Lehi as the abiding 
place of those who did not understand or would not receive the truth. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



They failed to gain an inheritance of celestial glory. Lehi was desirous 
that his family should hold to the rod and join him at the tree of life, 
but he was shown that there were those in his own household that would 
not do so. Are we living such lives that those who follow our example 
will find the tree of life? 

SAFETY IN LIVING THE GOSPEL 

God has spoken. The Gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord, is upon the 
earth, with power and authority. We live in the evening of the fulness 
of times. The world will soon be devastated with war and carnage, 
with plague and all the distresses that the Lord has promised unless they 
repent ; but he has indicated that they will not repent, and distress must 
come. 

You, my brethren and sisters, have been called out of the world. 
Opportunity has been offered to you to understand what we may expect 
and what we will receive if we are faithful and labor in kindness and love. 
Under the leadership of the best men and the best women that have lived 
upon the earth, Zion's sons and daughters are going forward, and if we 
will follow the advice and counsel that the Lord has given, our pathway 
will be one of happiness. It will be a pathway, perhaps not of ease and 
comfort always, but in the end it will terminate in the presence of our 
Heavenly Father, and glory, immortality and eternal lives will be our 
portion. 

Is it .worth the effort ? Shall we close our eyes and in carelessness 
and indifference follow the crowd, or shall we hold to the iron rod, looking 
forward and upward, determined that we will earn the better part, and 
in the end receive the welcome of our Father, Well done, my good and 
faithful son, my good and faithful daughter ; enter into your rest ? 

I am grateful for my membership in this Church and am thankful 
for all the blessings that are mine. I appreciate the brethren with whom 
I associate, and am thankful for you, my brethren and sisters, with 
whom I mingle in the Church, for your fine fellowship and for the 
wonderful kindness that you manifest as we minister among you. 

SET HOMES IN ORDER 

I pray that you may have wisdom to set your own homes in order 
today, not delaying. Set them in order while there is yet time. Call 
your families about you, and if you have failed in the past to give them 
an understanding of the purposes of life and a knowledge of the Gospel 
of our Lord, do it now, for I say to you as a servant of the Lord, they 
need it now and they will need it from now on. 

I pray that the Lord will help us, that he will give us patience and love 
for our fellows, that we may be worthy of the high calling that has come 
to us as his servants, holding his Holy Priesthood, or as his daughters, 
blessed with knowledge such as women in the world do not possess. That 
we may be worthy of his continued favor and love one another, as he has 
commanded us to do, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We are living in a rapidly changing world. The old is giving way 
to the new. We have new thoughts and feelings, new ways of doing 
and living. So rapid are the changes that many of us are more or less 
dazed and in danger of being swept off our feet. In a sense there is a 
confusion of tongues — certainly a confusion of plans, teachings, reme- 
dies, panaceas and whatnots. Some people are beginning to lose their 
anchorage and drift out into tempestuous seas without chart or rudder. 
In thus speaking I have in mind tendencies of the times, exhibited by 
many people. To what extent our people are affected by these things 
I do not know. I would like to believe that all of us deeply cherish our 
heritage of truth and stand immovable for the fundamental principles 
and doctrines that have characterized our Church from the beginning. 

TIME CANNOT CHANGE FUNDAMENTALS 

Fourteen months ago I was asked by a very intelligent lady in 
London what the characteristic doctrines of Mormonism are. I recited 
some of the Articles of Faith. Her reply was that most of these could 
not be characteristic for she knew non-Mormons who believed many, 
if not all, of these Articles, though, she admitted, there might be some 
differences in detail. I answered we certainly have some major char- 
acteristic beliefs. What are they, do you say? They constitute the 
chief features of our message to the world. And however rapid the 
changes of the times in this or in future generations these major char- 
acteristics will always remain fundamentals in our religious faith. Time 
cannot change or efface them. What are some of these ? 

THE FIRST VISION A REALITY 

The first one that I shall name is a belief in the divinity of Joseph 
Smith's call to set up Christ's authorized Church in this dispensation. 
We believe in the reality of his first great vision, wherein he saw the 
Father and the Son, heard their voices, and received messages from 
them. In this miraculous vision he learned that these two heavenly 
Beings are separate and distinct personalities in whose form man is made, 
thus confirming the teaching of Genesis that God created man in his 
own image. 

From that moment Joseph's ideas relative to the persons of the 
Father and the Son were correct and definite, and he taught them with 
convincing certainty, thus restoring to the world long lost precious 
truths. Their persons are limited in form to the bodies they occupy and 
are not diffused as an essence or shapeless entities throughout the im- 
mensity of space. They are real, living, glorified Personages. They 
had actually answered his earnest but simple prayer. He knew that they 
lived, for he had both seen and heard them. This definite knowledge of 
the personality of God had been lost to the world and with it a solid 
basis upon which faith could be built. 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

RESURRECTED BEINGS APPEAR 

But further exceedingly important knowledge was later given to 
the Prophet. The Angel Moroni appeared to him. Who was Moroni ? 
A tangible, resurrected personage who had lived upon the American 
continent about fourteen hundred years before. Moroni could be resur- 
rected because Christ had previously been resurrected, breaking the bonds 
of death and thus achieving a victory over the grave not only for himself 
but for all the human family. The reality "of a bodily resurrection is a 
fact which became known to the youthful Prophet. 

This knowledge was made doubly certain when the resurrected John 
the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery May 15, 
1829, and ordained them to the Aaronic priesthood. Both of these 
young men thus learned that tangible, resurrected beings live in the 
heavens. 

The Baptist came as a messenger from God in answer to fervent 
prayer. Knowledge is obtained by various means, one of which is by 
the exercise of faith resulting "in divine revelation. So the Prophet 
Joseph became wiser than all the learned divines of his day, getting 
abundant absolute knowledge from God through the visitations of several 
heavenly personages, including the Father and the Son, and also through 
numerous revelations. His knowledge was pure truth, for he was taught 
from on high. His teachings were therefore free from false notions. 

AUTHORITY RESTORED 

Upon him and Oliver was bestowed the holy Priesthood through the 
laying on of hands of qualified personages sent from the throne of 
God. Thus the authority to act for and in the name of Christ was again 
restored to the earth and the Prophet was commissioned to set up Christ's 
own Church. He energetically went about doing this work. Now while 
there had been teachers and reformers before Joseph's day who were 
doubtless more or less inspired, getting glimpses of gospel truths, none of 
them had received the Priesthood. Hence while their work and sacrifices 
were necessary to establish religious tolerance sufficient for the coming 
of the Prophet, none of them could organize Christ's Church, due to a 
lack of authority. This is a vital point and one on which we cannot 
compromise. 

We are willing to bless any non-Mormon man or organization for 
the good he or it may do. But this must not imply that we are ready 
to grant that what is done by any others, however great the good, is ac- 
complished in the authority of the Priesthood. In fact we hold otherwise. 
Priesthood is a characteristic of Christ's Church and of none other. 

THE BOOK OF MORMON A PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 

Another outstanding characteristic of our Faith is a belief in the 
divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. I have many times said this 
book is perhaps the best physical evidence we can offer to the world of 
the divinity of the Prophet's call. With us this sacred volume is the 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



39 



most remarkable book in print today. It came forth through the miracu- 
lous manifestation of God's power. This claim is made for no other 
book in the English language. And though the Book of Mormon has 
been ridiculed and various hypotheses advanced to explain it, none of 
these has stood the test of investigation, hence has gone into discard. The 
truth is the Book perhaps stands more unimpeachable today than it has 
ever stood before. Further, countless thousands who have read the Book 
in the way suggested in the 10th chapter of Moroni have solemnly testified 
that they know the Book is of divine origin. God revealed this truth to 
them. There was no other way for them to get a testimony of its 
divinity. 

FAITH A GIFT 

The truth of this sacred Book is another fact that admits of no 
compromise. Yet we do not quarrel with honest doubters who do not 
believe in the divinity of this Book. But we are sorry for their unbelief, 
recognizing that faith is a gift of God, withheld from everyone who does 
not fulfil the conditions necessary to have faith. The Prophet Joseph tells 
us in section 130, Doctrine and Covenants : "There is a law irrevocably 
decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all 
blessings are predicated. And when we obtain any blessing from God 
it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated." This states 
a great law that applies not only to the spiritual world but to the material 
world as well. Should we not be very grateful to our Father that he 
has given us faith to believe? Not boastfully but very humbly and in 
deep gratitude we accept the gift of faith as a special favor of the God 
we worship. 

GOPSEL, TEACHES UNIVERSAL SALVATION 

Another very important and highly distinguishing feature of 
Mormonism is the doctrine of the universality of the plan of salvation — 
of the saving and redeeming power of Jesus Christ. The fact that the 
doctrine of salvation for the dead is a part of Mormonism is a powerful 
evidence that Joseph Smith was called of God and commissioned to re- 
store to earth the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its plainness and fulness. 
Among all the scholars and teachers of religion in this and past genera- 
tions, where can you find outside of this Church any one who understood 
or understands the significance of the Apostle Paul's question, "Else 
what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not 
at all"? Or, of Peter's statement, "For this cause was the gospel 
preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according 
to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." 

During the winter of 1935-36 there was a series of weekly addresses 
on religion delivered in London over the radio. Most of the addresses 
were printed in the Listener, a weekly magazine published by the British 
Broadcasting Corporation. The magazine printed letters in its forum col- 
umns commenting on the addresses. Many of the letters declared Chris- 
tianity, as the reverend doctors taught it, could not be true for it pictured 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God as wholly unjust and unfair. To be saved, a confession of Christ in 
this life was necessary, the preachers taught. Yet the vast majority of the 
human family now dead, and many millions of people now living had 
never even heard the name of Jesus Christ. Why, the writers asked, 
should all of these be damned through no fault of their own ? Can there 
be a loving and just God who would do a thing so manifestly unfair and 
monstrous as this ? No ! the letter writers said. . 

But the glorious doctrine of salvation for the dead makes every- 
thing clear. It reveals God's all-comprehending love for his children, 
and shows him to be a wise, just and merciful Father. But the Christian 
ministry knew nothing of this beautiful doctrine. Where did Joseph 
Smith iearn it? From his divine teachers and the revelations of God. 
There was no other source from which he could have learned it. Of this 
wonderful doctrine he knew more than the rest of all the world combined. 
Was he a prophet of God? Who can make an open-minded, thorough 
study of the character and teachings of the Prophet and deny his divine 
inspiration? 

God is the Father of the spirits of all men. Not one of them will 
be denied the privilege of accepting of their Savior, Jesus Christ. Every 
one born into mortality will have a chance to hear the Gospel in this 
life or in the life to come — in the spirit world beyond the grave. Death is 
only a separation of the spirit and the body. The latter returns to dust 
and the former to the spirit world to await the time when it will reunite 
with the body, for the resurrection will be universal and will eventually 
come to every one born into mortality — unto both the just and the unjust. 
Not one will be denied. How beautiful and marvelous the plan! 

ACTIVITY IN THE SPIRIT WORLD 

In the spirit world there is great activity. The Elders of this Church 
who have gone thither are very busy preaching to those who once lived 
in mortality. Even during the brief period when the body of Jesus lay 
in the tomb the Master was not idle. "Today," he said to the thief dying 
nearby on a cross, "shalt thou be with me in paradise" — a place in the 
spirit world, but not heaven as we commonly understand the term. The 
Apostle Peter gives us light on this point when he wrote of Christ's 
whereabouts while his body lay in the tomb : "He went and preached unto 
the spirits in prison ; which sometime were disobedient, when once the 
long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a 
preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water." 

Is it not probable that very many more of God's children are today 
hearing and accepting the Gospel in the spirit world than they are doing 
here on earth? During the year 1935 ten thousand names were sent to 
our temples from Germany for ordinance work. And all our temples are 
busily engaged in doing vicarious work for the dead. This work will 
continue with an ever-increasing rate. More and more temples will be 
built and will be kept fully employed. The great doctrine of salvation 
for the dead is one of the most outstanding and characteristic of Mormon- 
ism and helps to stamp Joseph Smith as the greatest prophet who ever 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



41 



lived on earth, excepting only Jesus Christ himself. Will the world not 
yet say there is no exaggeration in this statement ? Very likely. For the 
world, at the moment indifferent to any religious propaganda, will show 
an increasing interest in the message of Mormonism. This is not said 
in boasting. It is only an indication of what will surely come. 

THE LAST DISPENSATION 

i 

Now, among other things the Prophet Joseph taught was that he 
inaugurated the last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of 
times ; that God had set up his Church for the last time ; that it would 
not be taken away or given to another people. These ideas, like salvation 
for the dead and many others, were not Joseph's. They did not origi- 
nate with him. They came through messengers and revelations from 
heaven ; and therein lies their vast implications. 

INSPIRATION CONTINUES WITH LEADERS OF THE CHURCH 

The Prophet and his brother, the Patriarch, were martyred. Their 
enemies hoped and believed that the Church would fall with its leaders. 
How greatly they were disappointed. They had forgotten that new 
strength to a religious cause always springs from the blood of its martyrs. 
Brigham Young, the rightful successor to Joseph, became the new prophet 
and leader. The Church was not born to die. God had so spoken. It 
should continue and grow until it filled the whole earth. The mantle 
of Joseph had fallen upon Brigham and in turn successively upon John 
Taylor, Wilf ord Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith and Heber 
J. Grant, where it now rests. In his turn each of these was sustained 
by Jesus Christ and the faithful members of his Church as prophet, seer 
and revelator and as president of the Church. Faithfully and to the 
very best of all his strength each of these brethren has served in the 
position to which God and the Church membership called him. The single 
purpose of each one has been to guide the Church as Christ directs 
through inspiration and to function for the good of the people. President 
Grant is faithful and loyal to this purpose. Can any faithful member 
of the Church point to one single thing that President Grant has said or 
done that is not in harmony with this lofty purpose? 

A WARNING OF DANGERS AHEAD 

Brethren and sisters, the times through which we have been passing 
have indeed been trying to most of our people. And I am sorry that 
trying times are still ahead. The sure word of prophecy and the signs 
of the times do not permit me to believe otherwise. We shall not have 
the peace and security we so greatly desire until we repent of our sins, 
turn to the Lord in real sincerity, and deal righteously with all men in 
all our relations with them. 

In conclusion I want to call attention to the fact that many winds of 
doctrine — social, economic, political — are blowing among the people. In- 
dividuals, ambitious for position and power, employing all kinds of propa- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ganda, are and will continue to be busy among the people to win their 
support. Such things are not new. They have long existed and have 
been particularly prominent in periods of great distress and chaos. And 
they are especially dangerous in countries ruled by democratic forms of 
government. The dictatorships of Europe were born of the distresses 
of the people. Orderly government in these countries was secured at 
the price of individual liberty. There the state is everything, the individ- 
ual only the tiniest cog in a gigantic machine. 

Dangers ominously threaten in this great country of ours. Our 
government had one great test — the Civil War of the sixties. It will 
have other tests. But it will triumph so long as the people remain true 
to their heritage and maintain the ideals of liberty and justice set up by 
the fathers of our country. 

DIVINE GUIDANCE NECESSARY 

What would I have the Latter-day Saints do? Just this: Remain 
calm ; do not be carried away by prejudiced and emotional appeals. Use 
your intelligence and try to be wise in all, things. Carefully and prayer- 
fully consider and study every new proposition. Look for the real 
motives behind propaganda and agitators. Make yourselves worthy of 
and seek for divine guidance in all of your affairs. Keep your eyes 
upon God's prophet, the head of the Church, and be faithful and true 
to the covenants you have made with one another and with God. There 
is safety in doing these things. May the Lord give all of us wisdom 
and strength to do them, I pray in Christ's name. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Logan Temple 

Brethren and sisters, I am grateful beyond my power to express 
for the privilege that is mine in standing before you to bear my testimony 
to the divinity of this great and mighty work. I appreciate the things 
that have been said to us by the Presidency of our Church and those who 
have spoken to us during this Conference. There is absolutely no ques- 
tion as to the truth that has been presented to us here this day. 

I believe with all my soul that if you and I can follow the instructions 
that have been given to us, we will come nearer to our Heavenly, Father. 

I believe also that if we pray more earnestly day by day, we will 
receive the spirit of light, and of wisdom, and also that sustaining power 
to uphold and support those who have been placed in authority to lead 
and direct the affairs of the Church in this day and time. 

I believe with all my soul in that quality of prayer that brings us 
in close contact with our Heavenly Father. May I say there is a believing 
faith; there is also a knowing faith. Perhaps we should differentiate 
between the two. This knowing faith comes to, us through our devotion 
to God our Eternal Father as we approach him, not only in our family 
prayers, but in the silent hours of life when we come to him alone, when 
we unfold what is in our hearts and invite him into our confidence, and 



ELDER JOSEPH'QUINNEY, JR. 



43 



have him know and understand that we love his work and those who 
have been called to preside over us. 

The quality of prayer that is most useful to any of us is that quality 
that develops the finest there is in human life, that brings us into fellow- 
ship with God and our f ellowman, that develops within us that absolute 
faith that is so necessary in order to retain and obtain the light of truth, 
which of course is a testimony of the Gospel. 

Any one who is earnest and sincere in his or her prayers cannot in 
any way mistake the meaning of what was said to us by our beloved 
President this morning, when he impressed us with the thought that if 
we observe and keep these commandments that God has given us by the 
revelations through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, we 
will retain our fellowship and our knowing faith, that faith that gives 
us the absolute assurance that this is indeed God's work. President 
Grant, not so long ago, made this impressive statement : "Let us gather 
faith as a people. Let us so order our lives that we are entitled to an 
increase of that faith. I am thankful that I know of no man or woman 
who has joined this Church and attended his or her sacrament meetings, 
partaking of the sacrament in remembrance of the suffering of our 
Savior and his death, who was honest in the payment of his or her 
tithing, who divided with the Lord as perfectly as he would ask the 
Lord to divide with them if they were making up an account, who has 
kept the Word of Wisdom — I have never known of such a person to lose 
his or her faith." This is indeed a marvelous measuring tape. 

There are many things, I am sure, that have come into your minds 
and into my mind this day, as we have been confronted, not only with 
the great things that have been said, but the realities of these things and 
the sincerity in which they have been called to our attention. Indeed 
we have been made to feel the divine and powerful leadership of our 
President and of the Authorities of the Church. It seems to me there- 
fore, my dear brethren and sisters, that the obligation resting upon you 
and me, as Latter-day Saints, should carry the spirit of humility to seek 
our Heavenly Father for his sustaining power, that we might be able to 
retain this testimony concerning the divinity of this work, and uphold 
and sustain those who are placed in authority over us. They are men 
of God. 

I desire to bear my testimony concerning the divinity of this work. I 
know, as I know that I breathe the breath of life, that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith was the instrumentality 
through which God operated in bringing to pass the restoration of the 
saving graces of the Gospel of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. 

I am grateful beyond words for the great blessings that have come 
to me in the various calls that I have had, from time to time, in lifting 
my voice in the defense of this great work in many lands and in many 
climes. I am grateful now for the privilege I have in presiding over one 
of the temples of God, in witnessing the faith of the many people who 
come to officiate for their kindred dead, who feel the relationship that 
belongs to the Gospel of our Father in Heaven, to know of a surety that 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this is a reality, that our dead can be saved through our faithfulness 
in the discharge of that obligation by officiating for them. 

May God bless us with the spirit of appreciation. May we be humble 
and prayerful. May we find ourselves always in full fellowship and 
harmony, exercising that consideration, that kindness, the spirit of the 
Gospel toward all with whom we associate and come in contact, is my 
humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, 
Amen. 

An anthem, "Praise to the Lord" (Christensen) was sung by the 
Choir. 

Elder James Brown, Jr., President of the Woodruff Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m. Monday, April 5. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The Conference reconvened Monday morning, April 5, at 10 o'clock 

a. m. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "How Firm a Foundation." 
Elder Mark W. Cram, President of the Sacramento Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

A vocal solo, "Come Ye Blessed," was sung by Sister Jessie Evans. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have decided not to call on all the mission presidents to speak 
at this Conference, and we may not call on all the General Authorities. 
We have tried and tried in vain to include all the people from whom 
we would like to hear, but we have not the time to hear from them all 
unless we should finally conclude, in years to come, that we should have 
four days of Conference instead of three days. 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters: It can never become a commonplace to 
speak in this historic tabernacle, nor in this presence. We are living a 
long way from home. We miss the mountains, the people and the 
tabernacle. The generation of men who laid out this city, erected this 
temple, and builded this house, built far better than they knew. I do not 
think there is another place in this broad land that people look to with 
more interest than they do this Temple Block. Whether they belong to 
our faith or not there is something that radiates from here that interests 
and satisfies them.

On November 28, last, President Grant arrived in Chicago to organ- 
ize the 118th Stake of Zion. He was received with great respect. The 
organization of the Stake was effected on Sunday, November 29. This 
was an additional confirmation of the fact that the Church is moving 
forward on many fronts. It visions a world-wide establishment. Its 
benefits and blessings are not limited to any people or to any location. 
It can serve the people of Chicago and California, of New York and 
Hawaii, just as efficiently as it can serve the people of Utah. It can help 
those that dwell upon the Islands just as effectively and well as those who 
live upon the continents of the earth. Mormonism is just as strong to 
save the people east of the Rocky Mountains as it is those west of the 
Rocky Mountains. No matter how far flung its Stakes, how wide the 
territory which it covers, how numerically great and strong it may become, 
it has the divine genius of reaching the individual, of lifting him up; 
of filling his heart with hope, and inspiring him to great endeavor. The 
humblest Saint living in the remotest corner of the land may know that 
the Gospel is true, with the same assurance that the Saint who lives 
under the shadows of the Temple may know it. 

Men frequently comment upon the marvelous organization of which 
we are a part. They not only comment upon it, but they have tried 
to copy it, but they cannot make it work. It is not a man-made institu- 
tion. It is of divine origin. The Almighty accomplishes his purposes 
through men. They are his agents. He clothes them with the holy 
Priesthood which is the strength of the Church, the source of authority. 
Referring to this Priesthood — I was deeply impressed with what the 
President said yesterday. All my life I have read or listened to the other 
people read the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Presi- 
dent said that this great revelation was given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith while he was a prisoner in Liberty Jail, Missouri. No mortal man 
ever gave to the world a better plan for the government of men than is 
contained in this revelation. It declares, "The powers of the Priest- 
hood are inseparably connected with the powers of Heaven." Think 
of it — as powerful as this Priesthood is, as mighty as it is to save, it can 
only be exercised upon the principles of righteousness. No matter who 
the man is who bears this Priesthood nor the circumstances under which 
it is exercised — to be effective it must be exercised in harmony with the 
powers of Heaven. 

Yes, the Church is moving forward on many fronts and no one need 
be alarmed over its growth nor apprehensive about its motives, for all its 
purposes are beneficent and its objectives are righteous. It is more than 
an intelligent plan for the betterment of the world, it is an institution 
inspired of the Almighty through which he will work out his purposes. 

Every missionary bears this testimony and I want to testify that 
the Almighty has set his hand for the last time to establish his work 
upon the earth and that it shall never be thrown down and given to 
another people, that it shall roll forth until it fills the whole earth — He 
has so declared it. His power permeates this great work and in his own 
due time and in his own appointed way he will make it victorious in the 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



earth. Every man clothed with divine authority should walk in humility 
before his Maker. 

A missionary's voice in this world is a very small voice. The dis- 
courses which he delivers are not so convincing as the life which he lives. 
God be praised for this great system of building character in men and 
boys. May he help those who have been commissioned to bear his mes- 
sage to the world, I pray in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

If I could say anything that would contribute to a larger appreciation 
of the Priesthood of our Church I would be grateful indeed. I can 
scarcely hope to add a new thought about it. It is an old principle of our 
religion and all religions and it is a common subject of discourse. Because 
it is old, however, and because it is common, it is not stale nor trite and 
it is not cheap. 

THE PRIESTHOOD DEFINED 

The Priesthood is a priceless thing. It cannot be bought; it cannot 
be sold, — at least not for considerations that are monetary. Its values 
are measured in terms of benefaction and blessing. While it is essen- 
tially spiritual in nature and essence, the results which flow from its 
use and administration are often temporal and material. It is at once 
the key to the "mysteries of Godliness" and the power and authority 
underlying the ecclesiastical organization of God's work in the world. It 
is everlasting in duration. It existed before the foundations of the earth 
were laid and will endure eternally. In its last analysis it is the endur- 
ing, perpetual power of the Gods, — that is, Elohim ; the power by which 
worlds have been and will be created ; the power by which all everlasting 
covenants and conditions are established and perpetuated ; the power and 
the only power which gives warrant and convincing assurance for the 
fulfilment of the highest and noblest aspirations of the human family. 

The Priesthood is usually simply defined as "the power of God 
delegated to man." This definition, I think, is accurate. But for practi- 
cal purposes I like to define the Priesthood in terms of service and I 
frequently call it "the perfect plan of service." I do so because it seems 
to me that it is only through the utilization of the divine power conferred 
on men that they may ever hope to realize the full import and vitality 
of this endowment. It is an instrument of service. Its uses and pur- 
poses are all defined in terms of service and the man who fails to use it 
is apt to lose it, for we are plainly told by revelation that he who neglects 
it "shall not be counted worthy to stand." 

ACTIVITY REQUIRED 

The Priesthood is not static and a man's ordination to it is not a 
static investiture. There may be some men, however, who so regard it, 
for they seem to be so smug and content with their ordinations. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



47 



I can well imagine such a man going into the presence of the great 
Eternal Judge and saying in substance, "While I was on earth I was a 
High Priest. I come now to claim the reward of a High Priest." I 
think it is not difficult to suppose what may be his answer. He will 
likely be met with such questions as these, "What did you do when you 
were a High Priest ? How did you use this great power which you held ? 
Whom did you bless with it?" Upon his reply to such interrogatories 
as these will his reward be predicated. 

PRIESTHOOD COMPARED WITH A STREAM 

I have sometimes compared the powers of the Priesthood bestowed 
on men with the waters that flow from our mountains down into the 
valleys below, as those waters are controlled and regulated by the law of 
irrigation which prevails in our western states. An early settler might 
have diverted from its natural channel the whole of a mountain stream up- 
on lands which he occupied and thereby set up a claim of right and owner- 
ship to the entire flow, but the law said, "No, you cannot have the whole 
stream. You may have only so much of it as you can put to beneficial 
use in the culture and production of crops on your land,- — no more." 
Is it not so with the great stream of power that flows from the fountain- 
head of God down to his servants in the earth? Can anyone claim the 
right to more of that power than he uses wisely and well for'the blessing 
of his fellowmen? I think not and I believe that if he indulges such a 
hope he will be disappointed. 

A PERFECT PLAN OF SERVICE 

But the Priesthood is not only a plan of service, it is the perfect 
plan of service. All worthy service is commendable. The man who 
builds my house to shelter my family from the storms and the elements 
merits my approbation and gratitude. I am indebted to the man who 
tills the soil, for food and bodily sustenance. To the scientists, the 
inventors, the skilled artisans and mechanics and the captains of industry, 
we owe lasting praise and thanksgiving for innumerable comforts and 
conveniences that make life easy and desirable. The artists of the world 
have gratified our inner craving for expression of beauty in tender and 
lofty sentiment in art, music,' literature and idealism. 

How grateful we are for all these benefactions! We almost wor- 
ship the modern medical man who, with patiently developed skill and 
large scientific knowledge, is able to relieve our bodily distresses, mend 
our broken bones, and set us up in health and vigor. We venerate our 
statesmen and cheer to the echo the heroes of our society. 

But, who of all these, who serve so well and so nobly the interests 
of the human family, can do for me a service that in real vitality, in 
everlasting benefit, is comparable to that performed by a humble Elder 
in the Church who takes me into the waters of baptism and raising his 
hand to high heaven, truly says, "Having been commissioned of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son 
and the Holy Ghost." What service is there that man can give which 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



approaches in importance and eternal beneficence the laying on of the 
hands of the Priesthood and the utterance of those divine words "Receive 
ye the Holy Ghost" and "be confirmed a member of the Church of 
Christ" ? 

So I pronounce the Priesthood "the perfect plan of service" because 
through its administration and offices our lives are eternally blessed. Not 
only is it essential for our induction into the Church and fold of Christ 
but is it of constant application. We use it in the blessing of our sick, 
to relieve suffering, physical, mental and spiritual ; for the encouragement 
and direction of our officers and missionaries as they are set apart for 
their respective duties in the Church ; for the blessing and naming of little 
children ; for the administration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper 
in the partaking of which we continue frequently to renew our covenants 
with the Savior; in the ordination of men and boys to offices in the 
Priesthood which are so widely distributed in our Church ; and lastly and 
perhaps more importantly than any of the items I- have mentioned, in 
the carrying forward of our temple work which is so unique in the world 
of religion and so distinctly a product of latter-day revelation in which, 
through the authority of the holy Priesthood, vicarious work is done for 
kindred dead, transcendently beautiful ceremonies and ordinances are 
performed for the holy, eternal, celestial marriage of man and wife, for 
the sealing of children to parents, for the establishment of eternal bonds 
and covenants as an endowment of men and women by which they make 
preparation to come back into the presence of God the Father and His 
Son, Jesus Christ. 

I said the Priesthood is widely distributed in our Church. There are 
180,000 men and boys who hold it. The boys have what is termed the 
lesser or Aaronic Priesthood. The men are ordained to the higher or 
Melchizedek Priesthood. Within these orders of Priesthood several 
offices are designated by revelation and the duties thereof prescribed. 
The men and boys are divided into quorums or groups in numbers con- 
veniently designated for the establishment of fraternal relations and the 
accomplishment of service in the Church. 

THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE HOME 

Every man is made a better man by reason of his membership in 
one of these quorums and by reason of his ordination to the Priesthood. 
A man with the Priesthood is a better father and husband than he would 
otherwise be ; that is, if he appreciates and uses the powers conferred upon 
him. He presides over his household in dignity and love. He wins the 
respect of his wife and children by his constant solicitation, not only for 
their temporal but for their spiritual welfare also. Children in a home 
presided over by the Priesthood do not flippantly and disrespectfully 
refer to their father as "the old man" or their mother as "the old woman." 
The very nature of the government of the Priesthood precludes such 
impropriety. A wife does not begrudge a man of the Priesthood his 
position as head of the household. She honors him as such and teaches 
her children to- do likewise, for she well understands not only what the 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



49 



Priesthood means to her husband but what it means to her too. She 
knows that if she sustains her husband in his Priesthood calling she has 
assurance of exaltation with him, and she knows moreover that if he is 
true to his Priesthood he will always be kind and faithful and righteous. 
I feel sure that if we could have more of the authority and influence of 
the Priesthood in the homes of the land we should have infinitely -less 
disrespect for law and order and the established institutions of society 
than we now see about us everywhere. 

The man of the Priesthood is a better citizen and a better neighbor 
than he would be without it. Holding authority himself, he is con- 
strained to respect authority. Being a part of the government of God, he 
sustains all governments. His life is dedicated to service. He must be a 
good neighbor, serving the needs of those about him. 

The man of the Priesthood loves knowledge and education. He is 
taught that "the glory of God is intelligence," that "man cannot be 
saved in ignorance," and that knowledge is power. He is enjoined to 
teach truth and righteousness and he knows that he cannot teach unless 
he learns. 

HUMILITY AND INTEGRITY 

While the Priesthood is a principle of force and action it nevertheless 
makes a man humble. The realization of the responsibility it entails, — 
this partnership with God in the exercise of His power, and the very 
nature of the grant itself tends to subdue natural human egotism. When 
one blesses the sick he knows that it would be futile to rely on his own 
talent, his own influence, or fine words in the presence of distress and 
suffering and the imminence of death. His native powers seem as 
nothing. He realizes that it is only through faith and with a pure heart 
that he can pronounce, with a power superior to his human faculties, a 
blessing that will be efficacious. 

Those who bear the Priesthood know too that their lives must be 
consistent with the divine commission which has come to them. No man 
can lie, steal, malign his neighbor or pollute his body with poisons and 
defile himself with sin and expect the stream of God's power to flow 
through him. The holding of the Priesthood stimulates a man more than 
anything I know to conform his life to the standards and attributes of the 
Master whose authorized representative he is. 

PRIESTHOOD FROM DIVINE SOURCE 

And it is true that a man who has been properly ordained to the 
Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an 
authorized and duly accredited representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
To many, no doubt, this appears as a bold and highly presumptuous state- 
ment to make. But it is a fact substantiated by creditable evidence. I 
am not infrequently asked, particularly by those whom I ordain, as to 
the derivation or lineage of my Priesthood. I reply by setting forth four 
steps only : I was ordained by President Joseph F. Smith, he by Presdient 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Brigham Young, Brigham Young by the Three Witnesses, one of whom, 
Oliver Cowdery, was ordained by the angelic ministers, Peter, James 
and John at the beginning of this dispensation. So the authority of the 
Priesthood which we bear is proximate to the divine source from which 
it emanates. Neither its origin nor its descent is beclouded and obscured 
in remote antiquity by equivocal and doubtful beginnings and transfers. 
Living witnesses or the recorded testimony of those who have recently 
passed away attest the validity of each act and event which has brought 
to us this delegation of divine power. 

Not only are we able to establish the legality of our credentials to 
participate in this great work but in' addition thereto, I feel sure that the 
experience of our people with the powers of the Priesthood, extending 
now for more than a century of time, furnish irrefutable proof of the 
genuineness - and divine nature of the powers which have been exercised. 
Spiritual manifestations and temporal blessings derived through the 
Priesthood have been altogether too numerous to estimate or recount. 
Under the Priesthood the Church was set up by a young man unlearned 
in the things of the world. Its marvelous organization, its procedure 
and practices, its ordinances and ceremonies and its incomparably beauti- 
ful and uplifting interpretation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ are all attri- 
butable directly to the powers of the holy Priesthood. Even its temporal 
successes and those of its members, the migrations of the people and their 
establishment in different sections of the earth are due to the inspired 
direction of the Priesthood of the Church. So that, if you ask any man 
who has had experience with the Church or knows its history what one 
thing it is that more definitely distinguishes our people from any other 
group and what one thing is most accountable for all our successes and 
achievements, he will readily respond: the Priesthood of the Church of 
Christ. 

ATTRIBUTES OF PRIESTHOOD 

I wish all the world would come to understand the real essence and 
inner nature of this precious power. I fear that there are too_many who 
look upon it as autocratic, compulsory and dictatorial. The Lord has set 
forth its nature and constitution in a revelation, which, it seems to me, 
more nearly breathes the true, kind, loving, considerate, merciful and 
righteous spirit of Christ than anything we have on record. I will not 
quote it here because you are all familiar with it. You well know how it 
enjoins humility, "long suffering, gentleness and meekness and love un- 
feigned" upon those who minister with the Priesthood, warning against 
any compulsion, unrighteousness and ulterior motives and advocating 
methods only of kindness and persuasion. 

Knowing the attributes of the Priesthood as we do, we do not fear 
it. Our unanimity of thought and action in response to its suggestions 
or nominations is not constrained upon us by domination and coercion. 
It is but the natural product of our accord with the wisdom and the 
inspiration of our leaders and the persuasion of righteousness and truth. 
We who give our allegiance to the Priesthood are not slaves and puppets, 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



51 



we are free, and the more perfectly we yield to the doctrines and the 
dominion of the Priesthood, the more unanimous we become in its sup- 
port. It is the truth that makes one free. Error is bondage. 

Very often things that are common come to be regarded as cheap. 
If gold were as common as clay it might not be the standard of values in 
the world. I fear that in some instances and with some people the exten- 
sive and common bestowal of the Priesthood upon the men and boys of 
our Church tends to lessen respect and deference for it. Being easy of 
acquirement, its value is sometimes deprecated. 

This is a great and serious mistake. In the first place the Priesthood 
has not been easy of acquisition in this or any other dispensation when 
it has been in the earth. Those who acquired it in the beginning of our 
Church and those who have preserved it and passed it on as a heritage to 
this generation suffered for it and endured trials, tribulations and even 
death that it might be established and preserved. In the second place, it is 
not common among the peoples of the world. If all of our men and boys 
who bear it were to be distributed among the people of the world there 
would be but one in every ten thousand of the world's population who 
would hold the Priesthood of the living God. If such a distribution were 
actual, I have an idea that no man would look upon his Priesthood as 
being common or cheap. 

ADMONITION TO BE TRUE 

So I say : men of the Priesthood, be true. Use the power that God 
has given you. Bless your fellowmen with it. It will save you and it 
will save the world. 

And to the sisters may I say : support your husbands in God's work. 
Encourage them and commend them in the performance of their duties. 
It is not always easy for a tired wife to forego the help and companion- 
ship of her husband in the evening when she needs his assistance and 
his comfort in the care of the family. It is a real sacrifice to have him 
go to his duties in the Priesthood. But urge him to go; you will never 
regret it; your sacrifice will be rewarded. 

I wish I could say something about the quorums of the Priesthood, 
those divinely appointed organizations which are designed to promote and 
conserve the education, the brotherhood and the service of the members, 
but time will not permit. I must close. 

In closing, I offer my personal testimony. I do so with some hesita- 
tion because my personal conviction seems so private and so sacred to me. 
I am constrained to do it by the hope that the assurance which has so 
blessed my own life may bless the lives of others. 

A STRONG TESTIMONY 

I know with a conviction that satisfies every knowing faculty that 
I possess, that the Priesthood of God is real and genuine, that it is a 
vital essence of force and power. I have felt its influence ; I have been 
consciously aware of its passing from me as I have laid my hands on the 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



heads of others in the administration of its kindly offices. I have seen its 
effect. I know that it is more than a narfle and a symbolism. I prize it 
above all earthly possessions. I look upon it as the key to all the happiness 
and joy and glory for which I aspire and I would rather lose anything 
else that has ever come into my life than to lose my Priesthood. 

I humbly pray that I may prove in some measure worthy to hold and 
exercise the divine power which, in the providence of God, has come to 
me, and that I may be worthy of the association which I have been so 
highly privileged to enjoy with President Smith and President Grant and 
the other noble men with whom my lot has been cast. I pray also that 
like blessings may come to all my brethren who bear the Priesthood of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. In His name, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 
The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. (John 14: 

30.) 

These words were spoken by Jesus in his last discourse before his 
crucifixion — the discourse which ended with that divine prayer that 
flowed from the soul of the Redeemer. That glorious sermon began 
with the words that have cheered myriads of souls, "Let not your heart 
be troubled ; ye believe in God, believe also in me." In the Savior alone 
are found all the treasures of love, true science and infinite wisdom. He 
is the joy of the desolate, the hope of the penitent. 

RIGHTEOUSNESS BINDS SATAN 

The prince of the world is Satan. He is the prince of darkness. 
Satan could find no taint of sin in the Savior. In the Lord there was 
nothing for the evil one to fasten on, for he was without blemish and 
without spot. 

Last summer, in a certain park, I observed that a number of the trees 
were fast losing their beautiful leaves. They were attacked by caterpil- 
lars and worms. It was evident that these pests were attracted to those 
trees. In the same park were other trees ; their foliage was lovely with 
bright colors. There was nothing in these trees to invite the destroyers. 
They were immune. 

It is possible, thank God, for every righteous man to bind the 
evil one so far as he himself is concerned. The Almighty alone knows the 
wonderful help and example we extend to our fellow creatures when 
our lives are such that Satan can find nothing on which to fasten. 

Each man makes his own stature, builds himself, 
Virtue alone outbuilds the Pyramids, 
Her monuments shall last when Egypt's fall.

WORKS OF THE FLESH 

And Jesus said, 

That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, 
adulteries, fornications, murders, 

Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, 
blasphemy, pride, foolishness : 

All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. (Mark 
7:20-23.) 

After enumerating the works of the flesh and declaring "that they 
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God," the Apostle 
Paul says : 

WORKS OF THE SPIRIT 

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, 
goodness, faith, 

Meekness, temperance : against such there is no law. 

And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections 
and lusts. (Galatians 5:22-24.) 

There i are certain institutions that can create and maintain a nation. 
They are the foundation stones of any nation that hopes to endure. Chief 
among these institutions are marriage, virtue, sobriety, industry, obedi- 
ence to law, loyalty to country, love of fellowman and an affectionate re- 
spect and reverence for God, our Heavenly Father. But when a republic 
or a monarchy rejects these foundation stones, these roots of Christianity, 
there shall arise another Gibbon to write the decline and fall of a nation 
that rejects God and disobeys his commandments. "Righteousness ex- 
alteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people." 

FREEDOM IN RIGHTEOUSNESS 

There is something grand in being free, and true freedom is found 
in righteousness. There are those who say that Christianity has never 
had a fair trial in the way of relieving economic distress, but it has had a 
fair trial and it has succeeded in improving the temporal needs of the 
people whenever and wherever it has been conscientiously observed. 

In the Book of Mormon we read of a nation that lived in peace for 
over a century and a half. They had all things in common. There were 
no rich. There were no poor. Each man loved his neighbor as himself, 
and they prospered : they became exceeding rich as to this world's goods. 
Moreover they prospered in the unsearchable riches of Christ, the only 
riches that endure. But pride crept in, the pride that goeth before a fall, 
and the words of Byron portray the unhappy result : 

Here is the moral of all human tales. 
'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past; 
First freedom and then glory; when that fails 
Wealth, vice, corruption, barbarism at last, 
And history, with all her volumes vast, 
Hath but one page.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AMERICA LAND OF PROMISE, CONDITIONALLY 

Moroni, an inspired prophet, whose words are in the Book of Mor- 
mon, declared that America is a land of promise, choice above all other 
lands, but he said, by the word of God, that "whatsoever nation shall 
possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all 
other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, 
who is Jesus Christ," or they would perish when the fulness of his wrath 
came upon them because they were ripe in iniquity. 

That same prophet, in giving this warning, looks down the ages 
and talks to the people of this great God-established, glorious republic. 
He warns them of the evils that have brought other nations down into 
obscurity and covered them with destruction, and says : 

And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the de- 
crees of God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until 
the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of 
God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. (Book 
of Mormon, Ether 2:11.) 

Our father's God, to thee, 

Author of liberty, 

To Thee we sing. 

Long may our land be bright, 

With freedom's holy light, 

Protect us by thy might, 

Great God, our King. 

DESTRUCTION IN UNCHASTITY 

I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that the sinister crime, 
that destructive sin, which brings down the fulness of the wrath of God 
upon the people, the iniquity in which they ripen, is the sin of unchastity, 
uncleanness. Men's hearts are filled with the things that the Savior said 
defiled them, and of these things they must repent; for if they do not 
purge themselves of these things God has forbidden, no matter how 
great their might, they will go down, for sin never was happiness. 

I don't know, I am sure, how long this nation will survive disregard 
of God, unchastity, Sabbath breaking and other evils that are in our 
midst. Tennyson said: 

Ring out the old, ring in the new, 
Ring out old shapes of foul disease ; 
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold ; 
Ring out the thousand wars of old, 
Ring in the thousand years of peace. 
Ring in the valiant man and free, 
The larger heart, the kindlier hand! 
Ring out the darkness of the land. 
Ring in the Christ that is to be. 

I humbly pray that every Latter-day Saint and all men may live 
such dives that with their blessed Redeemer they can say: 

The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 55 

God help us to reach that heavenly, soul-saving ideal, I humbly pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I feel greatly honored to be permitted to stand before you brethren 
and sisters and take part in this great Conference. 

Brethren, and all who are members of the Church, I have discovered 
that I am still alive, and I am very pleased to be living and to be in your 
midst. 

I have nothing in the world before me that has any great value, 
other than faith and hope and love of God and his commandments. I 
can think of nothing before me that has any greater value than the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I have tried to impress the people that I was sincere, frank, and 
honest in my beliefs. I think I have had a pretty hard time in the last 
year, a sort of a crucial test as to just how I will finish my work. I have 
been with you people in conference assembled pretty nearly a half a 
century, and at no time during my life have I been treated more kindly, 
more courteously and more helpfully than during the past year. 

I have spoken at several Priesthood and Seventies' meetings during 
the past year . A little over a year ago I attended a young peoples' meeting 
in Forest Dale. I was in my usual physical condition. I undertook to 
speak to the young people. In about five minutes I went silent. I sat 
down. They dismissed their meeting. I went home. I felt then : "I am 
through ; I have finished," but it hasn't come true, because I am still alive 
and trying to fulfil my mission. 

I have great joy and pleasure. God knows that I still want to fill 
a mission and be honorably released and return from whence I came. 

When I was sixteen, my father, Heber C. Kimball, was sixty-seven 
years old, as strong, powerful, masterful a man as ever lived ; with a 
great family — twenty-five sons and ten daughters. He was injured by 
accident and later was paralyzed — I can remember the very day when 
he was stricken — and he never spoke afterwards, although he was con- 
scious of his surroundings. 

Well, I have been favored in the past year. About one year ago I 
went to California. Mrs. Kimball was very sick, unable to walk. I am 
not telling you a hard luck story. While I was there I was stricken blind 
for eleven or twelve days. I have overcome that partly, and I am able 
to see. 

Now, I don't know of anybody here present that has a greater reason 
to be thankful than I have. I may be ungrateful at times, and I may be 
unthankful, but I honor God, the eternal Father, and His Son Jesus 
Christ. I believe with all of my soul that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God ; that Brigham Young was a prophet of God ; that Heber C. Kimball 
and all those other great men were inspired of the Lord. As far as I am 
concerned, if these things are not true, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

is not true, I wouldn't give you twenty-five cents for what you leave 
behind you. But it is true. It is my testimony to you that it is true. 

Before I conclude I want to say to you brethren that I have been 
personally acquainted with the First Council of Seventy since the days 
of President Seymour B. Young. The Council that we have now — 
I happen to be senior President but am not able to do very much — this 
Council has sustained me. They have been so kind and considerate that 
I honor them. I am testifying to you good people — and we have ample 
proof of it — at no time in the history of the Seventies has the First 
Council been more faithful as witnesses for God to the nations of the 
earth, and preachers of righteousness, than these men are; the Twelve 
Apostles the same ; and the First Council is under their direction. They 
have been greatly blessed by the Lord, and they are, through the Seven- 
ties, doing a wonderful work, fulfilling a great mission among the stakes 
of Zion, and at no time have they accomplished a greater work. They 
have the spirit of their office and calling. I sustain them. I want to 
leave my testimony with them. If it isn't true, as I said before, there is 
nothing true. 

I pray the Lord to bless you. I pray God the Eternal Father to 
bless President Grant. It isn't the man. We don't worship men. I don't. 
I have never believed you get on higher ground by worshiping a man. 
I am a good deal like my father. Before he died he was praying. He 
called together this great patriarchal family of his, and he got to praying. 
When he prayed, he just talked to the Lord. He wasn't talking to men ; 
he was talking to the Lord. So father finally burst out in a laugh and 
he said : "Oh, Lord, forgive me. When I pray for some men I have 
to laugh." He had to apologize to the Lord, because it amused him to 
pray for some men. 

I honor President Grant. I have every reason for it. I have known 
him all during my ministry ; and it isn't the man ; it is the prophet. God 
bless the prophet whom God raised up to guide and direct his people, I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, something has been- said during this meet- 
ing regarding the respect shown to the Authorities of the Church, and 
the love and esteem in which they are held by those who are working 
with them. I share in that esteem. Fortunately for me, I have known 
many of them for many years. 

The thing, however, that impresses me most in this respect is the 
fact that our missionaries, young men and young women, called from 
remote sections of the Church, have the same testimony, and support 
these Authorities with the same enthusiasm and zeal with which they are 
supported by those who know them best. 

It has been my great privilege to labor among these missionaries. 
I love them. This great missionary work has become dear to me. One 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 



57 



of the finest things about it is the attitude, my brethren and sisters, of 
your sons and daughters with respect to God and the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I have seen them, in a few short months, transformed from 
hesitating and doubting boys and girls to mature, earnest men and women. 
The thing that pleases me most is to hear them bear their testimony. 
They speak the truth. They are not seeking to deceive. 

The words of the Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, come to 

me : 

I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he 
counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry * * * 

And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love 
which is in Christ Jesus. 

This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ 
Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief. 

We have had a great experience during the last six months in 
the Eastern States Mission. We have been blessed with a great deal 
of publicity. Newspapers have treated us kindly. They have spoken 
well of the great movements of the Church and of the people. Now I 
am wondering, and the challenge that seems to come to me is : How 
can we somehow make the people of the world realize that the people, 
in and of themselves, are no greater than other people, but that some- 
thing has come into their lives to make them worthy of the things that 
are said of them and the things that they are doing? How can we 
put over the message that water does not rise above its source ; that 
"men do not gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles ;" that there 
is something in this message, of itself, inherently, that makes this 
people do what they are doing? 

If we can do that, if we can make them know that we believe that 
the greatest character who has ever crossed the pages of history is the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and that we serve him best when we keep most 
perfectly his commandments, and that we are what we are because of 
him, then we have done well. If we have faith in this world only, 
in the Savior, then well might the Apostle Paul say: "We are of all men 
most miserable." If we can somehow get the people to understand that 
whatever there is great among the Mormon people it is because there 
has been translated into their lives the principles and teachings of our 
Savior, and unto him we give the honor, the praise and the glory : If 
we can let them know, in the language of the Book of Mormon, where 
Mosiah said : "Moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other 
name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come 
unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the 
Lord omnipotent;" and that because we get these truths into the lives 
of people we succeed in getting them to accomplish the things for which 
we are commended. It is the Gospel of Christ that has made the 
Mormon people what they are. 

To me, our great mission and work in the field is to preach Christ 
and him crucified. I rejoice also that in gaining a testimony of the 
Savior our missionaries are impressed with the fact that as they study 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Mormonism, so-called, they see that it is but the pathway, the guide 
to life eternal, through the course mapped out by our Savior. They 
sustain these men as prophets of God, because God gives them a testi- 
mony of the Gospel, not because they know them personally. Those of 
us who know them personally can bear testimony to their integrity, but 
I rejoice that the young people, particularly the, missionaries, throughout 
the world say that they are prophets of God, because they know the 
Gospel is true. They have learned that by finding out that Christ is 
the way to salvation and life, and that in this Gospel are found the 
teachings of that Lord and Master; that the same principles which he 
advocated are advocated now; that the same powers, the same saving 
graces, the same gifts and blessings that were given to his people 
anciently are given now, if we are obedient unto that Gospel. 

They discover that these men, these principles, these things that 
are making us known, are but the results of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ being translated into life. 

Oh, I pray that we shall appreciate sincerely that the good things 
that are being said of us shall be said of us because we are worthy ; 
that we shall indeed translate into our lives these glorious principles of 
the Gospel ; that in all things Christ, the Redeemer and Savior of the 
world, shall be magnified and his name glorified in all the earth. 

In humility I bear witness, too, that I know that he lives, and that he 
is the Redeemer of the world. As has been said by Brother Stephen 
L. Richards, this testimony is peculiarly sacred to me, but I feel, neverthe- 
less, constrained to bear this witness unto you, and to say that the most 
glorious privilege of my life has been preaching our Lord and his work 
in the earth. 

I close with a voice of prayer, in the language of one of our poets : 

Oh, Thou by whom we come to God, 

The Life, the Truth, the Way! 
The path of prayer Thyself hath trod; 

Lord, teach us how to pray. 

May the Lord teach us to be obedient, to love and keep his command- 
ments, and translate into our lives the things that are worth while in 
the Gospel, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus, our Redeemer, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of, the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel my weakness this morning, and seek your faith and prayers. 
I have been happy in listening to the testimonies of my brethren, and 
especially the words of counsel and warning which have been given unto 
us by those who have spoken thus far. 

PEACE TAKEN FROM THE EARTH 

We are living in perilous times. The world is in commotion. One 
hundred years ago — to be exact, in November of 1831 — the Lord gave 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



59 



his Preface to his Commandments. You know the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants is different from any other book. It was not written by Joseph 
Smith. It is the work of God, and as its author he had the right, of course, 
to write his preface, which he did, and he said this : 

For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace 
shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own 
dominion. 

One year after the organization of the Church, peace could not have 
been taken from the earth, in justice, but the Lord said the time would 
speedily come. That time has come. Peace has departed from the 
world. The devil has power today over his own dominion. This is made 
manifest in the actions of men, in the distress among the nations, in the 
troubles that we see in all lands, including this land which was dedicated 
to liberty. 

There is no peace. Men's hearts are failing them. Greed has the 
uppermost place in the hearts of men. Evil is made manifest on every 
side, and people are combining for their own selfish interests. Because of 
this I was glad to hear the warning voice raised by our beloved President 
and by his counselors, yesterday, and by others of the brethren who have 
spoken; for I think this should be a time of warning, not only to the 
Latter-day Saints, but to all the world. We owe it to the world, to raise a 
voice of warning, and especially to the members of the Church. 

A TRUE CHURCH 

I would, with all my heart, that we, the members of this Church, 
were living in unity and peace and the love of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; 
which is perhaps more than we can expect under mortal conditions, for 
the Savior, in one of his parables, stated that the kingdom of heaven 
was like a net that was cast into the sea; it gathered of all kinds, some 
good, some bad, some neither good nor bad, and they had to be sorted. 

The Lord also said in this preface, that this is the only church upon 
the face of the earth with which he is pleased. Let me give his exact 
words : 

And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have 
power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of 
obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the 
face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speak- 
ing unto the church collectively and not individually. 

I say if the Lord had to make such a statement as that in 1831, how 
much more necessary would it be today ? He would have to say that this 
Church is the only church upon the face of the earth with which he is 
pleased (because it is his Church ; he organized it ; but he would also have 
to say he is speaking collectively and not individually, simply because there 
are so many professing membership in this Church, who are not abiding 
in the laws and the ordinances of the Gospel, nor are they true to the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



covenants and the obligations that they have taken upon themselves, to 
keep his commandments. 

I want to read to you another passage of scripture. This was given 
in the year 1833, after trouble had come upon our people, and they had 
been driven from their homes, because they had failed to keep the com- 
mandments : 

ZION TO REJOICE 

Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion, 
the pure in heart; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall 
mourn. 

For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly, as the 
whirlwind; and who shall escape it? 

The Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report 
thereof shall vex all people ; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come. 

Therefore I can say there shall be no peace come to this world until 
Christ comes to bring it. 

For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations 
and all their wicked works. 

Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things what- 
soever I have commanded her. 

But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will 
visit her according to her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with 
plague, with the sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire. 

Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have 
accepted of her offering ; and if she sin no more none of these things shall 
come upon her. 

JUDGMENTS COMING UPON THE WORLD 

As I observe conditions among the people I cannot see how we are 
going to escape when the judgments are to pass over the nations, which 
are promised in this revelation and in others which I cannot take time to 
read. Because of our disobedience and our failure to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, the righteous, as in times past, may be called 
upon to suffer with the unrighteous among us. 

So I rejoiced in having the voice of warning raised. Are we keeping 
the Sabbath day holy, as Latter-day Saints, when the picture shows are 
filled every afternoon and evening, and that, too, in communities of 
Latter-day Saints ; when the pleasure resorts are crowded on the Sabbath 
day ; when we turn our attention to pleasure rather than to the worship of 
God ? Do we have a claim upon his blessings, and are we entitled to have 
the angels of destruction pass us by, according to the promise that is 
given here, if we will keep the commandments of God ? Are we doing it ? 

FAULT-FINDING 

Are we guilty of finding fault with those who preside over us ? Are 
we willing to listen to the counsels that they give to us, and receive the 
voice of God as it comes through the one who stands to represent him as 
his mouthpiece upon the face of the earth ? How many of us are willing 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



61 



to do that ? We stood upon our feet here this morning and sang : "We 
thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet," and yet there are some among us 
who criticise him, who find fault with him. When he speaks by the power 
of the inspiration of Almighty God, we are ready to condemn him, as 
we have done in times past. 

Do you think, under these conditions, that we are prepared to escape 
from these penalties here enumerated in this revelation, given on the 
2nd day of August in the year 1833, a month after our people had been 
driven from their homes for violating the commandments which they 
solemnly had promised they would keep ? 

I want to raise the warning voice, and I am doing it among the 
stakes of Zion, as you happen to know. I want to cry repentance. Are 
we keeping ourselves clean and pure and unspotted from the sins of 
the world, and are we entitled to receive the blessings? 

PREDICTIONS BEING FULFILLED 

I want to tell you the judgments have gone forth and they are 
going forth. All these strikes that are taking place, this commotion, this 
unrest, this dissatisfaction, this desire on the part of people to overthrow 
governments — and that is going to come, for hasn't the Lord said that he 
will make an end of all nations? Is it not so recorded in these revela- 
tions? And so it must be. The angels of destruction have gone forth 
upon their mission. 

WARNING OF PRESIDENT WOODRUFF 

Permit me to read a few words from President Wilf ord Woodruff. 
This seemed to be the burden of his message from the time of the dedica- 
tion of the Salt Lake Temple until his death, for he repeated it time and 
time again, and I heard him : 

What are the signs of the times? Do the Latter-day Saints compre- 
hend them? This is a fast age. The Lord is going to cut his work short 
in righteousness. Read these revelations, for they contain the history of 
what is coming to pass in the earth. 

That is, these revelations out of which I have been reading. 

The Lord said to Joseph Smith in the beginning of this church — 

Then President Woodruff read from Section 86 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, verses 5 to 7, in regard to the wheat and the tares. You 
know in that revelation the angels cried to the Lord that they might go 
forth and reap down the earth. After reading that passage President 
Woodruff said : 

What is the matter with this world today? What has created this 
change that we see coming over the world ? Why these terrible judgments ? 
What is the meaning of all these mighty events that are taking place? 
The meaning is, these angels that have been held for many years in the 
temple of our God have got their liberty to go out and commence their 
mission and their work in the earth, and they are here today in the earth. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I feel in saying this to the Latter-day Saints there is a meaning in these 
judgments. The word of the Lord cannot fall unfulfilled. If you want 
to know what is coming to pass, read the revelation of St. John. Read the 
Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. These things are at 
our doors. What is the matter with this nation, — thousands of men 
striking, mobs raising up and destroying property ; tribulation prevailing ! 

I want to say that you will all find, before you are many years older, 
that Utah is a pretty good place to live in. 

Now, I can't take time to read more of it, but he raised this warning 
voice, and I believe Utah .will be a pretty good place to live in, and other 
stakes of Zion, for I don't believe President Woodruff intended to con- 
fine this to the borders of Utah, but to the stakes of Zion. But the 
judgments of the Almighty are being poured out, and they shall con- 
tinue, for the Prophet of God has said it. We shall not escape, unless 
we repent, turn to the Lord, honor our Priesthood and our membership 
in this Church, and be true and faithful to our covenants, which I pray 
we may be, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn "Praise to the Man who Communed 
with Jehovah." 

Elder J. Frank Killian, President of the Emery Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference was held Monday afternoon 
at 2 o'clock. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

Elder Joseph B. Harris, President of the San Juan Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A vocal duet, "I am Sure I Shall not Pass this Way Again," was sung 
by Sisters Ruth Jensen Clawson and Alice Jensen 'Holbrook. 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

It is a great pleasure, my brethren and sisters, to meet again with you 
in a General Conference of the Church. I feel sure that our prayers 
have been answered, for have we not asked our Father in heaven 
to enable our leaders to give unto us that which would mark clearly the 
way in which we should go? 

As I listened to President Grant yesterday morning, when he spoke 
on the Word of Wisdom, I could not help but feel that I hoped the Lord 
would give him a desire to preach on that principle of the Gospel as long 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 



63 



as he lived, and when he is no longer with us, that the Lord would raise 
up another who could preach on it with the same power that he does. 

I believe that when the Lord announced to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
that a marvelous work and a wonder was about to come forth among 
the children of men, that work was to include many important things, 
one of which I think is the Word of Wisdom. I believe that in that 
alone we shall always stand out as distinguished from all other religious 
denominations in the world. While today men are talking of uniting 
the churches, they never will want to unite with the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, as long as we are true to that great principle. 

Speaking of the marvelous work and wonder that was to come 
forth, in our mission we try to help the missionaries to grasp the truth 
of that statement, and to interpret the Gospel in terms of a marvelous 
work. Referring, for instance, to the Book of Mormon, great stress is 
laid upon the value of that book as the most tangible evidence of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Sometimes it seems rather in- 
significant, when you take the Book in your hand, to think of offering 
it for fifty cents to the people you meet. Then, when you stop to 
analyze what it really is, in and of itself, it is a marvelous work and 
a wonder. 

I read an article in a newspaper recently on a visit to this land of 
the United States by Dr. William A. Kennedy, of Lima, Peru. He was 
here in the interest of securing financial support for the establishment 
of a university there to investigate and make research into the early 
civilization of the Americas, particularly dealing with the civilization 
of the Incas and the Mayas, and President Herbert Hoover 
had been asked to serve as one of the directors in this school, for which 
I understand a franchise has already been issued. 

The paper reported that he had been assured of an endowment of 
$30,000,000, which amount would be increased to sixty or seventy mil- 
lion dollars within the next ten years . 

Now, think of that ! The value of the history of the early in- 
habitants of this land is considered to be worth at least $70,000,000, and 
we offer them more than they will ever know, after all their research, 
for the price of fifty cents ! After they have searched all the archives 
and the discoveries of men, then they will only have a dead record. 
It will speak only of the past. Whereas the Book of Mormon does 
not only tell of past civilizations, but it declares in most emphatic terms 
the ultimate destiny of this great land. Who can read the words of the 
prophets, and not know that, from the time when God first led his chil- 
dren here, after the destruction of the Tower of Babel, he designated 
this land as a choice land, choice above all other lands, and from that 
time until this it has been preserved as in the hollow of his hand, to serve 
some great destiny. 

Read the words of the Book of Mormon, declaring that upon 
this land the New Jerusalem of the Lord, our God, shall be builded, 
which shall ultimately be taken to heaven and again return when the 
earth is purified. Read the promise contained in that Book, that Jesus 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Christ is the God of this land and the king thereof ; that every nation that 
shall lift its hand against this land shall perish, "For I, the Lord, the king 
of heaven, will be their king." I wonder what the nations of this world 
would think if they knew that the God of heaven had decreed that he 
would fortify this land against all other nations. 

When we stop to analyze and think what the Book of Mormon 
contains, in addition to what might be discovered through the expendi- 
ture of this $70,000,000, is not this a marvelous work and a wonder ? I 
would like every missionary in our mission to feel when he approaches a 
home, offering a Book of Mormon, that he is offering something that is 
worth more than all the gold and silver of this world. If they read 
it and are touched by the divine spirit contained in its pages, they certainly 
cannot help but believe it. 

Years ago, when I was doing short-term missionary work in the 
Eastern States, we were out on the street corner one night, and a young 
missionary said to me, following the meeting: "Brother Richards, I 
don't know the Gospel is true." I said: "You don't?" and he said 
"No." I said: "You take the Book of Mormon and go home and read 
it, and don't you quit reading it until you know the- Gospel is true." 
We went out on the street about two weeks later and he stood up in his 
turn and said: "If the Book of Mormon isn't true, you tell me how 
Joseph Smith knew that those cities were buried in the depths of the earth 
out in Central and South America." When he was through I patted him 
on the back and said : "It works, doesn't it ?" 

When I was in Holland a sister came to me whose love for the truth 
had been somewhat disaffected, even though she had been a former 
worker in the Church, but through jealousy she had become lukewarm. 
Following a very inspirational meeting she said: "Brother Richards, 
tell me how I can get my testimony back." "Well," I said, "I will tell 
you if you will follow my instruction," and she said she would. I said : 
"When you can put all malice out of your heart, you go in to your own 
secret chamber and ask the Lord to reveal unto you the truth of the 
Book of Mormon, and then you read it chapter by chapter." She said : 
"I don't need to do that. I already know the Book of Mormon is true." 
"Then," I said, "you know all the rest of the story that goes with it." 

Now, I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, that in the analysis 
of every phase of our work, to me it is a marvelous work and a wonder. 

A young man arrived in the mission field a few months ago. He 
had had two years of college work. He said that he had received his call 
two years ago, but it took him that long to make up his mind to accept it. 
He said : "You know, I am a very practical man. I like to be able to 
go out in the orchard and pick the pears and eat them, and then I know 
it is a pear tree." When he was through I said : "Now, my boy, I want 
to tell you that pears grow on our tree too. Here is the Book of Mormon. 
With your analytical mind you take the little book, the "Seven Claims of 
the Book of Mormon," prepared by Dr. Widtsoe and Dr. Harris, and 
when you have analyzed those claims and the Book of Mormon, you come 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 65 

back and tell me if there isn't just as tangible proof that that Book is true 
as the eating of a pear is that the tree is a pear tree." 

I met him out in his district about six weeks later and he gave a fine 
testimony. I put my arm around him, and said : "Have you found any 
pears on the tree ?" He said: "Oh, forget it, Brother Richards." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I want to say to you that I thank 
the Lord for my membership in this Church ; and I thank him for every 
opportunity of service that has come to me. I am on my fourth mission. 
I have presided twice as a bishop, once as president of a stake, served 
on two high councils, and I want to testify to yOu that the Lord or this 
Church owes me nothing. I have been repaid a thousand fold for all I 
have ever done for the Church, and I hope I shall never falter. 

God bless you all, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that while I stand before you my 
remarks may be guided by the Spirit of God in whose name this Con- 
ference is conducted. 

I have listened with a great deal of interest to the statistical summary 
of the condition of the Church, the admonitions and the suggestions 
made by the brethren during these two days of conference. I have tried 
to probe into the heart of that which has been said to discover what 
I should say to fit in with that which has been said. 

PROGRESS BRINGS RESPONSIBILITY 

Many thoughts have come to me, — first and foremost a sense of 
gratitude for the progress of the Church, and secondly, a sense of the 
responsibility that rests upon every person who receives great favors. 
As I have thought these things over one thought has come to me more 
than any other — it has presented itself over and over again — an old 
and simple thought, one familiar to every Latter-day Saint and to 
every God-fearing man upon earth. I would like to present that to you 
even though it be elementary in its nature. 

As a young man, when I began my training for my life's work, I 
dipped into science and history, and gave attention also, I am grateful to 
say, to the restored Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I was thrilled 
by the thought that I belonged to an advancing day, that the day to which 
I belonged was not as yesterday, but was moving onward ; throughout my 
life I have gloried in and thrilled to the thought that I live in an ad- 
vancing day and age in the history of the world. 

PERMANENCE ENCOMPASSES EARTH'S CHANGES 

Of late, however, within the last few years at the most, I find that 
we no longer speak of an advancing day. We speak now of a changing 
day. This has greatly disturbed me because change Is not necessarily 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



advancement. I must know in what direction change takes place. If I 
live in an advancing day, then I know the change is one that I may 
favor and to which I may cling. But unless I am certain of the direction 
of change, I hesitate to accept it. 

We do live in a changing day. There is no question about that. We 
have the steamboat, the railroad; electricity with all its wonders; the 
radio, magnifying my voice at the present moment ; we have a thousand 
other wonders which have changed the older day. But, I cannot believe 
that these changes represent anything of real, fundamental importance 
to me as a son of God. I cannot help but believe that the elementary, 
the eternal, the fundamental things are just as they were thousands of 
years ago. 

This is not a changing world in the last analysis. This is a per- 
manent world. Change, at the best, is but a play upon permanent, un- 
changeable, eternal principles. It cannot be otherwise. The mountains 
may be worn down; they have been worn down; the high mountain 
may be reduced to a valley — but that which made up the mountain 
still exists. The particles, the elements, are but used in some other day 
for the furtherance of the great purpose back of all existence. 

DESIRABILITY OF PERMANENCE AND PROGRESS 

There is no change of value to us, unless it be upward, onward, 
forward, advancing. That is the thought that has been with me these 
two days. If any principle or change is connected with and uses eternal 
principles then it becomes progress. If it is not attached to such eternal, 
unyielding principles, it may be nothing more than chaos. I must search 
out for myself these eternal principles and by their use make this day 
one of permanence and progress. My message to the Latter-day Saints 
on this occasion is that we would do better not to speak so much about 
the changing day but say more about the day of permanence, — the day 
which has existed from the beginning in the mind of the Almighty who 
is the same yesterday, today and forever. 

"TO YOUR FIRST PRINCIPLES, O ISRAEL" 

. I think that my friend had that in mind when I met him on the 
street the other day. He said to me, "We would better get back to first 
principles." I remembered then an old slogan, an old battle cry handed 
down from the days of Israel "To your tents, O Israel," said the 
Prophet of old, and all Israel went to their tents and carried on in new 
and better ways. 

The Prophet Brigham Young made the same statement when he 
began the exodus into the West, "To your tents, O Israel." And today, 
"To your first principles, O Israel," should be our battle cry. We 
need not make a slogan of the minor things that sometimes disturb us and 
blind our vision. 

You would like to ask me as I speak on this subject if there are 
any principles of conduct to which we may cling with certainty. We 
have many. There is the code for human conduct given thousands of 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



67 



years ago known as the "Ten Commandments." These were given to the 
Prophet Moses amid the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai — a code 
which I am fully convinced was known to our Father Adam. I know 
that some people in our day say that "The Ten Commandments belong 
to a by-gone day, to a horse and buggy day." That I do not believe. 
To love God, to be kind, to be merciful, are as safe guides for human 
conduct today as they ever have been. We shall never out-live the 
eternal principles contained in the Ten Commandments. I have the 
feeling that if this people and the world at large would read and re-read, 
would practice and practice again, the simple commandments given on 
Sinai, we would solve many of the problems that disturb us today. It 
seems an intellectual folly or a mental aberration for men to disobey 
these fundamental invariable principles, commandments of God, and 
then attempt to solve the larger and more difficult problems of human 
existence. 

"Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not steal." 
Do we kill, in this age ? Do we lie, in this age ? Do we steal, in this age ? 
Suppose we search our own hearts ! Suppose this nation search its great 
heart to discover if these simple commandments are being obeyed. Do 
we return the dollar we find on the street when we know the owner ? Do 
we use the law as a shield to defraud the widow, and call it business ? I 
would like to put questions like these to my brethren and sisters who 
are before me and to all the Church. These are fundamental questions. 
Until we learn to speak the truth, to be honest, there will be no safety 
in the world. There can only be chaos and commotion and blood-shed 
and wars. We do not need to read books of philosophy to solve the 
problems of this day. The principles we need to follow have been given 
us throughout the ages by the Lord from our Father Adam until the 
- present day. 

OBSERVANCE OF TEN COMMANDMENTS A PRESENT-DAY OBLIGATION 

As I have said some people hold that the Ten Commandments belong 
to a by-gone age. That cannot be so for I remember that the Lord 
in this generation reiterated to the Prophet Joseph Smith the principles 
that are found in the Ten Commandments, and the Lord in this day 
added something to the Ten Commandments as reported by Moses ; and 
he made them more emphatic, for he said not only "Thou shalt not 
steal ; thou shalt not lie ;" but added, that "he who steals or lies shall be 
cast out unless he repents." 

I feel deeply on this matter, my dear brethren and sisters. It grieves 
me that I am not able to hang my overcoat in a public corridor for a half 
hour and then reasonably expect to find it again. It grieves me to know 
I cannot trust the people of my generation, my fellow men ; that they 
are directed by selfish motives to the extent of telling untruths. 

I would like to say also, that that which we do in opposition to the 
simple commandments of God, so often forgotten, changes and injures 
the very being of a man. The body is changed as well as the mind and 
soul, by that which we do. It is now a finding of modern science that 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prayer itself and the life of truth influences definitely and favorably the 
body itself, nerves, blood, the muscles, every part of us, physically, as well 
as mentally and spiritually. We are touched and changed by that which 
we do, for good or evil. The dishonest man corrupts his body ; the honest 
man makes it grow into greater strength and power. Therefore it is 
not a little thing to keep the eternal commandments given for our guid- 
ance in life. We reap our reward as we go along life's pathway. 

SECURITY IN OBEDIENCE 

We have many speakers and little time. I bear my testimony to the 
virtue and value of obedience to the simple commandments of Almighty 
God, those contained in the Ten Commandments, in the Beatitudes, in 
the messages that come to us from time to time from the inspired 
leaders of the Church who have spoken to us during this Conference. 

I bear witness to you that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. We are 
engaged in his work. Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, called in this 
day and generation to establish the work of God. We are traveling 
on safe ground, for Revelation is the rock and foundation of the work. 
I rejoice in my possession of this testimony, and I pray that it may grow 
within my heart, and within the heart of every Latter-day Saint, and I 
do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

Only a few days ago there was being commemorated the greatest 
event of human history, namely, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, our 
Lord, which only a few days earlier was preceded by its companion event, 
namely, his crucifixion. 

This year, as well as in years gone by, many prominent speakers have 
so ably discussed these important and hope-inspiring events that it may 
seem rather presumptuous, on my part, that I should undertake to make 
further comment, and yet there are a few features which I would like to 
emphasize in which there appears to be a variety of conflicting views, and 
which, if the Lorad will guide me by his Holy Spirit, I shall endeavor in 
part, at least, to clarify. In doing this I shall give heed "to the more sure 
word of prophecy" ; nor shall I deviate therefrom, nor yet attempt any 
private interpretation of my own. 

These two wonderful events must be considered jointly if we are to 
understand their real meaning. They represent the burning questions 
of life and death ; not only for Christ, our Lord, but for all mankind. 

Let us first consider the crucifixion : 

The crucifixion represents death, and suffering, or punishment for 
sin. We cannot appreciate the enormity of that suffering — that punish- 
ment for sin, which Christ endured in the garden of Gethsemane and upon 
the cross. "But," says one, "Christ did not sin." Very true, and yet he 
suffered for sin, not his own sin, for he had none ; but Christ suffered for 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



69 



sins, the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God. (I Peter 3 :18.) 
This intense pain and unbearable agony of his suffering we may not know, 
and yet he, even the Son of God, suffered these things, which suffering 
both in body and spirit, caused him to tremble with pain and bleed at 
every pore, even causing him to pray, saying, "O my Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless not as I will but as thou 
wilt." But this had been ordained of God in order to satisfy eternal 
justice, and so, we read — ■ 

For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might 
not suffer if they would repent; 

But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I. (D. and C, 
19:16-17.) 

And again : 

Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13 :3.) 

Was this death and all this suffering for Adam's transgression only ? 
No, not by any means. The penalty attached to Adam's action was death, 
not only for himself, but for all his posterity, and again, not only was it 
the temporal death, or death of the body, but also spiritual death, which is 
banishment from the presence of God. And thus Adam and all his 
descendants would have been eternally lost unless some plan had been 
provided for their redemption. 

Adam and Eve transgressed the law under which they lived in the 
Garden of Eden. The Lord said to them : 

Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. 

But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat 
of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee ; 
but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou 
shalt surely die. 

While the Lord forbade it, as we see, yet it was a part of the great 
plan of salvation, essential to the salvation of man, and we speak of it as a 
transgression of the law of heaven that mortality might be granted unto 
man. The will of the Lord is done in heaven. Why did the Savior teach 
us to pray: "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in 
heaven" ? 

Obedience to the will of God is the law of heaven — a necessary con- 
dition. Any deviation from his will would create confusion, disorder and 
disaster, and heaven would not be heaven if his will did not prevail. In 
this great sidereal universe there is an equilibrium maintained and upheld 
by the laws of God who created it ; let one of those laws, or forces of 
nature, as some are inclined to call them, either centripetal or centrifugal 
forces, be suspended even for a day, and this universe would suffer crash 
in violent collisions, or disintegrate by its members flying off into an end- 
less space never again to return. The equilibrium of heaven must also 
be maintained and upheld by strict obedience to the will of God. 

Adam and Eve hearkened to the devil and hence were cast out of 
Eden, which was paradise. But, shall we suffer for Adam's transgres- 
sion ? In answer let me quote the second Article of our Faith : 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



'We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for 
Adam's transgression. 

But, is there no escape from this suffering — this punishment for 
individual sin? Yes, if we will repent. 
Now, let us consider the resurrection. 

The resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. (D. 
and C. 88:16.) 

Redeemed from what? Redeemed from death and the grave. "O 
death where is thy sting ? O grave where is thy victory ?" This is what 
the resurrection of Christ means to us. 

The resurrection then represents life, joy ; immortality which is uni- 
versal ; for all are made alive again ; and eternal life in the presence of 
God, which comes only to those who repent, and for all such there is no 
more suffering, no more punishment for sin, for Christ suffered for all 
who would repent, but if they would not repent then shall they suffer 
for their own sins even as the Lord Jesus Christ suffered. They will have 
to pay the penalty themselves, being cast down to hell to endure the 
punishment which comes to those who will not repent, even though 
their punishment should last for a thousand years. (D. and C. 76 :84, 85.) 

How beautifully these two events are symbolized in the ordinance of 
baptism. The Apostle Paul had a very clear understanding of it as shown 
in his epistle to the Romans : 

Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ 
were baptized into his death? 

Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as 
Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
also should walk in newness of life. 

For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we 
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. (Romans 6:3, 4, 5.) 

How completely then are the crucifixion and the resurrection of our 
Lord, these two historic events — the greatest events of human history — 
how beautifully are they symbolized in the holy ordinance of baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins. And what an unjustifiable change 
the sectarian world has perpetrated by substituting sprinkling in lieu of 
immersion, thus destroying utterly its sacred meaning, its beautiful sym- 
bolism of the death and burial of our Redeemer on the one hand and on 
the other his glorious resurrection. A base perversion of a holy rite 
almost amounting to a sacrilege. 

All through the history of God's dealings with the children of men 
these two great historic events have been proclaimed both in prophecy and 
in symbols in order to impress upon their hearts their only hope for a life 
beyond the grave — the sacrifice for sin, the passover, the slaying of- a 
male lamb without spot or blemish, and with its blood striking the door 
posts as a means of saving the children of Israel from the plague decreed 
upon the first born of the Egyptians; Abraham's offering of his son 
Isaac; Job's testimony of his own resurrection and of his living Re- 
deemer. All these and many more proclaim the supreme sacrifice made 
by Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who was indeed without spot and 



i 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



71 



without blemish, and who suffered for our sins — the sins of the whole 
world if they would repent. 

These events are also symbolized from the very beginning even in 
the Garden of Eden. God planted a garden in the east of Eden with 
trees that provided for the bodily needs of Adam and Eve of which they 
were freely to partake, but in the midst of the garden he also planted the 
tree of knowledge of good and evil and forbade them from partaking of 
its fruit. 

Also the tree of life was planted in the midst of the garden just as 
was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and lest Adam and Eve might 
partake of the fruit of this tree and live forever in their sin they were 
cast out of Eden and cherubims with flaming swords were placed at the 
entrance to guard the way to the tree of life. Thus it will be seen how 
these two events are symbolized in the Garden of Eden. Death and 
suffering, or punishment for sin, symbolizes the crucifixion of the Son 
of God, and his resurrection is symbolized by the tree of life, or in other 
words, life after death, which comes to all, and also eternal life which, 
however, is withheld from men unless they shall repent. 

Now, let me quote the third Article of our Faith : 

We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be 
saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

What are these laws and ordinances through obedience to which 
all mankind may be saved? They are: 
1st — Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2nd — Repentance. 

3rd — Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. 

4th — Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Those who have faith in the Lord and repent of their sins and who 
render obedience to these outward laws and ordinances — which, however, 
must be performed by one who is commissioned of Jesus Christ to per- 
form them — shall be saved. Washed clean in the blood of the Lamb of 
God, the suffering of Christ, shall also secure to them complete free- 
dom from all suffering or any future punishment for sin. 

But, are we not to be judged according to the deeds done in the 
body? The right answer to this question is : "Most assuredly yes." And 
when we are finally brought to judgment before the Great Judge the 
books will be opened wherein our works are written — our deeds both good 
and evil — according to which we shall be judged. It will surely appear 
that there are two sides to our account — one for the good and one for the 
evil — the debit side and the credit side. And, if it shall be written on the 
credit side that we have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ and do now 
believe in him ; that we have truly repented of all our sins and do now 
repent of them; if it shall be recorded that we have been baptized by 
immersion for the remission of our sins by one duly commissioned to 
perform that sacred ordinance, and that we have received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by one having authority to bestow 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that blessing, then our account is balanced. Yes, far more than balanced. 
There will be a glorious credit balance that shall secure to us the Divine 
approval, and another book shall be opened which is The Lamb's Book of 
Life, and our names shall be entered therein, and we shall then receive 
the crown of Eternal Life — God's greatest gift to man — which he has 
promised to them who love him and keep his holy commandments. 

But, if when the books are opened it shall appear that we have 
rejected the counsels of God against ourselves, and have no such entries 
on the credit side of our account because we would not repent, the suffer- 
ing of our Lord will not apply to us and we shall be cast down into hell 
to suffer for ourselves, and that too until the uttermost farthing has been 
paid — until our sins are purged away, even if it takes a thousand years 
and until the day of the Lord, when we shall have atoned for our own 
sins, and when that time comes then shall the gates of hell be burst asunder 
and the captive shall be let free. Even the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against the Church of Christ. All mankind shall be saved in one or an- 
other kingdom. Even the wicked, after they have paid the debt shall be 
admitted into the Telestial Kingdom, the glory of which surpasseth all 
understanding, but where God and his Christ are they shall never come, 
worlds without end. Thus God has provided for the salvation of all his 
children excepting only the sons of Perdition, those who shed innocent 
blood and who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him. 

These are a few of the reflections which come to me as we celebrate 
the Easter festival in commemoration of the resurrection of our Lord, 
and in giving expression to them I have endeavored to portray the true 
meaning and significance of these historic events as I find them recorded 
on the pages of Holy Writ. And, as I reflect upon them, my heart is 
filled with joy and gladness even to overflowing, and with gratitude and 
praise to him, the Giver of all good. 

May the Lord add his blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 

President of the Western States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, the admonitions, the encouragement, and 
the advice given in these sessions of Conference I feel will be appropriate, 
useful and beneficial to all who accept of the same. 

I was impressed this 1 morning very much with the warning given as 
to the conditions existing in the world, and I am reminded of a passage 
of scripture which I should like to read: 

Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine 
in the land, not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing 
the words of the Lord : 

And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from north even to the 
east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall 
not find it. 



ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 



73 



Likewise, I read these words : 

For the Lord is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all 
churches of the saints. 

It is said that a wise philosopher made this observation : 

I have diligently searched the Heavens and nowhere have I found 
God. 

I think if we look around the world today we will find that confusion 
is everywhere to be found; misunderstanding, misinterpretation, doubt, 
and uncertainty are all ever present. The world is fraught with anxiety. 
We read an article in the paper the other day concerning a condition 
existing way off in Egypt, where, in a monastery of one hundred monks, 
these monks went on a sit-down strike because they wanted to go modern. 

From Canton, China, we read an announcement that the police raided 
a southern province of China known as the "Superstition Belt," and 
confiscated one thousand man-made gods in an effort to stamp out idol- 
atry. The authorities, fearing that wide-spread opposition would follow 
the drastic measures for the destruction of the metal and clay images, 
confined the images to a god concentration camp where the populace 
would be able to pray and burn incense to their favorite deity. 

We read in an Associated Press dispatch from Chicago of a large 
convention of churches there advocating the unification of a system that 
would make one church instead of many. In fact, there were forty 
different organizations represented, and the great bishop in charge said 
that he felt it was time for us to drop these different theories and ideas 
and be united under one hew organization to be called the United Chris- 
tian Advance. 

We read of the conditions existing in Russia; that the preaching 
of religion is forbidden. There are twenty-five million children of school 
age who have been taught that there is no God. The teachers are for- 
bidden to teach religion of any kind in the schools, all religious publica- 
tions are banned, and 4,200 priests and those in charge of the churches 
have been confined to concentration camps and many have died in ob- 
livion. At Moscow, where there were four hundred and fifty-four 
churches in existence, only some thirty now remain. Fourteen thousand 
churches were closed last year and few are left anywhere throughout 
the Russian countries. 

Many of these conditions that exist today, as we know, have been 
brought about as a result of confusion and misunderstanding with refer- 
ence to religion. It is astonishing how men's ideas are warped ; how small 
they become ; and, not being sensitive to the promptings of the Spirit of 
the Lord, they do not desire to have truth penetrate their souls. If 
truth could make its imprint upon the hearts of men as the Lord intended, 
what a marvelous and wonderful thing it would be. 

Truth is a virtue akin to the divine, "eternal, unchanged evermore." 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ stands for the highest in intellectual 
development. It invites all men to come from wherever they may to join 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the great pilgrimage that will lead us to our great eternal home. It is 
marvelous when our souls are touched with the influences of the divine. 
It enables us to overcome prejudice and bigotry and become mellowed in 
our feelings, thus permitting the influence of God Almighty to touch us. 

I thank the Lord that this Church is one that has never had to 
change its policies, never had to change its creed or its doctrine ; that there 
never has been a period when there has been a decline in enthusiasm or in 
numbers, but that it has grown year by year since its inception one hun- 
dred and seven years ago with a very meager beginning of six members, 
until today approximately eight hundred thousand are following the 
banner of Jesus, the Christ, the crucified Lord. 

I thank the Lord that there has come to me the opportunity of be- 
coming a member of this Church. I thank my sainted mother and father 
for the glorious teachings that they gave me as a child to honor and sus- 
tain the Authorities of this great Church. It has been born and bred 
into me that if I will abide the counsel of those who preside over me I 
will never go astray, and I have undertaken in my weak and humble way 
to teach these same principles to my own boys and my girls and also 
to the wonderful missionaries in our mission, that they might have im- 
planted in their hearts and souls that integrity and devotion that will 
make of them real, genuine, honest-to-goodness Latter-day Saints. 

This Church invites the world to come to it. It is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, in fact the Church of Jesus Christ and the Gospel of Jesus 
are one and the same, inseparable and indivisible, and we who have 
embraced its truths and live according to its glorious ideals and standards 
will assuredly go to our eternal homes, and there will be unfolded to us 
a glory and a beauty that will be very graciously received by us. 

I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that the three and a half 
years that Sister Daynes and I have spent in the Western States Mission 
have been the most beautiful picture in our lives. We have learned the 
meaning of love, of loyalty and likewise that of faith. We have under- 
taken to teach these precious truths to the missionaries sent us and to 
likewise stimulate the faith of the members of the great Church within the 
boundaries of our Mission. 

I am very happy to say that every one of our missionaries, some 
eighty-six in all, is well and happy and giving vigorously of his or her 
efforts for the great truths of the Gospel. 

My testimony has never lessened. It is greater and stronger and 
more fervent today because I know that the Gospel is true, God being 
my witness. I hope that I shall continue in the faith and be true to 
every trust that may be reposed in me. My peace and blessings to you 
all, my brethren and sisters. 

May God ever direct us in every path of duty I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



The congregation sang the hymn, "High on the Mountain Top." 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 75 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, we have had a wonderful Conference 
thus far. We are a greatly blessed people, but we find ourselves in a 
world that is sometimes designated as "the lone and dreary world," and 
as we pass along we encounter many dangerous pitfalls, but the Lord 
in heaven has provided a guide to take us safely through. 

FOUR IMPORTANT BOOKS 

Let me draw your attention to the fact that we have four great 
and important books, comprising the standard works of the Church — 
namely, the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
the Pearl of Great Price. These four precious volumes which contain 
the word of God to the children of men constitute the best library in all 
the world. I say this confidently without mental reservation. 

GIFT OF HOLY GHOST NECESSARY 

In connection with these important books that mean so much and 
are of such inestimable value to the Latter-day Saints, we have the gift of 
the Holy Ghost. This is highly essential because it is well understood 
that the prophets of old wrote and spoke as they were moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost. And in order to understand and comprehend their 
writings we must study those writings with the same spirit by which 
they were written. So that I think I can safely say that this gift which is 
given without exception to every member of the Church, at the time of 
his or her baptism, enables Latter-day Saints, and even young children, 
in great measure, to understand the glorious doctrines of the Gospel; 
whereas without this gift the most learned and cultured people on earth 
could not comprehend the words of these sacred books. 

A SURE GUIDE 

In addition to all this, as constituting a sure guide, we have the living 
oracles of the Church. The prophets in the meridian of time have 
spoken to us, and now the prophets of the latter days speak ; and it should 
not be forgotten that we have also had one hundred years of most im- 
portant and valuable experience behind us. We have been well looked 
after. The Lord has ever been mindful of his people. He is near at 
hand. He hears their prayers and answers the righteous desires of their 
hearts. 

There are three great things connected with the guidance alluded to. 
First, during the past one hundred years a great and marvelous work 
has been accomplished by the Latter-day Saints ; secondly, at the present 
time a further great and marvelous work is being accomplished; and, 
thirdly, there is room for great improvement. 

THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 

We read in the Book of Mormon the words of the prophet Lehi 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



(and, mark you, he was a great prophet), — he said: "Adam fell that 
men might be, and men are, that they might have joy." In that line of 
but a few words is disclosed the purpose of life : The very purpose of life 
is then that men might have joy. 

Many people may be happy. Many people may be joyous. But no 
person, or people, can have a fulness of joy except under certain stated 
conditions, and those conditions are set forth in one of the great revela- 
tions given to Joseph Smith, the prophet. The words are these : 

Man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, in- 
separably connected, receive a fulness of joy; 

And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. (D. and 
C. 93:33.) 

THREE DIFFERENT ESTATES 

We are told in the Pearl of Great Price that man's experience has 
come to him through certain estates. There is the first estate and the 
second estate and the third estate. In the first, pre-existent, estate man's 
experience was spiritual in its character. We were spirits there and 
we were happy. We belonged to a great family of spirits. It was a 
heavenly place and we were happy but we could not altogether appreciate 
that happiness because we had had no experience for comparison. We 
must have lived a great while. We must have learned much in that pre- 
existent state but something further was essential; something needed 
to be added to us that was lacking, and that is shown to be the case 
by certain scriptures that are found in the Holy Bible wherein it is said, 
"God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into him the 
breath of life, and he became a living soul." 

Previously he was not a living soul, he was a living spirit. You are 
living souls ; I am a living soul. Satan is not a living soul, neither are 
those wicked spirits who went with him, who rebelled in heaven and were 
cast out and came down to earth. Their punishment, according to the 
words of Joseph Smith, the prophet, is that they should not be given 
bodies. 

And so this gives us an idea of how very precious and desirable 
is the body. It is called the tabernacle of the spirit. It is called a living 
temple of God, and how wonderful that is, and it is only when we have 
attained to that condition that we can rise in the resurrection, after taking 
up these bodies, to exaltation and glory in that future third estate; so 
that we have in this matter of three estates a perfect brief citation of the 
purpose and meaning of life. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BODY 

Bernard McFadden, the publisher of the Physical Culture Journal, 
pays a glowing tribute to the importance of the body. It is so much in 
line with the teaching of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints that it seems to me possibly you would be interested in hearing 
what he says about the body. 

The title of this editorial is "Making our Body Glorious." 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON

Glorify God in your body is a Biblical command. It is a command 
also dictated by common sense. Your body is the house in which you 
must live all through life. You cannot move out of it until you make 
your last trip to the cemetery. 

To exalt and beautify the body exemplifies the highest degree of culture 
and intelligence. Your body should be treated with reverence. It should 
be cared for daily, and given every consideration. You should assume the 
responsibility as a sacred trust. Therefore, the acquirement of buoyant, 
vital health is a duty no one should neglect. 

Many of the tragedies that are so interestingly present in the vivid, 
life-like stories, were made possible because the body was treated with 
indifference. 

When you possess a hardy, vigorous body, your physical instincts 
give poise and add force to your character. Your very soul is more 
keenly alive. And you then have a foundation for spiritual power, that 
should be invaluable in the attainment of life's great riches of mind and 
soul. 

Nearly all criminals are physically as well as mentally defective. 
They have sinned against the body, and they had to pay the associated 
penalties. 

Man was made in the image of God, so the Good Book tells us. If 
you expect love and romance to come into your life, you should try and 
make your body godlike in its proportions. It is only then that masculinity 
and femininity possess the fascinating lure that leads to a sacred love. The 
glamor of romance, after all, serves a very practical purpose. It is made 
to perpetuate the home and guarantee the continuance of the race. There- 
fore, do not decry the body — your flesh and blood home. Give it careful 
consideration every day of your life. Make it strong, fine and splendid 
throughout its every part. 

In I Corinthians 3 : 16-17 we read : "Know ye not that ye are the temple 
of God?" * * * "If any man defile the temple of God him shall God 
destroy for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." Regardless 
of your religious views, you cannot get away from the truth of this divine 
philosophy. 

Our bodily house can be built with such fine material that it will 
stand the stress and storm of the most severe nature. 

Even the most devastating sorrows that seem to sear the soul to the 
very limit can be lived down and the sunlight of life can still add zest and 
glory to your daily life if you properly assume the sacred trust of building 
and maintaining that hardy strength which is our natural heritage. 

THE SPIRITUAL AND THE TEMPORAL 

I have no doubt, my brethren and sisters, that we all concur in what 
is said, in this splendid editorial because it is in harmony with the teachings 
of the Gospel. The spirit is precious, the body is precious, and when joined 
together they constitute the soul of man. The spiritual body is greater 
than the temporal body, but even so we see how very important is the 
body and how careful we should be to refrain from taking into the body 
anything that would be hurtful to it or would have a tendency to defile it. 

In this Conference we have heard of the spiritual and we have 
heard of the temporal. I have never been able myself to draw the exact 
line between the temporal and the spiritual. The line, if such there be, 
is very fine and almost indistinguishable. 

THE TRUE CHURCH 

I solemnly testify, my brethren and sisters, before sitting down, that 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I do know absolutely that this is the true Church of the Redeemer of the 
world whose precious blood was shed that we might live and be redeemed 
and saved in the kingdom of God. I know also that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God, faithful and true, and a wonderful man — wonderful 
indeed, and that his brother Hyrum, the Patriarch, was much like him. 

I rejoice in this testimony and pray that it may ever be with me, 
and I invoke God's blessings upon you, brethren and sisters, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the clarity and the strength 
with which the principles of the Gospel have been taught to us in this 
Conference. It is indeed good to be here. 

We, in the North Central States Mission, believe that the present 
time is a very choice period in which to do missionary work. We are 
constantly being asked such vital questions as : What is behind all these 
things that are happening on Temple Block in Salt Lake City ? What is 
it that stimulates and maintains your great missionary system ? Why do 
you build these temples? How is your Security work organized and 
conducted? The answers to these questions carry much that is funda- 
mental to our doctrine, our activity and our lives. People have always 
been interested in results. We as missionaries are delighted to point to 
some of these things as evidence of our activity and ability to meet the 
problems of the day. 

It would seem that the theme of this conference may easily be 
summarized in that passage from the 87th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day 
of the Lord come; for behold it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. 

Our inspired leaders have in these sessions clearly marked the path, 
and not only indicated the holy places, but have indicated the safety 
associated with them. It is a sacred privilege to be permitted to stand 
therein. 

Our missionaries stand in holy places. As evidence of this, I suggest 
a recent experience in our Mission. It appeared necessary to leave one 
of our cities temporarily without missionaries, due to the release of one 
of our number. This plan brought from a non-member friend a fervent 
appeal that missionaries be returned to them. She spoke for her friends 
and neighbors and called our attention to the fact that they were being 
taught the sacred principles of the Gospel and needed sorely the help and 
leadership of the missionaries. 

In due time, I personally accompanied an elder as he returned to 
this city. Across the aisle in the train was a young man in the custody of 
a sheriff. The officer was returning his companion to face serious charges 
of infraction of the law. I witnessed the uneasiness of the young man. 



ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 



79 



I heard him discuss the possibility of meeting his accusers, of facing a 
court and a jury with the possible loss of his freedom for months or 
years. He traveled at the expense of the state. When the time to eat 
arrived, he was taken into the diner. At night, he was led into the 
sleeping apartment of the train. Yet, with all of this, he was unhappy. 
He was uncertain of himself. It was quite evident he didn't stand in 
"holy places." 

In the same car traveled the missionary who was also being re- 
turned. He was not wanted by an accuser or the arm of the law. He 
was returning to an unselfish and a sacred service. He willingly paid 
his own transportation. For food he ate a sandwich and an apple. At 
night he secured what sleep was possible by dozing in his seat. He was 
radiating the spirit of calm and cheer as he conversed with fellow 
passengers. There was no disturbing conscience. He was at peace with 
himself and with others. He stood in "holy places." This situation, in 
contrast with the one just mentioned, clearly illustrates the value of the 
Gospel and the application of its truths. It thoroughly demonstrates the 
fact that the safe, sane and happy life is the one that is well-ordered and 
disciplined. It is not difficult to see and understand that the measure of 
one's achievement, progress and joy is viewed in terms of the degree to 
which he gives himself wholly and sincerely to the living of the funda- 
mental and potent truths of the Gospel. 

In the North Central States Mission we have many choice and 
worthy people. One of these I desire to refer to as a man of faith, as 
the following incident will indicate. I speak of Brother Arnold Wads- 
worth of Chinook, Montana. A few years ago this brother had the 
misfortune to lose the sight of one eye. About a year ago, while working 
on his farm, the lever on a planting machine was accidentally released, 
striking him in the other eye, which resulted in the loss of sight there 
also. While receiving treatment in a hospital at Great Falls, Montana, 
following this accident, he was visited by President Edward J. Wood, 
of the Alberta Temple, who gave him a blessing with a promise that 
vision would be restored to the sufferer. For several months there was 
darkness, but always an abiding faith and a manly courage. Last Decem- 
ber, Brother Wadsworth felt impressed to visit the Mayo Brothers at 
their noted clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, also in our Mission. Here 
the best of care and attention was given him. Several operations were 
performed, but each time accompanied by disappointment and apparent 
failure. After several weeks, an interview was called at which time he 
was told that nothing could be done for him. The operations had failed 
and there was nothing left for him to do but to return to his home and 
adjust himself to such life and activities as could be accomplished without 
sight. 

This man of faith replied that such could not be. He had been 
promised by a servant of the Lord that he would see and that he had 
come to this noted institution for the scientific skill required. Failure 
could not be accepted. Followed by a brief but intense silence, this 
answer came from the skilled physicians : "If that is your faith, your 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



purpose and hope, we will try again." Another operation was arranged. 
A more healthful condition was found than had hitherto been discovered. 
Followed by other operations and special treatment sight came back into 
the eye. This experience is recognized as an outstanding event in the 
clinic. The scientists were deeply touched by it. This grateful man 
recently returned to his home able to see his loved ones, his associates, 
and to engage in his activities which had been impossible for many 
months. He speaks of this experience with a deep and sincere gratitude 
and a sacred recognition of the kindness of the Lord to him. He, too, 
stood in "holy places." 

May we, also, be able to stand in such places and be not moved. 
It is a privilege to drink deeply of the spirit and inspiration of this 
Conference as it flows through these, our presiding brethren. Such is 
our blessing, our guide and our refuge. May we all be strengthened by 
an appreciation of its full significance I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice greatly, my brethren and sisters, in meeting with you and 
enjoying the sessions of this Conference. I am fully in accord with 
everything that has been said to us during all these meetings. I feel that 
the instructions that have been given are of great value, and that, as 
Latter-day Saints, we should remember that which has been said, and, 
undertake to follow it out to the best of our ability for our own welfare. 

CORRECT PRINCIPLES SELF-GOVERNMENT 

I am reminded of a story that is told — I think most of you have 
heard it — of the time when the Prophet Joseph was in Nauvoo. Nauvoo 
had become a very flourishing and wonderful city, — the outstanding city 
of Illinois, — one of the most remarkable cities in the country at that time. 
It was situated on the frontier and of course did not enjoy the facilities 
that we have today. Visitors came from all parts of the country. Among 
them was a prominent minister who was quite interested in community 
welfare. He said to the Prophet Joseph: "How do you govern this 
people so remarkably well? There is order and harmony, and splendid 
results are being accomplished in this city." The Prophet Joseph gave 
that historic answer : "I teach them correct principles, and they govern 
themselves." I think that is the keynote for us as Latter-day Saints in 
all the walks of life. 

LOVE OF MONEY THE ROOT OF EVIL 

President Clawson has referred to the fact that it is hard to dis- 
tinguish between the temporal and the spiritual. We are concerned with 
temporal things as well as spiritual things. We need to act properly in 
temporal things and we need to grow spiritually. We should not allow 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



81 



the temporal things to over-balance spiritual things; because while we 
have to earn our own livelihood, we ought to keep in mind all the time 
that we are here for a time only, that this life is only part of our exist- 
ence, and that eternal treasures are the things for which to strive. We 
are told by the Apostle Paul that the love of money is the root of all evil. 
Certainly the love of money may lead to some very serious conditions. 
Any man or woman whose whole heart is set upon the acquiring of 
wealth to the exclusion of things that are spiritual and in accordance 
with the principles, the Savior laid down is failing to appreciate some of 
the greatest things in life. Anyone whose efforts are so set upon the 
things of this world, that he does not show fair dealings and mutual 
helpfulness to his fellowmen, though he may accumulate wealth, is a 
failure. 

PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

I have been trying to analyze in my own mind during this Con- 
ference something of the present economic conditions of the Latter-day 
Saints. I realize that there has been great improvement in a general 
way in economic conditions throughout the nation, and in our own 
localities. I would like to present a few figures to you to indicate some- 
thing of the recovery that has taken place with, of course, the help of a 
great amount of Federal funds throughout the nation. These figures 
refer to the nation as a whole. 

COMPARATIVE BUSINESS INDICATORS 

In 1929 farm income was at a figure of 105, 100 being the normal. 
In 1936 it was 85. In department store sales in 1929 the index was 108. 
In 1936, 93. In business, activity in 1928 and 1929 it was 110. In 1936, 
108. In the matter of employment in the durable goods industries, — the 
heavy industries which reflect and indicate in large measure the prosperity 
of the country, — the index in 1929 was 95. In 1936, 88. In demand bank 
deposits throughout the country, the total in 1929 was $13,500,000,000. 
In 1936, $19,000,000,000. 

In our own locality we find that building permits, for instance, in this 
city in 1929 were $5,670,000. In 1936, $3,373,000, or 60%. In some de- 
partment store sales in this city, taking the volume in 1929 at 100%, the 
volume in 1936 was 75.2%. In wholesale groceries, with 100% in 1929, 
the percentage was 81.6% in 1936. In wholesale hardware, with an index 
of 100 in 1929, the index in 1936 was 122. In the matter of unemploy- 
ment, the decrease during the' past two or three years has been very 
substantial. In fact, it appears that ordinarily, at present, of those who 
are qualified in the trades, there is, practically no unemployment. In my 
judgment, one of the best gauges of economic welfare in this inter- 
mountain territory is the measure of tithes paid. On a unit basis, this 
would indicate that in the year 1936 economic conditions among the people 
were about 83% of what they were in 1929. In respect of building con- 
struction, I think we have recovered probably less than in almost any 
Other phase of industry; but I believe that with the progress we are 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



making in economic conditions, there will be a large increase in this 
activity in the future; which should take up a large part of the unem- 
ployment that prevails throughout this nation. 

IMPROVEMENT IN EMPLOYMENT 

I find in traveling among the stakes of Zion in many places there is 
relatively little unemployment and that people are feeling much better 
about conditions. Yet there is and always will be unemployment, and at 
the present time, particularly in the more densely populated sections, there 
is still considerable unemployment. It has been found true that a large 
proportion of the unemployed are those who have not particularly qual- 
ified for any line of industry. They have never become skilled in voca- 
tions or trades. I think that is one of the things that we ought to stimu- 
late, to encourage and to assist in every part of the Church. All girls 
and boys among us should learn trades or vocations that will fit them best 
for life as far as practicable, in the localities in which they live. It 
appears that in this year, 1937, there will be constantly increasing oppor- 
tunities for employment in the mining industry, in agriculture, in con- 
struction work and in generally increased business activity. 

DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 

In like manner, we should develop all our natural resources under 
proper state control, and develop industries suitable to local conditions. 
In Utah, for instance, in the matter of water supply we are not so fortu- 
nate as some of the surrounding states. Idaho is much better situated in 
water resources. To some extent Arizona also has this advantage, as 
well as California, Wyoming, and Colorado. Water is the very lif eblood 
of our communities. For lack of sufficient water some of our people have 
found it difficult, particularly in these drouth years that we have had, to 
mature proper crops and maintain the population we have, and that we 
ought to have, with the extent of fertile land in various localities. 

CONSERVATION OF WATER SUPPLY 

I say water is the lif eblood of this intermountain section. The State 
Engineer of Utah has been making a survey of small reservoir sites 
throughout the State. Utah has had proportionately less reclamation than 
any of the surrounding States. Yet all possible water supply ought to be 
conserved for irrigation of available lands. A large proportion of the 
people of the Church have been trained in agriculture and are living near 
to the soil. There ought to be every opportunity given to them, as far as 
possible, to maintain themselves in the communities in which they live. 
The results of the survey above mentioned indicate that there are about 
fifty-four small reservoir sites in addition to some other possibilities of 
additional water supply. If they can be developed, many communities 
throughout this State will be helped. I would like to encourage the Stake 
Presidencies and Ward Bishoprics in those communities where such pos- 
sibilities prevail to cooperate in every way in an endeavor to get reservoirs 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



83 



developed to provide supplemental water for theiinaturing of later crops 
in localities where our people have already established themselves. The 
water supply should be controlled and regulated in such a way that the 
people at large will have the benefit. In like manner it is important that 
all natural resources should be developed and protected for the welfare of 
all the people. 

CLASS AND FREAK LEGISLATION 

It seems to me at the present time there is an unusual tendency in our 
legislation not to consider the welfare of the whole people, but for various 
groups to seek to obtain legislation that pertains to their particular inter- 
ests. Now, if there is any particular group that wants any legislation that 
is not for the welfare of the people as a whole, it is dangerous legislation. 
As citizens and leaders in these various communities, it should be realized 
that those who are elected or appointed to act in political office should 
cultivate the determination to deal fairly with all citizens and avoid any- 
thing in the nature of class legislation, for such things are bound to react 
in promoting strife and disunion. 

AVOID CLASS FEELING AND STRIFE 

There is a tendency among some politicians to stir up class feeling 
and to pit one group or class against another. That is a dangerous thing. 
The Lord's heart is open and his blessings come to all mankind ; he is no 
respecter of persons, and in all lands and in all places those who serve him 
and keep his commandments are accepted of him. I think that ought to 
be the spirit of the Latter-day Saints everywhere. We should strive 
against anything in the nature of class feeling or class legislation. We 
have heard during this conference about the strikes that are prevailing 
at the present time. We are all familiar with these conditions. We must 
all come to understand that when such conditions develop, it is high time 
that both employers and employes shall be made legally responsible under 
the law in their dealings with one another. Also, it must be remembered 
that, in many such disagreements, the public at large suffers the conse- 
quences. Is it, therefore, not possible to work out some plan whereby 
friction may be avoided and whereby strikes may be promptly settled to 
avoid loss of wages to employes, deficits to the employers, and suffering 
to the public? There must be plans worked out, and proper legislation 
enacted, that will bring both sides of such controversies together under 
equitable conditions ; otherwise, if they increase they will become a serious 
menace to the welfare and progress of this nation. 

WISE COUNSEL OF PRESIDENT GRANT 

There have been a number of legislative matters that have been en- 
acted and policies promulgated against which warning has been given by 
the President of the Church ; and I want to say to you, and I believe you 
will realize it if you will think back upon these things, that in every 
instance he was right in his counsel. If this advice had been followed 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we should all have better conditions. Now, we do not believe in blind 
obedience, but we do believe in discerning obedience. Every one of us 
is entitled to enjoy discernment. What is discernment? It is recogniz- 
ing the difference between right and wrong, or developing clearness of 
judgment or insight. If we are living the Gospel we are entitled to enjoy 
the light of the Holy Spirit to guide and bless us, to enable us to judge 
rightly. We do not have to accept the judgment or counsel of the man 
who stands at the head of the Church here upon the earth ; but we will 
know that the things he advises are right, if we will divorce ourselves 
from personal or political desires or ideas. We should strive to enjoy 
the spirit of discernment. The Apostle Paul tells us that one of the gifts 
of the Holy Ghost is the discernment of spirits. In like manner one of the 
gifts is discernment of right and wrong. What a wonderful thing it will 
be when we shall all learn correct principles, and have the discernment to 
govern ourselves in righteousness. Then we shall grow in justice and 
fair dealing, we shall avoid strife and contention, we shall enact and 
administer equitable laws, and improve in temporal and spiritual things. 
The Lord will prosper this people temporally as well as spirtually if we 
control our selfish feelings and strive to carry out his purposes. 

FOLLOW ADVICE OF LEADERS 

I rejoice in the truth of the Gospel. I" realize the fact that the Lord 
has beeni very kind to me; my brethren have been very kind to me, they 
have borne with me. I sustain these men who preside because I know 
they are men who have been selected of the Lord by the inspiration and 
power of his Spirit. And I want to say to you that I realize the Presi- 
dency of this Church are in a position to counsel us in righteousness. If 
we will forget personal feelings or selfish desires and will conform to 
such advice we will gain the blessings. The people as a whole will be 
prospered and blessed ; and the people of the world will be greatly bene- 
fited if they will observe the instructions that are given to us here and 
that have been given to us all the years past. I know of a verity that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he was an 
instrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the Gospel of which 
we are the beneficiaries, and that all those who have succeeded him as 
presidents of the Church have been empowered with the same power 
and spirit. They have enjoyed the spirit of their calling in rich measure. 
May the Lord continue to sustain President Grant, and bless all the 
officers throughout this Church, that they may be watchmen upon the 
towers, that they may listen to the instructions given by those in authority 
and carry the same to the people ! May every one of the members of the 
Church cultivate the spirit of discernment and of righteousness, that all 
may learn proper principles and control ourselves for our own benefit 
and for the progress of the work of God, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

As a closing number, the congregation sang the hymn "The Spirit 
of God like a Fire is Burning."

HISTORY OF THE CHURCH REVIEWED 

This Church has had an interesting past. It will have a more in- 
teresting future. It has ever had outstanding objectives, that have 
focused the attention of the Church as we have gone forward, step by 
step, in unfolding the plan and purpose of the Lord in the establishment 
of this, his glorious work, to be triumphant in the last days. We glory 
in those achievements of the past. We have reason to be grateful to the 
Lord for the faithfulness and devotion of our fathers and mothers. We 
have been through days of trial and of struggle, of migration and immi- 
gration; crossing the plains; and colonization work. We have passed 
through days of misunderstanding when the voice of villainy and slander 
has had its day. We have seen bonds and imprisonment and even mar- 
tyrdom. But a new day has dawned for the Church, a day of under- 
standing and a day of demonstration. This day comes at a time when the 
world needs the very things that the Church is undertaking to accomplish 
as an example to them. It comes at a time when Christianity is having 
its most serious struggle, at least in these modern days, by reason of the 
difficulty churches are having to hold their membership, wherein, we 
have learned at this Conference, entire nations have turned away from 
Christianity. Some have said that the world has waited nineteen hundred 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



years for Christianity to reach the zenith of its power, and then it 
is found helpless to save the world from its greatest catastrophe, and 
there is a disposition to look for something else. 

Spain's sad condition 

I confess to you that it is a sad picture to see what is happening in 
Spain today. Spain was, for nearly a thousand years, the mightiest 
strength of the Roman Catholic Church, in maintaining itself, and it 
was by the might and power of Spanish soldiers that this church was 
able to establish itself in nearly all of Latin America; and to see this 
great nation turning against that church, crucifying priests upon the 
crosses within their own sacred structures, driving priests and nuns from 
the country, and raiding the treasury. These men who are the descend- 
ants of many generations of that kind of Christianity are engaging in one 
of the crudest wars that ever has been waged among any people in the 
destruction of each other. If these are the fruits of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, no wonder the world is losing faith. 

VITALITY IN CHURCH OF CHRIST 

There are many today who are agreeing with what the Lord said to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith more than a hundred years ago, concerning 
the brand of Christianity that was in the world then. "They had the 
form of godliness but they lacked the power thereof." Our Church, I 
say, comes to the attention of the world, when the world is willing 
to listen, and is far more concerned in the actual demonstration than in 
any of our proclamations of theories. For, after all, you can never judge 
the merit of any plan until you see it in actual operation in the lives of 
those who believe it. 

This Church has survived all this opposition and stands today 
making its greatest progress, outranking other churches so far as its per- 
centage of growth and increase is concerned, showing a vitality no other 
church has equalled so far as I know. No other church in this land has 
been engaged in building churches as this Church has been during the 
past few years. It is attracting the attention of the people of the world. 
But there is something here that is vital, something that holds men 
in times of trial, supports them in the face of mobs, sustains them in 
pilgrimages across the plains, keeps them loyal under all these circum- 
stances and now, in the day of prosperity, can still hold its membership. 

My soul rejoices, therefore, in the great undertaking which the 
Church has set for itself, to demonstrate that the plan of our Father in 
Heaven is capable of meeting and solving economic problems of the poor 
and the unfortunate by the vigorous application of those principles which 
the Lord revealed to the Church in the very beginning. 

When I think of the difficulties in the world to amalgamate people 
into a brotherhood, I realize we have reached a time when we are about as 
far away from brotherhood as the world has been in a long time, because 
each nation is thinking only of itself and within each nation are groups 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



89 



that are affiliated for selfish interests. How difficult it was in the days 
of Christ to amalgamate the Jew and the Gentile, and yet it was the 
prayer, one of the last prayers of the Master when he said, as he prayed, 
that they all, his disciples, "may be one as thou, Father, art in me and I 
in thee, that they may also be one in us, that the world may believe that 
thou hast sent me." 

BROTHERHOOD IN THE CHURCH 

It was the plan and purpose of the Christ and his Church to make 
men brothers, no matter what their nationality, to bring them into a broth- 
erhood and a fraternity. I rejoice when I see what has happened in this 
Church in the gathering of the people from all nations, even as the old 
Prophets saw them come — one of a city and two of a family, and from 
every nation — to the "mountain of the Lord's house," to here be amalga- 
mated into a brotherhood the like of which has never been witnessed in the 
history of this world before, among the peoples of Europe and America, 
save it was in the days of the Nephites, when they too had a brotherhood 
for a long period of time. But here we are assembled in this house, Eng- 
lish, Irish, Danish, Scotch, all nationalities, into a brotherhood. I am sure 
that it is the purpose of the Church tjf Christ to create such a brother- 
hood. 

I read in the Doctrine and Covenants these words from one of the 
revelations, section 38, verses 24 to 27 : 

Let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and 
holiness before me. 

And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself. 

For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of 
them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou 
clothed in robes and sit thou here ; and to the other : Be thou clothed in 
rags and sit thou there — and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just? 

Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. 
I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine. 

Thank the Lord that we are moving toward that glorious picture 
wherein brotherhood is accentuated. The revelation of the Lord does 
not indicate that he has taken up either the side of the rich or the poor, 
and certainly he is opposed to selfishness and to class distinctions and to 
groups interested only in themselves. Let me read, from the fifty-sixth 
section, what the Lord has to say concerning both groups : 

Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, 
for your riches will canker your souls ; and this shall be your lamentation 
in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation : The harvest 
is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved! 

But on the other hand: 

Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits 
are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are 
not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full 
of greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands ! 

But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I am sure that in perfect harmony with this revelation I could add "and 
blessed are the rich, too, who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, 
whose spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God coming 
in power and great glory unto their great deliverance." 

OBLIGATION UPON RICH AND POOR 

This indicates an obligation upon both groups toward each other, 
the rich and the poor. While the Lord provided an abundance for the 
needs of his sons and daughters when he created the earth, nevertheless 
he knew that some would be more frugal and saving and wiser in their 
accumulation of the things of this world, and others would be careless 
and indifferent and would soon come to want. There seems to be some- 
thing essential in the Lord's plan to preserve human life, and that even 
though some may be careless and not frugal and saving, they too shall 
have food and shelter and clothing. 

You will find the following recorded in the Book of Mormon, 
Mosiah fourth chapter and seventeenth to nineteenth verses. 

Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his 
misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him food, nor 
impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punish- 
ments are just. 

But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great 
cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he 
perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God. 

■ For, behold, are we not all beggars ? Do we not all depend upon this 
same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food 
and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we 
have of every kind? 

That is in harmony with another scripture that says it is far better 
to feed nine unworthy ones than to allow one to go hungry and in want. 

The Lord has therefore set up a plan by which those who have 
may give to the assistance of those who have not. In the 104th section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, which we have quoted often during 
the last year, as we have visited you in the stakes of Zion, we read: 

Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, 
and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the 
poor and the needy, he_ shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being 
in torment. 

The Lord's provision is not to take from a fellowman that which 
he possesses, against his will, but with his whole heart and in the spirit 
of love for his brother he gives his tithes and his offerings that there 
may be sufficient to care for the unfortunate, for the needy and for 
those in distress. 

LOYALTY WILL BRING SUCCESS 

The way the Church has responded to the appeals that have been 
made has filled my heart with joy. It is wonderful what has been ac- 
complished. Yet not all of us have participated, and we can go farther 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



91 



than we have gone. I am sure that if we shall go forth with a resolve 
that we can reach a minimum of one dollar per capita with Fast Offer- 
ings, it is possible for every stake and every ward to achieve this. Do 
not, however, regard it as a maximum amount. That is the standard 
for the poorest families in the Church, a dollar per capita. It should 
rise from that according to the standard of the living of the membership 
of the Church. Oh, that every man in this Church would pay his honest 
tithing ; what we could do ! Thank the Lord we have loyal men that are 
doing this. God touch the hearts of those who haven't the vision yet 
to see how important it is for them to make their contribution, thus 
establishing right and claim for an eternal inheritance for themselves 
in the kingdom of God, paying their rent to the Lord, their honest debt 
to him, and providing the means sufficient to care for the unfortunate 
and the needy, and supporting great movements of the Church. 

We must keep our eye upon these grand objectives. As the brethren 
have said, the Church has never set its hand to undertake anything more 
important than the attempt to solve this great problem. Now we have 
selfish interests to combat. I am sure in the world there is a spirit that 
would array group against group, class against class, but it must not 
find its place in this Church. 

ADVICE TO THE POOR 

You poor brethren, what shall you do ? You must make your con- 
tribution. You must not become greedy, nor filled with complaint, nor 
as the Lord said, having your eyes full of greediness and refusing to 
labor, you stand as condemned before the Lord as the rich who will not 
give to your help if you exhibit that spirit of selfishness, and covetous- 
ness, and of idleness. You must make your contribution so that you 
too may get that spirit of brotherhood and not have in your hearts hatred 
toward those who are well to do. The spirit that is rampant in our coun- 
try must not find its way into the hearts of Latter-day Saints and get 
themselves filled with such a venom toward wealth and toward large 
interests that they engage in the unlawful practices that are so common 
elsewhere. Latter-day Saints should be distinguished as men that obey 
and honor and respect the law. I am sure that so far as the masses of 
the people are concerned, the world never had such blessings and ad- 
vantages. Let me call your attention to the fact that, so far as the 
masses are concerned, we are all of us in a more fortunate condition than 
the world has ever known. It is true that in this age of science and 
invention wealth can be accumulated faster today than ever before in 
the history of this world. Originally it was secured by the enslaving 
of human labor, and the profit went to the master and lord who supervised 
his people in the state of semi-slavery. We have no longer in the in- 
dustrial world the slavery of men, but machinery that takes the place 
of men and makes it possible for wealth to be accumulated, I say, faster 
than at any period in the history of the world, but let us not f e,el because 
we have not all become millionaires that we are a group discredited and 
that we are not getting our fair deal.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BLESSINGS COMMONLY ENJOYED 

I remember as a boy there were three men in Logan who possessed 
a surrey, a team and a man to drive the outfit, and when they turned 
out we looked with almost envious eyes upon it and longed that we 
might have such a display of joy and satisfaction to travel about as these 
our fortunate brethren. When I go to Cache Valley today I find ninety 
percent of all the farmers and brethren in Cache Valley owning an auto- 
mobile that cost more than that team and surrey. That is the blessing that 
has come to the common people that once only the rich knew. 

In 1900 not one family in one hundred owned a horse and a buggy. 
Today three out of four have cars. One family in thirteen had a tele- 
phone. Now one family in two have telephones, and that is only thirty- 
seven years ago. Modern plumbing and central heating were luxuries. 
Less than five hundred thousand homes had electricity in 1900. Radio 
and electrical refrigeration were unknown. Today twenty-one million 
homes are wired for electricity. Seven million families own electric 
refrigerators ; twenty-two million have radios ; blessings that kings did 
not know anything about. So we are all of us participants in the greater 
blessings that have come, and if we have not become wealthy and inde- 
pendent and ready to go onto easy street, we are enjoying blessings 
beyond any generation that has ever lived. 

Now then, brethren and sisters, let the spirit that was in our fathers, 
that prompted them to make sacrifice, also inspire us to help our brother 
and our sister. 

EPISODE FROM FATHER'S JOURNAL 

I was reading my father's journal recently and an early episode 
mentioned was his response to a call from President Young. My father 
was a bishop in Cache Valley when a call came for volunteers to go down 
to the Missouri River. There were five hundred eighty souls stranded 
and unable to come to the valleys of the mountains and somebody had 
to go and help them. My father writes, "I did not have the heart to call 
for the six men allotted to my ward, unless I responded first." So he 
became the first volunteer ; left his farm in the care of his brethren, took 
his two ox teams, drove down to the Missouri river, assisted in bringing 
the five hundred eighty, and paid his own way; never received a dol- 
lar for it, though it required six months to accomplish it. The joy that he 
had in having done something for some of his unfortunate brethren and 
sisters was pay enough. From those five hundred eighty, countless thou- 
sands have come to own their own homes, to live in these valleys 
and enjoy the benefits of this wonderful land and privileges within 
the Church. Let that spirit, therefore, be in the hearts of all of our breth- 
ren and sisters today, the spirit of brotherhood. 

TROUBLE IN NATIONS OF WORLD 

My brethren and sisters, I am also exceedingly anxious that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints shall not only distinguish themselves in this spirit of 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



93 



brotherhood, that we love our brethren, but that we love them sufficiently 
to save them from humiliation and from sorrow and distress that will 
come unless we assist them in the solution of their economic problems. 
I am also anxious that we shall distinguish ourselves in a time when the 
whole world seems to be running wild with a spirit of change. When 
the war' had ended, many of us rejoiced to see nation after nation abandon 
monarchial forms of government and establish democracies, and, we 
thought, this is truly the beginning of the golden age for the world. Then 
we discovered with sorrow that there was much lacking to prepare the 
nations, that had been for ages under kings and monarchies, to be ready 
for a democracy. They could not stand the trial of poverty and dis- 
tress, and capitalizing upon the people's distresses there arose leaders 
that overthrew these democracies and they established dictatorships that 
will not bring this world to its peace, nor will they liberate these people 
but will enslave them, and they will never go forward under the plan of 
either communism or fascism that robs men of their liberties, of their 
property and political rights. 

America's destiny 

My brethren and sisters, as we see them, therefore abandoning 
these democracies the whole attention of the world is focused upon the 
great democracy of the world, America. Shall it stand ; shall it survive ? 
Yes, because the Lord God of Heaven has established it. I am not 
afraid of outside enemies. All the perils that threaten this country 
shall be from within. There shall never come any disaster nor distress 
that shall destroy America from the outside, if the peoples of this land 
shall rally to the standards established by our fathers, and maintain the 
stability of the Constitution and the law, and the order established in this 
land wherein our fathers long ago agreed that the will of the majority 
expressed in laws shall be obeyed by the minority. 

God help us as Latter-day Saints to be found still standing by these 
standards and loyally supporting the law and order and the great de- 
mocracy established here, that it may live for the blessing of all flesh, as 
the Lord has decreed it ; for after days of sorrow and trial and dictator- 
ships, the world will be prepared, by and by, for the fruits and the bless- 
ings of the democracy that shall survive in America. 

THE KINGDOM OF GOD TO BE ESTABLISHED 

Yes, I agree that there are troublesome times, days of sorrow and 
distress ahead of the world, and that the devil is in the world grasping 
to maintain his power, yet the Lord God of Heaven has established his 
kingdom, and he is in the world with it, and it shall be triumphant and 
victorious. The Lord help us to adhere to these glorious principles, and 
we shall fulfil the prophecies of old wherein they declare that the ends of 
the world, the east and the west and the north and the south shall say, 
"Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of 
the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in 
his paths."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Zion arise and shine. Thy day hath come. 

God help us to prove to -a world that is doubtfuland skeptical about 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that in the real Gospel, restored with its 
power and its authority, there is a virility and strength sufficient to 
meet and to solve human problems, and let us go gloriously toward our 
destiny, as the Lord hath pointed it out, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

It is indeed a pleasure to join the Latter-day Saints in this great 
Conference again. I have been inspired by the beautiful music and by 
the clarity with which the principles of the Gospel have been presented 
to us by our President, and by the General Authorities of the Church. 

I am happy to see the feeling of friendship and social fraternity 
that exists among our Latter-day Saints. I think its equal cannot be 
found in any other group in the world. It is based on what Jesus called 
a mark of a true disciple, when in speaking to his Apostles he said: 

By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have 
love one to another. 

You faithful Latter-day Saints in the stakes of Zion are preaching 
the Gospel beautifully to the world. The broadcasts from this historic 
building and organ, the fine sermonettes that come from Brother Evans, 
your work on the Social Security Program, have reached people in 
Eastern Canada and touched their hearts, who have never heretofore 
found interest in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

This letter came to me this morning. It was directed to the Temple 
grounds here, and forwarded to me by Brother Peery. It suggests what 
some of these things are doing in the world. The letter is from a young 
college student, who takes her Bachelor's degree this spring from the 
Farmington Normal State School of Maine, and says, in part: 

I saw the March of Time the other night, telling how you have been 
meeting the economic difficulties there. I was fascinated with it. Living 
here in the east, I have never contacted real historical information con- 
cerning the Mormons, and now I would like very much to know some- 
thing of their history. 

On my recent tour of the mission, when I reached St. John, New 
Brunswick, a city where we had been unable to make many contacts or 
get much favorable newspaper work done, a reporter called and asked me 
if I had anything that would interest the people of St. John, after he 
has asked me what my mission was. I told him that I felt that I did 
have something that would interest the people of St. John, and would 
be glad to give it to him if he would come to my room. He came and I 
gave him some of the facts about the Social Security Program, something 
of the way it had worked out. Then he said : "That sounds like a fairy 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



95 



story." When I assured him that it was the truth he said : "It is won- 
derful. I have not heard anything like it. But," he said, "how do you 
get your people to do those things ?" I was pleased to tell him that the 
secret of the response lay in the fact that the membership of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints look upon their President as a 
prophet of God, who speaks the will of God to his people. 

The same spirit of friendliness and love so manifest in the gathering 
of the Latter-day Saints here is found in the branches of the Church in 
the world, which indicates that the secret lies, not in people or in their 
place of residence, but in the principles of the restored Gospel. This 
knowledge gives zest to missionary work : to realize fully that the mes- 
sage of the Gospel gives purpose to life, and enthusiasm for living, an 
interest in the welfare of other people, resulting in the growth and 
happiness of the individual, gives courage to the missionary to carry on 
even under many discouragements. 

The missionaries throughout our mission are well, and are a happy 
group, thoroughly enjoying their work. They are fine examples of what 
the Gospel does for people. Their buoyant happiness, their courage and 
kindly interest in the welfare of the people teach well the fruits of 
Mormonism. You parents are to be congratulated on the home training 
of these fine young men and women. 

It is my opinion that none of our fine institutions can take the place 
of the home in training young people in the formation of ideals and 
correct attitudes. If missionaries come into the field with the right at- 
titude and ideals, and if they have been taught the value of unselfish 
service, and have grown up in a home where reverence has been shown 
for the Gospel, and where its principles have been practiced, they have 
that which makes them successful missionaries. 

If they can have added to these fine essentials some definite knowl- 
edge of the Gospel principles, they are so much better equipped for their 
work. Many come to us knowing but little of the Gospel, and little of the 
art of meeting people. I have sometimes wondered if in our homes, as 
Latter-day Saints, we could not do more by way of teaching the Gospel 
to these young people, that they might come to this important work just 
a little better prepared. 

Missionaries who have some definite training in music, public speak- 
ing and reading, have opportunities to meet clubs and social groups, that 
help very materially in getting our message before people in such fashion 
that they will listen. 

On reaching the mission field the missionary is thrown largely on 
his own resourcefulness and initiative. This causes him to study with 
a definite purpose, and creates in him a humility and a dependence upon 
God, that accounts largely for the marvelous growth that he makes 
during the mission period. 

These lines from Ella Wheeler Wilcox well characterize, I think, 
the life of the missionary, wherein she says: 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Lean on thyself until thy strength is tried, 
Then ask God's help, it will not be denied. 
Use thine own sight to see the way to go ; 
When darkness falls ask God the path to show. 
Think for thyself and reason out thy plan ; 
God has his work, and thou hast thine. 
Exert thy will and use self-control 
God gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul. 
All thy immortal powers bring into play ; 
Think, act, strive, look up and pray. 

No matter what our station in life, the blessings of the Gospel are 
dependent upon our individual response to it. Its blessings and promises 
and requirements have remained much the same throughout the ages, and 
the joy and happiness based on its principles have been enjoyed only by 
those who have made the Gospel a living, active part of their daily lives. 

Speaking through 'the writer of the book of Revelation, the Master 
commended the Saints for much of their fine living, and then he made 
these promises to the seven churches, and I believe they have eternal 
values : 

To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is 
in the midst of the paradise of God, and . . . 
He shall not be hurt of the second death. 

And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him 
will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule them. . . . 

He that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I 
will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name 
before my Father and before his angels 

Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, 

and then finally he concludes by saying: 

I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be 
rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed . . . and anoint thine 
eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. 

The present condition of the world indicates that the Latter-day 
Saints should see the necessity of the possession of this gold that has 
been tried in the fire, and of this salve with which to anoint our eyes. 
Within the Gospel principles is found the gold that has been tried in the 
fire, and in the inspiration of our leadership and the authority of the 
Priesthood and the blessings of the Holy Ghost is this salve with 
which to anoint our eyes, that we may see, and seeing, find the way to 
peace, security and happiness. 

I am happy in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My testimony and love 
for it grow as, I see its influence on people. 

May the Lord bless our leaders and us, that each of us may do 
fully our part of this great work, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The Singing Mothers and the congregation sang the hymn, "Prayer 
is the Soul's Sincere Desire." 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



97 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the Eirst Council of the Seventy 

Recently I had the pleasure of visiting the Texas Mission. President 
Peterson was ill and has since been released to return home. It is 
regrettable that it becomes necessary every once in a while to release 
missionaries on account of the condition of their health. 

President and Sister Peterson have certainly done excellent work in 
the Texas Mission. They have the love and confidence of the Saints and 
the missionaries. The Saints have been greatly blessed by the Lord in 
having such fine people to preside over them. 

There were two things that interested me particularly while in the 
mission field. The first was the integrity and the good spirit manifested 
by the Saints in trying to do what they could in preaching the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. They are interested in having the message go to other 
people, and they give of their time, and their energy, and their money, in 
order that they may be helpful in the progress of the Lord's work here 
upon the earth. 

In one field I found a man, formerly from Wyoming, who, in order 
to go to Sunday School, found it necessary to travel thirty miles each 
way. He got into his car with his family, and as they proceeded up the 
valley they picked up other members of the Church and drove thirty miles 
in order to worship the Lord on the Sabbath day . 

I not only had the privilege of attending the district conferences, 
but I had the opportunity of visiting in some of the very small towns 
where the missionaries have been sent to labor, and where they had 
found some investigators, and where a few Saints live. 

In going to one of these very small places the presiding Elder of 
that district asked me if I would accept an invitation to eat in the hqme 
of one of the Saints. I told him I would be very delighted to visit among 
the people. He said, "Well, Brother Taylor, I would like to say this, 
before you accept the invitation, the place where you are going is a very 
humble home, and they haven't been blessed with all of the comforts that 
other people have been blessed with." I told him I would like to go and 
would be delighted to visit with them. 

When I went to this home it was indeed a very humble place, with 
but few of the usual comforts that men and women are entitled to. 
When I went into the house I found that one of the men was very much 
interested in carrying the message of the Gospel to other people and had a 
supply of tracts. He would go out in the day time and perform his 
usual labor, and then at night he would go out and leave tracts and do 
regular missionary work among the people. 

When we sat down to a meal, it was very humble, but good. The 
table was small, and it was necessary for some of the family to stand 
up. Because I was visiting among them they went out and purchased 
a few cup cakes. I am doubtful whether they had had cup cakes in the 
house for a long time. 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



In the course of our conversation, this good man who was doing so 
much for the Church, and loved those who had been appointed to preside 
in certain places in the Church, said that tomorrow he and his brother 
expected to lose their jobs, and yet he was entertaining me as one of the 
servants of the Lord, and also going out day and night in order to 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As I traveled among the people I 
found the same spirit, a spirit of sacrifice and of helpfulness. 

The other thing that came to my attention was the attitude of the 
people toward the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or toward Christianity in 
general. They still have the same opinions that they had in the days 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that as long as they have a desire to 
worship the Lord and are doing the best they can, eventually the Lord 
will take care of them when they get on the other side. So to them the 
Gospel only means doing some of the finer things that men and women 
should do, and somehow they just cannot understand that in religion 
there must be a certain way of worshiping God the Eternal Father, a 
right way, a correct way. 

It seems to me that in this enlightened age when perhaps we think 
better and reason better, the people of the world ought to be able to 
understand that if there is a right way of doing everything else on the 
earth, that there could only be one right way of worshiping God. 

You remember when Joseph Smith, as a boy, had been to church and 
had gone home to reason things out for himself, that even he, as a young 
boy, could see and understand that there must be a certain way of 
worshiping God. In his reasoning he said : "I will go and ask the Lord 
which of all the churches is right." He also said: "Or are they all 
wrong together?" He could see that there must be a right way, a true 
church on the earth, or else perhaps that all the churches might be wrong. 

If the Prophet Joseph Smith, as a boy, could reason that way, it 
seems to me that other men and women, with the intelligence and develop- 
ment that they have, ought to be able to understand that God also has a 
correct way of worshiping Him. If they think they can find this way by 
reading the Bible, they will be disappointed because the Bible isn't com- 
plete enough for anyone to find the correct way. There are too many 
things in the Bible that are not plain and will not explain the way of the 
Lord in its fulness. 

When the Lord spoke to Joseph Smith, He did not send him to 
the Bible and say: "Organize my Church and develop it, and use the 
Bible for your standard." That was not sufficient. Joseph Smith could 
not have done it, because the holy scriptures, as we have them today, are 
not sufficiently clear in many details. So the Lord gave Joseph Smith 
the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine and 
Covenants, in order to avoid the confusion that had resulted from men 
trying to organize a church with only the Bible as their guide. 

Even in our day, with the four standard works of the Church, we 
are not successful in our worship of the Lord, without our prophets, 
seers and revelators to receive inspiration and revelation from God day

by day, in order that we may constantly know the Lord's mind and will 
concerning us. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters, and help us to 
appreciate the Gospel and the fine things that have come to us, that we 
may serve him in spirit and in truth, I pray, in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

My very dear brethren and sisters, I deeply and sincerely appre- 
ciate the opportunity of mingling with you in this great Conference. I 
believe that perhaps I appreciate it more greatly due to the fact that after 
having been here continuously for three years or two years and a half, 
I was unable to attend the last Conference, and thus I come this morning 
to this Conference with a renewed interest, having realized what it means 
to be absent. 

I sincerely and humbly pray, this morning, for an interest in your 
faith and prayers, that I may be guided in what few words I say and 
what little time I occupy, to say something that will be of benefit to all 
of you, and that will help us, as members of this great Church, to more 
fully discharge our responsibilities to the world. 

Sister Pratt and I are greatly enjoying our labors in Mexico, for 
since the division of the mission in July of last year we have moved our 
headquarters to Mexico City, and we are greatly enjoying our labors 
there. There is just one point of regret, and that is that this move 
prohibits us from enjoying the association of the great number of the 
youth of Zion who came and labored with us in the border states, among 
the Mexican people ; for in Mexico we are not permitted to bring mission- 
aries from the stakes of Zion, and our few missionaries are made up 
of young people from the Juarez Stake and from the membership of 
the mission itself. We feel thus that we are deprived of a great pleasure 
in association with a cross section of the youth of Zion coming from the 
different stakes. 

We have been told during this Conference, my brethren and sisters, 
of the picture that seems to be forecast as to conditions in the world and 
what is about to happen. This is a rather gloomy picture. Perhaps we 
who are in foreign missions — I might say especially in Mexico, where the 
connection with Spain at the present time brings the battlefield so very 
close — see and realize the possibilities of the development of this gloomy 
chaotic picture that has been painted for us. We realize that it can, 
with very great difficulty, be averted. The world seems bound headlong 
for a chaotic, dark state of night, where darkness and confusion indeed 
will, as they in fact do today, cover the nations of the earth. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that we, the Latter-day Saints, have 
a great responsibility in this time of , darkness and confusion, a responsi- 
bility that was given to us in a direct charge by our Master two thousand 
years ago, in which he said : 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour, where- 
with shall it be salted ? * * * 

Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. 

Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a 
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, 
and glorify your Father which is in heaven. 

It has been pointed out to us during this Conference that we have, 
indeed, that which will guide the world in the solution of its problems 
today, and as you cast about over the world you will find nowhere else 
this light that can lead the world in the solution of its problems. Only 
through our living in accordance with the principles of the Gospel, and 
letting our light so shine that men see our good works, can we be a light 
to the world and help them through this hour of darkness. 

I should like each of you to imagine a great chandelier with hun- 
dreds of thousands of small globes, with a rather intricate, yet, when 
understood, simple design, through which each of those globes is con- 
nected with the main wire which brings the current from the power- 
house, to supply the power for the lighting of those globes. Compare 
this, in your minds, to the organization of the Church. Our Father in 
heaven, the power house, is supplying the power coming to us through the 
medium of his Son Jesus Christ, transmitting it to their representative 
here upon the earth, our prophet, seer and revelator ; through him dis- 
seminated to the General Authorities ; from them to our stake presidents ; 
from the stake presidents to our bishops, or in the missions to the mission 
presidents and to the branch presidents ; through them to the different 
auxiliary heads in the wards and to the block teachers. Thus each of us, 
every member of this Church, if we are in harmony with this organiza- 
tion, may connect our lamp to the source of power, and gain that strength 
and that current which will make our light so shine that men, seeing our 
good works, will come to glorify our Father which is in heaven. 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that we are indeed 
connected with the source of divine power, that will guide us in these 
days of confusion ; and that if we do keep ourselves connected to this 
organization we will each be a light that will shine in our own corner, 
and will guide men in their struggle during these troublous times. 

But if any of us fail to uphold our immediate superiors, if we 
criticise our local officers, if we become out of harmony with them, then 
we shall be cut off from the source of power, and will not shine ; in fact, 
we will be left in darkness. 

It has been my sad experience, during the past year, since I last 
met with you here, to see a group of Saints sever their connection with 
the source of divine power, and to see their lights go out and to see them 
left in darkness; and others, who were depending upon them for the 
light, to lose their way and wander in the wilderness of confusion and 
ignorance. These men did not criticise President Grant. They main- 
tained that they accepted and upheld the General Authorities of the 
Church. But they did not like their district president, and they criticised 



ELDER REUBEN M. WIBERG 



101 



their mission president, and they continued on until they refused to ac- 
cept and uphold and sustain those who were placed over them in that 
locality, and today, as I say, they are left in darkness, to wander in the 
wilderness of apostasy. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that we, as members of the Church, 
will sustain and uphold, support and magnify each and every officer in 
the Church — the General Authorities, beginning with President Grant, 
his counselors, the quorum of the Twelve, the Seven Presidents of 
Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric, the general boards of the auxiliary or- 
ganizations, our stake organizations, our ward organizations — that each 
of us may indeed keep himself connected to that source of divine power 
that will permit our light so to shine that men, seeing our good works, 
will come to glorify our Father which is in heaven, and will find the 
solution, through us, of the problems that face the world today. 

I pray the blessings of our heavenly Father to be with you, to be with 
all of us in the discharge of our respective responsibilities in this great 
plan, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER REUBEN M. WIBERG 

Former President of the Tongan Mission 

If it were possible to get a group such as this one together in the 
Tongan Islands, one could say that he was speaking to nearly fifty per 
cent, of the population. From that you will readily understand that 
Tonga is only a mere spot in the South Seas. One writer, having visited 
that place, put it in words something like this : 

Have you heard of Tonga, 

That lone Pacific realm 

Where a queen rules in splendor, 

By Great Britain's saving grace, 

Where parliament meets biennially only, 

And then just meets to eat? 

It is quite a lengthy little poem, if you would call it that. He 
pictures some of the things that were nevertheless true, but are not true 
at the present time. 

Though it is a very small and perhaps insignificant kingdom, even 
in the legislative set-up and the government, there are many virtues that 
I feel are worthy of mention. 

We are inaugurating a Church Security Program here in our Church, 
and we have already heard in this Conference of comment that has come 
from people outside of the United States, and from prominent men of 
our country, who are not of our faith, who- feel that it is a wonderful 
thing. 

In a smaller sense, perhaps, there is something very remarkable 
about the kingdom of Tonga and its government. All of the land is 
owned by the government. When a young man becomes of the age of 
sixteen he may register at the Minister of Lands office and receive a por- 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tion of land sufficient for his maintenance, even if he has a large family, 
and most of them do. 

Whether or not a person registers for land at that age, he becomes 
taxable, and every person is taxed alike. He may accept that offer of a 
portion of land sufficient for his keep, or he may not. Fortunate for 
the one who accepts it, because if he is in any mood at all to be aggressive 
he can take care of that and much more, and also go into other activities 
as much as he will. 

I am very happy and pleased with this opportunity, my brethren and 
sisters. I didn't think the call would come a second time. It has been 
a year, nearly, since I returned, and I was not in attendance when my 
name was called in the October Conference. 

I would like to say this to the brethren and sisters here assembled, 
respecting the people of Tonga — perhaps on your maps you will more 
readily find this little kingdom under the name of the Friendly Islands — 
when our boys, your sons, go to that field to labor they are among a class 
of the most friendly people, I believe, that I have ever met. I think 
to a great extent the people there are friendly, having overcome their 
prejudice of years past when the work was in its beginning. One would 
be impressed, almost immediately, with the friendliness of that people. 
The missionaries are taken in, even by those who are not of the Faith, 
and even by those who are under restraint by their religious leaders and 
advised not to accept literature or to tolerate the visit of a Mormon Elder, 
but invariably they make the Elders feel welcome. 

During my brief mission there, presiding over that kingdom, as far 
as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is concerned, I made 
a request and the response was almost immediate, and equipment was 
sent there for a visual means of teaching the Gospel, although we don't 
have much electricity in that country, other than that which can be 
obtained from a car battery or some other kind of battery. We rigged up 
and managed to produce little films to show those people some of the 
things that they may never have the opportunity of seeing here at home, 
and also many things that go to prove the divinity of the Book of Mor- 
mon. Although that book is not in print and has not been published in 
that language, they are very familiar with it, because it seems even with 
that handicap the Elders avail themselves of every opportunity to teach 
the contents of that wonderful book. They hope some time, though they 
are very few in number and the cost would be great to publish that book, 
that they may be enabled to assist in bringing it forth in printed form. 

It was also my privilege to labor in that mission at a time when mis- 
sionaries were very scarce, in fact, so scarce at one time that I was the 
only Elder upon the mainland, and there was one Elder in one district of 
that mission 260 miles away. We communicated by mail, which is any- 
thing but speedy in that part of the world. 

During that period it became necessary, as you will understand, to 
call local people into responsible positions to carry on and officiate in the 
work of the Lord. During that period we had twenty-two branch 
presidents, all of them local men. We had three district presidents, all 



ELDER REUBEN M. WIBERG 



103 



of them local men. We had officers and teachers in all of the auxiliary 
organizations, who were local men and women. 

During that period I believe that a keener sense of responsibility 
was felt among the Priesthood of that mission than ever before. In fact, 
when I went into the mission there were a number of branch presidents 
who thought their only responsibility was to conduct the meetings. They 
couldn't tell you how many members they had in the branch where they 
were, or very much about them. They did report that they had held a 
sacramental meeting at such and such a time, regularly every Sunday, and 
that was about all. 

Many of those men developed a sense of responsibility in a short 
time, where they felt that they were actually the father of that little 
branch, and they paid regular visits to their members especially those who 
were delinquent, and the work developed and prospered under their 
leadership. 

President Dunn, who has succeeded me, was a former companion 
upon my first mission in that nation. I almost knew that he would be 
my successor, when I went into the field, and he felt the same, according 
to our correspondence while we were separated, he on this side and I on 
the other side. It was one of the most pleasant days of my life to meet 
Brother Dunn and welcome him into the Tongan Mission, for I know his 
worth and his ability as a leader among that class of people, whom he 
loves and whom I love. I believe that every missionary who goes there, 
unless something is wrong with the missionary, learns to love those people. 

A great deal could be said about that fine mission, even though it is 
the smallest we have, but I feel, my brethren and sisters, that perhaps 
for the one minute that I have left I would like to speak primarily of 
the feeling of the Latter-day Saints there toward the people at home, 
the families of the missionaries, and the General Authorities of the 
Church. 

It is not an infrequent thing, in our little district conferences and in 
our mission conferences, especially when an elder is leaving, that many 
of the officers of the branches, the Relief Society sisters and others, 
will come to the missionary and ask him to convey their heartfelt appre- 
ciation to the Presidency of the Church, to the Twelve Apostles, and to 
the presidents of the organizations, for through the organizations and 
through correspondence and advice that come from the General Author- 
ities, conveyed to them through the mission president and agencies there, 
they feel that they are just as close, I believe, as the people in the 
Western States Mission or in any other mission of the Church here at 
home. 

They are eager to know all of the advances and all of the plans that 
are made by the Church. They have always been found to be willing 
to work in harmony, sustaining the General Authorities of the Church 
and their desires. 

I pray that the Lord may be and abide continuously with those 
people in the South Seas, and that the work may grow and progress. 
It is a comparatively new mission, having been organized in 1917, and a 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



few years after its organization, by legislative act, a law was passed 
forbidding Mormon Elders to enter that kingdom — not only Mormon 
Elders, but any Mormons — and under that handicap, for a period of two 
years we labored without missionaries coming into the field. 

At the time of my departure from that mission in 1925, there were 
only the Mission President and his wife left, with one district president 
and one missionary to preside over each of the other two districts. For- 
tunately, en route to American Samoa, Pago Pago, I met the first incom- 
ing missionary. 

In 1924, almost by means that were uncanny, that legislative act 
was repealed, and Mormons again were granted the liberty to come in. 
They are glad now to have the Elders come in, I assure you, and they 
give us every opportunity that we request. Of course there is that ele- 
ment that inasmuch as the Queen herself is the head of the Church, there 
is somewhat of a feeling of restraint from that source, but it is very little 
heeded by the general population of the country. 

My time has expired. I pray God to bless us, and I do it in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Thirty-seven years ago this day I was sitting upon the bench to my 
right. President Snow sent to me a note, and all that was on it was : 
"I want to see you at 'my office at the close of these services." I had no 
more idea, my brethren and sisters, what President Snow wished of me, 
than I have at this moment how long I shall live. 

I went immediately, at the close of the meeting, to his office, and as 
I entered the door most of the members of the Twelve were in the room, 
and President Snow told me I had been chosen to be one of the quorum 
of Twelve. I had had no previous intimation, so it was a complete sur- 
prise. 

HEARINGS IN SMOOT CASE 

It was just a short time after — two years, I may say — that I was 
elected to the Senate of the United States. There is hardly anybody 
in this audience, or, I was going to say, in the United States, but what 
can remember, if they were of age at that time, what took place. The 
charges that were made against me have been published so often, and I 
am quite sure that every one here knows what they were. I shall not 
take the time to read them. 

Last night I picked up the first volume, (one out of five large vol- 
umes), containing the hearings in what was known as the Reed Smoot 
case. All the powers of the churches of this nation used every effort 
and all the influence that they could bring to bear upon the senators of 
the United States, to have them vote for my expulsion from the Senate. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



105 



SENATOR BEVERIDGE'S INTEREST 

Albert J. Beveridge, a member of the Committee on Privileges and 
Elections, met me often, asking me every conceivable question as to the 
beliefs, the aims and the objects of the Mormon people, what oaths we 
had taken, and everything connected particularly with what is termed in 
the world the "Hierarchy." 

I read last night, out of Volume I of those hearings, many of the 
questions which were asked President Joseph F. Smith, Apostle Lyman, 
and others who were called there to testify. I might add that in all 
those five volumes my name was mentioned very seldom. It was "the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

QUESTIONS ASKED OF MINISTERS 

Later, in the book, "The Young Man and the World," published by 
Senator Beveridge, are questions that were asked of many ministers 
of the United States, and I am going to call your attention to the ques- 
tions that he submitted to not one but hundreds of ministers of the 
gospel. 

"The first question was: Yes or no, do you believe in God the 
Father ; God a person, God a definite and tangible intelligence ; not a 
congeries of laws floating like a fog through the universe ; but God, a 
person in whose image you were made ? Don't argue ; don't explain ; 
but is your mind in a condition where you can answer 'Yes' or 'No' ?" 

Then he continues : "Not a man answered 'Yes.' " Each man wanted 
to explain that the Deity might be a definite intelligence or might not, 
as the case may be ; that the latest thought was much confused on the 
matter, and so forth and so on. 

"The second question: Yes or no, do you believe that Christ was 
the Son of the living God, sent by him to save the world ? I am not asking 
whether you believe that he was inspired, in the sense that the great 
moral teachers are inspired. Nobody has any difficulty about that. But 
do you believe that Christ was God's very Son, with a divinely appointed 
and definite mission, dying on the cross, and raised from the dead ? An- 
swer 'Yes' or 'No.' 

"Again, not a single answer with an unequivocal, earnest 'Yes,' but 
again explanations were offered. In at least half the instances, some or 
most of the answers were that Christ was the most perfect man that the 
world had seen, and humanity's greatest moral teacher. 

"The third question : 'Do you believe that when you die you will 
live again as a conscious intelligence, knowing who you are, and who other 
people are?' 

"Again, not one answer was unconditionally affirmative. 'Of course, 
they were not sure as a matter of knowledge.' 'Of course, that could 
not be known positively.' On the whole, they were inclined to think so, 
but there were very stubborn objections, and so forth and so on." 

"The men to whom these questions were put were particularly high- 
grade ministers. One of 'them had already won a distinguished reputa- 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tion in New York and the New England states for his eloquence and piety. 
Every one of them had had unusual successes with fashionable congre- 
gations. But every one of them had noted an absence of real influence 
upon the hearts of their hearers, and all thought that this same condi- 
tion is spreading throughout the modern pulpit. Yet not one of them 
suspected that the profound cause of what they called the 'decay of 
faith' was not in the world of men and women, but in themselves. 

"How could such priests of ice warm the souls of men? How could 
such apostles of interrogation convert a world ?" 

WITNESSES IN THE SMOOT CASE 

The balance of the chapter is worthy of reading, but I haven't the 
time. This young man at the time was a very popular Senator of the 
United States, and as I read the hearings in my case, and his questions 
that were asked President Joseph F. Smith, when the latter was a witness 
before the Privileges and Elections Committee, I felt in my soul then, 
and you couldn't help it if any one of you were to read the proceedings, 
that what Senator Beveridge wanted to know was why and how the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints held together so well, and 
why its members were willing to sacrifice so much of their time and their 
substance, and were willing to give their lives for the Church, if necessary, 
as shown by the testimonies given, and he felt in his soul that there was 
something greater than the thoughts of man; that there must be some 
power in the Church and that power was manifested in its representatives 
who testified in this case. 

It seemed rather hard at the time, my brethren and sisters, that so 
many of the leading men of the Church were dragged to Washington to 
testify but I get so much comfort out of the fact that though the Com- 
mittee on Privileges and Elections had an idea that was anything but 
favorable to the Mormon people and the Authorities of the Church, I 
know, from the lips of the men constituting the Committee, that the result 
of the hearings and of the visit of the President of the Church and mem- 
bers of the quorum of the Twelve and many other leading men gave a 
complete answer to the false charges that had been made against the 
members of the Church for so many years. 

A STRONG TESTIMONY 

God never requires anything of this people — never has and never 
will — that he is not prepared to help them fulfil, and will overrule all 
things and defeat all enemies that stand in the way of the fulfilment of 
his purposes. 

A wonderful Church is ours ! The power back of it is divine reve- 
lation. Church members are loyal to its institutions. It is not an organiza- 
tion for Sunday only. It enters into every-day life and never should be 
lost sight of in our dealings at home and abroad and in our association 
wherever we may be or go. 

I have never been ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I have 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



107 



never in all my life been placed in a position where I felt that it was 
necessary that I should violate any law, ordinance or commandment of 
God. I never expect to be. 

May God's blessings attend this people, his Church, and may his in- 
fluence and power ever be with President Grant as long as he lives, and 
with the Authorities of the Church from the highest to the lowest, I pray, 
in the name 1 of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The musical numbers for this session of the Conference are being 
furnished by the Singing Mothers, Sister Charlotte O. Sackett, Con- 
ductor. 

We have a telegram from President M. Charles Wood of the New 
Zealand Mission in which he says the Saints and missionaries send 
Arohanui (great love) and greetings to assembled Saints in Zion. 

An anthem, "Lamb of God," was sung by the Singing Mothers, Mar- 
garet Summerhays, soloist. 

Elder Hyrum T. Moss, President of the Rigby Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference was held at 2 o'clock p. m., 
Tuesday, April 6, 1937. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers provided the musical numbers 
for this meeting. 

An anthem, "How Lovely are Thy Messengers" (Mendelssohn), 
was sung by the Singing Mothers. 

Elder Wilf ord G. Edling, President of the Hollywood Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The Singing Mothers sang "O Morn of Beauty." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of,the Council of the Twelve Apostles 
I shall read four verses from the 53rd chapter of Isaiah : 

Surely'he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did 
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our 
iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his 
stripes we are healed. 

All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his 
own way ; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth ; 
he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers 
is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. 

I shall depart from this text for a moment to say that I am happy 
in the fact that my faith, my feelings, and spirit have been in complete 
accord with all that has gone before, in the various sessions of this Con- 
ference, particularly in the selection of Brother Albert E. Bowen to fill 
the vacancy in the Council of the Twelve Apostles. 

BEARS TESTIMONY 

I am very thankful to the Lord for the Gospel and its blessings 
which I have received. I am thankful for the knowledge I have of this 
great plan of life and salvation; thankful for the evidences that God 
has provided by which to prove its truth, and for the testimony which I 
have received. 

I know that this work in which we are engaged is the work of the 
Lord, the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ ; that which was instituted 
in the councils of heaven before the world was. It is the power of God 
unto salvation to all those who are obedient unto its laws and ordinances, 
and through the atonement wrought out by our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ which makes effective all the ordinances of the Gospel ad- 
ministered in his name and by his authority for the salvation of the 
souls of men. 

I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, I know that those 
who have succeeded him in the presidency of this Church have been 
prophets of God to this Church and to the world, including the present 
president of the Church. I know that those who shall come after will be 
called of God, and that this work will ultimately triumph, and the king- 
doms of this world shall become the kingdoms of his Son, and Christ 
our Lord will reign upon the earth. 

LIVING FOR OUR FAITH 

Now I feel to quote to you, brethren and sisters, a little poem which I 
think is germane to the text I have chosen. I do not remember the 
name of the author but it reads as follows: 

So he died for his faith. That is fine — 

More than most of us do. 
But say, can you add to that line 

That he lived for it too? 

In his death he bore witness at last 

As a martyr to truth. 
Did his life do the same in the past 

From the days of his youth? 

It is easy to die. Men have died 

For a wish or a whim — 
For bravado or passion or pride, 

Was it harder for him ? 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



109 



But to live; every day to live out 

All the truth that he dreamt, 
While his friends met his conduct with doubt. 

And the world with contempt. 

Was it thus that he plodded ahead 

Never turning aside? 
Then we'll talk of the life that he led— 

Never mind how he died. 

A LIFE OF INTENSE SUFFERING 

In the songs that, have been composed, as far as my memory serves 
me, there has been but very little said about the suffering of our Lord 
during his life up to the time of his betrayal into the hands of his enemies 
prior to his crucifixion. But as I understand it, brethren and sisters, his 
whole life, particularly from the time he began his ministry, was one of 
suffering, intense mental suffering. The bearing of the sins of the world 
must have been a tremendous load. I think that no mortal man can 
comprehend it fully, or write it or speak it. We may never know in 
this life. 

Mosiah, in the Book of Mormon, tells us that the angel of the Lord 
talked with King Benjamin and showed him certain things that would 
take place centuries later, pertaining to the coming forth of our Redeemer, 
and the atonement. I shall read two or three verses from the third 
chapter of Mosiah which tells a wonderful story: 

For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, 
the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to 
all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and 
shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working 
mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame 
to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing 
all manner of diseases. 

And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts 
of the children of men. 

And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, 
and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death ; for 
behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the 
wickedness and the abominations of his people. 

Christ's mental anguish 

This was fulfilled in the Savior's life as recorded in Luke 22:44, 
which reads as follows: 

And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as 
it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 

Jesus not only died for his faith and for us but he lived for it 
too, and for us he endured mental and bodily pain and anguish of soul 
beyond the power of mortal man to understand or to endure. The 
angel told King Benjamin that the suffering of our Lord as experienced 
in Gethsemane was due to the wickedness and abominations of the 
people. This was because he loved them so, his love being perfect.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Elder James E. Talmage, in his book, "Jesus The Christ," tells us 
that it was his belief that our Savior died from a broken heart. If the 
wickedness of those for whom he suffered and died was the cause of his 
extreme suffering, we might ask, how far are we responsible, and what 
is the measure of our guilt? 

HE DIED FOR REDEMPTION OF ALL 

Jesus Christ, our Savior, suffered and died for the sins of the 
world, for those who lived contemporary with him, for those who lived 
before, and for those who come after, that all men might be redeemed 
unconditionally from the effects of the Fall of Adam and Eve, from 
death, through the resurrection. 

For since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of 
the dead, for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 
(I Cor. 15:21, 22.) 

Also that all mankind might be saved from the effects of their in- 
dividual sins by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space 
there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth 
whereon these may dwell; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. (Abraham 3 :24-2S.) 

TO AVOID THE JUDGMENTS 

If this people are to be delivered from the judgments which are to 
be poured out upon the earth, by keeping all the commandments ; and if 
we are not to be delivered from the judgments unless we do, as we have 
been told in a former session of this Conference would be the case, is it 
right that those who do keep the commandments should be made to suffer 
because of the unworthiness, or lack of keeping the commandments on 
the part of some of us ? We owe it to others, to the Church and to the 
Lord that we keep all the commandments, and that we avoid sin and evil 
of every form. May the Lord give us strength and power so to do, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 

President of the Spanish- American Mission 

I am indeed happy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you on this 
wonderful occasion. I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with me, 
that I may say something of profit to all of us. I believe that the prayer 
that was offered at the beginning of this meeting was offered in my behalf, 
as I had been praying very fervently for many days that I would have 
strength and guidance on this occasion. 

As I have sat through the sessions oLthis Conference I have thrilled 
to the inspiration that has come through our leaders, to the instructions 



ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 



111 



and the voice of warning that has been raised here to the people of Zion. 
It is my prayer that we as a people will heed this counsel, that we will take 
this advice, and that we will accept this voice of warning to the people, 
that we may escape in a measure the judgments that are to come upon 
the nations of the earth. 

It is a pleasure to represent this Church and people in the world, 
to declare the Gospel of peace, a Gospel whose principles will save the 
human race and to whose shelter those who are world-worn and weary 
with the cares and burdens of this life can come for peace and for rest. 
We can say to them with assurance that if they will accept the principles 
of this Gospel and adhere to them they will find rest and peace from the 
calamities that may come upon this world, because when a man or a 
woman is at peace with himself or herself, it matters little what goes on 
about them. They know in their own souls and their own hearts that they 
are like a ship in a safe and sheltered harbor and that they will be able to 
weather the storms that rage in the open seas all about them. I pray 
that this will be the lot of the Latter-day Saints. 

Running through my mind during part of the sessions of this Con- 
ference has been the admonition given to this people at the commencement 
of the work by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and in connection with that 
the statement of the Lord to ancient Israel wherein he said, "Surely the 
Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants 
the prophets." My brethren and sisters, we have been warned in this 
Conference. That prophecy has been fulfilled to us, and we will be pro- 
tected if we accept that warning. 

In connection with what has been said regarding opposition within 
the Church itself, and some of its membership opposing the things that 
are said and done by our leaders, I would like to raise the warning voice 
by means of the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith himself on this 
subject. We read in Church history from the sayings of the Prophet 
regarding this thing, when he charged the Saints not to follow the example 
of the adversary in accusing the brethren, and said : 

If you do not accuse each other God will not accuse you. If you have 
no accusers you will enter heaven, and if you follow the revelations and 
instructions which God gives you through me, I will take you into heaven 
as my back-load. If you will not accuse me I will not accuse you. If you 
will throw a cloak of charity over my sins, I will over yours — for charity 
covereth a multitude of sins. 

Following this same line of thought, on apostasy and the judgments, 
he gives us the following : 

I will give you one of the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom . It is 
an eternal principle that has existed with God from all eternity: That 
man who rises up to condemn others, finding fault with the Church, saying 
that they are out of the way while he himself is righteous, then know 
assuredly, that that man is in the high road to apostasy ; and if he does not 
repent, will apostatize as God lives. The principle is as correct as the one 
that Jesus put forth in saying that he who seeketh a sign is an adulterous 
man, and that principle is eternal, undeviating; and firm as the pillars of 
heaven; for whenever you see a man seeking after a sign you may set it 
down that he is an adulterous man. 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



My brethren and sisters, the Savior set forth the same principle 
many years ago when he was upon the earth, as recorded in Matthew, 7th 
chapter, wherein he said : "Judge not that ye be not judged. For with 
what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged," and he followed it up with 
the sermon on the beam that was in our own eye. I shall read it to give 
it to you correctly : 

Judge not, that ye be not judged. 

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with 
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. 

And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but 
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 

Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote of thine 
eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 

Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and 
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 

I thought of this in connection with the statement of President Grant 
to us, that the thing that needs to concern the Latter-day Saints is that 
they condemn their own selves for their faults and their failings, and that 
if they do this, humbling themselves before the Lord, they would find no 
time to accuse the brethren or to find fault with them. I can testify that 
this is a true principle. I have prayed throughout my life that the Lord 
would magnify within my own eyes my faults and my failings, that they 
would be made large enough to me that it would take my time and my 
attention to correct them and to humble myself before the Lord, and I 
have also prayed while being in positions of trust in the Church, that he 
would clothe my own faults and failings with mercy, that they would 
not be magnified in the eyes of my brethren, that they would not take 
from me my opportunity to do good among my brethren and sisters. 

I wish to thank my Father in heaven for this Gospel, for the leader- 
ship we have in this Church, for the opportunity that I have to serve, 
and for the opportunity that is yours. I am assured that within this 
Church there are opportunities for every member to serve according to 
their capacity and their ability, and that in time the Lord will give unto 
us these opportunities. Our Church is not of the world, and they cannot 
conceive of the ways of the Lord. I am reminded of the verse in 
the song which says we should not judge the Lord by feeble sense. It 
seems rather absurd to the world that we as a people so willingly accept 
responsibility and yet seek for none. 

My brethren and sisters, I thank the Lord for this opportunity, and 
I pray for his blessings upon you, and I do it in the name of his Son 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 
In the days of ancient Athens, when her citizens took pride in the 
culture and art of her greatness, the youth who entered the army were 
required to take an oath before the gods. It read : 

We shall never bring disgrace upon this our city, by any act of 
dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



113 



ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both 
alone and with many. We will revere and obey the city's laws, and do 
our best, to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us, who are 
prone to. annul and set them at naught. We will strive unceasingly to 
quicken the public sense of civic duty. Thus in all these ways, we will 
transmit this city not only not less, but greater, better, and more beautiful 
than it was transmitted to us. 

A hundred and fifty years ago, the founders of our Republic an- 
nounced the sublime truth that men are free and equal. A century and a 
half have rolled away since then, and the history of the world has no 
chapter to compare with the accomplishments of America in that time. 
Standing on Saxon foundations, and inspired by Latin example, we have 
done what no race or nation or age has ever accomplished. The American 
people have founded a Republic on the unlimited suffrage of the millions 
of souls that inhabit this land. They have worked out the problem that 
a man, as God created him, may be entrusted with self-government. 

Our forebears had a virgin continent to conquer. The fundamental 
problems they met with hard work and a faith in. themselves. They had 
inherited from their fathers, the ideals of home-life, freedom of religion, 
the free state, the public school, and the lands of the vast continent 
to till, on which they built their homes. 

No nation has ever had a freer people, and no other nation of history 
has given its citizens the powers of happiness as our Government has 
done. Great wealth has been produced, but that wealth has been used 
to build industries and institutions of learning ; it has been the power 
in the hands of men to build humble homes and beautiful churches, 
and with it all, the ideals of the founders of the Republic have been 
preserved, and America has worshipped at the shrine' of its great men. 

Our Government was "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created equal." America has upheld this 
ideal before the world, and has opened its gates to all peoples of the 
world. Religion has been a forceful factor in our growth, and today 
some two hundred or more Christian sects are attempting to keep alive 
the divine message of the Savior of the world. The light on the hills 
of Judea became our light, and we have had faith in the vision of a 
prophet of ancient Israel : 

_ The secret things belong unto the Lord our God : but those things 
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we 
may do all the words of this law. 

Our Government started out blessed with the rich inheritance of the 
ages. Its future lay before it, and that justice should rule the hearts 
of all its people, the Constitution of the United States was written. The 
influence of our Government has been felt time and time again among 
the nations of Europe, for they have looked to America for the solution 
of their problems. 

A few years ago, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, a great 
event took place. In that simple and dignified room, where the Declara- 
tion of Independence was written and the Constitution of our country 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was adopted, no fewer than twelve nations, through their representatives, 
assembled to make their own solemn declaration of common aims. In 
that sacred room, those nations made public confession of a faith which 
linked them in friendship with this nation. What a solemn occasion! 
The nations of Europe lighting their national fires at the altar of -Ameri- 
can liberty. 

The peoples of the world have entered our gates, and have found 
here a new life and happiness. Never had they been so well cared for ; 
never had they the chance to live and to look up to their God in hallowed 
feeling as they were given in this land. No nation of history has given 
homes to its people as has this our Country. Never has the wealth of land 
been so equitably distributed; never in all time, have so many people 
owned their own homes. With individual opportunity, there has gone 
quite naturally inequality. Inequality is a law of all social life, and to 
try to do away with inequality among men is to substitute tyranny for 
liberty. 

The quality of democracy in America is that it seeks to protect and 
preserve that sovereign right of all people to come to a knowledge of 
their own better selves, and to live their own natural lives. Democracy 
teaches us that it is not wealth that makes happiness, but the wealth of the 
spirit, brought about by the opportunity to work on land and in factory, 
and to enjoy the blessings of church and school. Men may exploit 
honest labor, but such a thing is foreign to American principles. It is 
the wealth of America in the hands of men of vision that has built 
industries, and made it possible for all people to have honest labor, 
and to live honestly before their God. The schools of America, the 
churches, the institutions of higher learning have been closed to no one, 
and the statement of a noted writer on economics that the glory of 
America is that every head of a family is given an opportunity to own 
his home, is true. The peasants of Europe, who lived on bread and wine, 
have found asylum in this land, and the comforts of the humble fire-side. 

This is an age of change. Innovation is the idol of the times. "In 
this age of novelty, many things are made better, and many things are 
made worse. Old errors are discarded, and new errors are embraced." 
Governments feel the same effects in this craze for change. "But the 
experience of all ages," said Daniel Webster on one occasion, "will bear 
us out in saying that alterations of political systems are always attended 
with great danger, for if the Constitution is to be changed, an alteration 
in one part will work an alteration in another." 

Nor are great and striking alterations alone to be shunned. A suc- 
cession of small changes, a perpetual tampering with minute parts, steal 
away the breath, though they leave the body ; for it is true that a Govern- 
ment may lose all its real character : its genius and its temper : without 
losing its appearance. So if we are not careful — very careful — we may 
find our government changed to a despotism, and yet called a Republic. 
It may have all the essential modes of freedom, and yet nothing of the 
essence, the vitality of freedom in it. The form may be left, but the 
spirit and the life will be gone. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



115 



To perpetuate our government, we must cherish and love it. We 
must preserve a correct and energetic tone of morals. After all, liberty 
consists more in the habits of the people, than in anything else. There 
are always men wicked enough to go any length in the pursuit of power, 
if they can find people enough to support them. Ambition of men to 
become dictators must be restrained by the public morality. When such 
men arise, they must find themselves standing alone. 

America will have to suffer the hate and envy of the unappreciative. 
It is a law of life that we only appreciate that which we are ourselves. 
Millions of citizens have never risen to the appreciation of the glory of 
our nation, and therefore they become the fighters and destroyers of 
right. Wrong rules the day, and in time a wrong is felt to be right. It 
all means that education is the only way to reach the ideal in our souls 
of what our Government really means. Did the fathers reach it ? They 
did, but it was through the faith they had in Almighty God. Such faith 
is the great help to true education. 

We are the trustees of a sacred trust. We have been given by 
Providence this Government with all its potentiality, with all its accom- 
plishment, with allots promise. The question should be to every Amer- 
ican: How am I discharging this trusteeship? What am I doing to 
preserve, protect, and perpetuate the ideals of the government in which 
we have such implicit faith ? We have a solemn obligation before us. 

Every American should read the Declaration of Independence, the 
Constitution of the United States, Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg, and 
see for himself whether the American policy; has been a selfish program. 
It has been a program to serve humanity. 

Only the application of the standards of moral excellence can save 
our fundamental ideals. As we look into the future, will it be progress 
or decline ? Let us pray God that it may be progress. But progress will 
never be unless we sacredly preserve our Constitution and hold it as 
the surest vision for liberty and freedom. 

A few days ago, the Christian world celebrated the Easter Day. 
Churches were filled with worshipers, and for the moment, as on the 
Christmas day, men's thoughts were turned to God. The unfortunate 
thing is that the spirit of the day is soon forgotten, and other hopes and 
feelings take grip on the soul. People are not happy, for they miss the 
very things that make for the joy of living. The youth have an aversion 
for hard work ; the mad thirst for pleasure has replaced our sacred home 
life, and the hate of man for man has brought the nations of the earth 
to the verge of war. 

Yet there are forces and truths in the world that may yet be taken to 
awaken a finer conscientiousness in the hearts of mankind, and a more 
sacred belief in the righteousness and justice of the dreams and ideals 
which the Christian world knelt in honor of last Easter Day. We are 
told by St. Mark, the Evangelist, in words of exquisite beauty that : 

When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother 
of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices that they might come 
and anoint him. 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came 
unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 

And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone 
from the door of the sepulchre? 

And when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away ; for it 
was very great. 

And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the 
right side, clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted. 

And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted; Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, 
which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here. 

For all the ills of government ; for all the ills of humanity, in these 
words of St. Mark, there is fundamentally the panacea and the hope 
for humanity. How many millions of the Christian world have rolled 
away the stone from the sepulchre of Jesus Christ, our Lord, and know 
that he has risen as the true and living Christ, whose teachings can 
rejuvenate mankind? The power that rolls away the stone from the 
sepulchre and allows the risen Christ to come forth is contained in the 
words of the Master : 

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy might, mind and 
strength : and thy neighbor as thyself. 

This is the way of mutuality and co-operation in human society. 
It is the Master's way of doing away with hate and fear. It is only 
by the Christian world allowing the Christ to come forth to eternal life, 
that the civilization of the world can be saved. 

If in our thoughts of the resurrection of the Savior of the world 
we could realize more perfectly that he mastered the teaching of the 
Psalmist, "that the statutes of God give wisdom unto the simple, and the 
highest conceivable wisdom to the humblest minds," people's hearts 
would be awakened to a spiritual response, which is so much needed at 
the present time. It was his life that liberated people from the domina- 
tion of deceits, and bestowed upon the race the increasing consciousness 
of the immortality of spiritual values. Every human soul must push 
away the stone from the sepulchre, and know for himself that Christ is 
risen unto life eternal, and in this thought, the new day will be a dawn 
of renewed faith in mankind and in the directive providences of God. 

The Singing Mothers and the congregation joined in singing the 
hymn, "Come, Let us Anew." 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

One hundred and seven years ago today this marvelous and great 
Church was born. Last night as I sat in this building and looked into 
the faces of the congregation which had assembled here for Priesthood 
meeting, I could not help but think perhaps some of those six souls who 
joined the Church on that sixth day of April in 1830 would hardly un- 
derstand and know what was transpiring if they were permitted to be here 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



117 



in our midst today and behold the thousands assembled in one service 
at one place. 

I am astounded constantly at the magnitude of this great work of 
ours. I cannot help but think to what ends of the earth it has not gone 
and to what corners it has not penetrated. Realizing all this there yet 
comes into my heart and my soul this conviction : That perhaps never 
again will I look upon a scene as impressive as the one I beheld last night 
— eight thousand or more men in this building attending the Priesthood 
meeting, and all dedicated and set apart for God's work. 

I do not speak of this splendid body of leaders now before me who 
for three days have been here attending this Conference, for you are the 
leaders of the Church, but I am thinking of what this Church means to 
this great world of ours. I am thinking of the missionaries who have 
reported — the presidents of missions — the advancement of our work, 
and the gladness with which certain members of society whom they come 
in contact with accept their words and express joy at hearing of. this great 
Gospel again restored. Oh yes ! It has reached its arms around the earth. 

And yet, I would like to bring to your attention one thing that is 
close to us at home — one thing that we ourselves within the Stakes of 
Zion now, thank God, have to contend with. 

Less than a year ago the Presidency of the Church and the Quorum 
of the Twelve Apostles, under the inspiration of the Almighty, gave 
to the First Council of the Seventy the task of organizing missions 
within the stakes of Zion. Brethren and sisters, there are 118 stakes of 
Zion, which run from the Pacific ocean (Honolulu, Hawaii) to the 
Eastern borders of this great country of ours, and from Mexico north- 
ward into Canada. 

What has prompted this? Isaiah tells us that certain things would 
occur which God had decreed. They do occur because of what the Lord 
has said and done. This is one of them: 

Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, 
and that bringeth forth an instrument for his own work. 

And, so, within the ranks of this Church I feel that there has been 
inspiration of God upon those who have brought forth this great work. 

Of the 118 stakes of Zion, for your benefit let me say, 112 have either 
been organized into stake missions or are in the process of organization. 
Within our own communities there have been brought into the fold 
of Christ already more than 300 souls who knew not the truth before. 
In addition to this, through this valiant missionary service, upwards of 
600 souls who have known the truth of this Gospel, but who have more 
or less become indifferent (and I want to say that none of us, I fear, 
are free from that) more than 600 of the indifferent ones, have been 
brought again into the Church to renew their activities through the en- 
deavors of the missionaries who proclaim this Gospel in the stakes of 
Zion. And the work is hardly started yet. 

How minutely, how delicately, every part ordained of our Heavenly 
Father fits into this great latter-day institution which he has established — 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these various arms and helps in government, which we behold and taste 
of today. Surely this Church is not too small to reach to every corner 
of the earth, and of a surety the earth is not too big to listen to and 
feel the thrill of conviction from the teachings of the restoration of the 
Gospel which can and will emanate from the voices of our missionary 
brethren and sisters throughout all the earth, as well as in the stakes of 
Ziqn at home. 

The zeal and the pride with which the presidents of stakes and the 
bishops of wards have taken hold of this work stirs the hearts of those 
who are engaged in it, and we feel to thank God for such worthy men. 

May this work go on until it shall accomplish its purpose and may 
we as missionaries in the service of God remain humble and do that 
which God would have us do, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I hope none of you was more shocked at the proceedings of this day 
so far as they concern myself than was I. I have never regarded myself 
as a person of particular consequence, and why I should have been asked 
to assume this responsible position, I do not know. 

In my lifetime I have dreamed many dreams, I have nursed many 
ambitions, but this. was never one of them. I have never coveted, never 
sought, and never desired any preferment in the Church. I have been 
happy all the days of mylife to work in it, and would have been content 
to remain in places where I would not be forced to occupy public position. 
But since the call has come, I do what I have always been taught to do, 
namely, respond, and pledge you that I will give it all my strength. 

The only thing in the world that counts is people. When the creation 
of the world was finished, as the last and crowning act God made man 
to dwell in it, and he gave to him for his use everything that was created, 
and told him that he might exercise dominion over the earth. In all of his 
ministry Jesus was concerned only with people ; nothing else mattered. 

Whatever our position may be, in whatever sphere we labor, we are 
all dedicated to the business of ministering to the welfare of people, trying 
to make mankind rise to the stature of his destiny. That is the province 
of the teacher, and every man in this Church is a teacher. 

I have thought during this day of the occasion when Jesus was led 
to the top of a high mountain, and the tempter told him to look out 
over the world, and promised him that he would give him the world, if 
he would but bow down and serve Satan. There is a beautiful lesson 
in that circumstance, I think, for all -of us who would essay the business 
of teaching others. We need the power to lead men up to high emi- 
nences from which they may see the world, their own positions in it, and 
the destinies that await them if they order their lives aright. If anything 
is needed more than anything else now it is a voice issuing as from the 
top of a high mountain, lifting men's visions to the high level whence it

comes, and revealing to them what there is in the world and what they 
may do in the exercise of their prerogatives and rights in accomplishing 
the world's work. And if we be what we have pretended so long we are, 
then we have that kind of voice. It behooves us only to learn to hear and 
understand it, and govern our walk and conduct by its teachings. 

May God bless us with power to do so, I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

v PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Everybody that we wanted to speak has had a chance to speak, and 
I think that some of the six and seven minute speeches have been among 
the best we have had. There are forty minutes left. I would like about 
fifteen minutes of that time, it will take five or six minutes for the singing, 
and I am willing to divide the remainder of the time with my counselors. 

We shall hear a few words from President Clark, and then from 
President McKay. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

There is nothing certain in this world. Usually Brother McKay and 
myself sit here for two and a half days, more or less, on tenter hooks. 
Then comes our turn, and the Conference is over. This time we have 
been pluming ourselves ever since the first day that we were through. 
Now we find ourselves, near the last moment, asked to say something 
again to you, or at least to try to say something. 

CONFERENCE ADDRESSES INSPIRED OF THE LORD 

My brethren and sisters, I have enjoyed this Conference. I have 
enjoyed the messages that have come to us during this Conference. When 
I was not a member of this group — the presiding group— I used to think 
that perhaps they all got together beforehand, and decided what each 
should say, what each should talk about, because all the speeches of the 
Conference fit in together as a mosaic, making a beautiful picture of in- 
struction, counsel, and advice. It was a great surprise to me to find, 
when I came into the group, that there were no discussions about Con- 
ference talks or a Conference program; that every man was left free to 
follow his own desires in what he should say . No plan or course was 
marked out. Then there came to me, as I am sure there has come to 
you, a more poignant realization that the Lord was in charge of these 
Conferences. The old expression about the keynote speech of the Con- 
ference took on, to me, a different meaning entirely. It was not a speech 
consciously predicting or forecasting what should be said at the Confer- 
ence, but it was the Lord speaking through his chosen and anointed one, 
giving a thought and direction to the things that should be said . Therein 
lies the responsibility, my brethren and sisters, of those whom you have 
called to fill these high and sacred places of authority.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



RESPONSIBILITY OF SAINTS TOWARDS THOSE WHO SPEAK 

It is our responsibility so to live that when the Lord shall indicate 
through the one whom he has chosen to' direct his affairs upon this earth 
the line and direction which should be taken, that we shall be able to 
follow on, we who hold positions of lesser trust and responsibility in the 
Church. 

I often say, and thoroughly believe, that whenever an Elder of the 
Church stands up to speak to the people, the responsibility as to whether 
or not he shall say that which the Lord would have him say is not wholly 
his. No member of the Church who sits before him but has the obliga- 
tion to exert his power in prayer that those things may be said which 
shall benefit those to whom the Elder speaks. Furthermore, that respon- 
sibility carries back beyond the mere coming to the meeting, or the mere 
attitude in the meeting ; it carries back to the character of life which every 
Latter-day Saint lives, because it is his duty so to live that if, when, and 
as he comes into church his faith and his prayers may be exercised to 
the end that they who speak shall be able to declare the will of the Lord. 

I do not say nor do I suggest that there may not be occasions when 
the Lord speaks in spite of the people. Those times sometimes do come, 
but I do feel that when the people of the Lord come to these Conferences 
such is not the occasion in which they find themselves, and therefore it is 
their duty, coming to the Conference, to come in a spirit of reverence, 
in a spirit of worship, in a spirit of sanctification. First, that they them- 
selves may be fed, and in order next that they who speak may also be fed, 
to the end that all the people of the Church, and all the people of the 
world may be instructed, directed, and built up by those things which may 
be said at these Conferences. 

SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CONFERENCES 

These are unique gatherings, unique in the whole world, unique 
because they are gatherings that are directed by the man whom the Lord 
has chosen to guide and direct his work on this earth. No other people 
have any such position as this ; no other man has any such position as 
that which I have described, and therefore what we do and say here from 
Conference to Conference, has a deep, abiding spiritual significance, and 
that significance cannot reach its full measure, we cannot send out our 
messages in their full strength unless those who gather here, who parti- 
cipate in these Conferences, are attuned to the Spirit of the Lord. 

May he in the future as in the past bring together in these Confer- 
ences faithful Latter-day Saints. May he bring together continually 
such great gatherings of the Priesthood as we had last night. As has 
been said here today nobody can stand before that great audience and 
not be solemnly impressed with the strength and the power which reside 
in them. 

So I repeat we should come here prepared to help to open up the 
avenues to the heavens, that from the heavens may come the inspiration 
which God expects us to possess. That you may be participants, that 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



121 



we may be participants, that we shall give to the world those things which 
the world needs, and that the Lord may bless us always, I ask in the 
name of Jesus, Amen. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

If at this moment each one present were asked to state in one sentence 
or phrase the most distinguishing feature of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, what would be your answer ? It occurs to me now 
.that my answer would be this : 

Divine authority by direct revelation. 

A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE 

There are those who claim authority through historical descent, 
others from the scriptures, but this Church stands out as making the 
distinctive claim that the authority of the Priesthood has come directly 
from God the Father and the Son, by revelation to Joseph Smith.' 

Founded upon that principle, accepting it as absolute Gospel, we 
have clearly defined in our minds some fundamental principles : 

First, that God is a personal being ; that he has a spirit-personality. 
When we visualize him in that form, we look at him through the clearest 
lens through which the human mind is capable of perceiving Deity. As 
someone has said, "He may be infinitely more, but he cannot be less." 

The acceptance of divine authority by direct revelation also reveals 
to us the fact that Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, for 
the Father in appearing to Joseph Smith stated in definite words, "This 
is my beloved Son, hear Him." 

Correlated with that revelation is another fundamental fact, that the 
Lord is interested in his people, that the whole human family are related 
as his children, and he loves them, and that he has authorized men to 
officiate among the children of the world, to bring them back into his 
presence. 

My brethren and sisters, the paramount thought in my mind at this 
moment is this : That the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith 
and restored authority to establish the Kingdom of God on earth, and 
this is my testimony to you. 

TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENTS GRANT AND CLARK 

I will also testify that divine authority rests in, rich abundance upon 
him whom the Lord has chosen to stand at the head of this work at the 
present time. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I have had to sit in 
council with President Grant and President Clark. I wish every person 
in this Church might have had the same opportunity to look into Presi- 
dent Grant's noble spirit as I have ; to know him as I have had the privi- 
lege to know him ; to glimpse his unbounded generosity, his love for man- 
kind, and particularly for those who are true and loyal to the Church ; to 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



realize how fearlessly he stands for right. If you realized these virtues 
more fully, I am sure that when you kneel down to pray there would 
be a note of thanksgiving in your heart and in your words which perhaps 
there has not been heretofore. 

I would like to pay a tribute to President Clark, a man of sterling 
integrity, who loves this work above everything else in this world. He 
is loyal and true, sound and clear in judgment, a valiant servant of the 
Lord. 

UNITY IN THE LEADING COUNCILS 

I would like you to < know that there is a spirit of unity and oneness 
in the council of the First Presidency, the spirit for which Christ prayed 
just before he went into the garden of Gethsemane: "That they all may 
be one ; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be 
one in us." And as he prayed on that occasion so I pray now that that 
spirit of oneness may characterize the leading councils of the Church; 
nay, may I say, continue to characterize the leading councils of the 
Church. For I believe that there has not been a time in the history of our 
Church when there was more unity among these councils than at the 
present time. I pray that that spirit of oneness may spread throughout 
all the Church, that it may be characteristic of Presidencies of Stakes and 
High Councils, Bishoprics, Ward Teachers, and particularly of the 
quorums and auxiliaries of the Church, that they may all be one, to quote 
the Savior, as he and his Father are one. God help us to achieve this 
principle, that our faith in God and in his work may be unwavering, and 
our loyalty never doubted, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The musical numbers of this session have been rendered by the 
Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direction of Sister Lottie 
Sackett. We have appreciated them very, very much. 

The same spirit that Brother Bowen has was my spirit as a young 
man, as a child, as a boy. My mother used to tell me, as you have heard 
me say many times, that if I would behave myself I would become an 
Apostle. I told her that I did not want to be an Apostle, a president of 
a stake or a bishop of a ward, I wanted to be a business man, but when 
the call came for me to go to Tooele, I made an heroic sacrifice. I will 
not enter into the details. 

GRATITUDE FOR PRIESTHOOD 

When the local patriarch in Tooele blessed my little baby who was 
dying and promised her she should live and be a mother and become 
a leader among her sisters, I thanked the Lord more fervently than ever 
before in my life for the Priesthood of God and the power that that 
patriarch had. Subsequently he said, "I have a blessing for you, and I 
want you to come to my office and get it." After I had received that 
blessing I saw and believed that my destiny was to devote my time 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



123 



practically to the Church, because of the promises made to me. And I 
have done it conscientiously, and there has never been any fear in my 
mind of the final triumph of this work. 

A REVELATION IN BRIEF 

I remember that one of my nearest and dearest friends was the late 
William C. Staines. Staines told me he once received a short revelation 
of just a few lines from the Lord. He said he was worrying over the 
rough people, many of them, in pioneer days, and the hardships, and the 
profanity, a little too much drinking, etc. among the people, and he was 
broken-hearted regarding these conditions and wondered what would 
happen when Brigham Young and others of the leading brethren passed 
away. The Lord gave him a revelation to the effect that he need not 
worry, that this is His work and the men for leaders of the Church 
would come when they were needed, and they have come. 

TRIBUTE TO ALONZO A. HINCKLEY AND SUCCESSOR 

I want to say that we have had no truer, more faithful member of 
the Council of the Twelve Apostles than was Alonzo A. Hinckley. I 
believe firmly that 1 whenever the Lord inspires a man to make a promise 
under the inspiration of His Spirit the Lord is not going to allow that 
promise to fail. Brother Hinckley was given a blessing in which he was 
promised as a young man that some day he would be an Apostle. He did 
not- believe it, but the Lord saw fit that that promise should be fulfilled 
before he passed away to undoubtedly a greater mission. 

After the brief remarks that have been made here today by Brother 
Bowen, I believe that every true Latter-day Saint believes that the Lord 
has had something to do with the selection of Brother Hinckley's suc- 
cessor. 

APPRECIATION FOR MUSIC FURNISHED 

I want to thank the choir and the Singing Mothers and their leader, 
the organist, and the soloists, who have done so much to add to our 
comfort during this Conference, particularly of course the Tabernacle 
Choir that sang to us Sunday and that furnished the broadcast. I appre- 
ciate our organist and Brother Spencer Cornwall, and all who have 
furnished music for us. I thank them on behalf of myself and my coun- 
selors and the Apostles. 

UNITY IN COUNCIL OF TWELVE 

I can say that after fifty-five years and a fraction in this Church 
as an Apostle I can repeat and emphasize what President McKay has 
said, that from my knowledge I do not believe the Council of the Twelve 
was ever more united than they are today, and I rejoice in it. We have 
no fear in asking people to speak because we know that they are seeking 
for God to help them in delivering their message.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



INSPIRED BEYOND NATURAL ABILITY 

I am grateful beyond expression that what I had planned in my 
mind to say in this Conference I have not said — not a word. I am very 
grateful indeed that many years ago when I sat on my seat in this'taber- 
nacle for quite a while one afternoon listening to Milton Bennion, and 
planning what I was going to say in my address that I was going to 
deliver when he got through speaking, and when I got up to speak and 
opened my Ready Reference book that I had in my pocket, and turned it 
down at the pages that I had marked, I forgot all about the speech that 
I had expected to deliver. I prayed with all my heart and soul that the 
Lord would inspire me beyond my natural ability, that I would have his 
inspiration so strong that my brother, whom I saw in a meeting in this 
building for the first time in my life, might be converted to the truth. 

I told that congregation that never before in all my life had I so 
strongly desired the inspiration of the Lord while standing before a con- 
gregation in this building, that never before had I desired so much their 
faith and prayers to help me in my remarks. I did not think again of the 
Ready Reference book, nor did I think of the sermon that I had planned 
to deliver, but I preached on the divine mission of the Savior, the Son 
of God, the Redeemer of the world, and principally upon the divine mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith, the instrument in the hands of God of again 
establishing upon the earth the plan of life and salvation. 

Brother George Q. Cannon used to sit in a chair here on the stand 
facing north. I was sitting on the stand right below him. When I sat 
down I heard Brother Cannon say, "Thank God for the power of that 
testimony." I leaned forward and wept for joy, because I knew God 
had heard and answered my prayer. I had left three quarters of an hour 
of the time — forty-eight minutes in fact — for Brother George Q. Cannon, 
knowing that his brother Angus, who was in charge of the meeting, al- 
ways believed in a two-hour meeting. 

Brother Angus M. Cannon, at the close of my remarks, walked over 
to where President Cannon sat and said : "George, there is three-quarters 
of an hour left for you. Please occupy it." 

Brother George Q. Cannon said : "Angus, I came in late, I was in 
pain at two o'clock, and I do not feel like talking ; I don't want to talk. 
We have had a very wonderful meeting, and I am in favor of your dis- 
missing the meeting." 

Angus said: "Well, I am not going to waste three-quarters of an 
hour. If you won't talk I will call on somebody else." 

Brother George Q. Cannon said : "All right, take your seat, I will 
talk." He got up and said : "There are occasions in the lives of all of us 
when the Lord sees fit to inspire a man and to allow him to reach such 
heights of inspiration that it is a very grave mistake for somebody else to 
try to follow him. Therefore, inasmuch as we have had an occasion of 
this kind in the remarks of Brother Grant, I ask Brother Angus M. 
Cannon to call on the choir to sing and on someone to dismiss this meet- 
ing." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



125 



CONVERSION OF BROTHER 

The very next day my brother came into my office and said : "Heber, 
I heard you preach yesterday." 

"Well, well, well, I am glad to know it — the first time you ever 
heard your brother preach?" 

He said, "No, Heber, I have heard you lots of times." 

"Well I never saw you in a meeting before in my life." 

"No," he said, "I never took a front seat, I generally went to a meet- 
ing where I ' could get in the gallery, or somewhere else where you could 
not see me, and I could see you. But you never spoke before as you did 
yesterday . You spoke beyond your natural ability," (using my own 
words in my prayer), "you spoke by inspiration." 

I said, "What did I speak about?" 

"The idea of your asking that. You know that the main theme upon 
which you spoke was the divine mission of the Prophet in the hands 
of God in the establishing of this Church." 

"You are praying for a testimony of the Gospel, I understand?" 

"Yes, and I am getting discouraged. I feel like I shall quit praying." 

I said: "Quit. You say you know there is a God and you know 
there is a devil, and that the devil tried to get you to commit suicide, and 
instead of doing it (you went out with your pistol in the high pines of 
Oregon to do it) you got down on your knees and prayed and got up 
weeping for joy ; and that you know two things, that there is a devil 
and that there is a God. If you quit praying you have surrendered to the 
devil. What in the world is the matter with you ? Do you want the Lord 
to come down here and talk to you : You tell me that you know that I 
spoke beyond my natural ability, that I spoke by inspiration, that my 
theme was the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. What more 
of a testimony do you want ?" 

He said, "I never thought of that before." 

Well, before the week was out he applied for baptism. 

We know as we know that we live that we have the truth. We have 
absolute confidence as the Presidency of the Church in the men whom we 
recommend for the apostleship. President Smith, in my judgment, al- 
though he called twelve men to the Presidency and the Quorum of the 
Twelve during his life, made no mistake in any one of the men that he 
called. It may sound egotistical, but I am sure I have made no mistakes 
in the appointments to these quorums that I have made. 

GRATITUDE FOR GOSPEL 

I thank the Lord from the bottom of my heart for the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, the plan of life and salvation, that we as a people have, and 
that we as individuals have. I thank God for the young men who go out 
upon missions without college education and meet the scholastic accom- 
plishments of the world, and that under the inspiration of the living God 
they have been able to confound the wise of the world and have touched 
the hearts of honest people, bringing them into the Church. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BLESSING AND TESTIMONY 

I pray God with all the power of my being to bless every soul who 
has embraced the Gospel, and to inspire every one to live the Gospel. 
"Man is that he may have joy," and there is no joy in the world that equals 
the joy of knowing in your heart of hearts that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that we as individ- 
uals are living the Gospel that will bring eternal exaltation to us and 
our loved ones. 

That God may help each and every one of us to do this, is my 
humble prayer. I pray God's blessings upon this people. I thank our 
Heavenly Father for the marvelous attendance of the Priesthood at our 
meeting last night. I thank him for all the blessings that he has given me. 
I humbly pray God that he will multiply the rain and increase the 
fertility of the soil, and increase the love of labor in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints, and a determination with the help of God to live the 
truth, so that our example may so shine before the world that those who 
know not the truth may seek for it ; and I know that if they will seek for 
it God will give it to them. I thank the Lord for the statement made by 
Moroni in the Book of Mormon as follows : "And when ye shall receive 
these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal 
Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and, if ye 
shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he 
will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." 
The Book of Mormon is the great, the grand, the most wonderful mis- 
sionary that we have. 

APPRECIATION FOR POLICE SERVICE 

I want to express the gratitude of myself and associates in the 
Presidency and of the Apostles for the splendid way that the police de- 
partment of this city, under the direction, I suppose, of their chief, have 
looked after the traffic and prevented accidents. We owe them a debt of 
gratitude. 

A FAVORITE POEM 

Even though my time is up, I am going to read you a poem that I 

intended to use in my opening remarks : 

There are three lessons I would write, 
Three words as with a burning pen, 
In tracings of eternal light 
Upon the hearts of men. 

Have faith, tffough clouds environ round 
And gladness hides her face in scorn. 
Put off the darkness from thy brow; 
No night but hath its morn. 

Have hope, where'er thy bark is driven, 
The calm distorts the tempest's mirth. 
Know this, God rules the hosts of heaven, 
The inhabitants of earth. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



127 



Have love — not love alone for one, 
But man as man thy brother call, 
And scatter as a circling sun 
Thy charities on all. 

There is hardly a day of my life that I do not repeat the words of 
that poem. God bless you all, Amen. 

"Holy Redeemer," a sacred anthem, was sung by the Singing Moth- 
ers, William Hardiman, violinist. 

Elder John W. Jones, President of the Long Beach Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The music of the Conference was under the direction of J. Spencer 
Cornwall, Conductor of the Tabernacle Choir. The singing at the fifth 
and sixth sessions by the Relief Society Singing Mothers was conducted 
by Sister Charlotte O. Sackett. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank W. Asper, assisted by Wade N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

these pages those who now believe the Gospel will find their faith strengthened and

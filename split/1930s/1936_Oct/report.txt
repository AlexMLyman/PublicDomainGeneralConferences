A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very glad to have the privilege of meeting with the Saints in 
General Conference once more. I shall first read a message from the 
First Presidency to the Church : 

THE MESSAGE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY 
TO THE CHURCH 

As promised at the last April Conference, we inaugurated a Church 
Security Plan. To facilitate the putting into effect of the Plan, we 
organized a General Committee whose functions were to represent the 
Presiding Bishopric in the detailed administrative work of coordinating 
and supervising the labors of the various regularly established Church 
organizations in their large and important security operations. 

The Security Plan contemplated no new Church machinery for this 
work, but provided for the use of all the existing Church organizations — 
the Stake and Ward organizations, the Priesthood quorums, the Relief 
Society, and the various auxiliary organizations — each of which was 
to render the maximum service it could furnish in the interest of the 
general welfare of the Church. 

OBJECTIVE TO PROVIDE NECESSITIES 

The announced objective set for the Church under this Program 
was to provide by October 1, 1936, by a wholly voluntary system of 
gifts in cash or in kind, sufficient food, fuel, clothing, and bedding to 
supply through the coming winter, every needy and worthy Church

family unable to furnish these for itself, in order that no member of 
the Church should suffer in these times of stress and emergency. 

WORK TO REPLACE IDLENESS 

Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possi- 
ble, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away 
with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift 
and self respect be once more established amongst our people. The 
aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is 
to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church 
membership. 

Our great leader, Brigham Young, under similar conditions, said : 

Set the poor to work — setting out orchards, splitting rails, digging 
ditches, making fences, or anything useful, and so enable them to buy- 
meal and flour and the necessities of life. 

This admonition is as timely today as when Brigham Young made it. 

CONTRIBUTIONS IN LABOR 

The harvests not having been yet fully completed, it is not possible 
to make a final report upon our present situation under the Plan, but 
we are happy to make the following preliminary statement : 

In accordance with the Plan, everything that has been done has 
been accomplished by the purely voluntary gift or labor of members 
of the Church as well as the gifts of many non-members who have con- 
tributed most generously of their substance to aid the Church in its 
efforts. We wish especially to thank these for their help. 

More than 15,000 persons have performed labor on various Stake 
and Ward projects in connection with this Plan. Many of these have 
contributed their work gratis ; others have received for their services, 
work certificates entitling them to help during the coining winter. 
Hundreds of thousands of work hours have been furnished by the 
people to this necessary and praiseworthy purpose. 

The Church Security Plan contemplates that those now on WPA 
projects shall continue on these projects, making sure to give a full 
day's work for value received but they are expected to contribute of 
their time when not so employed to the carrying out of the Plan. 

The Church aims to help provide for the care and sustenance of 
those on direct relief — Federal, State and County, as also for those 
for whom the Church has heretofore cared. The exact number of such 
persons cannot now be certainly given but they may be as many as 
15,000. We have strongest reasons for believing we shall be able to 
give these the aid they need. 

REPORTS FROM STAKES 

Oct. 1st, the date set on which reports were to be made, 98 stakes 
out of a total of 117 had reported on their organizations and achieve-

merits, and 83 answer that they are prepared to supply food, clothing, 
bedding, etc., to every person in need. 

We commend the presidencies of stakes and bishoprics of wards 
for this outstanding record of promptness and efficiency. 

It is also contemplated that under this plan work shall be sought 
and obtained for the unemployed in private industries, thus relieving 
both the government and the Church. To this time upwards of 700 
persons have been so placed by the Security agencies. Efforts along this 
line will be steadily pursued. 

RESULTS ITEMIZED 

As already stated the harvests are not yet completed and so returns 
are necessarily incomplete, but data available show as to food-stuffs 
actually now on hand the following items : 

Wheat, over 4,000 bushels. 

Beans, over 13,000 pounds. 

Dried fruits, over 23,000 pounds. 

Meat, over 10,000 pounds. 

Vegetables, over 14,000 pounds. 

Potatoes, over 6,000 bushels. 

Shelled corn, over 3,000 pounds. 

Flour, over 62,000 pounds. 

Canned fruit and vegetables, almost 300,000 cans. 

There are numbers of other items of foodstuffs of lesser amounts. 

There are over 23,000 articles of men's, women's and children's 
clothing, including dresses, underwear, coats, suits, stockings, socks 
and shoes. 

There are more than 2,000 quilts already made ; and other bedding is 
being accumulated in substantial quantities. 

Arrangements are under way for the supply of fuel as needed. 

The foregoing partial summary will indicate what the people have 
done in the short space of time of five months only. It is a glowing 
promise of what the people are able to do when they put their wills 
and hearts to this work. 

WARDS AND STAKES TO HELP EACH OTHER 

Every ward and stake is expected to face the necessity, not only 
of providing for its own, but of helping other wards and stakes. In 
no other way would it be possible to do the work which the Church 
is aiming to do. But few stakes and wards are in a position where 
they may be rightfully satisfied by merely caring for their own. 

This great work must continue unabated during the winter months 
along all lines and activities possible in that inclement season. When 
spring comes, the measures taken to supply foodstuffs must be redoubled. 
We shall then easily be able to do better than this year because we can 
begin our work when the planting season begins. We must not con-

template ceasing our extraordinary efforts until want and suffering 
shall disappear from amongst us. 

The responsibility of seeing that no one is hungry or cold or insuf- 
ficiently clad rests upon the bishops, each one for the members of his 
ouw ward. He will use every Church organization of his ward to 
help him in his work. For help outside his ward, he will look for 
necessary assistance to his Stake Presidency, they to their regional or- 
ganization, and these to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church whose 
primary responsibility it is to look after the poor of the Church as a 
whole. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS ABUNDANTLY BLESSED 

For this great undertaking the Lord has abundantly blessed his 
people already, and he will continue to pour out his blessings so long as 
the people do their duty by the poor. 

Generations and generations ago, the Lord said to Israel of old, 
urging them to pay their tithes into his storehouse : 

Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not 
open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there 
shall not be room enough to receive it. 

To this generation, the Lord has said: 

Inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do 
it unto me. 

And the Lord added this admonition: 

Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have 
made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto 
the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, 
being in torment. 

Jacob, speaking to the people of Nephi, said : 

But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. 
And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if 
ye seek them ; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good — to clothe 
the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and ad- 
minister relief to the sick and the afflicted. 

APPRECIATION FOR SERVICE 

We are grateful to our Heavenly Father for his goodness unto this 
people during this year, for the bounteous crops which he has given 
to them, and for the measure of prosperity which has come to our midst. 

We have proved the Lord and he has opened the windows of 
heaven. 

We are grateful to all those who have contributed of their substance 
to our achievement. We thank all those who have served so long and 
earnestly in the working out of this program and especially to those 
15,000 and odd members of the Church who have been directly concerned. 

We invoke the blessings of the Lord upon each and every one of

you. We pray the Lord continually to inspire his people to the end 
that we shall once more be able to take care of all those worthy ones 
amongst us to whom hard times have come in these days of stress. 

(End of Message) 

HONEST LABOR 

When we appeal to the people to continue to labor for the WPA, 
we ask them to labor with energy. I was told that my father, who was 
the superintendent of public works in early days, (and it was the 
public works of the Church that built this building — blacksmith shop, 
carpenter shop, and other things, said, "I can pick out every man 
who is working by the day, and every one who is working by the job. 
I find men working by the day — by the day — by the day; and I find 
them working by the job, by the job, by the job, job, job — by the job, 
by the job, by the job, by the job." 

Now, we want our people who are on the WPA to work by the 
job and not by the day. 

QUOTES BRIGHAM YOUNG 

I desire to call attention to a statement by President Brigham Young : 

My experience has taught me, and it has become a principle with 
me, that it is never any benefit to give out and out, to man or woman, 
money, food, clothing, or anything else, if they are able-bodied and can 
work and earn what they need, when there is anything on earth for them 
to do. This is my principle and I try to act upon it. To pursue a 
contrary course would ruin any community in the world and make them 
idlers. 

And what would ruin a community would ruin a state, and I 
might incidentally remark, a nation also. 

THE CONSTITUTION INSPIRED 

The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard ; it is 
founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner ; it is, to all those 
who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades 
and refreshing waters of a great rock in a weary and thirsty land. It 
is like a great tree, under whose branches men from every clime can 
be shielded from the burning rays of the sun. — Joseph Smith. 

From my childhood days I have understood that we believe abso- 
lutely that the Constitution of our country was an inspired instrument, 
and that God directed those who created it and those who defended 
the independence of this nation. In other words, that He fought with 
Washington and others in the Revolutionary War. 

In Section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants we find the following: 

We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit 
of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation 
to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and 
safety of society. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws 
are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free 
exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the pro- 
tection of life. . . . 

We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil 
government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another pro- 
scribed in its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, 
as citizens, denied. 

COMMENDS INCREASE IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS 

It gives me very great pleasure indeed to announce that we have 
had a remarkable and splendid increase in the tithes of the people 
since this Security Plan was first announced. We have also had, as 
I remember it, fully 100 per cent increase in the amount of Fast Day 
offerings paid. I rejoice in this, and when we ask the people to come 
off the "dole" so to speak, we ask every man who has a farm to farm 
it and not to let it lie idle, and collect money from the government of 
the United States. 

I was told by the cashier of a bank that a man came into his bank 
who wanted to borrow some money. He said : "Yes, you can have it 
as usual, if you will give me a crop mortgage." 

He said : "Oh, I am not raising crops now ; I am getting more 
money from the government than I could get from crops raised on 
my farm. I will give you an order on the government." 

GRATITUDE FOR CHANGE IN SENTIMENT 

Since our conference six months ago it has fallen to my lot to visit 
very many places. First I went to Detroit, Michigan, where I attended 
a convention of the Farm Chemurgic Council, and was one of the 
speakers. My remarks were received with such enthusiasm and with 
such applause that I think for the first time in my life, when I retired 
that night, I was unable to sleep for many hours because of the gratitude 
that filled my heart for the wonderful change that had come about in 
the attitude of the world at large toward our people. When I thought 
of the persecutions and trials and tribulations of our people ; when I 
thought of my own mother being rejected by her brothers and cast out 
as a thing of evil ; when I thought of laboring in England for three long 
years, during which time some of the most wicked and vile and devilish 
things imaginable were printed in the newspapers about our people ; and 
when I remembered that not one single line of refutation was I able 
to get in any of the newspapers, and then when I thought of the great 
body of leading men — some of the greatest, if not the very greatest, 
financial men in our country applauding my remarks that were practically 
telling of the accomplishments of the Church, and applauding them to 
the echo, it was impossible for me to sleep. 

EXPERIENCE WITH LONDON EDITOR 

To give you one illustration of my experiences in England — I may 
have given it to you before, but I will do so again — I took a letter from 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the shipping firm, with which we had been doing business for over 50 
years, to the editor of a newspaper in London, vouching for my integrity, 
my honesty, and the trustworthiness of anything I might say to that 
paper. When I presented my letter I was told that the editor was not 
in, but the assistant editor, Mr. Robinson, would see me. By the way, 
this letter not only vouched for my integrity, but it vouched for the 
integrity and honor of every man who for the past 50 years had presided 
over the European Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

The gentleman asked me what he could do for me. I told him it 
would be a great pleasure to me if he would allow me to write a reply 
in refutation of the many vile and wicked falsehoods that had been pub- 
lished in his paper regarding the Church. 

He said: "Oh, we have not published anything false; we have pub- 
lished just exactly what is right about you Mormons." 

I replied: "Yes, my friend, when one man calls another a liar he 
thinks he is doing what is right, but if the man is not a liar that does 
not make him one. I know absolutely that everything you have pub- 
lished in your paper about us is a falsehood." 

"Never mind what you claim, we will not publish anything that 
you write." 

I said: "I defy you to get a letter of recommendation from some 
responsible person, vouching for any individual who has furnished you 
these falsehoods. I can furnish you letters of recommendation from 
every non-Mormon banker in Salt Lake City. I have no recommenda- 
tions from Mormons, because that would be no more valuable than if I 
were to write a letter saying : 'To whom it may concern : The bearer, Mr. 
Heber J. Grant, is strictly honest. Respectfully, Heber J. Grant.' I 
have letters from bankers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, 
who are not members of our Church, from H. B. Claflin and Company, 
the largest dry goods house in New York, signed by the president, 
vouching for my integrity and honesty, and I assure you that everything 
you have published in your paper about the Mormons is a falsehood." 

He said: "Never mind what you assure me. We will not publish 
anything you have to say." 

I said : "Good day, sir." 

I went to the door and opened it, then took my "stovepipe" hat 

off. 

When I was over there, way back 30 years or more ago, a man 
was not considered worthy to be called a minister who did not have 
a Prince Albert coat and a stovepipe hat. For the first time in my life 
I was wearing both of them. 

The boy told me that Mr. Robinson, the assistant editor, would 
receive me — this was downstairs before I walked up to his office. And 
I had the thought which I expected to use later if necessary. I turned 
around and said: "Excuse me," and I used the thought that came to 
me downstairs. 

"By the way," I said, "the boy who met me downstairs told me 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



that Mr. Robinson, the assistant editor, would receive me, the editor 
not being in ; you are only the assistant editor. Is your name Robinson ?" 
"Yes." 

"Are you related to Phil Robinson?" 
"Oh, no." 

"Do you know Phil Robinson?" 

"Do I know Phil Robinson? Everybody knows Phil Robinson." 

"Well I am glad to know that. Was he the correspondent of the 
London Daily Telegraph during the Boer War, one of the two greatest 
of all the London papers?" And I emphasized greatest, because his 
paper was not one of the two. 

"Yes, he was." 

"And would you believe anything and everything he wrote?" 
"I would." 

"Then buy his book entitled Sinners and Saints; it will cost you 
only two shillings. Phil Robinson visited Utah and traveled all over 
the state with one of the Apostles, (the late John Henry Smith was 
the man) and if you will buy that book, sir, you will find that everything 
you have said in your paper is a malicious falsehood. 

He said: "You astonish me." 

I said, "You are not the only man who has been astonished when 
he has run up against the Mormon problem." 
He said : "Write me a half column." 

I said : "Small favors thankfully received, large ones in proportion. 
Seven to ten columns of lies and a half a column of refutation. Thanks, 
you shall have it inside of two hours." 

He got it all right, kept it the usual month or two and returned 
it with the statement that the editor was very sorry, but he could not 
find space for the returned manuscript. Every time I have received 
such letters of sorrow I have thought of the saying, "Polite lying is a 
gentlemanly accomplishment, lubricates business, varnishes unpleasant 
facts, and promotes friendship." 

It doesn't promote any friendship with me, it promotes complete 
disgust for men to say they are sorry when I am sure they are telling 
a lie. 

HONORED AT CONVENTION 

These remarks of mine at Detroit made a very profound impression 
for good for the Latter-day Saints and their accomplishments. The 
president of the association asked me to kindly speak again at the banquet 
which was advertised and at which about 1,200 people were present, and 
I took pleasure in speaking again briefly. All of my remarks before 
the conference were published in pamphlet form, and my remarks at 
the banquet were published in an abbreviated form. The remarks in 
full appeared in the Improvement Era. I have a letter from the man- 
aging director saying, "Mr. Grant, it is the concensus of opinion of 
several score of men whom I have met since the convention that you 
came down to Detroit and stole our convention." 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

It fell to my lot to have a very delightful trip with my wife and 
nearly all of my children to Alaska, and to speak while on that trip at 
Seattle, Portland, and Boise. We had a very enjoyable time and saw 
a remarkable and wonderful country, so far as scenery is concerned. 

Afterwards it fell to my lot to attend a gathering of the Grant 
family in Galesburg, Illinois, and I believe that I did some good in meeting 
with the children and grandchildren of my father's brothers and sisters. 
I thoroughly enjoyed myself and hope some day to make an impression 
for good upon them, and that I may be successful in bringing some of 
them into the Church. I have had a number of letters from some of the 
people and have sent books and tracts to them, and some have remarked 
that they wished they were here so that they could attend our meetings. 
I am not sure but what they would like to join the Church. I held 
meetings with the Saints in Galesburg. The majority of the audience 
were non-Mormons. 

It fell to my lot to go to Estes Park, Colorado, where I delivered a 
speech of a full hour before the Institute of Human Relations in defense 
of our people, this being the only time in my life that I have been per- 
mitted to meet with people who were explaining the faith of various 
religious organizations, among the speakers being a gentleman from 
China. My remarks were received with kindness the same as was the 
case at Detroit. 

When I contemplate the change in attitude that has taken place 
my heart is filled with gratitude. 

EXPERIENCES IN JAPAN 

When I went to Japan we made all arrangements to board and 
lodge at a very fine place that overlooked the town, upon a bluff, a 
delightful location. I handed my card to the gentleman after arrange- 
ments had been made, and our rooms selected, and he said, "Well, from 
Salt Lake City ! I am glad to see you. We are expecting some preachers 
from Salt Lake City." 

I said: "Turn the card over and maybe you will find they have 
arrived. 

He turned the card over and saw the Articles of Faith of our 
Church. He said, "Oh, you cannot stay in my house, I would not allow 
a Mormon to sleep under my roof." 

I said, "Thanks." 

He rushed to a newspaper, published by an Englishman, and in 
English, by the way, telling that he would not let a Mormon sleep under 
his roof. 

Brother Louis A. Kelsch, the minute we arrived in Yokohama, 
went to see a minister, whose picture he had seen in a newspaper, I think 
it was in St. Paul ; he had seen a picture of this minister taken in Japan 
with two converts. Brother Kelsch cut the picture out of the paper because 
a voice, figuratively speaking, without making any noise — a communica- 
tion to that part of him that shall live after he is gone — said, "You shall 
meet that man in Japan." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



When he returned to Chicago he said to his wife, "Brother Grant 
has been called on a mission to Japan, I see by The News, and I know 
two men who are going with him." This was at the dinner table. He 
had then received no notice of his call. 

"Who are they?" she asked. 

He said: "One of them is Horace S. Ensign, the other I do not 
care to mention." 

That night after he retired his wife said: "Lou, are you the other 
one?" 

He said: "Yes." 

MEETS MINISTER 

As I was saying, as soon as he got to Japan he called on this gen- 
tleman, and the minister was delighted to meet him. He showed him 
the picture and said : "A voice told me that I should meet you in Japan. 
Here I am. I am delighted to meet you." 

The minister went on talking to him and said : "You know, we are 
expecting Mormons here and all of us have joined together and have 
petitioned the government not to allow them to be permitted to speak 
here." 

Brother Kelsch said : "Turn that card over and maybe you will 
find that they have arrived," and gave him his opinion in good plain 
English of his Christian spirit. 

The editor of the newspaper literally "ripped the man up the back" 
who refused to allow us to stop in his boarding house. I called on the 
editor of the paper and thanked him for his attacking the man for his 
lack of Christianity and a decent respect for other people, and he said: 
"Don't you bother about thanking me. I have been reading stories 
about you, and I am going to publish a lot of them." 

I said: "Go right ahead. The more you publish the more grateful 
I will be, if you will only give me the privilege of replying to them." 

"You shall have all the space you want." 

WRITES REPLY 

He published a lot of things not very good, and I took space, oc- 
cupying one entire page and a fraction answering them. Then there was 
another small publication against us, and I wrote another long reply. 
The gentleman no doubt concluded that space was too valuable to let 
me say all that I wanted to say, so there were no more attacks. 

My heart goes out in gratitude for the splendid reception given 
to my speech in Colorado. 

VISIT TO CANADA 

Afterwards it fell to my lot to travel to Butte, Montana, then to 
Grea tFalls, Montana, where I held a meeting, and we then went 
to Canada, to the Taylor Stake, where a celebration was being given 
in honor of Brother Heber S. Allen, the former president of the

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



stake, and we also held meetings in Cardston. I then had the 
great pleasure of visiting the Canadian Rockies, and viewing the 
beautiful scenery there, also visited Glacier Park. Glacier Park 
and the Canadian Rockies are far ahead of anything I saw in 
Switzerland, in my opinion; yet any number of people, hundreds of 
thousands of them, go clear across the ocean to see something not up 
to the standard of what they could see here at home and in Canada, to 
say nothing of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Bryce, Cedar 
Breaks and Zion Park, which are superior to them all and which belong 
to us here at home. Returning from Canada we held meetings in 
Spokane, Washington, Butte, Montana, and Idaho Falls. 

DEDICATION OF PIONEER MONUMENT 

One of the most important, and perhaps the most important, thing 
that has happened since our last conference is that on the 19th of Sep- 
tember a special train left Salt Lake City for Omaha, where buses 
took us from the station to the Winter Quarters Pioneer Cemetery, 
where nearly six hundred of our people are buried. On that special 
train of a number of cars I did not see one cigarette, which was re- 
markable in this day. For several years past I have not had a meal in a 
dining car when there were not from one to a half dozen and sometimes 
ten ladies smoking cigarettes, to say nothing about the men. 

We had a little concert in the observation car and some excellent 
singing by a very splendid quartette, also singing by the group. I 
think it was no doubt the first time in the history of that car that people 
were ever in it without a single smoker. 

I believe there were over three thousand people in attendance at 
the dedicatory services. The Lord blessed those who spoke and those 
who listened. We had a glorious time. I do not believe there is a more 
beautiful or finer monument to be found in all the United States than 
that monument by Brother Avard Fairbanks. I believe it is his master- 
piece, and that it will give him a reputation with everybody who sees it. 
The sorrow depicted on the face of the mother as she looks down into 
the grave of her babe is perfectly wonderful. 

When I thought of people refusing to rent halls for money, in years 
gone by, in which the Mormons might meet, and then thought of that 
marvelous Joslyn Memorial Building being tendered to us for services 
on Sunday evening, again I was not able to sleep as well as usual. I 
think the marble in the steps that lead up to the entrance of that building 
is more than enough to erect an ordinary building. 

GROWTH OF CHURCH 

With the exception of times when I have been away from home, I 
believe that during the past six months since our conference there has not 
been more than one or two Sundays when it has not fallen to my lot to 
dedicate either a stake house or a ward meeting house. The Church is 
growing in power and ability and strength along all lines. The growth 
in tithing and donations tells its own story. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



I have rejoiced in the very many splendid and remarkable meeting 
houses we are building. The Church has furnished a great deal of 
employment by increasing the amount they are giving to the people when 
they erect meeting houses. We are giving them now sixty per cent of 
the total cost from the tithes, instead of nothing, which was the case 
when I was president of the Tooele Stake of Zion. We had to build 
our own meeting houses out there, and there was nothing given by the 
Church because they were not able to give anything. The Church finally 
started giving one-quarter, then one-third, then fifty per cent, and now 
we are able because of the increase in tithes of the people, to give sixty 
per cent towards the cost of erection of meeting houses. And out of the 
remaining forty per cent I do not believe that the people need to raise 
one-half. The amount of labor that the people can give in their wards 
makes up the difference. Certainly Zion is growing, and all is well. 

THE TOWNSEND PLAN 

We have on at the present time a great political campaign, and I 
want to say to the Saints that I hope they will not allow their political 
affiliations, their regard for political affairs, to cause feelings of ill-will 
towards one another. I have had some of the most insulting letters 
that ever came to me, condemning me for not being in favor of the 
Townsend Plan, and that I must be ignorant of the Plan. I am not 
ignorant of the Plan. I have not read every word of it, but I have 
asked one of my secretaries to read every word of the Plan and to give 
me the important points, and to my mind it is in direct opposition to 
everything I have quoted here today from Brigham Young and from 
the revelations of the Lord. The idea of allowing every man and woman 
who has reached the age of sixty years and wishes to retire from working 
to get $200 a month from the government ! There is nothing truer than 
Brigham Young's statement, that we should give nothing to people, 
unless they are not able to work, without requiring them to do something 
for it. 

I want to say to the people that one of my nearest and dearest 
relatives criticised me for not favoring the Townsend Plan. I love him 
just as much as though he did not criticise me. I am perfectly willing 
for him to think and believe and act just as he wants to do, I want every- 
body to do this ; I do not want the people of the Church, when they are 
working for the government, to work by the day — by the day — by the 
day ; but I do want them to work by the job, by the job, by the job. 

Let every Latter-day Saint who has a farm, farm it, and not try to 
borrow money to be paid back by the government. Let every man feel 
that he is the architect and builder of his own life, and that he proposes 
to make a success of it by working. "Six days shalt thou labor and do 
all thy work," and rest on the seventh, and do not be willing to labor four 
or five days and then only half labor. Let every Latter-day Saint give 
value received for everything he gets, whether it be in work, or whatever 
he does.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Speaking of the political campaign that is on, I have often remarked 
that I thought politics are a little like the measles. I have been assured 
that measles are never at all bad if they do not set in on you; if you 
will take a little saffron tea and keep them on the surface they are all 
right, but when they set in on you they make you crosseyed, and I have 
heard that they also turn the hide yellow. 

HYMNS WORTH MEMORIZING 

I would like every Latter-day Saint to learn the hymn and repeat 
it to himself time and time again during this campaign — you will find it 
on page 66 of the Hymn Book. I will tell you how I remember that 
page. We hold conferences on the 6th of April and the 6th of October, 
provided the 6th of October comes so that we can have a Sunday near 
that date, you can all remember six for October and six for April, and 
that is sixty-six, and that is the page on which the hymn is found ; so you 
cannot say "I would like to learn that, but I do not know where it is," 
you cannot forget where it is. 

Should you feel inclined to censure 

Faults you may in others view, 
Ask your own heart, ere you venture, 

If that has not failings too. 

Let not friendly vows be broken ; 

Rather strive a friend to gain ; 
Many a word in anger spoken 

Finds its passage home again. 

Do not, then, in idle pleasure, 

Trifle with a brother's fame, 
Guard it as a valued treasure, 

Sacred as your own good name. 

Do not form opinions blindly; 

Hastiness to trouble tends, 
Those of whom we thought unkindly, 

Oft become our warmest friends. 

Then there is another hymn I would like you all to learn, which 
you will find in the same book, I cannot tell you the page, but it is there. 
I tried to get it into the Hymn Book for forty odd years before I suc- 
ceeded, but I distributed thousands and thousands of copies of it in 
America and while I was over in Europe in the missionary field and 
asked every missionary to learn it before it was published in our psalmody. 
I first heard it as I was traveling to Oakley in Idaho with President 
Francis M. Lyman 55 years ago. He sang the song, and that night at 
camp as we were sleeping on the ground I asked him to repeat it to 
me. I wrote it down and I learned it the next day as we were traveling. 

Incidentally there is no greater evidence of the growth of the Church 
that I can give than by telling of that trip. I traveled forty miles from 
Tooele to Salt Lake, then through Salt Lake, Davis and Weber Stakes, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



15 



twenty miles to Brigham City, and two days and a half west from 
Brigham City, sleeping on the ground two nights, to a branch of the 
Grantsville Ward of the Tooele Stake of Zion, known as Oakley. I 
think we have at least a half a dozen stakes, if not more, west of Brigham 
City now. My first official motion, I believe, after I was made an 
Apostle, was to present Oakley and other wards — three or four of them 
and some branches — to the Box Elder Stake. The growth in that 
country is remarkable. 

This hymn is as follows: 

Let each man learn to know himself ; 
To gain this knowledge, let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor. 
How lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience' voice adroitly smother ; 
But oh ! how harshly we review 
The self-same errors in another ! 

And if you meet an erring one 

Whose deeds are blamable or thoughtless, 

Consider, ere you cast the stone, 

If you yourself be pure and faultless. 

Oh ! list to that small voice within, 

Whose whisperings oft make men confounded, 

And trumpet not another's sin, 

You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 

And in self-judgment, if you find, 

Your deeds to others are superior, 

To you has Providence been kind, 

As you should be to those inferior ; 

Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light which men are apt to borrow ; 

So, first improve yourself today, 

And then improve your friends tomorrow. 

The first part of the first verse is the chorus, but I like the last half 
of the last verse for the chorus, so I will repeat it : 

Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light which men are apt to borrow ; 

So, first improve yourself today, 

And then improve your friends tomorrow. 

WORK A BENEFIT 

I do not ask any man or child in this Church, although I will be 
eighty years of age next month, to work any more hours than I do. I 
have worked more than one day from half past three in the morning until 
nine o'clock at night. Do you know, I do not think work ever hurts 
anybody. I do not know of anything that destroys a person's health 
more quickly than not working. It seems to me that lazy people die 
young while those who are ready and willing to labor and who ask the 
Lord day by day to help them to do more in the future than they have

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ever done in the past, these are the people whom the Lord loves, and they 
live to a good old age. 

MAKES APPEAL 

Please, every Latter-day Saint farmer, farm your land, because if 
you do not you will lose your inheritance, and some one else will get 
possession of it sooner or later. Do not take anything which you are 
capable of producing yourself. 

A TESTIMONY 

I am grateful beyond all the power and ability with which God has 
given me to express myself for a knowledge that he lives, that God 
is our Father, and that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and Savior. 

May the Lord help you and me and every soul who has that knowl- 
edge to labor with all the ability which we possess to bring others to that 
same knowledge, by our example. Oh, how grateful I am to our Heaven- 
ly Father that he saw fit to choose Joseph Smith as the instrument 
in his hand of establishing again upon the earth the plan of life and 
salvation. May the Lord bless you one and all, and bless every honest 
soul upon the earth, and help every Latter-day Saint to so live that his 
example will shine and that it will help to bring others to a knowledge 
of the truth, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of our Re- 
deemer, Amen. 

A vocal solo, "Still, Still With Thee," was sung by Mrs. D. Sterling 
Wheelwright.

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I think I could do no better in reporting 
the Eastern States Mission than to tell you in a few words of some of the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



work being done by your sons and daughters who are laboring in that 
mission. 

At our annual Palmyra conference in July of this year we held a 
meeting and banquet attended only by missionaries. The entire program 
was provided by the missionaries themselves. They planned it and carried 
it out, and I am sure that it reflected their true feelings. The subject 
of their banquet program was "Monuments." I was reminded of this 
during the talk of President Grant. I cannot name all of the subjects 
treated at this moment but will name some of them. 

"The Seagull Monument" was assigned to one missionary, and 
around that monument she wove a beautiful talk on faith and trust in 
God, and then earnestly pleaded with her fellow companions to exhibit 
in their lives the same fine qualities that had been exhibited by their 
fathers. 

Another missionary was assigned "The Mormon Battalion Monu- 
ment," and he made an earnest plea for patriotism and courage. 

Another was assigned "The Monument at Cumorah Hill." He 
spoke eloquently, and may I say touchingly, upon the subject of immor- 
tality and the deep appreciation of the faith that had come into his life 
by reason of contact with that monument. Anticipating the monument 
at Florence, Nebraska, another missionary spoke of fidelity and courage, 
and closed with a wonderful appeal for all present to exhibit the same 
fine qualities in missionary life. 

I would not have you believe that it was all serious, some of it was 
high type fun and wit, but when we closed those who were there said : 
"This is one of the finest entertainments of my life, because with wit and 
fun have been interspersed and interwoven some of the finest ideals for 
life and for the Church I have ever heard." 

Brethren and sisters, your boys and your girls are carrying on under 
that kind of influence and under these lessons which this Church teaches. 

A few days ago my attention was called to an article in a magazine 
in which the author had severely criticised the religions of the day. He had 
contended that there was no progressive philosophy in any of the so-called 
religions of the world, a philosophy that met the problems of life. I 
thought this morning, I wish that author could understand the spirit 
and genius of Mormonism ; I wish he could know truly the philosophy of 
life as taught in this religion ; I wish he could know how basic principles 
are translated into the lives of those who accept and obey the Mormon 
religion. I wonder if anyone can listen to a speech such as that delivered 
this morning by the President of the Church and feel that there is not a 
true philosophy, a progressive philosophy of life in at least one of the 
religions of this world. If anything could be more basic than that to 
which we have listened I cannot think what it would be. 

To know that to serve God best we serve our f ellowmen most ; to 
believe in our Government, to obey its laws, to understand and respect its 
basic law especially, what could be higher, what could be more conducive 
to good citizenship than that ? Surely it is satisfying to know that work, 
honest work brings its reward, in a consciousness of duty well done. Oh, 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 



21 



I do hope and pray that the Latter-day Saints shall go from this confer- 
ence more firmly resolved than ever to live the Gospel, to keep the com- 
mandments of God, to forget not the basic things in our religion. I 
hope we shall carry them back to our homes, that we shall not forget to 
pray, that we shall not forget to study the scriptures, that we shall not 
forget that the home is the unit that shall endure forever. 

Basic ? Yes. Let us not forget the basic principles of the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. May I read to you in conclusion a text that came 
to me as I was called so unexpectedly to the stand to speak to you this 
morning : 

Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the 
Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before 
God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father 
that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism — 
yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according 
to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost ; yea, then cometh 
the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost ; and then can ye speak with the 
tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel. 

I commend to you these words of Nephi as found in the 31st chapter 
of II Nephi. 

I bear you my solemn testimony that I do know that there is a re- 
ligion that has a basic philosophy of life so progressive, that it meets 
every requirement of life. That religion is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
revealed and re-established upon earth in this day. How glorious and 
splendid it is to be one of the missionaries preaching that Gospel ! 

May God help us to appreciate and understand our responsibilities 
and to meet them nobly and manfully, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

c 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

It is a great responsibility to speak here. This tabernacle subdues 
one's feelings and lifts up his heart. I do not think the Church has ever 
erected a monument that has become so widely known as this historic 
building. It testifies of the wisdom and sacrifice of a generation that 
has gone. 

The Northern States Mission has been presided over by a long line 
of strong and devoted men and is well established. Any ordinary man 
who will look after the common duties connected with it should be able 
to carry it forward. 

It does one good to go away from home and look at his people at 
a distance. The perspective gives one a better appreciation of them 
and of their achievements. 

Brother Colton has made reference to some of the monuments 
erected by the Church. As I walked down Temple Avenue this morning 
and saw the figure of Moroni which crowns the highest spire of this 
beautiful temple in front of me I was reminded that for twenty-five 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



years, almost daily, I looked upon that figure which symbolizes the res- 
toration of the Gospel in this dispensation, but never before have I ap- 
preciated as I do now its significance. 

That figure crowns two buildings and one monument — the Salt Lake 
Temple, the Washington chapel, and the monument at Palmyra, New 
York. 

I have traveled over the states in my mission and have noted 
with pride and satisfaction the magnificent monuments erected to the 
heroic dead in that land. One of the finest monuments in the world 
stands in Springfield, Illinois, erected to Abraham Lincoln. But never 
before, in any land or at any time, has an enlightened people erected 
a monument to a person commemorating what he did after he was 
dead. This is a most remarkable thing. And the fact that gives emphasis 
to it is the character of the people who did it. 

The Latter-day Saints are not a highly emotional people, given to 
hysteria. On the contrary, they are a matter-of-fact, practical, thorough- 
going people. To know that they have implicit faith in all that the 
monument commemorates — the appearance of a resurrected and immortal 
being to a young man in this generation — is a significant thing. This 
is material proof that personality persists after death and that the res- 
urrection is a glorious reality. I know of no other monument like that. 
This is a marvelous testimony in a day of unbelief and skepticism. 

My brethren and sisters, a few of us have been commissioned to 
preach the Gospel in the world — you have been called upon to live it, and 
the sermon which you preach carries a conviction that words can never do. 

It is a matter of pride and satisfaction to know that when strangers 
visit you they are impressed with you and with your religion. 

We are made the custodians of great and precious truths — truths 
that will save and regenerate the world, and we are called upon to declare 
these truths to the world. God help us to do it in a way that will reflect 
credit upon the people which we represent and be acceptable to him I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

This is a great honor, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege 
of representing the Southern States Mission and the fine army of young 
men and women who are there as missionaries from the wards and stakes 
of Zion. I feel very grateful for my membership in the Church. I have 
learned to love it more than I love my life, and I love it because I see what 
it accomplishes in the lives of men and women. 

I am grateful that we are being led by prophets of the Lord. I real- 
ize that the Lord has committed to us a great program, and if we live up 
to it and apply it in our lives it will make us better men and women. Justly 
can we come together and sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
to guide us in these latter days," and while we sing this with all our hearts 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 



23 



and souls there are men and women all over the world who are in 
spiritual despair, who realize the need of prophets to guide us in these 
days. 

Some of these men reside down in that southland from which I came 
to attend this conference. 

In the August 9th issue of the Journal, one of the largest papers 
in Atlanta, Bishop Warren A. Candler of the Methodist church, one of 
the outstanding leaders of Atlanta, decried the condition of the people, 
saying that the whole world and especially our country needs a revival 
of genuine religion, and closes his article with these words: "We need 
the reappearance of prophets sent from God." 

The world is clamoring for that kind of leadership. 

Another article that appeared during the month of August in the 
Alabama Christian Advocate, a Methodist paper, "The Cry for Proph- 
ets" contained the following: 

O timorous Church of Christ, 

Cease counting your gain and losses ! 
The future, imperilled, is calling 

With the voice of a million crosses ! 
Calling for faithful prophets and seers, 

To rise up and prophesy — 
To kindle a fading vision afresh, 

Lest a visionless people die. 

Our sins are many, our needs are sore; 

O prophet, show us the roll — 
Take up the scales of God once more, 

And weigh the things of the soul. 
Point not alone to the patriarchs 

For the leading we need today — 
Scrolls of the Ancients we cherish, 

But the prophets must lead the way. 

In our mission we point out to the people that we have no quarrel 
with their churches, we are willing to grant all they have to offer. This 
great church, led by prophets of God, is in the earth to take up where 
they leave off. It presents a constructive program to assist men and 
women to overcome their bad habits, to enlist them in the service of God 
our Eternal Father, to surround their boys and girls through its auxiliary 
organizations and the marvelous program they have to present, with an 
influence that preserves them in their virtue and in their integrity, and in 
their manhood and womanhood. 

The Atlanta Constitution of August 9th last, reports an address by 
Reverend Peter Marshall, of the Westminster Presbyterian church of 
Atlanta, while visiting a Bible conference in Virginia, where he made the 
statement that every condition that preceded the fall of empires of the past 
faced America today. He said we should awaken to a realization of this 
fact. "In Atlanta," he said, "society thinks it cute for debutantes to be 
carried home Monday morning gloriously drunk." And then he appeals 
to the young people and says he hopes the youth will rise above the 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

standards of their parents. But it is very difficult for water to rise 
above its source. 

Recently, in Carolina, I presented our youth program at one of our 
conference sessions. Following the meeting a lady school teacher, not a 
member of our Church, a woman with much experience and dearly be- 
loved, came to me and said : "President Richards, I would like to volun- 
teer my services to help put over that program in this community. We 
have discussed the possibility of a program for the young people in our 
schools, but we realize we cannot accomplish it because when we have a 
party or entertainment we have to contend with drunkenness and disor- 
derly conduct." 

I said : "Yes, it is hard to raise the children above the standards of 
their parents, isn't it?" But I said : "We can do it because our standards 
are higher, and if our children can be raised to the standards of their par- 
ents they will live clean lives." She volunteered her services and is 
now helping in our Mutual work in that community. 

We feel very grateful for the influence of the M. I. A. in our mission. 
During the month of August we held four inter-district conventions, 
bringing together in the neighborhood of three or four hundred of our 
young people each time, first in the parks with our athletics and games, 
and then in the evening in our appreciation work ; and in the parks during 
three such events I saw only two cigarettes smoked. 

Compare this and the statement which appeared recently in The 
Improvement Era, reporting the June conference here in Salt Lake, when 
approximately nine thousand of our boys and girls were at Saltair Beach 
and not one arrest was made for disorderly conduct, and very little to- 
bacco seen on the grounds, and no one found intoxicated, with anything 
the world has to offer in its leadership of youth. 

I received a letter from one of our missionaries recently upon his 
release from a six months' mission, his home being in Jacksonville, Flori- 
da, and in this letter he expressed his gratitude for the opportunity he had 
had of serving as a missionary, and he said the one outstanding thing for 
which he was grateful was his association with the Elders of that mission. 
He said : "Before I came on my mission, not one of my boy friends, not 
of the Church, did I know to be morally clean, and in associating with 
these missionaries, to the contrary, I found none who had not been." 

Realizing these conditions, why shouldn't we thank God for a prophet 
to guide us in these latter days ? Why shouldn't we realize the blessings 
that are ours while a despairing world is crying for prophets to point 
the way? 

It would be interesting to you to be in the mission office at Atlanta 
and read some of the letters we receive. We received a letter from a man 
in Florida recently who said he was a reader of the Book of Mormon; 
he had found it the most interesting document he had ever read in his life, 
and he wondered why it was not used by all people in preference to the 
King James or any other translation of the Bible. A lady wrote in from 
Alabama. She said she had come to the conclusion "that Mormonism was 
the only true religion, and" she said, "I have always thought I could never 



ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 



25 



be anything but a Baptist." Then she asked for a price list of our 
literature, and added : "Mormonism is truly the most wonderful thing I 
have ever heard of. I have read different philosophies, psychology, psy- 
chiatry, Christian Science, etc., in fact I have almost exhausted every 
source of information in search of answers to my own life's problems ; 
needless to say the problems were not solved, but now I have hope." Then 
she added a word of gratitude to the Mormon Elders who called at her 
home. 

We received a letter from a minister in Ohio telling us that the people 
in his city were not willing to receive the full gospel, and the churches 
were not willing to have the full gospel preached from their pulpits, and 
he said he had been given to understand that the Mormons possessed the 
full gospel, and he would like to receive a little additional information 
about it. 

I close by leaving with you my testimony that this Gospel is in the 
earth to exalt men and women, not only after they die but while they are 
here, to lift them up from the common ways of life. It makes our farmers 
so that they do not just go out and farm, and return, and go back and farm 
again, and sit around on the porch as they do in some places where I have 
been, with no aim and no objective. But these men are interested in the 
things of God, they are interested in their Father's work, they are inter- 
ested in the salvation of youth, they have something to guide the destinies 
of their lives, and such is true of every man or woman who understands 
the beauty and the philosophy of this great Church. 

I thank God, my brethren and sisters, as testimony has been borne 
here today, for the privilege of representing you in the mission field. 
I am grateful for this work, and I am grateful for what it is doing for 
those who receive and embrace it and I am grateful for prophets to 
lead the way. May the Lord bless you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "High on the Mountain Top." 
Elder A. William Lund, Assistant Church Historian, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2:00 p. m. 

FIRST DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock p.m. 
The congregation sang the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 
Elder Albert L. Larsen, President of the San Bernardino Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The hymn, "O Ye Mountains High," was sung by the congregation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE

BISHOP DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance at this 
conference and to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, which is the Church of God. 

Soon after the social security plan was announced there appeared at 
the office of the Presiding Bishopric some who requested to join the 
Church. The questions put to them brought forth the statement that 
they liked the program and wanted to belong to a church which took care 
of its poor. Nothing else seemed to matter, the main objective was to 
be fed and cared for. This has not been unusual during the last six 
months. It is an almost daily occurrence at the Presiding Bishop's 
Office. People generally, it seems, have very little conception of what 
it means to belong to this Church. Generally, they will say: "What 
difference does it make to what church you belong, they all lead to the 
same end." 

I am not surprised at this coming from those who are not members 
and who are not familiar with the obligations placed upon members, 
but I am shocked to find so many who claim membership who apparently 
have similar ideas. We forget sometimes that the Church of our Lord 
is founded upon principles with a promise, and to obtain exaltation in 
his kingdom we must be obedient in all things. The Lord has made it 
clear to us that it is the responsibility of those who have plenty, to care 
for those who are in need, but he modifies that to the extent that those 
who are worthy may have claim upon the Church. We find in going 
over our records that a large portion of those who are in need are not 
worthy so far as obedience to the Gospel plan is concerned, for they are 
not obedient to, nor do they have respect for the laws of God. Just how 
far our responsibility should go towards those who find themselves in 
this condition is a question that must be answered through the spirit 
of love and fellowship. 

First, it is our responsibility, if they have been baptized and have 
been accepted into the Church, to labor with them diligently in the spirit 
of love ; teach them the Gospel principles, take them by the hand, so to 
speak, (for many of them are as the blind) and lead them into the 
truth and the light, where they may gain an understanding of the 
Church, the principles thereof, and their duty regarding these principles. 
While the Church is responsible for its poor, it is clearly set forth that 
it is the duty of the rich to give of their substance for the support of the 
poor. The Lord has said, "I say unto you, be one ; and if ye are not 
one, ye are not mine." 

We must be impressed with the thought that those who are poor 
are not entitled to help unless it is earned. "The soul of the sluggard 
desireth and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made 
fat." And, again, "The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; 
therefore shall he beg in harvest." (Prov. 20 :4) . 



BISHOP DAVID A. SMITH 



27 



"Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye 
also reap ; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your re- 
ward." (D. and C. 6-33). 

In the early history of the Church it was impressed upon the leaders 
of the Church to urge the people to be united, to have all things in 
common, that there should be no poor and none who were rich. As they 
moved from place to place they were given allotments, which were called 
their inheritance, and when they came to the valleys of the mountains, 
again allotments were given to Church members as their inheritance. Men 
did not quarrel over the choice of places ; they took that which was 
assigned to them. They were called to settle the valleys of the mountains 
and establish homes. They could have taken up in some places whole 
valleys, but their call was a mission, and the land was secured for them 
and those who should follow. This has been a Gospel principle, one of 
the principles upon which the Church has been established, a principle 
which obligates us in this day, which means that we are not only required 
to become familiar with the principles of the Gospel, but we are re- 
quired to apply those principles in our daily walks of life ; to walk 
uprightly before the Lord, to put aside selfishness and those things 
which come into the lives of men and make them selfish and lacking in 
consideration one for another, having no desire to be helpful to one 
another. 

In this day the world is troubled because many have not learned to 
know this principle, or have no respect for it, and therefore seek to take 
by force that which rightfully belongs to someone else. The world seems 
to be full of strife and turmoil because of selfishness, lacking in con- 
sideration for one another. 

The plan of the Gospel as revealed to us in this day permits us 
through our own efforts, our own faith, our own obedience, to become 
equal, equal in all things. How many will receive that blessing? How 
many will be worthy to stand in that group, we cannot say. 

In the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants the 
prophet tells us of his vision in which he saw the Father and the Son ; 
he saw the glory of the Celestial kingdom and those who may obtain it ; 
the glory of the Terrestrial kingdom, and the glory of the Telestial 
kingdom, and those who should occupy them, showing that even in the 
time to come there will be a division of equality. This condition will be 
brought about only through the failure of the children of God to be 
obedient to his laws which he has established, that his purposes should 
be brought about and his children receive exaltation wherein is the free 
agency of man, which makes them equal in all things, at least the oppor- 
tunity to be equal is embodied in the Lord's plan of salvation. 

It seems to me that we should keep these things in mind when we 
speak of charity, of relief, the priesthood, and the Church, for it takes 
each individual member to make up the Church, and where one is neglect- 
ed, where one is left to flounder alone without guidance, someone is 
responsible, and someone will be called to account. Therefore, it seems 
to me the way to bring about this condition is not altogether through a 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



division of property to make men equal, but through living in harmony 
with the Gospel, in teaching the Gospel in that energetic manner that will 
carry us into the homes of the wayward ones, those who hunger and thirst 
after righteousness. Many of them may not know the cause of their 
hunger, not having known, or, through disobedience, having lost the taste 
for spiritual food ; they may not discover the cause of their ailment 
unless someone who understands and appreciates the blessing thereof 
carries this spiritual food to them, feeds them, and helps them to under- 
stand. 

So I say, my brethren and sisters, it takes more than food to prepare 
us to be equal ; it takes more than Gospel principles to develop the 
Church. It requires the untiring effort of those who have received the 
priesthood, and thus taken upon them obligations which require that we 
serve our Father faithfully in the great work entrusted to our care, 
this obligation having come to us through acceptance of the holy priest- 
hood. 

May we be worthy of the Lord's help, may we become more united. 
With turmoil all about us, it is incumbent upon us that we draw near 
together in spiritual and temporal matters, that we become more obedient 
to the commandments of God. May we remember to pay our tithes and 
offerings, and meet together often, that we may partake of his Spirit and 
be edified, strengthened and become equal in his sight. May he bless 
us to this end, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

I shall attempt to enumerate briefly the unique and distinctive con- 
tributions of Joseph Smith. I shall not try to appraise their relative im- 
portance or set them forth in logical or chronological sequence. Most 
of these contributions are in the field of theological doctrine. Some, 
however, are of a more temporal nature. 

CERTAINTY CAME WITH FIRST VISION 

I name first a new conception of God and the Godhead. There 
can be no doubt that in the religious world of the Prophet's boyhood there 
prevailed a very nebulous and uncertain doctrine with reference to the 
personality of God and the personages of the trinity. The creedal state- 
ments of the day appear to us now as being most difficult of interpretation 
and understanding if not wholly unintelligible. To this situation the 
First Vision brought clarity, definiteness and certainty, not as the product 
of reasoning, argument and sophistication but with the sureness of expe- 
rience. When Joseph came out of the grove he had no need to argue for 
a theory, — he knew the facts. God is in form like a man. He has a voice. 
He speaks. He is considerate and kind. He answers prayer. His Son 
is a like but distinct person. He is obedient to the Father and the mediator 
between God and man. The presumption of God as a mere essence or 
principle of power and force in the universe was for all time exploded. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



29 



The testimony is direct and positive and irrefutable. Many have not 
believed but no one has ever had the knowledge to disprove it. The 
character of the Holy Ghost as a member of the Godhead came to the 
Prophet later through revelation with a clarity and definiteness exceeding 
other scriptural pronouncements on the subject. He set forth, "The 
Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's ; the Son also ; 
but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage 
of spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us." The 
identity and functions of the Holy Ghost are by him also differentiated 
from those of the Holy Spirit. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S CONCEPTION OF PRIESTHOOD 

Second, I point out a new conception of the nature of the priesthood. 
I pass by the restoration of the priesthood on which there is testimony 
of a character entitling it to admissibility in any tribunal, because the 
restoration postulates a withdrawal of the priesthood from men, which 
is a controversial subject. On the nature, duties and offices of the 
priesthood, however, I look in vain for any definitions comparable to 
those given by the Prophet. 

First there is the wide distribution of the powers and offices 
of the priesthood among men and boys of the Church. This was 
a complete innovation so far as modern Christian practice is con- 
cerned. None but a selected few had ever claimed or held the 
right before, although there is respectable historical evidence, not known 
to the Prophet, to warrant the belief that the same practice was extant 
in the early church. 

But even more important in its novelty do I regard the new con- 
stitution of the priesthood as revealed through Joseph Smith. To 
my thinking there is nothing more beautiful or truly Christ-like in all 
scripture than this lovely exposition of the divine commission to men 
to act in the name of God. Listen : 

Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are 
they not chosen? 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled 
nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we under- 
take to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to 
exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children 
of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw 
themselves ; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, 
Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man. — Doctrine and 
Covenants 121 :34-37 Incl. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned; 

By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the 
soul without hypocrisy, and without guile— 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward 
him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords 
of death. 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly ; then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine 
of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow 
unto thee forever and ever. — Doctrine and Covenants 121 :41-46 Incl. 

Here is the genius of the government of Christ. No compulsion, — 
just persuasion; no unrighteousness or autocracy, — only goodness and 
love. Here is the answer to the religious intolerance and crimes of the 
centuries ; the complete refutation of the alleged injustice of God. 

NEW CONCEPTS THROUGH LATTER-DAY REVELATION 

I mention next the matter of new revelation, by which is meant divine 
communication from God to men in these latter days. While this subject 
is highly important, I need not elaborate it, — first, because it is well un- 
derstood both within and without the Church ; and second, because its 
novelty has never been denied. I do not mean that the validity of the 
revelations to Joseph Smith have not been denied. They have, — but 
all concede the principle and practice to be an innovation. All logical 
persons will likewise concede that this doctrine once established is the 
end of all controversy as to authoritative religion. 

Then comes the new concept of man, his past, present and future 
state. I do not maintain that ideas had not been advanced, prior to the 
Prophet's time, that were in some respects comparable to his. Undoubt- 
edly the pre-existent state of man was in the belief of many. It could 
not be otherwise with students of the Bible, but no such comprehensive, 
coherent, and definite understanding as that set forth by the Prophet 
had ever appeared before. The continuity of intelligence and intelli- 
gencies ; the fatherhood, — and motherhood too, of our individual spirits ; 
the free agency and choice which were ours in the pre-earth lif e ; spiritual 
creation preceding mortal creation ; the relationship of body to spirit 
in this life and in the hereafter, the transcendent scheme of eternal 
progression, — all these and many related items constitute a unified, logical, 
authoritative exposition without counterpart in Christian literature. 

Of special interest is the concept of the body as tabernacle of the 
spirit. A philosophy of temporal living has been built around this idea. 
In it a man's body is a sacred thing. It is not his own to be violated with 
impunity. God provided it in the form of and as t # he house of his spirit. 
Any conscious, wilful impairment of the body is an affront to God. 
And so it follows that the care of the body has real spiritual significance. 
It is doubtful if any religious body at any time ever received a more 
unique and novel doctrine than the Word of Wisdom, the inhibitions 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



31 



of which are known to many but the underlying philosophy of which 
is understood by few. 

Closely related to the state of man is the concept of the whole human 
family as the children of God. On this subject many entirely new 
contributions were made by Joseph Smith. He established the universal 
justice and love of God for all His children as no one else has ever done. 
His theology denies the resurrection to none. All shall come forth from 
the grave ; all bodies shall be reunited with spirits to constitute eternal 
souls, through the universal redemption of the Savior. There will be 
general salvation for all in the sense in which the term is generally used, 
but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation. In the hereafter, 
as in this life, there are degrees of glory, preferential places and con- 
ditions. Goodness and obedience will bring their rewards, the highest 
of which is to dwell in the presence of God and His Son. The prescribed 
requirements of the Gospel, such as baptism, confirmation, and other 
ordinances are not prerequisites for the resurrection as many suppose. 
They are necessary only for exaltation, — the highest station. 

Exaltation is not planned merely for a few select ones. It is designed 
for all who will prepare to enter the Kingdom. Everyone is given the 
opportunity to prepare, not only those living but they who have died, as 
well. Such is the justice of the Father. 

THE PURPOSE OF TEMPLE WORK 

That brings me to another inestimable contribution, wholly dis- 
tinctive and novel. Strange it is that with the rather frequent mention 
in the Hebrew scriptures of temples and with the pointed and oft quoted 
reference to baptism for the dead that Joseph Smith should have been 
the first of all Christians to conceive the purpose of temples and institute 
vicarious work for the dead. This great project of the latter days 
deserves an extended treatise of itself. It must suffice for my present 
purpose merely to call attention to it. In its ramifications and compre- 
hensiveness it embraces substantially the entire scope of the Gospel. 
The story of life is simplified for the understanding of men. Through 
the eternal powers of the restored priesthood, ordinances and ceremonies 
are administered in preparation for entrance into the Celestial Kingdom 
of our God, and the dead who have lived without opportunity to enjoy 
these high privileges are accorded, through the service of their kins- 
people, the same rights as those who live. 

One of the features of temple work should for emphasis be specially 
mentioned. It is the sealing of husband and wife in the eternal covenant 
of marriage. Joseph Smith taught that the family circle is the founda- 
tion of exaltation and that its projection into eternity is heaven itself. 
He sanctified the association of loved ones. He made the father a 
priest and the mother a priestess in the temple of the home. If his 
glorious interpretation of this divine institution could have general 
application, the ills of society would be cured and the brotherhood of 
mankind established. This contribution alone entitles him to a place 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



on the very summit of distinction among the world's philosophers and 
benefactors. 

WISDOM SHOWN IN CHURCH ORGANIZATION 

The limitations of this opportunity prevent any further elaboration 
of additional items within the scope of my theme. I must pass them with 
bare mention. The organization of the Church ; its phenomenal growth ; 
its quorums, divisions, agencies, authorities, officers; its incomparable 
missionary system were all the product of the inspiration, the wisdom 
and vision of the Prophet. He was also a builder of cities, a statesman 
of great foresight and such a leader of men that even after death his 
influence has grown with the years. 

THE WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH 

His literary labors must not be forgotten. He produced more 
scripture, that is, the revealed word of God, than any other man of 
whom we have record. Indeed, his total scriptural productions would 
almost equal those of all others put together. Within the pages of the 
Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great 
Price, which came to the world through him, are to be found such truth 
gems as, "The glory of God is intelligence" ; "Men are that they might 
have joy" ; "For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass 
the immortality and eternal life of man" ; a clear statement of the 
purpose of good and evil in the world, a philosophical problem which 
has baffled the scholars of all times, and many others of inestimable 
value. There also came from him such memorable sayings as, "It is 
impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" ; "A man is saved no 
faster than he gets knowledge" ; "Whatever principle of intelligence we 
attain unto in this life it will rise with us in the resurrection." He wrote 
history and dissertations on many subjects and was an orator of mag- 
netism and convincing force. 

The world's enlightenment of the century following his life has not 
disclosed a single error in his theological and philosophical pronounce- 
ments, and the society which he established is without question the peer, 
and many students not belonging to it maintain it is the superior, of all 
social systems on the earth. 

What is the explanation? How may we account for these re- 
markable accomplishments, these transcendent contributions to the learn- 
ing, the knowledge and wisdom of this age? 

JOSEPH SMITH CHOSEN OF GOD 

The critics of Joseph Smith have ridiculed him. They have em- 
phasized the crudity of his youth, his lack of education and deprecated 
his intelligence. In so doing, have they helped find the explanation? 
Perhaps they have, without intent on their part, for the more inadequate 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



33 



by native endowment and training they make the Prophet, the more 
certainly do they lead the way to the inevitable conclusion that the 
explanation he makes of himself and his work is the only explanation. 
If he had been proved to be a person of unusual brilliance and education 
there might have been some warrant for the presumption that out of his 
own mind he had conceived and executed all, but those who have sought 
to destroy him have robbed the argument of that premise. Perhaps 
God willed it so. Even the inimical and abusive typesetter who printed 
the Book of Mormon unwittingly laid a stone in the foundation of evi- 
dence establishing the truth of the Prophet's account of the translation 
when he ridiculed the punctuation and composition of the manuscript, 
the sentences and words being run together as they naturally would be 
in the manner of dictation to the scribe described by the Prophet. 

There is only one explanation which is tenable. God chose this 
man. He spoke through him. The virgin, unsophisticated mind of the 
youth was a fertile field for the planting of spiritual seeds. They grew 
and matured into a perfect faith that brought Joseph into partnership 
with God. When that came to be, there was nothing unattainable, for 
as we are told of old, one man and God are a majority. 

Today we proclaim him Prophet and sing his praise as sincerely, 
as devoutly, as reverently as they did one hundred years ago when 
they sat in his presence and felt the inspiration of his influence and heard 
the word of God from his lips. 

Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah ! 
Jesus anointed that 'Prophet and Seer' — 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations revere. 

A CHARGE TO BE TRUE 

It would seem scarcely necessary to point out the obvious con- 
clusion and purpose of this recital. If any man has received in his heart 
the witness of the divine truth embraced in the contributions of the 
Prophet Joseph, I charge him to be true, — true to his testimony, true 
to the Prophet, the founder, true to the cause and its duly commissioned 
leaders, true to the covenants he has made in holy places, and true to 
the brotherhood of man in the service that he renders. If any man has 
not received this witness, I appeal for his thoughtful, prayerful, sym- 
pathetic consideration. I offer to him, out of the experiences of my life, 
a humble but certain assurance that if he will receive and apply the 
teachings of Joseph Smith he will be made happy. Doubt and uncertainty 
will leave him. Glorious purpose will come into life. Family ties will 
be sweeter. Friendships will be dearer. Service will be nobler, and 
the peace of Christ will be his portion. I so testify in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A vocal solo, "The Lord's Prayer," (Malotte) was sung by Rampton 
Barlow.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 




ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 



President of the California Mission 



My brethren and sisters, it is a glorious thing to have the opportunity 
of coming home once every six months to meet with you in conference 
assembled and to hear the instructions that come to us from the brethren. 
The organization of this Church is marvelous, the opportunity it gives its 
membership to do good work is remarkable, and no one could be a worthy 
member of it except he or she do good work. 

I bring greetings from California. We have 8,558 members in that 
great mission field, and 106 missionaries every one of whom is enjoying 
good health. The Lord has indeed been good to us and we are grateful 
for his blessings. 

I was thrilled when President Grant said to us this morning that 
eighty-three of the stakes of Zion have reported that the)'' are able to take 
care of their worthy poor. I want to say that the California Mission will 
take care of its worthy poor. The spirit of the membership of the mission 
is wonderful. The little branch of Douglas, Arizona, with 264 members, 
remitted only a few weeks ago a check for five hundred dollars, represent- 
ing fast offerings which they desired to turn into the mission office that 
we might have means to help some other branch that is not so favored as 
are they. Reports from every branch indicate that they are able to provide 
for their own needs, and I was somewhat chagrined at the report from 
one branch president in answer to the questions that I sent out : "When 
the government withholds relief, will you be able to provide for those in 
your branch?" He replied, "Yes, for when our relief stops we will go 
back on our farms and earn our own livelihood." 

This morning when President Grant spoke of the banker I thought 
of that instance. I wondered, how could it be possible that Latter-day 
Saints would sit idly by and eat the bread of the worker? Truly we have 
led the way. What marvelous editorials have appeared in the papers along 
the coast, commending the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
for its stand ! It has been thrilling to read them. The San Francisco 
Chronicle said: "If all churches would but follow the lead of the Mor- 
mons, there would be no want in the world." 

When those who have shall give to those who have not ; when the 
spirit of greed is overcome ; when selfishness is done away, truly then are 
we a brotherhood. That of course is what we are as a Church, and 
faithful members of this Church shall never want. The Lord himself 
will open the way to provide for all. I am grateful for this move that 
has been made, I am grateful for the response that has come back to the 
brethren, that we stand behind them one hundred per cent. I am sure 
that the various nations of the earth must take notice of what love is ac- 
complishing among the people in Western America. 

About eight months ago a gentleman came from Salt Lake City to - 
Los Angeles. He came to talk on "The New Day in Mormonism." I 
received a telephone invitation to appear at this meeting. When I arrived 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH

there, to my surprise it was composed entirely of Presbyterian ministers, 
and this good man proceeded to tell them what the Mormons believed, and 
of all the absurd things I ever heard he uttered them there. I was aston- 
ished that in this day such accusations could be made. He talked of blood 
atonement. He told of a man who worked for Z. C. M. I. and disappeared 
over night, the supposition being, of course, that the Danites had taken 
him and his life had been sacrificed. I wondered how it was possible that 
such a thing could be, but there were many other things that were just as 
ridiculous uttered by this man. 

Within the past week, in fact last Sunday, I was pleased to encounter 
a different spirit. Again I was invited to go to a meeting where a minister 
was going to talk on the Book of Mormon, "What the other man thinks." 
Imagine my astonishment when that good man stood up to begin his 
address, and began reading from the Doctrine and Covenants and the 
Book of Mormon, and declaring that this scripture was written a hundred 
years ago, and that the man who wrote it must have been inspired from 
Almighty God or he could not have said such things. Then he stopped 
and said: "I am a Presbyterian minister, I am not a member of the 
Mormon Church," and two or three times during his sermon he stopped 
to let us know that he was not a Latter-day Saint. 

This man was Dr. Carl S. Knopf, dean of the School of Religion 
of the University of Southern California, where they have some eleven 
thousand students. He had touched "the hem of the garment" of one of 
the Apostles of the living God ; he had come under the influence of John A. 
Widtsoe and so had been changed, for tolerance had crept into his heart 
and a spirit of f raternalism and a desire to clasp hands with the Latter- 
day Saints. All who were there were thrilled, and at the close of his 
sermon, as we went forward to shake hands with him, I told him it was 
the finest sermon I had heard on Mormonism for a long time. 

A woman from Wyoming said : "I came to tell you that what you 
have said about this people is true. I was opposed to them, I hated the 
very word 'Mormon', but I was astonished when I went to Utah to live 
to find that they would come and help me to live and give me sustenance. 
I have been amazed at what I have seen there, and what you have said 
here is the absolute truth. They are the kindest people in the world." 

At the conclusion of his sermon he uttered a prayer, and one of the 
missionaries wrote it down. He quoted from Moroni 8th chapter, 9th to 
22nd verses, and explained it. He quoted from the Articles of Faith and 
pointed out in how many instances he could shake hands with us. He 
quoted from Moroni 9th chapter and 4th verse, and Alma 11th chapter 
43rd and 45th verses. This was his prayer : 

Our Father, it is just a little difficult to understand why thou hast 
so made us that we can have these radical differences of opinion and yet 
at many points have such wonderful ideals and all of us try in our way 
to follow in the footsteps of the Master, but, our Father, we do pray this, 
that if that is to be an exercise of good will and faith, if thou hast made 
us different just so we can exercise charity and love and learn how to love, 
even without having identical thought .... we would pray that thou 
give us the spirit of understanding, that we may clasp hands with our 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fellow men and even clasping hands with disagreement in some of our 
fundamental thoughts, yet clasping hands with agreement on some of the 
great issues. May we stand shoulder to shoulder for those issues and 
make the world better because we believe mightily in the things of the 
Spirit. So we pray that those who are Methodists may be good Metho- 
dists, and those who are Presbyterians be good Presbyterians, and those 
who are Mormons be good Mormons. O Father, we realize that in every 
one of these divisions of thy church there stands the central figure of 
Jesus Christ, that in every one of these divisions there are many good 
things. Help us to join together in the exaltation of the good. And now 
we pray for mercy and peace, the love of good, the faith, the fellowship 
of the Holy Spirit to be and abide now and always. 

Dr. Knopf said : 

I am reading from a book, not a cold book from cold library shelves, 
but I am reading from a book, (holding up the Book of Mormon, 
Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price) that has been the 
inspiration of a young man who has now come to the University to teach 
courses there. When one of the professors came to teach religion he 
said that only one or two students would not suffice for his attention, 
that he might just as well close the whole thing up. This young Mormon 
man said he would be delighted to give all his time if he could save but 
one, and he would be happy to carry on his class. 

The doctor was thrilled at the attitude of this young Mormon, Brother 
Byron Done, who is taking the place of Dr. Widtsoe. 

God bless this Church and its leadership. I know that he is blessing 
it. I am grateful for the opportunity that has been given to serve in it, 
and hope that I shall always be worthy of the confidence that has been 
reposed in me. That God's blessings may be in each and every one of your 
homes, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am indeed happy for the privilege I have in standing before you 
this afternoon and reporting briefly the Northwestern States Mission. 
We have been highly blessed in having President Grant speak to us 
in five of the largest cities of the northwest to record crowds. His 
inspiring sermons were received with gratitude and thanksgiving. It 
is beyond my power to express the gratitude we feel in having President 
Grant with us in these various parts of the country. We have also 
been honored and blessed with a recent visit of Apostle Stephen L. 
Richards who toured a part of the mission with us. He left valuable 
instructions and inspired the many people who gathered together to 
hear him. His advice to our missionaries was inspirational and very 
helpful to them. We were also highly favored with the presence of 
Apostle George Albert Smith and others of the general authorities of 
the Church. Naturally we feel very grateful for these leaders of the 
Church. 

We have at the present time laboring in our mission, seventy-eight 
very fine missionaries. These young men and women are striving with 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



37 



all their might to deliver the message that has been vouchsafed to them 
into the homes of many people, upon the streets, in halls, and in our 
various meeting places. 

We have had some sickness among our missionaries, but I am very 
thankful to say that at the present time, they are all well. We appreciate 
beyond measure the help they are receiving from their homes. The faith 
and the prayers that are being exercised in their behalf are a sustaining 
power in the great responsibilities that have been placed upon them. 
These young men and women need the encouraging support of all. 

I think one of the delightful things of missionary life is to see the 
development and growth that takes place in the hearts and in the minds 
of these young men and women. They of necessity learn the value of 
prayer. They appreciate that in their communion with God comes a 
strengthening of their faith. They have a deeper understanding of the 
Gospel, a finer respect for the authorities of the Church, indeed they 
develop an assurance that the work in which they are engaged is of God. 

I believe in prayer. It brings you and me in closer touch with God, 
our Eternal Father. To my mind, there is no thought equal to a thought 
of God. It becomes the most precious and holiest thought we can hold. 
Prayer is the agency through which we obtain a firmer testimony con- 
cerning the divinity of this great and marvelous work that has been 
brought to us through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Prayer is the mellowing power that gives us a love for our fellow man. 

I shall never forget as long as I live the prescription that I received 
from President E. J. Wood, who was my mission president on the 
Samoan Islands. He said, "What you really need is three ounces of 
evening and morning prayer, three ounces of determination, three ounces 
of diligence ; place them in a bottle of adaptability, shake with the hand 
of strength, administer with the power of faith, and I believe you will 
get along all right" — a good prescription for anyone. It needs daily 
application to understand its power and effectiveness. 

I believe that prayer causes us or enables us to overcome our weak- 
nesses. Just recently I picked up a Millennial Star and I read a fine 
article written by Elder Stephen L. Richards, a part of which I quote : 
"Youth should know that obedience is not bondage, but liberty — liberty 
under law; that the only real freedom is the freedom from our weak- 
nesses, from the vices, the remorse of conscience, and the infraction 
of law. When youth understands that the bending of the will in obedience 
tends to liberty and joy, then lawlessness, disrespect, and irreverence 
will wane. I wish that youth could realize that the only death to be 
feared is the death that is the wages of sin, and that the Gospel program 
of living is insurance against that dreadful calamity ; that the command- 
ments of God, both the "shalts" and the "shalt nots," and the warnings, 
reproofs, and admonitions of God's servants are all kindly calculated 
to hedge around the precious age of youth with safeguards which shall 
protect its course until the age of wisdom and judgment shall be reached." 
These truths that are so beautifully expressed seem to me to carry a 
deep and abiding truth. When anyone succumbs to evil thoughts or 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



evil doings, he loses a certain amount of power and light ; and because 
of this, he brings himself under bondage to sin. After all, freedom 
comes to one in overcoming evil tendencies. Prayer will enable us to 
overcome these weaknesses, and at the same time provide for us a 
faith that will assure us that God lives and that through the light and 
power of his Holy Spirit will lead us along the paths of righteousness. 
I believe that we should not only have a believing faith, but we should 
have a knowing faith. By a knowing faith, I mean the assurance that 
God lives and he does answer prayers. I think that one of the most 
satisfying things is that assurance that comes through the administration 
on the part of the Elders when they lay their hands upon the sick, that 
they will recover from their afflictions. This gift of faith is developed 
through the agency of prayer especially when that prayer is answered 
upon the heads of those who may be stricken with sickness and disease. 

The assurance that we have when we read these sublime words in 
the Doctrine and Covenants fills one with joy and happiness: "That 
which is of God is light ; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, 
receiveth more light ; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until 
the perfect day." This is a perfect scripture — so full of faith and 
assurance. Again I quote: "Faith comes by hearing the word of God 
through the testimony of the servants of God, and that testimony is 
always attended by the spirit of prophecy and revelation." May I say 
to you, my brothers and sisters, that if there is any joy in the world it is 
that joy which accompanies one in lifting his voice in the defense of this 
great and mighty work which has been revealed to us in this day and 
time. When we are in possession of the light of truth, we are in pos- 
session of testimony ; and when we are in the light of testimony, we 
develop a love for our fellow man, and without a love for our fellow 
man it would indeed be hard to impress him with the Gospel of our Lord 
and Master, Jesus Christ. It is through a love for our fellow man that 
we are able to place an interpretation upon the saving graces of the 
Gospel. 

In closing, I desire to leave with you my testimony that I know that 
God lives, that he answers prayer, that he is a re warder of them who 
diligently seek him, that the light of truth comes to us through humble 
and sincere prayer. I bear testimony that I know that Joseph Smith 
was indeed a Prophet of Almighty God, raised up in this day and time 
to restore the everlasting Gospel of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. 
I sincerely pray that God will bless this testimony to our good and 
to his service, in his name, Amen. 

ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, representing that great contribution of this 
Church, the missionary system, I have joy in speaking for the North Cen- 
tral States Mission. This is a fairly new mission in point of time. There 
is pioneering yet to be done, but growth and development are manifest. 



ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 39 

We find unusual joy in our association with the young men and women 
who come to us as missionaries. Seventy-three of them are there at the 
present time, laboring in love and harmony and in loyalty. I think it 
would be impossible to find a sweeter spirit of service than that manifest 
by these young people. Pushed as they are to the limit of service, and oft- 
times feeling their personal weaknesses, they come to rely upon the Spirit 
of our Father in heaven, which is their safety. There isn't anything that 
they will not attempt when invited to do so. They are teachable, they are 
desirous of using sacredly the help which comes from their homes. As I 
talk to some of the missionaries about the use of their money, and the 
effort expended by their parents at home to secure it, I am reminded of 
that experience recounted in the life of King David of Israel. 

King David and his men were being pursued by the Philistines and 
were seriously in need of water to drink. Some of his loyal soldiers took 
their lives in their hands and slowly worked past the lines of the enemy 
to secure water from the well in Bethlehem, where as a boy David had 
refreshed himself. When the water was brought to him, he was overcome 
by the sacrifice and could not drink it. He poured it out unto the Lord. 

The money that comes into the missionary field is being used, we 
think, wisely. We hope that you parents at home will feel that our best 
wisdom will be used in instructing missionaries in its use. It is a sacred 
thing, this giving up a part of our lives and our money, to take the mes- 
sage to the world, and these your sons and daughters are dong it with 
dignity and power in the North Central States Mission. 

We have many fine members in that mission, something less than 
three thousand, scattered through the States and some of the Provinces 
of Canada. These members are showing remarkable faith, they are dili- 
gent in their effort to understand and live the Gospel. They are sending 
their sons and daughters into the world as missionaries. We have ten in 
other missions giving regular and full time service. This greatly stimu- 
lates and strengthens the families and branches from which they came. 
It brings a number of our members to Salt Lake City with the mission- 
aries as they depart. It encourages them to make an effort to go to the 
temple, and partake of those many other active spiritual influences which 
are here. 

We want to thank you brethren and sisters here at home who have 
received so hospitably the members from the mission as they come to 
visit among you. They return to us greatly encouraged. They find the 
principles of the Gospel practiced here and rejoice in it. These members 
come back to us with increased spirit and testimony. It is an effective 
means of creating strength in our mission. 

A number of things emanating from the headquarters of the Church 
are helping us in our work. For some time, of course, we have felt the 
power of the Bureau of Information work on this block. We find that 
those who have visited here are always ready to receive the missionaries 
and to learn more of the Church which they represent.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



In our territory many families listen regularly to the Tabernacle 
choir and organ recitals, dedicating that Sunday morning period to wor- 
ship with us. The Security Program offered by the Church has opened 
an avenue of discussion in the homes and the lives of many upon whom 
our missionaries call. Not only has it opened an intense interest, but it 
has also created a very definite responsibility. The eyes of the world are 
upon us and we are expecting to carry the program forward with com- 
plete success. 

The travels of President Grant and the publicity given him have 
done much to give us audience. The radio talks and especially the 
Church of the Air programs are very effective for good. 

All of these activities from the headquarters of the Church are open- 
ing up very definite opportunities for missionary service. It isn't often 
that we receive visitors from the headquarters of the Church. We have 
been recently favored with visitors from the Mutual Improvement Board 
— Brother Oscar A. Kirkham and Sister Clarissa A. Beesley — they left in 
our mission a message of Mutual Improvement work which shall inspire 
us for a considerable time. We appreciate their visit. 

The outstanding experience of the year was the visit of Elder Char- 
les A. Callis of the Council of the Twelve who spent three weeks with us. 
He went into some places where General Authorities of the Church have 
not been able to visit before. He attracted the attention of many people to 
our meetings who are not members of the Church. Some fifty per cent or 
more of all those who attended these twenty- four public meetings were 
non-members. He bore his testimony in power and explained the Gospel 
with clearness. Meetings were held with the missionaries in all our dis- 
tricts, he inspired them in their work and left them his blessing. We are 
grateful for his visit and the power of his message and testimony. We 
always greatly appreciate the visits of those who preside over us. 

My brethren and sisters, this missionary work is making headway 
and is attracting attention — the lump is gradually being leavened. We feel 
that prejudice is being broken down in many places. We are able to con- 
tact people now where two years ago it would have been impossible. Many 
invitations are coming which heretofore never would have been received. 

We are grateful for the kindness of the Lord unto us, for the trust 
and confidence of our brethren in presiding positions of the Church to 
sustain and support us in our work of responsibility. 

May God bless you, my brethren and sisters, here at home. We are 
proud of your efforts and those of your missionary sons and daughters. 
We are trying to use those efforts to the glory of God in the North Cen- 
tral States Mission. May peace and harmony attend the members of this 
Church everywhere, to the end that we may all walk hand in hand with 
God and his purposes in the accomplishment of this great and important 
work, which I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH

ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

It is a pleasure to meet you again in conference and partake of the 
fine spirit that is here. The friendly mountains surrounding these 
valleys are a welcome sight to those who have been away for a few 
months. 

It has been in the mountains that God's people have always grown 
to strength. I rather think it was the sight of these towering peaks 
that caused Orson Pratt to select, as his subject the first Sabbath in the 
valley, Isaiah 2:2: 

And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the 
house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and 
shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

At least, those of us who have once partaken of the spirit of these 
mountains always welcome the opportunity to return. 

It is a pleasure to bring you greetings from the missionaries and 
saints in the Canadian Mission. Especially to those parents to whom I 
may not get to speak personally, I am happy to say that all the mis- 
sionaries are well. I have just completed a tour of the mission and found 
the missionaries happy indeed in the great work they are doing. 

The fraternal spirit among the missionaries is wonderful. The 
love the Gospel gives them for God's children seems to be intensified 
for their fellow workers until their attitude toward each other is wonder- 
ful, and the effect on their lives so wholesome that they are envied by 
the people of the world. 

A bishop of the Church of the Christian Brotherhood told me that 
he had never met finer men than our Elders with whom he was acquainted. 

The missionaries are a hard working group, meeting many obstacles 
as well as many happy situations. I know of no work that calls for 
greater versatility, better judgment and more sustained effort than to 
be a successful missionary, neither do I know any work that better 
prepares one for a happy, successful life. 

Last June we were greatly blessed by a visit from Elder Charles 
A. Callis. We toured the mission by automobile covering 3,500 miles. 
The farther we drove and the more meetings we held the better Brother 
Callis seemed to like it. He inspired us all with his energy and zeal 
for the work, his appreciation for the beautiful and historic spots so 
numerous in the Canadian Mission, and above all with his knowledge 
and testimony of the Gospel. 

Sister Beesley of the Mutual General Board came to Toronto and 
held a Mutual convention. Her visit was a delight to the large crowd 
that gathered from many parts. It is the first time, as far as I know, 
that a General Board member has visited the Canadian Mission. The 
people are still talking of Sister Beesley's splendid discussions and 
fine spirit. I am sure that the fruits of this visit will be seen in Mutual 
work throughout the year.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The auxiliary associations of the Church, especially the Relief 
Society, M. I. A., and Primary, are so different from anything found 
in the churches of the world and so admirably fill a felt need that they 
are popular with the people. M Men and Vanguard, Gleaner and Bee- 
hive classes are usually largely non-members of the Church and occa- 
sionally the entire class is non-members. 

A mother in the City of Ottumwa came to the lady missionaries 
and asked them to try to interest her daughter in M. I. A, for she 
said it had had such a wholesome effect on the girl's older sister. 

It has been but a short time since we established missionaries in 
the city of Orillia and although we have but very few members, the 
missionaries there established a Primary, and after the Primary work 
had been going for about three weeks mothers came to these young 
men and said: "We thank you for the fine wholesome influence which 
this work is having upon our children in their home life." 

The genealogical work, also, is very attractive to the people. It 
appeals to everyone who hears it. A newspaper reporter came to our 
home a week or two ago to get a report of a conference we were holding 
in Toronto. We told her something of the genealogical work of the 
Church and then she said : 

"That is the most interesting thing I have ever heard in all my 
life." 

Thus the Gospel of Jesus Christ is filling a felt need in the world 
today. 

Dr. George H. Betts, a noted psychologist, said that every thinking 
man is asking himself these questions : 

1. Is there a God? Who? What kind? Whence? 

2. Whence came and whither goeth man? 

3. What has God to do with the running of our lives and the universe? 

The answer of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ to all these 
questions is so definite and clear that all may understand. 

The same author says that religion should do the following three 
things for the individual : 

1. Religion serves the individual by adding to his serenity of mind, 
giving him hope, sense of security, and happiness. 

2. Religion defines a way of life, outlines a system of ethics, provides 
certain norms for conduct, sets up ideals. 

3. Religion motivates certain lines of conduct, supplies the drive for the 
pursuit of ideals, gives fortitude to withstand hardships. 

From this point of view it seems that religion was never so needed 
as in the present condition of the world. 

But for religion to set up ideals and define life's goals and motivate 
conduct and supply the drive for carrying out the ideals it must be a 
reli gion from which one gets a personal testimony of God and his 
relation to God in this life and in the future. 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 



43 



So many people fail to find these fine things in religion because 
their religion has been a thing apart from their daily life and they have 
never received that touch of divine inspiration that gives newness of life. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ calls one to action, and through accom- 
plishment we find the joy that passeth understanding. 

From a clipping from a recent paper we get the following interesting 
item from Joseph Fort Newton: 

NO PARKING 

Einstein tells us that nowhere in the universe is there such a thing as 
a hitching-post. No doubt he is right ; but why should he put the truth in 
the language of horse and buggy days ? 

To bring his idea up to date he should have said that no matter how far 
we go in the universe, we see the same sign which faces us on our city 
streets — "No Parking on Either Side at Any Time." 

There it is, staring us in the face, whether we like it or not. If we try 
to pull up to the curb and stop, a blunt voice tells us brusquely to "Move on" 
even when we do not want to go on. 

Otherwise we get in the way, hold up the traffic, and halt the human 
procession. Life is activity, growth, movement. It will not stand hitched. 
If we stop we are left behind, outdated, outmoded. 

Life is effort, struggle, the putting forth of energy. It is by going that 
we arrive, by doing that we learn. We live on a slippery slope. If we do 
not go forward, we slip back and lose our footing. 

It is so on all the roads of the world. In any walk of life, if a man 
stops thinking, stops studying and parks his mind, he loses the truth. He 
ceases to be a leader and becomes just a relic. 

"The truth goes marching on," sings a thrilling hymn. "Time makes 
ancient good uncouth," a great poet tells us. Unless we keep step with the 
truth, keep our minds alert and active, we lose it. 

There is always truth ahead, more truth, new truth, new light to break 
forth, new roads to travel, new goals to win, The Gospel of life is "The 
Gospel of going on and still to be," rejoicing. 

Even at the end of life there is the same sign, "No parking." Death 
is only another beginning — the greatest of all adventures ; and heaven is 
the place where lost things are found ! 

Thus from this man of the world we get a graphic picture of the 
principle of eternal progression so distinctly a doctrine of the restored 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Because of these outstanding things that the Gospel has for the 
world, that are so distinctly a part of the doctrine of our Gospel, we 
are happy in our work in the Canadian Mission. The missionaries are 
a loyal, faithful group. Together we are striving to carry out the work 
as outlined by the authorities of the Church. We feel keenly our re- 
sponsibility and the trust placed in us and are thoughtfully and prayer- 
fully endeavoring to discharge this responsibility to the benefit of the 
people among whom we are working and we are receiving a joy and 
happiness that gives our testimonies of the divinity of Jesus Christ and of 
the divine mission of Joseph Smith increased strength day by day. 

I humbly pray that God will bless and strengthen this great work, 
and so guide and bless each of us that we can carry well our part of 
the great responsibility that our Heavenly Father has intrusted to us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BISHOP JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am impressed to speak to you on the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper. It was instituted near the close of the Master's life. His 
earthly ministry was over, his public service was ended. He was staying 
at Bethany when he said to his apostles, "We will keep the Passover." 
He sent Peter and John to prepare for this great annual event and said 
unto them : 

Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a 
pitcher of water : follow him. 

And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the good man of the house, 
The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the 
passover with my disciples? 

And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared : 
there make ready for us. 

And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as 
he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover. 

No doubt his disciples went to the temple, purchased a lamb without 
blemish and prepared it in the room they had rented. And when the 
time was come he sat down with the Twelve. They partook of unleavened 
bread and bitter herbs which reminded them of their sufferings in Egypt, 
and of the roasted lamb procured at the temple, and no doubt performed 
the usual rites prescribed by the strict Jewish ritual. 

When the Passover ceremony was completed and while they were 
still at the table in the room, the Master took some of the unleavened 
bread, blessed it and gave to each of his disciples, saying, "Take, eat ; 
this is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me." 

He then took the cup of wine, which on the Passover day was usually 
three-fourths wine and one-fourth water, gave thanks and blessed it, 
and gave it to them with the command : "Drink ye all of it ; for this is my 
blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission 
of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of 
the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's 
kingdom." 

The simple ceremony of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was 
inaugurated so that his disciples would perpetually remember his death, 
his atonement, and his teachings. 

The Apostle Paul had raised up a branch of the church at Corinth. 
Learning that there were some abuses growing in this large branch, he 
wrote them a letter and in this letter he said : 

For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, 
that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread : 

And when he had given thanks he brake it and said, Take eat, this 
is my body, which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me. 

After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye, as oft as 
ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 



BISHOP JOHN WELLS 



45 



For as often as ye eat bread, and drink this cnp, ye do show the 
Lord's death till he come. 

Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of 
the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 

But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, 
and drink of that cup. 

For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh 
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 

For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 

The Apostles were no doubt strongly impressed with the solemn 
words he expressed on the night before his crucifixion. The unleavened 
bread and the lamb of the Passover were looked upon as memorials 
of their deliverance from Egypt. The Passover had already been in- 
stituted to remind the Jews of the coming of Christ, his great atoning 
sacrifice which he should make. Now the old Passover symbol had been 
fulfilled. Jesus was about to leave them. His public ministry was 
ended. He would no longer be with them and they needed some common 
bond which would link them to each other and to their Master, and 
in this simple but impressive manner was instituted the spiritual bond 
or covenant, the ordinance known to us as the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper. The bread and wine, duly consecrated by prayer, became em- 
blems of the Lord's body and blood, to be eaten and drunk reverently in 
remembrance of him. This ceremony is full of deep spiritual significance. 

When the Master established his church on this western continent, 
he did not leave the Nephites in doubt as to his identity, nor as to his 
wishes concerning the Lord's supper. After the great destruction and 
cataclysm, many of the people who were left gathered around the Land 
Bountiful. A voice was heard among all the inhabitants of the land : 

Beheld, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the Heavens 
and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father 
from the beginning. I am in the Father and the Father in me; and in 
me hath the Father glorified his name. 

I came unto my own and my own received me not. And the scriptures 
concerning me are fulfilled. 

And as many as have received me, to them have I given to become 
the sons of God ; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my 
name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses 
fulfilled. 

I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the 
beginning and the end. 

And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood ; yea, 
your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will 
accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings. 

And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a 
contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a 
contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost 

Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the 
world, to save the world from sin. 

The Savior ministered to the Nephites and taught them the Gospel. 
Many marvelous things happened among this chosen people. But now 
he was about to leave and in order that they might be kept mindful of 
his coming and of his mission, he instituted among them the same sacra-

ment of the Lord's supper, as he had among the disciples on the eastern 
continent. He asked his disciples to bring bread and wine, and while they 
were absent he had the people sit down on the grass, and when the 
disciples brought this bread and wine he blessed it and broke the bread, 
gave it to his disciples, who afterwards gave it to the multitude. He 
said it should be given unto the people of his church and to all those 
who should believe and be baptized in his name. His final words were 
as follows : 

And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even 
as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you. 

And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown 
unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always 
remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my spirit 
to be with you. 

He emphasized the thought that in partaking of the bread they do 
it in remembrance of his body, and in partaking of the wine they should 
do it in remembrance of his blood, and witness unto the Father that 
they would always remember him. 

On the 6th day of April, 1830, when the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was organized, and after the usual preliminaries 
preparatory to organizing the Church under the laws of the State of 
New York, the Prophet and his friend, Oliver Cowdery, were sustained 
as the first and second elders of the Church, and then the sacrament 
of the Lord's supper was administered and partaken of by the baptized 
members of the Church present on that occasion. At that meeting the 
Saints were advised that it was expedient that the Church should meet 
together often, and partake of bread and wine in remembrance of the 
Lord Jesus. The prayers to be used in this sacred ordinance were also 
given. Later, while the Prophet was in quest of wine to administer 
the sacrament, he was told by the Lord : 

For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat 
or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that 
ye do it with an eye single to my glcry — remembering unto the Father 
my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed 
for the remission of your sins. 

The question might be asked, "How often should we partake of 
these emblems ?" The Lord has not left us in doubt about this matter, for 
in a revelation given August 7, 1831, known as Section 59, the Lord 
stated : 

Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, 
even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 

And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the 
world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments 
upon my holy day. 

For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, 
and to pay thy devotion unto the Most High. 

The records of the Church show that many members absent them- 
selves from this important meeting. Does this mean that we do not 
fully understand or appreciate the importance of the sacrament and the 



BISHOP JOHN WELLS 47 

blessings that come from partaking of it? Every individual who has 
complied with the ordinances of the Gospel and has become a member 
of the Church is expected and required to attend the sacramental service 
on the Lord's day and there partake of this holy ordinance. It is a 
privilege to be counted worthy to partake of this sacrament. 

We have considered the institution of the sacrament by the Master 
himself, with its impressive purpose of being an abiding memorial of 
the life, teachings and Gospel of the Master. Now let us consider its 
benefits and blessings to us as members of the Church. 

The efficacy of partaking of the sacrament is contingent on our 
worthiness. We must partake of it in faith, must be sincerely repentant 
and desire forgiveness for ourselves and be ready to forgive others. If 
we partake of it worthily, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, in 
meekness, reverence, humility, and in the spirit of worship, it will bring 
to us a chastening and purifying spirit. 

What an inspiration and strength it gives to know there is someone 
who is so interested in us that if we will take upon us his name and 
keep his commandments, he, in turn, promises that his spirit shall abide 
with us. In the many trials and temptations of life, what a source of 
comfort this promise gives. When partaken of often and in the proper 
spirit, it is a safeguard against evil, and we shall develop an intimate 
fellowship with God and with one another. It will give us a richness 
of spirit, and it will uplift, ennoble and develop an active, living faith 
within us. 

It is my sincere prayer for the Latter-day Saints that we may attend 
to our sacramental meetings and reap the rich blessings in store for 
us. May the Lord bless us in our endeavors to do so, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "How Firm a Foundation," after 
which the closing prayer was offered by Elder Elmer E. Hinckley, Presi- 
dent of the Nevada Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10:00 Saturday morning, October 3. 

SECOND DAY 
MORING MEETING 

The Conference reconvened Saturday morning, October 3, at 10 
o'clock a. m. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers (Sister Charlotte O. Sackett, 
director) provided the music for this session of the Conference, and 
sang as an opening number "Holy Art Thou," (Largo). 

Elder Marvin O. Ashton, President of the Highland Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

An alto solo, "List! The Cherubic Host," (Gaul), was sung by 
Mrs. Emery Epperson.

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Tivelve Apostles 

APPRECIATION FOR BLESSINGS 

I desire to express to the Lord in your presence, my brethren and 
sisters, the gratitude I feel this morning for the blessings of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. I am thankful that my grandparents heard and received 
the Gospel in their native land, England — that they forsook the traditions 
and the religion of their fathers and joined with the Saints in Nauvoo 
and later came to these valleys of the mountains, and that I had the 
privilege of being born of goodly parents under the Celestial law of 
marriage and have had the environment of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
and of faithful men and women, and that my heart has been inclined 
to love and obey the truth. 

I desire to show to the Lord my appreciation of his blessings in the 
ordinances, the gifts and all the blessings of the Gospel by living an 
orthodox life, being orthodox in thought and in my living and in my 
teaching. A true Christian — that is what I would like to be. 

CERTAINTY CAME WITH VISION OF FATHER AND SON 

Expressive of the principles of the Gospel, I desire to say that 
as I view it, the most important event in many centuries affecting 
mankind occurred in Manchester, New York, in the Spring of 1820 
when the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, revealed themselves anew 
to the world, through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
whom the Lord raised up for this and other important purposes per- 
taining to the welfare of mankind. 

Mankind may now know of a certainty that the God of this world 
is a personage having a body of flesh and bones as tangible as the body 
of mortal man ; and that he is an immortal being, glorified and exalted, 
in whose image and likeness man is created and made ; and that the Son 
is in the express image of the Father. This revelation and the restora- 
tion of the Gospel which followed are what the people of this world 
needed more than anything and everything else. 

THE GOSPEL NOT ALWAYS ACCEPTED 

For more than a century we have, as a Church, been preaching 
the Gospel to the world ; but as a rule people have not received it. They 
are not, however, unlike the people of other Gospel dispensations in 
this respect. The Prophet Isaiah preached the Gospel to the people 
of his day, yet we find him saying, "Who hath believed our report?" 
(Isaiah 53:1) 

The Apostle Paul was a great preacher of the Gospel in his day, 
and yet we find him saying to the Romans, "But they have not all obeyed 
the Gospel, for Esaias sayeth: Lord, who have believed our report?" 
(Rom. 10:16) 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



49 



Even the Savior's forceful teachings, accompanied by mighty 
miracles, did not convert all the people. It is our responsibility as a 
people to continue the preaching of the Gospel in all the world regardless 
of who may or may not accept it. To them that hear and understand 
the Gospel, it becomes as a savor of life or death, according as they 
accept or reject it. 

We came to earth for the express purpose of working out our 
salvation according to the plan of the Gospel, which was instituted in 
the councils of heaven before the world was; and which has been re- 
stored to earth in these last days. One of the conditions of salvation 
is a belief in God the Eternal Father and in his Son Jesus Christ as 
they are, also a belief in the efficacy of the atoning blood of Jesus 
Christ. 

BELIEF IN GOD AS A PERSONAL BEING 

The first article of our faith reads, "We believe in God the Eternal 
Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." The 
Holy Ghost, unlike the Father and the Son, is a personage of Spirit, 
without flesh and bones. The faith of all intelligent beings is centered 
in God; and it is necessary that they have a correct understanding of 
his personality and attributes and the relationship they sustain to him. 
The scriptures of the Bible support the doctrine of a personal God ; but 
religionists generally do not accept the teachings of the Scriptures on 
that point of doctrine. 

There are, however, some independent thinkers who do. Henry 
Ward Beecher was one of them. In lecturing to a class of students who 
were preparing for the ministry he said : 

I am compelled to say that I must form an ideal of God, through his 
Son, Jesus Christ. Christ is indispensable to me. My nature needs to 
fashion the thought of God, though I know him to be a spirit, into some- 
thing that will nearly or remotely represent that which I know. I hold 
before my eyes a glorious form, therefore; but after all the glory, what- 
ever may be the nimbus and the effluence around about it, it is to me a 
glorified form of a glorified man. And I therefore fashion to myself, out 
of the Spirit, that which has to me, as it were, a divine presence and a 
divine being, namely a divine man.— Lecture on Preaching, p. 129. 

NEED FOR NEW REVELATION 

As an evidence of the need for a new revelation of God, such as 
was given through Joseph Smith, I quote from a sermon by the Bishop 
of Liverpool, England, as reported in the Lancashire Post, of March 21, 
1912, as follows: 

One of the great needs of the Christian Church is power. We are 
living in an age of great material power. We have covered the land with 
new and restored churches ; we have spent great sums of money on Colleges 
and ecclesiastical buildings ; we have improved and enriched their services. 
We have planted new missions in foreign lands, and their settlements m all 
the great towns. Religion today is wearing silver slippers, and moving in 
high places, and vet I venture to think there is a strange want of power 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



about the Church of God, not only in our Church, but about every other 
branch. The Church at present seems almost overmatched by the power of 
darkness. Sometimes it seems as if the darkness is gaining on the light. 
What is the cause of the strange paralysis that has befallen the Church? 

He "believed that the Church needed today a new discovery of 
God ; the Church was weak today because God was so distant, so unreal, 
so dimly seen." The Bishop evidently had not learned of the new 
discovery of God through Joseph Smith ; but to him the need for such 
a discovery was very apparent. 

Naturally, one will desire to know what are the teachings of that 
great Angelican Church concerning God, that he should be to them so 
distant, so unreal, so dimly seen. It is explained in the first article 
of their religion as follows: 

There is one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or 
passions, of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness ; the maker and preserver 
of all things visible and invisible, and in the unity of this Godhead there 
are three personages of one substance, power and eternity, the Father, the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost. 

Note : three persons of one substance, having no body. 

We have considered the need the world had for the re-discovery 
of God by Joseph Smith. At that time, the Gospel was about to be 
restored in fulfilment of the Scriptures. Joseph Smith was raised 
up to be the instrument in the hands of the Lord in its accomplishment ; 
and it was necessary that he have a correct understanding as to the 
personality of God, that he might be orthodox in his teachings pertaining 
to the Godhead, and that his faith and knowledge might sustain him 
in meeting the false ideas and teachings so prevalent at that time, and 
that he might be able to endure the trials and persecutions he would have 
to meet, for the Gospel's sake. 

FULNESS OF GOSPEL REVEALED 

This wonderful revelation of the Father and the Son was followed 
by the visitation of other heavenly beings — delivering to Joseph messages 
pertaining to the Gospel and the Church, and the keys of former dis- 
pensations, necessary in the accomplishment of his divinely appointed 
mission, with priesthood and authority from God to administer all the 
ordinances pertaining to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Many revelations were given to Joseph for his guidance in the 
restoration of the Gospel and the establishment of the Church and 
kingdom of God on the earth and for the guidance of the members 
of the Church. 

FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL 

The fourth Article of our Faith reads as follows : 

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are : 
first, Faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism 
by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



51 



There are other principles and ordinances of the Gospel the ac- 
ceptance of which is necessary to man's salvation. In the preaching 
of the Gospel we undertake to make plain all the conditions on which 
salvation is predicated, and to prove our position from the Scriptures. 
We have given some time to the consideration of the subject of faith 
as the first article of our religion. The subject of repentance follows 
faith in logical sequence, and is one of the most comforting of all the 
principles of the Gospel. By repentance our sins, though they may 
have been as scarlet, may be washed white as wool, through the blood of 
the Lamb of God. 

Such are the teachings of the Scripture. 

The third Article of our Faith reads as follows : 

We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be 
saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

All the principles, laws and ordinances of the Gospel are made 
effective for man's salvation through the atonement of Jesus Christ. 
Repentance means a forsaking of all evil and the doing of good. 

Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest. 

Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly 
in heart ; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 

For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. — Matt. 11 :28-30. 

This is a beautiful call to repentance. The burden of sin is hard 
to bear. 

Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the 
Lord, remember them no more. — Doc. and Cov. 58:42. 

For, behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might 
not suffer if they would repent; 

But if they would not repent, they must suffer even as I, 

which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble 
because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and 
spirit— and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink. 

Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my 
preparations unto the children of men. 

Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with 
my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these 
punishments of which I have spoken. — Doc. and Cov. 19:16-20. 

Baptism naturally follows repentance, for baptism by immersion 
by one having authority is for the fulfilment of the law, for entrance 
into the Church and kingdom of God, and for the remission of sins, 
which have been repented of. 

On the occasion of the Pentecost at Jerusalem, under the influence 
of the Holy Spirit, those of many nationalities were convinced that 
Jesus Christ, who had been crucified, was what he claimed to be, the 
Son of God and the Savior of the world. Faith had found place in 
their souls, and they said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles, 
"Men and brethren, what shall we do?" (Acts 2:37) 

"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." (Acts 2 :38) 

In this declaration of Peter's, we have taught us in logical sequence, 
the principles of Faith, Repentance, Baptism and the bestowal of the 
Holy Ghost. 

The Holy Ghost is conferred by the laying on of hands of those 
having authority, and upon those who have met the prescribed conditions, 
and are worthy. The Holy Ghost will not dwell in unholy tabernacles. 
But when a man has repented of his sins and has had them washed 
away in baptism, he is without sin and worthy to receive the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands. It is the mission of the Holy Ghost to bear 
record of the Father and the Son, and of the truth of all things. By 
the Holy Ghost we may know the Father and the Son, whom to know 
is life eternal. 

The Apostle Paul mentions these principles and ordinances in his 
epistles to the Hebrews, as follows : 

Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on 
unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead 
works, and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying 
on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. — 
Heb. 6:1, 2. 

The Bible Commentary by Matthew Henry has this to say with 
respect to the above quotation : 

These are the greatest foundation principles, which ministers should 
clearly and convincingly unfold and clearly apply. In these the people 
should be well instructed and established, and from thes_e they must never 
depart ; without these, the other parts of religion have no foundation to 
support them. 

GOING ON TO PERFECTION 

The Apostle Paul says, "Let us go on to perfection." 
We read from Peter: 

Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ; 
and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience 
godliness ; and to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness 
charity.— II Peter 1 :5-7. 

The thirteenth Article of our Faith reads : 

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in 
doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition 
of Paul — 'We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many 
things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything 
virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these 
things. 

I bear you my testimony that I do know that the work in which we 
as Latter-day Saints are engaged is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the 
plan and power of God unto salvation, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



53 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We always have more speakers than we have time in which to hear 
them. A request was made yesterday, and I renew it, that when our 
good brethren from the mission fields speak to us they occupy not to 
exceed ten minutes. 

ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I appreciate the opportunity given me to report to you in repre- 
senting the East Central States Mission. My heart is filled with gratitude 
for the honor and the privilege that have been given me to labor in that 
field in preaching the Gospel. 

One of the recent outstanding events happening in our mission was 
the visit of Elder Melvin J. Ballard of the Council of the Twelve. He 
came just at a time when our missionaries were going into the country 
for their summer work, as we call it. His instructions and helpful 
suggestions were an inspiration to them. He promised them that if they 
would do certain righteous things, they would be blessed in many ways. 
I want to bear testimony in evidence to you that the promises that were 
made by him, a servant of God, to those young men and women, have 
been absolutely fulfilled. 

While listening to about fifteen of them bear their testimonies just 
previous to coming to this gathering I was thrilled with the testimonies 
which they had, how the Lord had blessed them, and how he had been 
near to them. It came about, brethren and sisters, because those young 
people had humbled themselves before our Heavenly Father through 
prayer and humility. The suggestion was made that they go into the 
country without purse or scrip, and they did it. A greater part of our 
missionaries labored that way this summer, some of them going for a 
month, not spending five cents ; they left their money at home, and the 
result was that they depended upon the Lord. That experience was rich 
to them because of the blessings which they received. They found the 
Lord and he blessed and never failed them at any time. 

We are having an unusual experience in our mission, by being 
asked to preach the funeral services of a great many people, several of 
them non-members of the Church. Two hundred, four hundred, five 
hundred, and as many as a thousand people have attended these meetings. 
The sentiment towards the Latter-day Saints is changing wonderfully 
in that mission. You realize that years ago prejudice was very strong 
against us at times, but that sentiment has greatly changed. To illustrate : 
In the city of Goldsboro, North Carolina, where a few years ago we were 
not able to rent a hall, the great auditorium in the court house in that 
city was turned over to us when Brother Ballard was there, with an 
attendance of four or five hundred people. The change is so wonderful 
that we could use, I am conservative in saying, double the number of 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



missionaries we have in that field today, because of the opportunities 
we have. Not only are we finding places, but many people are writing 
and asking us, "Can't you send missionaries into this locality ; we would 
like to help you?" That request is not confined to members alone, but 
non-members are offering suggestions such as this. 

I have learned, and it has been emphasized to me this summer, 
possibly more than any time else in my life, that if I want the blessings 
of my Heavenly Father I must live for them. I must get near to him, 
and I believe I can express to you this morning the sentiment of the 
young men and women who are laboring in the field, that when they 
get close to our Heavenly Father and have his Spirit with them it is 
most remarkable what they can accomplish. We have been able to touch 
the heart of stone, so to speak. Those who have been against us have in 
turn blessed and helped us in our work. 

The work of the Lord in our mission field is progressing. We are 
happy. Young men and women are enjoying good health at this time, 
and the Lord is blessing us abundantly. I plead with you in all earnestness 
to send your boys and girls on missions, that they might have the joy 
and the blessings which come from this service. 

A mission is two fold, it works both at home and in the mission 
field. If you have the faith, as President Grant told us at our last 
conference, nothing is impossible. What we need is greater faith, and 
if you have that I promise you that the Lord will bless you and open up 
the way so that you can send your sons and daughters on missions. My 
experience has proven it to me. May I be personal enough to say to you 
that our eighth child is now on a mission in the Eastern states. Recently 
I said to my wife, "We must send another one of our children on a 
mission, so that the Lord will bless us." My testimony to you is that 
when you have the proper faith the Lord will bless you. May we have 
sufficient faith to help us promulgate the Gospel. 

In closing, I would like to say this : During my lifetime in the field 
of publicity, numbering some forty years, I do not know of any 
time when the world has watched and given us so much publicity as they 
have regarding this Relief Program, and every day they are checking 
our progress. If we do not make good we shall have — well, we are not 
going to fail — there is no such thing as failure with the Latter-day 
Saints. We cannot fail when the Lord is with us. The Church Security 
Program is going to be one of the outstanding testimonies and evidences 
of this work. I am glad to belong to an organization where the leadership 
has the inspiration of God to direct and help them, and to help us in all 
our problems that we have to meet. I pray that the Lord will be with 
the leaders of the Church and inspire them in the future as he has in 
the past. 

It is my prayer that we may fulfil our part in this great work, be- 
cause as sure as I stand here God's work is going forward, man cannot 
stop it. May you and I be able to do our part in this great service, I 
humbly pray in his name, Amen. 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



55 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Central States M ission 

I echo the sentiments of President George F. Richards in his 
opening remarks when he said he was grateful to the Lord for mem- 
bership in the Church and the experience which came as a result of it. 
I am grateful to the Lord that his blessings are everywhere. 

When we leave this inspirational center and go to our fields of 
labor we do not feel alone. I find his blessings wherever I go ; we are 
not alone in the great cities nor in the country places where our people 
gather. We feel that we are in his presence and that his power is over 
us. 

In the twenty-five branches of the Central States Mission, 
the fifty-two Sunday Schools and more than a hundred corres- 
pondent Sunday Schools where our people gather, the inspiration 
and blessing of that Spirit is present. It is the light that shines in dark- 
ness, as expressed in modern revelation, but the darkness comprehendeth 
it not, and even those who sit in the light only partially comprehend 
the blessings which the Gospel brings to us and what it means. 

We have two responsibilities in every mission ; to look after the 
organized branches and the converted saints on one hand, and to direct 
the missionaries on the other. So far as we possibly can we try to 
keep the two separate ; that is to say, allowing the saints and the local 
people to look after their own local organizations, get their own ex- 
periences and make their own development, and not lean on the mis- 
sionaries. On the other hand to have the missionaries as free as possible 
to spend their time seeking out the honest in heart. It is not always 
possible to do this, because the missionaries at times must help the or- 
ganizations. We try however to take the attitude that when a man 
presides over a branch he presides over the branch, and the Elders who 
go into the branch go to him and say, ''President, if we can assist you 
in any way we are glad to do so." In a district where there are no 
organizations the Elders have the responsibility of taking charge. 

To find the honest in heart we pray and ask the Lord to guide 
us and prepare their hearts to receive us, and yet when the Elders start 
out in the morning in the great cities or even in the country they hardly 
know which way to go. But it does seem that the Lord leads us many 
times to the very homes where he wants us to go. I frequently wonder 
how many homes there are that the Lord has prepared for us that we 
do not find, or how near we live to him so that we may obtain the 
revelations of the Holy Ghost to guide us to these homes. I have no 
idea how far we fail in that respect. 

I am happy to say that the mission progresses and the branches 
grow in efficiency, particularly in the past year have I been able to 
note a vast increase in the interest in the genealogical department of the 
Church and temple work. Many people are now beginning to think 
about the genealogy of their fathers and we have organized junior 
genealogical societies with a degree of success that has been very satis-

factory. One young Elder travels through the mission promoting gene- 
alogy work. He usually stays about two weeks in a branch and shows 
them as nearly as he can how they should proceed to improve their 
work. He also spends the rest of the time in regular missionary work. 

Another delightful thing is the development of the missionary. 
A man came to me yesterday who could hardly speak for the emotion 
which swelled in his heart. He said: "My boy is home again. I want 
to thank you for what you have done for him. He is not the same boy 
that went away at all." 

I said to him: "My dear sir, it was the Lord and himself who 
did it. He submitted himself to the will of God and lived in the presence 
and power of His Holy Spirit, and he comes back sanctified, strengthened 
and made a strong character." 

We are just trying to do our duty, brethren and sisters, in the 
Central States Mission. We use our efforts to the best of our ability 
and we find that the Lord blesses us and opens the way for us. Radio 
programs are open for us as far as we can fill them. Newspapers 
give us notices, people listen to our testimony wherever we go. We try 
to sing the Gospel and preach the Gospel, and put literature in the hands 
of the people. Your sons and daughters who are with us are performing 
splendidly. You can be very happy about them. At the present time 
we have only one case of serious sickness in the mission. We hope 
the Lord will preserve us from further serious sickness. 

May he bless his servants who preside over this Church, that we 
may continue to enjoy their inspired leadership and your faith and 
prayers, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH J. DAYNES 

President of the Western States M ission 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, to bring you a report 
from the Western States Mission. We have there 82 Elders and lady 
missionaries at the present time, all of whom are very well. We have 
had some very unusual things transpire, unusual healings, unusual con- 
versions, and particularly have I been impressed with the fine quality 
of good people who have recently come into the Church. We have had 
several conversions of friends from the Reorganized Church, and they 
are becoming a great power in our branches. 

The Security project has met with great approval, and our people 
have been very desirous of doing their full duty. When the Church 
conceived the idea of asking each of the members to contribute as a 
Fast offering one dollar per capita, many of our Saints, some of them 
in remote places, desirous of doing their part have done it wonderfully. 
One man sent a check for forty-eight dollars to us, asking that we credit 
him and his family four years in advance with Fast offerings. 

Our tithes show a very good increase, likewise our Fast offerings. 
We have had a number of wonderful missionaries go out into the field

from our mission. We have nine out now, and three others who will 
soon be in the field, making twelve from our mission who are spending 
their time in other missions of the Church. 

The meeting to which President Grant referred, which was held 
in Estes Park, August 8th, being the convention of the Institute of 
Human Relations, was a privilege of unusual importance given this 
Church. I have heard President Grant give many marvelous addresses, 
but I think the one given there, in which he gave historical and doctrinal 
phases of Mormonism, is perhaps his outstanding address. He covered 
almost everything historical and likewise doctrinal that the Church 
presents to the world. Many wonderful reactions in the nature of com- 
plimentary praise regarding his address have come from those who 
were present. 

Perhaps the outstanding thing that has occurred within our mission 
was the dedication of the Winter Quarters monument, which took place 
on the 20th of September, a week ago last Sunday. There were three 
thousand people at the dedication services proper, and there were fifteen 
thousand people who came onto the hill during the day, and there have 
been literally hundreds of people there every day since. In a letter 
received from one of our lady missionaries, she said: (she had been 
appointed to be there that day) "There were 150 people came on the 
hill to ask questions concerning the monument and what it stands for." 

We have had a wonderful response from the officials of the city 
administration in their endeavor to give us that which we needed. I 
want to quote you just a few words from the remarks of Mayor Butler, 
given at the time of the dedication : 

In meeting here to dedicate this memorial we are but acknowledging 
the debt we owe to the devoted men and women who gave their lives to the 
uplifting of this great western country. 

We are all inclined, except at moments such as this, to forget how 
deeply we are indebted to the men and women who crossed the plains in 
the days when it required sublime faith and undaunted courage to face 
the dangers and the privations of the long journey. 

$ * $ ! # * 

We are here, however, to do honor to those who did not reach the 
goal, to those that sacrificed their lives that others might go forward. 

We would be ingrates indeed were we not to commemorate the heroism 
of these men and women in some lasting memorial such as this. 

As the mayor of the city of Omaha I am happy to add my word of 
recognition of the sacrifices made by these pioneers and to express on 
behalf of the people of Omaha their appreciation of this monument which 
is to be unveiled here today. 

Governor R. L. Cochran, governor of the State of Nebraska, paid a 
very beautiful tribute, and I quote a few words from his remarks : 

No other events of human history are more soul-stirring than the 
chronicles of the struggles for the freedom of conscience. No battles 
ever fought have shown a higher courage than that manifested by a 
determined people in a peaceful exodus from the scenes and conditions 
of religious persecution. America was colonized by the refugees from 
religious intolerance in other lands, by men and women of conviction

who preferred self exile rather than suffer regimentation in the manner 
of their worship of God. 

A century ago there was gathering on a peaceful, fertile Illinois 
prairie the nucleus of a colony of God-fearing people who sought to 
rear their children in their own particular faith. 

After a few pathetic years of resistance, during which time the leader, 
Joseph Smith, was killed, the colony decided to move far westward to 
establish new homes beycnd the Rocky Mountains. 

s|e $ $' -fc* ♦ : afc $ 

This ceremony today is in proper keeping with the respect due to those 
purposeful pioneers who were first to leave their impress on the Christian 
civilization of the great plains.

And so, down through the mist of the passing years the Mormon 
migration has become epochal, significant as an institution having an 
influence on the social standards of succeeding generations. Subsequent 
events would seem to have justified the losses suffered, the rigors met and 
survived. I am humbly disposed to pay reverent homage to the high 
purpose that inspired the heroic enterprise, and to look upon this field of 
unmarked mounds as symbolic of the sacrifice that life in every scheme 
of human endeavor, demands as the price for ultimate success. 

I received a letter from the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce 
of Omaha the day before I left, and I quote a few words from him : 

We of Omaha feel that this is one of the most inspirational meetings 
that has been held here for a long time, and I am sure that all of those 
who gathered on the hill above Florence left the place better for having 
been there. 

You may be sure that we were more than willing to cooperate with 
your people in this ceremony, for the leaders of your Church approached 
this dedication with a dignity that was truly inspiring. The Church of the 
Latter-day Saints erected their own memorial to their own dead but were 
happy to have others join in the service. It is a great contribution to the 
memory of those who pioneered the middle west. 

I quote from an editorial in one of the Omaha newspapers the 
Monday morning after the dedication : 

Omaha listened yesterday while Heber J. Grant, president of the 
Mormon Church, and other eloquent speakers told of the struggles and 
triumphs of their faith, of its tragedies and blessings, its past and its 
present, and its hope for the future. 

It is a tale that bears telling. Suppose its origin does appear fantastic 
to Gentile unbelievers. It is not more so than that of other religions 
that number adherents by hundreds of millions. It is worth while for its 
relation to humanity's search through the ages for truth. 

Starting in New York, taking form in Ohio, coming to growth in 
Missouri, reaching strength in Illinois, until in Utah it mounted heights 
of power and influence, the story of the Mormon Church is fascinating 
as a human document. 

Hardships endured at "Winter Quarters" tried their souls and tested 
their faith, but were borne with resignation. When Brigham Young 
organized the march to the region he had located beyond the mountains, 
with songs on their lips and prayers in their hearts, thousands followed 
on to Utah. 

They made the desert bloom, they established cities, with all the 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



59 



attributes of civilization, schools, churches, factories, to utilize their 
products, everything connoted by greatness. 

Holding fast to their faith, they bore the shock of adversity, of 
ostracism, patiently striving for the goal they visioned. One need not be 
a Mormon, nor subscribe to any tenets of the Church, to admire the 
courage, the fortitude, the industry of this powerful sect. 

It is marvelous the response we have had, my brethren and sisters. 
My testimony has grown day by day as I have studied the reaction of the 
people as they have contemplated the purposes of our mission. Our 
Elders and our lady missionaries are reaching many honest, God-fearing 
people who are receiving the message of truth. And I testify to you 
that I know that this Church is true, that the Gospel of Jesus Christ and 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are one and the same, 
inseparable and indivisible. As I learn of it and study it I am more 
convinced from day to day of its comprehensiveness, its beauty and its 
glory, and in my work I am happy that I am one who is undertaking 
to promote its glorious truths. 

May the Lord bless us all, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

The "Singing Mothers" and the congregation sang the hymn, 
"Praise to the Man Who Communed with Jehovah." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel to express gratitude for my membership in the Church. I 
know that Joseph Smith communed with Jehovah ; that the Lord spoke 
to him and gave him commandment to organize the Church and to 
establish his truth once again in its fulness in the earth. I am grateful 
for all that has come through that restoration, the knowledge, the faith 
and the understanding which I have of the Gospel — and I say knowledge, 
because I have that knowledge. 

ENDORSES CHURCH SECURITY PLAN 

Just a word I desire to say in endorsement of the Plan which has 
been spoken of at other sessions of this conference, looking after the 
interests of the members of the Church. Some have said that this is 
new. I look upon it as a return to that which is old, which is always 
new when it is true, for that which is true never becomes old, but it 
is a return to first principles. I hope that it will lead us in love, in the 
spirit of sympathy, fellowship and brotherly love, to have the interest 
in our feliowmen that we ought to have, and increase in our hearts a 
desire to keep the commandments of the Lord and walk in the light 
as we understand that light, that we may be constantly guided by his 
Spirit.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OBSERVATIONS REGARDING TOLERANCE AND BROADMINDEDNESS 

I would like for a few minutes to offer a few observations in regard 
to the question of tolerance and broadmindedness. We hear so much 
in these days about being tolerant and broadminded. I suppose the 
world will never know how many crimes have been committed through 
a misinterpretation and misunderstanding of these terms. Satan is 
very "broadminded," extremely so as long as he can get people to do 
evil and avoid the truth. He will teach any kind of theory, or principle, 
or doctrine, if it doesn't conform to the fundamental things of life — the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. He is even willing to teach some truth if he 
can join that truth with error, and by teaching the error with the truth 
lead men astray. This is how broadminded he is, and that is how the 
apostasy came about in the primitive church. The Lord has given 
to man his agency. That is a divine principle — it is inherent, born with 
us. We have it because the Lord gave it to us in the spirit world. It 
is the only principle upon which exaltation can come. It is the only 
principle upon which rewards can be given in righteousness. Satan's 
plan in the beginning was to compel. He said he would save all men 
and not one soul should be lost. Surely he would do it if the Father 
would give him the honor and the glory. But who wants salvation 
when it comes through compulsion, if we haven't the power within 
ourselves to choose and to act according to the dictates of conscience? 
What would salvation mean to you if you were compelled? And so, that 
great gift of agency has been given to men. By it we may climb to the 
heights, we may enter the kingdom of God to sit on the throne and be 
exalted as sons and daughters of God, but we must be obedient. 

Tolerance is not indulgence. I think sometimes the terms have 
been confused. We must not get so broadminded that we would throw 
over the fundamental things of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I heard of 
one man — and I think he filled a mission — who made the statement, as 
the report comes to me, that in this enlightened age the Church of Jesus 
Christ should get away from the narrow idea that baptism for the 
remission of sins in water is essential to salvation ; that we should be 
broader than that. 

AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC GOD 

Another man, with similar views, made the statement, so the report 
comes to me, that we shall have to cease believing in the anthropomorphic 
God ; we must quit thinking of God as being in the form in which man 
is made. He ridiculed the idea by saying, "Can we worship a God who 
has to eat, who has to sleep, who has to take a bath?" Of course, in 
thinking of God as a person, in whose image we are created, we do not 
necessarily have to think of him as having to conform to all the conditions 
of mortal existence to which we, under present conditions, are forced 
to subscribe. But is there anything wrong in thinking of a God who 
eats ? He did eat and has promised to eat again. What is wrong in it ? 
He bathes, at least in fire, so he tells us. We are his ofT-spring, and he 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



61 



has given us commandments to serve him in the name of his only 
Begotten Son as sons and daughters unto God. 

BOUND BY LAW 

Moreover, we know, because it has been revealed, that all kingdoms 
have a law given, and that includes the kingdom of God. It is not some- 
thing that stands apart from all other kingdoms in this regard, and he 
himself has said: "Unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every 
law there are certain bounds also and conditions. All beings who abide 
not in those conditions are not justified." 

The Lord is very tolerant, yet he declares that we are bound by 
law, and if we violate the law we are not justified, and must remain 
filthy still. You might just as well try to destroy the law of gravity, or 
say it is useless, that it has filled its purpose and is worn out, as to say 
that baptism is not essential to salvation. I believe in being tolerant, 
but I believe that that tolerance will teach me to observe and keep the 
law and constantly abide in it, and not to make excuses for my wrong 
doing by saying I am broadminded. 

EVERY MAN'S PRIVILEGE 

"We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according 
to the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, 
let them worship how, where, or what they may." 

I am willing to defend any man in the privilege which is his by his 
agency. If he wants to worship a cat, or a dog, the sun, or the moon, a 
crocodile, or a bull — and men have done all these things — that is his 
privilege. But it is also my privilege and right to try to teach him to do 
better and to accept a better worship. I will defend him in his rights, 
and at the same time endeavor to teach him that he may see more clearly 
and walk in the light of truth. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith once said: "The Saints can testify 
whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has 
been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a Mormon, I am 
able to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defense 
of the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man in any other 
denomination, for the same principle that would trample upon the rights 
of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the Roman 
Catholics or upon any other denominations that may be unpopular and too 
weak to defend themselves." 

ONLY THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS 

I believe in that doctrine. At the same time I am satisfied and I 
know that the kingdom of God is governed by a definite, fixed law, that 
cannot be controverted. We cannot change it because we perhaps become 
modern and say we are broadminded, as some people understand broad- 
mindedness and tolerance to be. It doesn't change the fact in the 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

least that if we would receive the kingdom of God and enter into its 
exaltation, we must comply with the fundamental truths, the laws upon 
which that kingdom is established. We have them, we are the advocates 
of these principles, they are in our keeping. Why, bless your soul, the 
whole world ought to come to us with songs of everlasting joy, singing 
their hosannas to embrace the truth ; but I wonder sometimes if we do 
not stress a little too much the fact that they today are receiving us in 
kindness. Let us not pat ourselves upon the back too much because we 
have little opposition. I see a danger in it; but let us go on keeping 
the commandments of the Lord in humility and truth, and teaching the 
people the correct principles, drawing them to us by our lives as well 
as by our precepts. And so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JAMES M. PETERSON 

President of the Texas Mission 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the new oppor- 
tunity which has come to me to go into the mission field once more. 
I am happy to report our work in the Texas Mission I bring to you 
the greetings of our saints in Texas and Louisiana, as well as from 
the missionaries laboring there. 

To the parents of the missionaries I am happy to report that they 
are well. During the past year we have enjoyed splendid health, and 
the blessings of the Lord have been with us. We have an exceptionally 
fine group of missionaries. The parents of these fine young people 
can well be proud of them. I am sure that they will bring honor to 
you and to the Church, and to the community when they return to their 
homes. 

Much of the old prejudice and antagonism has disappeared, but 
there are still many things to dishearten and discourage the missionaries. 
They need your support. When you write to them write only encourag- 
ing things, and avoid anything that may tend to discourage them in their 
work. 

This year Texas is celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of 
her freedom. At Dallas a fine exposition has been built. Millions of 
dollars have been spent in the erecting of buildings and places of amuse- 
ment. We are fortunate in having a booth in the Exposition, manned 
by our Elders who labor there. Thousands of people stop to see the 
pictures of our various temples and to hear the discourses of these fine 
young men. The Gospel message, my brethren and sisters, is finding 
its way into the homes of both the great and the small. The advancement 
and growth of the Church, and the publicity which has recently come 
to it through our relief program and the addresses of President Grant 
abroad, as well as other favorable publicity, have opened many a door 
to our missionaries. 

Due credit must be given to our Tabernacle Choir and the Organ 
for the splendid broadcasts coming from this famous old building. 



ELDER JAMES M. PETERSON 



63 



I think I am safe in saying that our most direct contacts come from 
these broadcasts and the favorable expressions which we hear with 
reference to them. 

We are happy in bearing testimony of the revealed Gospel, knowing 
that as we are instrumental in bringing people to a knowledge of the 
truth we are more firmly establishing ourselves in the kingdom of God. 

Some years ago there came to our house quite frequently a dear 
little old lady. She often stayed with us four or five days at a time. 
At the dinner table we would discuss the topics of the day, the disasters, 
the storms, the drouth, the difficulties of the business world, and 
invariably when we had finished she would place her hand on my arm 
and say: "Never mind. Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his 
righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you." 

It is strange — possibly it is not strange — how our experiences affect 
our view-point. For instance, I was looking casually through a maga- 
zine and came upon a couple of verses which told of early pleasant 
experiences and the failure that followed an attempt to find the old 
pleasures in the doing of those same things. It was beautifully written 
and touched me. I read it to my wife and she shared my appreciation 
of it. Then at the dinner table with a group of young people I prof- 
fered to read it. I put into it all the pathos of which I was capable. 
When I finished some of them laughed, and others, more respectful, 
smiled and wondered why my eyes were filled with tears. So it was 
when this dear little old lady continued to repeat those beautiful words : 
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness ; and all these 
things shall be added unto you." I only smiled and thought of it as 
another Bible quotation. 

With the passing of the years there has come possibly some slight 
degree of wisdom, and with it the experiences that enable one to see 
more clearly. But not until I had seen the world turned upside down, 
so to speak ; not until I had seen gigantic financial institutions topple 
as a house of cards; not until I had seen the fruits of a lifetime of 
labor and sacrifice and hardship swept away as with a puff of wind ; 
not until I had seen men go down to work in the morning hopeful and 
full of enthusiasm, and then saw them standing at night, heartbroken 
and penniless, did I come to realize, in a degree, the meaning of those 
precious words. 

My brethren and sisters, are we seeking first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness? Are we giving ourselves freely and willingly 
to his service? A missionary told me this story of his sister who had 
written him from home for advice. A young man had come to pay 
his attentions. He was tall and handsome as young lovers go; she 
was young, vivacious and liked him. Came the end of the week, and 
he proposed a trip into the mountains for the Sabbath. She hesitated 
and then quickly remembered that she was a Sunday School teacher, 
and that her class of little ones would be waiting for her on the morrow. 
So he went with others into the mountains and left her with her Sunday 
School. Came the end of another week, and the renewal of the proposal 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that they spend Sunday in the mountains. Now she had had time to 
think it over and was ready with an answer. She told him that the 
Sabbath was a very sacred day to her ; that she had been taught from 
childhood to remember to keep it holy, and that she could not be induced 
to break it however tempting the invitation. The next morning as she 
was leaving her home for Sunday School a large automobile drove up 
to the house and in it were the aforesaid young man and a group of young 
people. With all the enthusiasm of which young people are capable 
they urged her to accompany them and all but lifted her into the car. 
I do not know the workings of her mind ; I do not know the vision that 
held her to the right. I am inclined to the belief that she knew nothing 
of these sacred words of the Master, but somewhere in her mind was 
the essence of that commandment: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, 
and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you." 

True to the teachings of a fine Latter-day Saint home she has 
found the way to the kingdom of God. And so may we and all who 
seek him and strive to keep his commandments. But let us not suppose 
that we may find it by a mediocre or haphazard living of the Gospel ; 
but rather let us dedicate ourselves, brethren and sisters, to the service 
of the Master, and in remembrance of his suffering and sacrifice for 
us devote ourselves to the keeping of the commandments which he has 
given us, that we may come to know the beauties of his kingdom and 
the joy of his eternal progress, I pray in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I pray that what I say this morning may be dictated by the Spirit of 
the Lord. 

An ancient American prophet whose name was Moroni once wrote : 

And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth — that if the day cometh 
that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall 
be because of unbelief. 

£ ' , + ) if' ' • $ , £ 

Awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem ; yea, and put on thy 
beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and 
enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, 
that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, 
O house of Israel, may be fulfilled. 

James, a disciple of our Lord, says : 

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to ail men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 

There is something calamitous happening in the world today; it 
has slowly been destroying our spiritual lives. I refer to the fact that 
human life on the one hand and religion on the other have been drifting 
apart. They are drifting apart today, and this is one of the greatest 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



65 



calamities of all history. We realize that the world has made wonderful 
strides in science and invention during the past century. From a material 
standpoint no one doubts the greatness of the age in which we are living. 
Electricity and mechanical inventions have changed our economic and 
social lives. Magnificent have been the achievements of men ; still more 
splendid will they be. The nations of the world have accumulated great 
wealth but the love of money has pushed aside their love of God. The 
conscience of Christian creeds has become blunt to the primary dis- 
tinctions of right and wrong and the world is drifting to some ignominious 
end. 

When we look back to a century ago, we see here in America, a 
people strong in honesty and fortitude, subduing nature and building 
homes and cities. They traveled in small boats, ox-carts, and horse drawn 
wagons. The farmer was using the type of tools that resembled those 
that were used in the days of the ancient prophets. It took from May 
to early autumn to travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean. There 
were no railroad trains ; and steamboats were just beginning to ply the 
rivers of the West. Newspapers were printed by hand at the rate of 
two hundred copies an hour. Thought was transmitted only as fast as 
one could travel. Then came the age of machinery. Inventors gave 
us the telegraph and telephone; modern farming machinery, and ulti- 
mately the automobile and airplane. During the last years, the science 
of medicine has all but conquered disease. Space has been annihilated 
by the forces of travel, and the radio has brought the voices of men from 
the far-off quarters of the earth. The age has been one of marvelous 
thought and progress, tfielike of which the world has never seen before. 

As a result of this progress in the line of science, and the coming 
of foreigners to our shores, our civilization has become complex. Law- 
making bodies have created laws by the thousands, until we have come 
to believe that government is the source of righteousness ; that govern- 
ment by external means is the spring of morality and spiritual life. The 
morale of America has drifted to a very low state ; this is also true of 
all the civilized world. Our moral autonomy has gone, and men and 
nations have forgotten God. Satan is offering the kingdoms of the 
world to those who will fall down and worship him. The temptation 
of Jesus after his baptism has become today the temptation of men. Yet 
nations are crying for Peace. They have organized leagues of peace; 
they have made some determined efforts to do away with war; they 
have all failed for the reason that peace movements have not been 
founded on a proper comprehension of righteousness and truth. 

When our forefathers met in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia in 
1774 to draft some system of government by which the colonies could 
carry on, an old minister, Dr. Jacob Duche, was called in to offer a 
prayer, and as he prayed, John Adams tells us that tears "gushed into 
the eyes of all present." It was a fervent prayer to the Lord and I quote 
it in full for it carries a message of faith to us : 

O Lord, our Heavenly Father, high and mighty King of Kings, Lord

of Lords, who dost from Thy throne behold all the dwellers upon the 
earth, and reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over all kingdoms, 
empires and governments, look down in mercy, we beseech Thee, upon 
these American States who have fled to Thee from the rod of the op- 
pressor, and thrown themselves upon Thy gracious protection, desiring 
to be henceforth dependent cnly upon Thee. 

To Thee have they appealed for the righteousness of their cause. To 
Thee do they now look up for that countenance and support which Thou 
alone canst give. Take them, theretore, Heavenly father, under Thy 
nurturing care. Give them wisdom in council, and valor in the field. 
Defeat the malicious designs of our cruel adversaries. Convince them of 
the unrighteousness of their cause, and if they still persist in their san- 
guinary purposes, O let the voice of Thine own unerring justice, sounding 
in their hearts, constrain them to drop their weapons of war from their 
unnerved hands in the day of battle. 

Be Thou present, O Lord of Wisdom, and direct the Council of the 
honorable Assembly. Enable them to settle things upon the best and surest 
foundation, that the scene of blood may speedily be closed ; that order, 
harmony and peace may effectually be restored, and truth and justice, 
religion and piety, prevail and flourish amongst Thy people. 

Preserve the health of their bodies, the vigor of their minds. Shower 
down upon them and the millions they here represent, such temporal bless- 
ings as Thou seest expedient for them in this world and crown them with 
everlasting glory in the world to ccme. All this we ask in the name and 
through the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Savior. Amen. 

When the government of the United States was finally organized 
under the God-inspired Constitution, it was the result of toil and blood ; 
and faith in the providences of God. The age-long barriers of class 
were done away with, and those founders declared that here in this 
nation, there should be no slave ; there should be no king ; nor master ; 
nor subject. The fathers of the republic said to us : "We are all children 
of God, free and equal." 

Are we going to abandon our heritage? Shall we "look unto the 
rock whence we were hewn?" It was a wise piece of advice when the 
ancient psalmist wrote : "Remove not the ancient land-mark which thy 
fathers have set." Have we come to the time when we shall have to 
guarantee payment in silver before our citizens will go to war to protect 
the ideals of our government ? If we have, then our citizenry have lost the 
ideals of the founders, and have forfeited their rights and the finer feel- 
ings of what we call patriotism. When the American Revolution and the 
Civil War were fought, men went to war because of their love of country. 
They believed it a divine duty to die for their country. They were reared 
in the belief that sacrifice for truth is a divine injunction of God. Many 
of us recall the words of Garibaldi, the Italian liberator, when he spoke 
to the youth of Italy. Said he : 

Fortune, who betrays us today, will smile on us tomorrow. I am 
going out from Rome. Let those who wish to continue the war against 
the stranger, come with me. I offer neither pay nor quarters, nor provision. 
I offer hunger, thirst, battles and death. Let him who loves his country 
with his heart and not with his lips only, follow me. 

Hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles, death. 

Such was the offer — nothing more — remarks the historian Tre-

velyan. Today we are purchasing souls for war ; we are offering idleness 
for work ; we are dissipating the resources that God gave us ; we are 
trying to solve our problems from without, and not from within. Jesus 
said on one occasion: "I am come that they might have life, and that 
they might have it more abundantly." This sentence was the basic thought 
of his religion. He gave us the meaning of rich and radiant living. He 
told us to live our lives from within; and in this should be our power, 
which is the "inner light," the light of God ever leading us on. The 
forces which are to make the world the world it ought to be, are now 
within it. These forces are the divine principles that were taught by 
Jesus Christ our Lord. By these principles knowledge will be higher, 
ambition nobler, and life more divine. 

My brethren and sisters, it is religion that must solve the problems 
of our civilization today, and if we do not go back to God and the 
religion of the Master, our western civilization is destined to be 
destroyed. Religion at its best has supplied, and it can now supply, 
"the motives, faiths, insights, hopes, convictions, by which men inwardly 
come to terms with themselves and with their fellow men." We must 
come to a new spiritual ascendency over our baser selves. To achieve 
peace in this world of ours, this will have to be done. We must come 
to religion by way of life, and a deeper desire within to live life well. 
As soon as we strike this road again, we will find the high way where 
the seers and prophets of the spirit are walking ; and above all we will 
distinguish there the footsteps of the Son of God. We will bring our 
lives into the inner world of man's divine life and light. Once more we 
will bring God and his Son back to us through the inward and not the 
outward; through our faith and confidence in the Savior of the world. 

You and I and all people will have to do away with hatred in our 
hearts. The inner light is the light of God ; it is the light of love and 
truth. As I walked to this meeting this morning a man handed me a 
vicious document of hatred for the Jews. I wish to say unhesitatingly 
that I love the history of the Jews. They gave us the greatest book 
of all time, the Holy Bible, and they played a large part in the American 
Revolution. A Jew raised his voice in the Continental Congress one 
time and said, "It is for God and hence for right." The Jews are, as a 
whole, a noble race. All people have their failings but we must come to 
love the peoples of the world and do away with hate. 

The German Lessing, who wrote "Nathan the Wise," put these 
words into the mouth of the Jew and the Christian who were conversing. 
The Jew said : "O Christian, I understand you now because of the spirit 
of your Christ that is in my soul." And the Christian replied : "O Jew, 
I understand you because of the spirit of your God and our God." 

The spirit of the American government must be restored. Man 
must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, then the old time patriot- 
ism will again be in the hearts of men. 

The real test of the strength of civilization is in the moral capacity 
of the rank and file of the citizens to give up the pleasures of the present 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for greater rewards in the future. This quality is the foundation of 
both moral and spiritual character. The social security of a nation is 
based on the character of the citizens, not on the amount of material 
comforts the government may bestow upon them. Hard work and 
sacrifice make men strong. Ease and gifts from any source are 
destructive to efficiency, character, and citizenship. Social security is 
in the character of the citizens and hence must come from within. 
Social security can not be bestowed from without. 

The Abby Genty, a French savant during the French Revolution, 
declared before the students of Paris University that "the independence 
of the Americans is the event most likely to accelerate the revolution 
which is to renew the happiness of the world. In the bosom of this 
new nation are the treasures which are to renew the world." He 
named the relief to crowded Europe as one of the blessings to come to 
mankind. The Emancipation of Slaves, the End of Conquest, Universal 
Peace, the Conversion of the World to Christianity, are others. All 
these were to spring from the truth, honor, and the virtue of three 
millions of Americans who believed in God. America has given us an 
ideal. It is not gold, nor silver, nor brass, nor iron which makes 
success. It is truth, honor, and justice. It is faith, hope, and love. It 
is, as the learned Abby suggested, on the virtues of mankind and the 
freedom of mankind that the future of mankind is to be builded. 

When we have learned the Christian way of living and have gone 
back to God, then the words of another sage will come true : 

It will change everything. 

I can see the end of war in this, some day. 

I can see the joy of women and little children, some day. 

I can see cities and great spaces of land full of happiness. 

I can see love shining in every face. 

There shall be no more sin, no pain, no loss, no death — 

Only Life, only God — some day when 

The world shall have learned. 

I pray that we may sense keenly two things this day. I pray that 
the Spirit of our Lord and Savior may find lodgment in our souls as 
never before, and that we may hold sacred as a trust of God, the 
Constitution of the United States. God grant that we may always see 
the right, I ask in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 
Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am thrilled with the thought today that this body of men and 
women have enjoyed, since this conference convened, the true spirit 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and, that from the very commencement of 
our exercises advice and admonition have been given to this people 
in a spirit of love and solicitiude, and also in a way and manner which 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



69 



will, I feel sure, sink into the hearts of us to the end that we shall not 
be turned aside from the sacred duties which devolve upon us. 

I am reminded of the statement of one of the prophets of old 
when he said : "Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself ; 
it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." 

And, so, as I cast my eyes over this great congregation and think 
of the things that have transpired, the things which today are transpiring, 
and the things which in the future will transpire, I feel sure that this 
prophecy was not directed to the individual, but rather to the collective 
horde of mankind upon the earth. Surely and truly this people should 
be a people filled with gratitude and praise unto God our Eternal 
Father for the mercies and the blessings which have come unto them. 
We have had evidence of God's handiwork in all we have been hearing, 
and even in these past two weeks I personally think, at least to me, has 
come another testimony of this Gospel, which in no other way could 
have come. 

I refer to the pilgrimage which will become history, which was 
taken back over the familiar pioneer trail to Florence, Nebraska. There, 
upon that sacred hill, made so by the bodies of hundreds — they say 
nearly 600 people — who laid down their lives, and at a time when it 
was virtually a wilderness, and under the most trying circumstances. 
There came from their ashes and their dust a spirit which blended into 
the lives of the men and women who fortunately attended this dedicatory 
service, a something which bore to them the truth and divinity of this 
great work in which we are now engaged. When we heard our leaders, 
the authorities of our Church, telling of this wonderful pilgrimage 
of our forebears, and then heard the governor of the state of Nebraska, 
the mayor of the city of Omaha, and Carl R. Gray, the president of 
the Union Pacific Railroad System, all uniting their voices with ours 
in testimony of that which had been done, surely, I said to myself, this 
is virtually a whispering spirit from the dead. And, at night, as we 
assembled in that great and wonderful Joslyn Memorial, that great 
temple of marble, erected in Omaha with its art gallery, and the seats 
upholstered in the last word of the art of the upholsterer, and saw our 
brethren who were there, the Presidency of the Church, the Apostles 
and others as they sat on the stand and spoke to that large audience, 
surely gratitude filled every heart of those who had gone to pay honor 
to their departed loved ones who were buried in the Florence cemetery. 
It was my privilge to sit next to two gentlemen who were inclined to 
talk a little, and they said as the service went on : "They are all spell- 
binders, aren't they?" 

Then, as Senator Smoot finished his address one said to the other : 
"You know a man of such national prominence as Reed Smoot, who 
will give attention and pay heed to that which he is saying certainly 
deserves attention; we ought to do something ourselves, because I am 
sure that what he says has in it all the ear marks of worthwhile 
endeavor for mankind to listen to and follow."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



These things, coupled with the things which today are going on 
in our very midst, the advice and counsel of the authorities of the 
Church, asking us to go forward and carry out this wonderful system 
of our relief program, and that system which has arrested the attention 
of the United States as a whole, and, I am sure, foreign countries as 
well, ought to speak to you and to me this word, that it is truly the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost through God himself that these things 
come to this people who a few years ago were persecuted and driven 
from pillar to post, and yet today stand out shining lights before many 
people, exhibiting that which the Gospel has produced among the 
children of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Truly, in the world 
today, if we will stop and think of the prayer Orson Hyde uttered on 
that sacred hill in Jerusalem, it is being more fully realized and compre- 
hended than we ourselves, I think, can understand. God has said to 
us that he would make us lie down in green pastures, and lead us beside 
the still waters ; that he would guide us in paths of righteousness for 
his name's sake, and I am sure he is doing it. I know that the statement 
of Jeremiah is being fulfilled wherein he said : "Oh Lord, I know that 
the way of man is not in himself ; it is not in man that walketh to direct 
his steps." 

My prayer is for courage, faith, hope, and above all, thankful and 
grateful hearts to God for that which we have received, and that which 
we are receiving. May God grant us these things, I humbly pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The "Singing Mothers" and the congregation joined in singing "The 
Star Spangled Banner." 

Elder Lorenzo H. Hatch, President of the Granite Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

SECOND DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference commenced promptly at 2 
o'clock Saturday afternoon, October 3, with President Grant presiding. 

The Relief Society "Singing Mothers" furnished the music for this 
meeting. The opening number was an anthem, "How Lovely Are Thy 
Dwellings, O Lord." (Rheinberger). 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Martin Twitchell, Presi- 
dent of the Garfield Stake. 

The Relief Society "Singing Mothers" sang "Seraphic Song" (Rub- 
enstein) — Mrs. Bessie Morley, Alto; William Hardiman, Violinist. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel very grateful to be in attendance at this conference. I have 
been thinking of the brethren who are not here because of illness or due 
to the fact that they are in foreign lands. They are deprived of the com- 
panionship that we enjoy but wherever they are if in the line of duty they 
may partake of the Spirit of our Heavenly Father. 

I have rejoiced in the sweet strains of music to which we have 
listened, to the prayers that have been offered and to the discourses that 
have been delivered. 

ETERNAL HAPPINESS THROUGH OBEDIENCE AND SERVICE 

We are greatly blessed as a people and we have need to express our 
gratitude in service, not only in lip service, but by giving of ourselves to 
the blessing of mankind. Our eternal happiness will be in proportion 
to the way that we devote ourselves to helping others. It will be 
conditioned upon the things that we do and say while we are here in 
mortality. 

This is a probationary condition for us. Our Heavenly Father gave 
our first parents an opportunity to come and he told them what they ought 
to do, and all down through the ages he has been instructing us through 
his prophets. Wherever the people have listened to the prophets they 
have had success and happiness and they have been making preparation 
for eternal joy. Where they have refused to be mindful of the teachings 
of the Lord through his servants, they have paid the penalty. Not only 
have they suffered in mortal life, but they have forfeited the blessings 
that they might enjoy in immortal life. 

Think of the experiences through which we personally pass while 
here in the world and of the centuries of history available from which 
we may learn valuable lessons. 

DESTROYED BECAUSE OF THEIR WICKEDNESS 

By reading the Old Testament we learn that for a long period of 
time after Adam came, the people, exercising their agency, determined 
to have their own way and followed after the teachings of the adversary 
until they were too wicked to live. The flood came and only those were 
left who had been obedient and had sought to do the Lord's will. Abra- 
ham tells us of the destruction by fire of the people of Sodom and 
Gomorrah because of their wickedness. 

Why was it necessary for the flood to come? Why did the Lord 
permit the cities of the plains to be destroyed by fire? It was because 
the people would not take advantage of their opportunities. They were 
not only wasting their lives here upon the earth but were also bringing 
into the world another generation which would follow their bad example. 
In both cases, it seems to me, our Heavenly Father in his wisdom and 
mercy cleansed the earth by the flood and cleared the way for a righteous 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



people to dwell here if they would. The cities of the plains were burned 
that their wickedness might not continue to jeopardize other com- 
munities and children as yet unborn. 

THE EXPERIENCES OF JACOB AND HIS SONS 

We remember the experiences of Jacob. He resided in a country 
which was fruitful and he was prosperous but in the mercy of the Lord 
who knew all things, Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, was sold into slavery 
by his own brothers and taken to Egypt. After he had been there some 
time Joseph being inspired by the Lord became the chief adviser to 
Pharaoh and directed the people to prepare for a deadly famine that was 
to follow seven plenteous years. Joseph not only brought a blessing to 
the people of Egypt but because he kept the commandments of the Lord 
he was the means of saving his father's household from starvation by 
bringing them to a land of plenty. 

Then Moses came, and, directed by the Lord, led the people who had 
become slaves in Egypt out of their bondage, into the Promised Land. 
When they kept his commandments they prospered ; when they refused 
to keep his commandments they paid the penalty of their disobedience. 

These were the people that were saved from the Egyptians and from 
drowning in the Red Sea when the Egyptian army was destroyed there, 
who were fed by quails and by manna from heaven, saved from thirst 
at Horeb when water gushed forth from the rock when commanded 
to do so by the Lord, and guided by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar 
of fire by night. 

PRINCES OF ISRAEL DISOBEDIENCE AND DESTRUCTION 

There were in that day, as there have always been, those who prided 
themselves upon their intellectuality and ability. Upon one occasion while 
in the wilderness Moses told the camp to do certain things. There were 
some of the princes of Israel, men held in high esteem — among them 
Korah, Dathan and Abiram — who refused to comply with the request of 
Moses and informed him that they were holy. Because they had trans- 
gressed and become darkened in mind they didn't realize that the ad- 
versary was influencing them. They refused to do what the Lord 
wanted them to do — not what Moses desired of them but what the Lord 
required of them. And then they defied Moses and criticized him and 
found fault with him. The result was that a large number of them were 
swallowed up in an earthquake, and about fourteen thousand seven 
hundred others who complained because of what had happened to Korah 
and his followers were suddenly swept away by a plague. 

All down through history not only has there been spiritual distress 
but physical distresses have followed the people of God when they have 
been instructed what to do and have refused. 

AT THE TIME OF THE SAVIOR 

We come to the time of the Savior. He was the Son of God, and as 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



73 



long as people listened to his advice and counsel they had their blessings, 
but they failed to keep his commandments and the result was that the 
people from whom he came were scattered. Jerusalem was destroyed and 
a terrible condition arose. But prior to that time the Lord knowing 
what would occur took a remnant of his people and brought them across 
the mighty ocean to the Western Hemisphere. 

THE DESCENDANTS OF LEHI 

It was during the reign of King Zedekiah, six hundred years before 
the birth of Christ, that Lehi, a servant of the Lord, crossed the ocean 
with his family. It was a new world to them. They were at the mercy 
of the winds and waves of the sea, but the Lord provided them with a 
compass whereby they might know which way to steer their vessel to 
arrive at their destination. 

But some of the sons of Lehi rebelled and whenever they rebelled 
the compass would not work and they drifted hither and thither until 
they would repent. When they turned to the Lord the compass operated 
and they could steer their vessel in the direction of its destination. 

They came to this country. Soon after their arrival Laman and 
Lemuel became rebellious and they and their group refused to listen to 
the advice of their father or their younger brother Nephi whom the 
Lord had inspired. Nephi, desiring peace, went into another section 
of the country with his followers and left that which they esteemed to 
be a better part to Laman and Lemuel and those who followed them. 

What was the result? Those who kept the commandments of the 
Lord prospered. As long as they were faithful they were blessed and 
became a mighty multitude. Those who followed Laman and Lemuel 
because of their wilfulness were cursed with a dark skin and later 
became known as Indians. They lost their written language. They 
retained the story of their former lives and the lives of their parents by 
tradition. Nephi's people remained white and as long as they honored 
God and obeyed him were marvelously blessed. 

After his resurrection the Savior visited America as he had promised 
and conferred upon the faithful people the same blessings that he be- 
stowed upon those at Jerusalem. He gave them the priesthood and 
ordained apostles. He told them what they should do as a Church, and 
for two hundred years they were a righteous people. They kept his 
commandments and they were happy. Then came a period of wickedness 
and the destruction of the white race by the Lamanites. 

When Columbus discovered America the Lamanites were here in 
large numbers. They had lost their written language and knew of their 
ancestry only by tradition. They were a degraded people. They had 
suffered the penalty of refusing to take advantage of the opportunities 
that the Lord in his mercy had offered to them when he brought their 
ancestors to America. 

MODERN PROPHETS AND EXPERIENCES 

The Lord raised up mighty men to establish the United ' States of 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



America, and we became a nation. He gave us a glorious Constitution 
for our guidance and protection. He revealed himself again to the chil- 
dren of men and gave us another prophet. This prophet was only a youth 
but the Lord blessed him and magnified him and gave to him revelations. 
He organized a Church as commanded and we are members of that 
Church. 

The purpose of it was to prepare us to live eternally right here upon 
this earth, not upon some other earth. The Lord in his mercy restored 
the priesthood that had been lost to the earth. As martyrs for the truth, 
this prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum sealed their testi- 
monies with their blood. 

But the Lord raised up another leader. Brigham Young was called. 
And the people followed him and came into these mountain vales. I 
know of no people who have ever lived that have been more wonderfully 
blessed than have the people who followed President Young out into this 
section of the country. It has been my privilege within the last few 
days, in company with three of my brethren, to cover most of that trail. 
We came from Nauvoo along the route the first company followed and 
saw where they were camped at Sugar Creek, Garden Grove, Mount 
Pisgah, and other places. They were a courageous people. 

Winter Quarters, where the monument was dedicated two weeks 
ago yesterday, has been referred to here. The people were absolutely 
expatriated from their own lands, not for any wrong that they had done, 
but the Lord as in the case of Joseph in Egypt had a mission for them 
to perform. Joseph had not committed any wrong when he was sold 
into slavery and cast into prison, but he was needed and he had the 
courage to face his problems and became the savior of his race. 

So it was with those who had turned their backs upon civilization, 
many crossing the Mississippi river and the plains of Iowa in the winter. 
Many came later to the valley of the Great Salt Lake from other parts 
of America and from Europe. 

I stood just a few days ago upon the ground near Iowa City where 
three thousand of our people who had come from the east and from 
the old world, desirous of being with the body of the Church and unable 
to afford teams and wagons, began their pilgrimage with handcarts. 
We went over the trail where they traveled and saw where they had 
been. Many of them laid down their lives as a testimony of their faith 
in God. They gave their all and thereby became martyrs for the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. They have earned eternal life in the celestial kingdom, 
the highest reward of all. 

Driven from their homes in so-called civilization they suffered from 
exposure and the want of every comfort, facing dangers seen and 
unseen and passing through every unpleasant experience that you can 
think of they laid the foundation of this beautiful city and other happy 
communities. They gave to us this building in which we worship today. 
They began the Temple that is upon the ground just east of us. And we 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



75 



were fully established in the tops of the mountains before the passing of 
Brigham Young. 

NO SAFETY EXCEPT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS 

I have covered several thousand years of time in a few minutes but 
the thing that I would like to emphasize is that all through this period 
those who kept the commandments of the Lord were laying up treasures 
in heaven that nobody can take from them. They are sure of eternal 
life in the celestial kingdom. What of those who refused to do what 
the Lord would have them do? Think of those people in the days of 
Moses who ignored the advice of our Heavenly Father and were swal- 
lowed up by an earthquake or were destroyed by a plague. They for- 
feited all because of disobedience. But do we realize that in our own 
day and in our own time if we fail to keep the commandments of our 
Heavenly Father the difficulties and distresses that afflict mankind 
generally will come to us. The only assurance we have of safety is on 
the score of righteousness. There is no other way. 

OUR PRESENT PRESIDENT'S ADVICE REJECTED 

There are those among us today who have been blinded by the 
philosophies and foolishness of men. There are those who reject the 
advice and counsel of the man that God has placed at the head of this 
Church. 

I am grieved as I stand here and think of the way we rejected the 
counsel of President Grant. And I don't want to be counted among that 
"we" for I was not — but there were those among us who rejected the 
advice of the President of this Church and voted to repeal the Eighteenth 
Amendment and approved of bringing intoxicating liquor back into our 
community and legalizing it. That action has increased our accidents 
and murders and thousands of the sons and daughters of America are 
losing themselves and are being debauched beyond the possibility of 
recovery. 

Had we listened to the man who stands at our head and done our 
duty we would not in this valley and other places be suffering from the 
distresses that have come upon us, at least, we would not be responsible 
for them. 

People who haven't very much information suddenly come along 
with a bright idea, and they suggest "this is the way" or "that is the way," 
and although it is in conflict with the advice of the Lord some are per- 
suaded to try it. The Lord has given safe advice and appointed the 
President of his Church to interpret that advice. If we ignore what he 
advises, as the President of the Church, we may discover that we have 
made a serious mistake. 

THE LORD INTENDS WE SHALL WORK 

He has advised us to work. He has advised us to take care of our- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



selves and not become objects of charity. He has advised us not to 
look forward to the time when we can sit down in ease and live upon 
the efforts of somebody who is more industrious or more successful or 
more faithful. 

He has advised us to be real men and real women. I want to say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, if you will take that counsel, if the mem- 
bership of this Church will carry out the program that has been started 
God will bless us. We will have joy and satisfaction in our homes. We 
will not be concerned as to the conditions that exist abroad. More than 
that, there will be peace and love in our homes and that comfort that 
can only come from our Heavenly Father. That is the plan. Do you 
believe it? Do you believe that this is the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints? Do you believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the Lord? Do you believe that the man who stands at the head 
represents our Heavenly Father? He may make mistakes. The Prophet 
Joseph made his. Moses, the greatest leader of ancient times, made his 
mistakes. But I want to say that as long as the Lord sustains his leaders 
we should sustain them. Today the men who stand at our head are 
unselfishly giving of their time that not only we but the world in general 
may be blessed. As long as the Lord gives them physical strength, 
mental power and spiritual light, if we are wise we will follow their 
advice and counsel. 

When I think of those who came here into this arid country, how they 
divided the little substance they had with one another, how they worked 
with their hands, not only the men but the women and the children, 
I tell you it is a serious thing whenever we or any other people set up a 
regulation that says to our boys and girls : "You shall not work until you 
are eighteen years of age." 

That is not the Lord's way. Our Heavenly Father intended that 
we should work. He made it possible for us to work in this land and 
will continue to do so. One of the greatest curses that could come to 
humanity would be to lose the power to work, and yet many seem not 
to appreciate that fact. 

WHAT OF THE FUTURE 

I am thinking of the future. I am thinking of the handwriting 
upon the wall in the days of Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar. I am thinking 
of the conditions in the world today. The Lord has drawn you out of 
the world, has brought you to the fastness of these great hills, has given 
you an opportunity that you may be preserved from the evils of mankind 
if you will, and has promised you eternal life in the celestial kingdom 
if you will be faithful. 

I am grateful today for the blessing that is mine. I am thankful for 
membership in this Church. I am happy to be identified with the men 
who are in its leadership and I am thankful to be a member of the 
Church to which you belong and to associate with you in the flock. 

We can read the history of mankind and see that when men honored 



ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 77 

the Lord they were happy and prosperous ; when they turned their backs 
upon him and listened to the adversary of all righteousness, they lost 
their blessing and were often destroyed. Yet, with all that information 
before us, there are good men and good women in our own communities 
who are blinded by the philosophies of mankind, and they are going along 
jn the broad way that leads to destruction and unless they repent of their 
sins and turn back, they will be lost. 

HAPPINESS IN PROPORTION TO RIGHTEOUS LIVING 

There are many things that might be referred to wherein we are 
falling short, but I see many successes attained. I also see the joy and 
happiness in the homes of our people, and I pray that as a people we will 
look for the light and not for the darkness, that we will follow our leaders 
and not the trailers, that we will go forward, each realizing that we 
live independent lives, and our eternal happiness will be in proportion to 
our righteous living. The Lord has offered us opportunities for develop- 
ment that the world has never known before. Are we going to be blinded 
by the foolishness of others and lose our privileges, or will we cling to the 
iron red with our faces to our problems and our backs to those who 
would lead us astray ? 

So, Father in heaven, we are grateful for our membership in thy 
Church. We desire to be worthy of it and with thy help we will prove 
our devotion to thee and thy cause. That we may continue so to do and 
gain eternal life in the celestial kingdom in the companionship of the 
best men and women that have ever lived or will live upon the earth, I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 

President of the S panish- American Mission 

My brethren and sisters, this glorious sight takes my breath away 
from me. This is a glorious privilege that I am today adding to my privi- 
leges and blessings that have come to me as a result of this Gospel, and 
I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for it. 

I am happy to report the Spanish-American Mission. Although it 
is new in name yet this mission has existed for many years as a part of 
the Mexican Mission. 

I say to the parents that your boys and girls, the Elders and lady 
missionaries in this mission are well and happy in the work that they are 
doing in spreading the principles of this Gospel. We have had very little 
sickness among the missionaries during the summer months, some slight 
colds as a result of extreme heat in the southwest and along the Mexican 
border, but at this time they are all well and happy. 

It would be a source of joy and would gladden the hearts of each 
and every parent if they could hear the prayers that the missionaries are 
offering daily in their behalf, giving thanks for the privileges given them, 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and they are praying that the Spirit of the Lord will continue to bless you 
at home, that you will enjoy the same privileges, the outpouring of the 
Spirit of the Lord that they enjoy, and that it will be possible for you to 
continue the means whereby they are sustained in the mission field. 

Brother George Albert Smith in speaking of the Book of Mormon 
and the promises of the Lamanite people therein contained, reminded me 
of the fact that my assignment is to this people, that it is my duty through 
the help of the missionaries that have been sent to me, under the inspira- 
tion of the Spirit of the Lord, to carry the Gospel to this people, that 
they, through the blessings of the Gospel, may be redeemed, that they 
may be restored to the former knowledge that their parents had, and that 
they may be again restored to that glory that once obtained upon these 
continents, as evidenced by the wonderful ruins that have been excavated 
in Mexico and in Central America. 

Theirs was a mighty race, a vast civilization ,at one time. As has 
been stated here previously in this conference, these things were unknown 
at the time of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith was an instrument of our Father in heaven and gave to the 
world a knowledge of things that were past and a knowledge of things 
that would be proven to them in the future. 

Today these are demonstrated facts. 

I was interested in the remarks of President Richards before the 
class at the Mission Home this morning, wherein he said that in the early 
days of this Church, the missionaries were sent forth among the inhabi- 
tants of the earth to tell them that the restoration of the Gospel was about 
to take place — that the prieshood was to be restored and that the keys 
would be restored to the Prophet Joseph and his associates by those 
heavenly messengers who had held them in former dispensations. He 
pointed out that the duty of the Elders and the missionaries in the world 
today had changed — that it is their duty to testify that these are demon- 
strated facts, that these heavenly messengers have come, that the Gospel 
has been restored, and that they are messengers bearing the authority of 
the living God in representing these keys and giving this message to the 
world. 

I rejoice with you in the priesthood and the authority that is in this 
Church. I rejoice with you in the leadership thereof. 

It is my prayer that we shall ever be found in harmony with it. I hope 
the day will never come when I shall be without responsibility in this 
Church, because it is the one thing that will keep us safe, that will keep 
us in the paths of truth and righteousness and that will make of us ser- 
vants of our Heavenly Father and enable us to do his will here upon the 
earth. 

I rejoice in the inspiration that has come to us today and yesterday 
through the previous speakers. I only hope that through the Spirit of the 
Lord I shall be able to carry this enthusiasm and these messages back to 
our missionaries — and that we may spread it to the people with whom we 
are called to labor. 

I would like to say to the parents who are sending missionaries into 



ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 



79 



the mission field that the people among whom we labor are some of the 
finest people that inhabit the earth. They are a kindly people. It is true 
they are meek, but I am reminded that in Matthew, the Savior speaking 
on the mount, is there reported to have said: "Blessed are the meek for 
they shall inherit the earth." 

I am wondering if this has any significance when applied to the 
Lamanite race. I believe that it has. They are humble ; they are meek ; 
they are in humble circumstances. They have been a down trodden people 
for many generations and yet back of all that are the promises contained 
in the Book of Mormon to Lehi and his family when they were guided to 
this land, that it was to be a land of promise to them and their posterity 
forever — a land choice above all other lands. 

Is it possible that the day is at hand now when those promises will 
be fulfilled and when this meek, down-trodden people will inherit the 
earth? I hope so. I believe that it is here. If you could see what the Gos- 
pel is doing for this people, how it lifts them out of bondage and raises 
them to new heights, I am sure you would feel as I do the thrill that 
comes to those who see the lives of these people and the transformation 
that comes to them through the blessings of the Gospel. 

It is my desire to work earnestly and faithfully to discharge our obli- 
gations, to carry this message to this people, that in the own due time of 
our Heavenly Father these blessings will come to them, that these prom- 
ises may be fulfilled, that they may return to a knowledge of the Gospel 
and that they might again become a white and delightsome people, full 
of truth and zeal and of the energy and the faith that was exhibited during 
their periods of faithfulness in the Book of Mormon times. 

I want to say to you that when the Gospel has reached them and 
touched their hearts there is not a more faithful people, a more diligent 
and obedient people upon the face of the earth than are these Mexican 
or Lamanite people, because they strive earnestly day and night to keep 
the commandments of the Lord, to gain more knowledge and a greater 
testimony and they are really enjoying the Spirit of the Lord. 

It is a significant fact that although some missionaries from distant 
points, who are not acquainted with the Lamanite people, feel that they 
would rather go to some other mission, they feel that this people is not 
worthy, possibly, of their attention, but they all testify after a few months 
in the mission field and after becoming acquainted with this people, that 
they are thankful to their Father in heaven that they are permitted to 
labor as missionaries among this people and take to them the message of 
the Gospel. 

I pray the Spirit of the Lord to continue with us throughout the 
remaining sessions of this conference and that we may go back to our 
homes and our various fields of labor, filled with the Spirit of the Al- 
mighty and carry to them the messages that we have received here from 
our leaders, and I pray that we as a people will always be found sustain- 
ing our leaders, not only by word of mouth but upholding their hands in 
every way possible through our work and faith, that we may sustain 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



them that they may carry on the tremendous burdens that are upon their 
shoulders. 

I thank my Father in heaven every day for the acquaintance I have 
with the leaders of this Church, that he has permitted me to become ac- 
quainted with them and receive of their confidence and respect. 

I pray for his blessings upon them and upon all of us, and I do it in 
the name of his son, Jesus Christ, Amen.

BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

It is a source of gratitude, my brethren and sisters, to be with you in 
this conference and enjoy the good instructions, the spirited remarks and 
the beautiful music that we have heard. I rejoice in the splendid spirit and 
the very good counsel that has been given us throughout the entire ses- 
sions. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may attend me in what I may say. 

THE PRESIDENT AN AMBASSADOR OF GOOD WILL 

I am very happy in the excellent health that President Grant enjoys. 
To hear his clear ringing voice and see his alert, vigorous, active person- 
ality in his eightieth year is certainly interesting and remarkable, and a 
source of satisfaction, I am sure, to every member of the Church. He is 
a powerful ambassador of good will among the people of this nation in 
promoting friendship and removing prejudice, overcoming ill-will and 
misunderstanding regarding this great work in which we have part. He 
is doing an important work in that respect, and in his visits in the various 
wards, and dedicating meeting houses, the people of the Church are hav- 
ing the opportunity of coming in contact with him to a greater extent, 
possibly, than with any other President since the Church has grown so 
extensively. 

WAYS AND MEANS OF REMOVING PREJUDICE 

There are various means that are being developed and have been 
developed in the Church that are helping materially in removing prejudice 
and giving the people of this nation and other nations a much better 
understanding of what this people actually believe, — what they stand for, 
— what their habits are and what their desires and purposes and ideals are. 

BUREAU OF INFORMATION TEMPLE SQUARE 

These things have been mentioned in part during this conference. 
One of these is the Bureau of Information on this Temple Square. Dur- 
ing the past summer there have been more than 250,000 visitors in our 
midst who have come to the Square and have received information re- 
garding the history and the ideals of this people, and have become friends. 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



81 



A great work is being done as can be declared by those who live in other 
sections who have been here and whose minds have been changed toward 
this people in many respects and have come to have a better understand- 
ing of our principles and motives. 

TABERNACLE BROADCASTS 

Another means, as has been stated, is the regular weekly broadcast 
of the Tabernacle Choir and Organ, and other broadcasts, such as the 
Church of the Air in which we participate from time to time — and other 
programs over the air. They are all very helpful in overcoming prejudice 
and promoting good will. 

CHURCH HISTORICAL MONUMENTS 

In addition, the various monuments and places of historical interest, 
such as the Hill Cumorah, the Joseph Smith Home at Palmyra, the Jos- 
eph Smith Birthplace in Vermont, and Winter Quarters, are all proving 
very attractive to many visitors. They are helpful means of teaching the 
remarkable history of this,people and the foundations of our faith. 

LIMITED EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL MISSIONARIES 

It is remarkable, also, what development is taking place in ways and 
means of promulgating our message of good will and peace not only 
throughout this nation but in other places. When I was on my first mis- 
sion some thirty-seven years ago in the farthest corner of Belgium, in 
common with other missionaries, I used every available means to make 
known our message : tracting, conversations, holding meetings, etc. We 
held meetings both in French and in German among the people who were 
living there. We visited those who would permit us to enter their homes 
and held cottage meetings ; and yet I thought at that time that my efforts 
were relatively limited in trying to get this message before the millions of 
people. In that little country of Belgium alone there were several million 
people at that time. I suppose it is the most densely populated country in 
Europe — over 640 people per square mile, — a nation that exemplifies the 
bee-hive. It doesn't have that motto, but it is honey-combed with indus- 
tries of all kinds, and the people there are generally very busy. 

SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMUNICATION 

When I read and declared the fulfilment of the promise made by 
the Apostle John that an angel should come forth "having the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and people," it seemed to me an almost over- 
whelming task to undertake. I could not see how it could be accomplished. 
In the thirty-seven years that have elapsed since that time I have come to 
realize more fully, particularly recently, that there are ways and means 
being provided whereby this Gospel of peace can be declared in a very 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



much wider circle and in a very much wider range than has been the case 
heretofore. 

GREATER PROGRESS IN PROSPECT 

We are on the eve of greater developmnets. At the present time, for 
instance, we have an offer to install a television transmitter in this city ; 
and while, of course, it is new and is experimental in a sense, and its 
range is relatively small — about twenty-five or thirty miles, and the re- 
ceiving sets are rather expensive — it is an indication of additional means 
whereby, not only the voice, but the face and figure of the one who may 
be speaking can be shown successfully over considerable areas. 

MESSAGES TO BE CONVEYED TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH 

Likewise, the matter of developing increased power for broadcasting 
is at our very door. Almost at this moment in the City of Washington, 
the Federal Communications Commission is holding a hearing on applica- 
tions from some of the largest stations in this country to increase the 
power under which .they operate, ten times as much as the power that is 
now being used generally throughout the country. The result of such 
increase cannot be calculated at the present time. Not only that, but the 
use of what is known as a short wave, quite different in its range, although 
it is of the same character, an electrical wave for the conducting of mes- 
sages to the very ends of the earth, is being developed. So, I can appreci- 
ate in a larger measure that means and ways will be made available for 
the great missionary work we are now doing and that is to be done in the 
future, both in the world at large and in the various localities where Saints 
are established in the stakes and wards ; and that the Lord will fulfil his 
purposes. 

GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 

I rejoice in all of these things. I rejoice in the growth of the Church 
as it has been described by President Grant. I just happen to remember 
that recently in the Christian Herald, a publication that circulates widely 
throughout this nation, comparisons were shown for last year of the 
growth of the various churches. By the way, may I state that it is shown 
in the article in that publication that the Christian churches of the United 
States are growing faster than the population of the country, so that 
Christian membership is increasing throughout this nation. 

Among other things it is shown that there are thirty-three church 
groups that have a population of over 50,000 each ; and in those groups 
the Latter-day Saint group is twelfth in number. We have advanced 
from fourteenth place, in recent years, to twelfth ; and our percentage of 
membership gain for 1935 is more than double the average of that group 
of thirty-three and the highest of the twelve. In percentage gain we are 
among the highest of the thirty-three groups. In the past nine years our 
percentage gain is nearly twice the average of the thirty-three groups. 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



83 



IMPROVEMENT IN TITHEPAYING 

As stated by the President, also, evidences of the faith of the mem- 
bers of the Church are shown by the improvement made in various tem- 
poral activities — notably in the observance of the principle of tithing. I 
am sure that through the appeals and the instructions of the First Presi- 
dency as well as through the improved general economic conditions, and 
better crops and prices in the farming districts, there has been a material 
increase in the tithes for the first six months of this year, which is the 
latest report that we have, as compared with the same period of last 
year. This amounts to approximately twenty per cent increase in tithing. 
In regard to the number of tithepayers, there has been an increase of 
about ten per cent showing that those who are observing the principle of 
tithing are paying largely in proportion to their increased income. Re- 
garding farm crops and prices, it is well to remember that the agricultural 
industry is a very important factor in our economic welfare. When farm 
crops are good and prices are normal the nation prospers. During many 
years past, whenever prices of farm products have been at normal level, 
economic conditions have been favorable. 

OBSERVANCE OF FASTING AND FAST OFFERINGS 

In regard to the matter of improvement in the observance of fast 
offerings, of course, there have been only about three months, as shown 
by the report, since the instruction and encouragement given by the First 
Presidency ; but the fast offerings have increased for the first six months 
of this year forty per cent as compared with the same period last year, 
and the number who have paid fast offerings has increased forty-one per 
cent. There has been an increase in per capita of practically the same 
proportion. One of the interesting evidences of what can be done with 
regard to fulfilling the request of the First Presidency that there be not 
less than one dollar paid during the year per capita of the Church mem- 
bership by all members of the Church is shown by one ward, at least, in 
the Church, during the past four or five years. That is the San Francisco 
ward of the San Francisco stake. For the past five years, they have had 
an average of over one dollar per capita of Church membership in that 
ward ; and it is a ward that is made up largely of wage earners and people 
who are engaged in daily labor and earning moderate amounts. 

WHAT FAST OFFERING REPRESENTS 

The fast offering, of course, is intended to serve two purposes: the 
first is that it represents the fasting of the members of the Church, — the 
abstaining from two meals, — and the attendance at fast and testimony 
meeting. The people are strengthened spiritually through such fasting, 
praying, and testimonies. Secondly, in recognition of the needs of those 
who are not so fortunate as they, that they give the equivalent in value 
of those two meals. Thereby, they suffer no financial loss and they gain 
a great spiritual benefit. That is the true spirit of the observance of fast 
offering. 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is reported to us that, in some instances, in order to make a better 
record, bishops have encouraged the giving of funds or obtaining of 
funds to be credited to their ward that do not represent the individual 
giving by the head or the members of the family. We would suggest that 
the spirit of this principle and the manner of observance should be care- 
fully followed. It is for the spiritual benefit of all Church members as 
well as for the aid of those who are in need, and should be carried out in 
the spirit thereof as instructed by the First Presidency. 

EXTENT OF RELIEF 

Now, with regard to the matter of relief extended : There were 
about 16,100 people, as I remember it, who were assisted by the bishopric 
and the Relief Society of the various wards during the past six months, 
which is approximately three hundred fifty less than a year ago for the 
same period. The tithes expended in the relief of the poor throughout the 
Church have increased during the past six months as compared with the 
first six months of 1935 — about 31 per cent. In addition to the tithes 
expended, of course, there are the fast offerings and the help extended by 
the Relief Society. The total expended for relief by the Church increased 
about 11 per cent. 

There appears to be some misunderstanding in Utah regarding the 
Federal appropriations. The so-called "dole" was abandoned in 1935 
and replaced by work relief for all able-bodied persons in need, and by 
direct relief for those who are incapacitated. 

SPLENDID EFFORTS OF RELIEF SOCIETY 

I rejoice in the good report that has been given and in the work that 
has been accomplished during the past few months under the Security 
Plan. There has been a prompt and active response throughout the 
Church to the appeal of the First Presidency made at the April Confer- 
ence. I would like to express particular appreciation to the Relief Society 
throughout the Church for the splendid work they have done. Their will- 
ingness to sacrifice and the energy they have put into the work that has 
been entrusted to them of doing so much for the welfare of the poor is 
very praiseworthy. 

In many cases, these women, — housewives, mothers in homes, of- 
ficers of the Relief Society, — have given a tremendous amount of service. 
In fact, according to the reports that come to us, some of them are al- 
most worn out, because of the service they have given. Of course, it is 
expected and intended that as many as possible of those in need who are 
to get the benefit should contribute of their labor for the accomplishment 
of these things — the securing of food and taking care of it and the pro- 
viding of clothing and bedding and things of that kind. Everyone who 
expects to get relief should work for it. 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



85 



SELF-SACRIFICE OF STAKE AND WARD OFFICERS 

In this great undertaking I have been greatly impressed and filled 
with appreciation for the devotion and the fine spirit shown by the stake 
presidencies and the ward bishoprics throughout the Church. Their will- 
ingness to serve, — busy men as they are, having their own living to earn, 
volunteering their services so readily to the Church — is admirable. They 
have given their time, sometimes at the sacrifice of their own occupations, 
in order to carry out the request of the First Presidency in this work 
which we are undertaking. I pray the Lord to bless and sustain them. I 
appreciate always the service of these men who are called to preside, be- 
cause the heavy burden of this responsibility rests primarily upon the 
bishop and the stake president and they give that service willingly and 
freely. 

SPIRITUAL WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN 

There is one other thing I would like to mention, my brothers and 
sisters, and that is this : We are all concerned with the spiritual welfare 
and the training of our children. They are a source of blessing to us if 
we train them and teach them in righteousness. If we fail by example and 
precept to stimulate them in high principle and right living, they may be 
the cause of sorrow and remorse to us. A great responsibility rests upon 
us as parents. These souls are precious in the sight of God. We should 
recognize their true worth, and do our utmost for their proper develop- 
ment. We have a rare privilege in the Church and that is the opportunity 
of receiving, enjoying and serving in the priesthood. That is the very 
foundation of the Church, — the source of its divinity. I am concerned, 
of course, for the girls as well as for the boys, but primarily my responsi- 
bility concerns the boys who may receive the priesthood. I realize that 
through the encouragement, the help, and the inspiration of the parents, 
the boys who should receive the priesthood can become worthy to receive 
it and be inspired and encouraged to carry on their responsibilities in that 
priesthood. 

TRAINING IN THE PRIESTHOOD 

That is, primarily, the parents' responsibility. In addition thereto 
the various auxiliaries — the Primary Association, the Sunday School, 
the Mutual organizations, and, of course, the priesthood leaders them- 
selves — are helping materially in the teaching and training of these young 
men. I feel that of all things that are of concern in this Church, the train- 
ing and welfare and development of these young men in the spirit and 
power of the priesthood is of first importance. They are the hope for the 
future progress of the Church. In order to best qualify these young 
men for the greatest good, they are entitled to have systematic teaching 
and training under inspired leadership, and to perform regularly all the 
varied duties of their callings in willingness and the spirit of true service. 
I think we, as leaders of the Church in the various divisions thereof, 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ought to give great consideration to the advancement, welfare and func- 
tioning of these young men in the various labors and duties that they are 
called to fulfil, that they may measure up to high standards and get the 
spirit of the priesthood. The youth of the Church will qualify if only we 
give them the proper leadership. Shall we accept this challenge? 
"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office 
in which he is appointed, in all diligence." (D. & C. 107:99). 

May the power and spirit and blessing of the Lord attend us all, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very sorry that we have not time enough to hear addresses 
of fifteen or twenty minutes each from the brethren of the First Council 
of the Seventy, but we shall have to ask them to limit their remarks to ten 
minutes. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

The most blessed thing, and the greatest thing, that has ever come to 
mankind in all the history of the race since the dawn of creation is the 
Gospel of the Lord, Jesus Christ. There is nothing of so great importance 
to every one of us as to make a practical application of that Gospel. 

It is for that purpose that we have been placed here upon this earth, 
that there might be made a practical application of those principles which 
have within them the power of God unto salvation, power to bring us back 
to God from whose presence we have wandered far away. 

These principles are everlasting and eternal in their very scope. I am 
going to quote a few things in regard to these principles. People may 
wonder and think, "Oh, are you going to talk about faith and repent- 
ance?" Most assuredly, there isn't anything else to talk about. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith gave instructions to the early missionaries of this 
Church that they should speak none other thing to this generation than 
repentance of sin. 

Faith is an attribute of God. Hope is a divine attribute. Charity is 
a divine attribute. It is a part of that image in which man has been cre- 
ated. Every one of those attributes form a part of the image. When we 
read in the scriptures, "So God created man in his own image, in the 
image of God created he him, male and female created he them," it means 
not only in the physical image of God but in all of his divine attributes. 

God is love and man is love. There is love in every human creature. 
There is faith in heaven and there is faith upon the earth. There is faith 
in man ; just as there is hope and charity in every human being. No man, 
however savage or ignorant, has ever been discovered without these di- 
vine attributes. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



87 



We have inherited all of these divine attributes because we are the 
children of God in very deed, and so man is made in the image of God 
both in spirit and in body, in physical form and in all of his faculties ; the 
difference being that in the one they exist in their perfection, in the other 
in very imperfect form. And, there is meaning in the commandment of 
the Saviour when he said: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father 
in heaven is perfect." 

If we ever attain to those divine perfections, it will be because we 
have made the practical application of those principles that have within 
them the power of God unto our salvation. Every one of these attributes 
is susceptible of being developed and made perfect through the applica- 
tion of the principles of the Gospel, the most blessed thing, the greatest 
boon, the very pearl of great price that has been committed to men for the 
express purpose of perfecting their lives and preparing them for celestial 
glory. To accomplish this divine purpose God made this earth and placed 
us here upon it. 

Let me now quote a few passages from the Apostle Paul's epistle to 
the Hebrews ; defining faith, he says : 

Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things 
not seen. 

What wonderful meaning is contained in these words ! The very 
substance of things hoped for, the essence itself, a divine attribute and 
part of God. 

Faith is the very substance of "the things hoped for." What are we 
hoping for? If we are hoping for the sordid things of the world or for 
the gratification of evil desires or of unworthy ambitions, then our faith 
is likewise bad. If our hopes are evil, then our faith is evil, for faith is the 
very substance of our hopes. 

People who devote their whole lives in hoping for the things that are 
evil may know it is their faith that is guiding them. So we should be care- 
ful what we hope for. Faith is a wonderful principle. 

A man once said to me — he was a clergyman, a minister — he was 
not orthodox — he made this statement ; "You have one principle in your 
Church that I do not like." This man that I am speaking of was a learned 
man. I visited him in his home in his large living room that was literally 
lined with books from the floor to the ceiling, a man of scholarship, schol- 
arly attainments. He said, 

"You have one thing that I do not like." 

"What is it?" I asked. 

"It is that principle you call faith." 

"What is the matter with faith ?" 

"Just think of it," said he, "to believe anything that you hear." 

What a misconception he had of faith. He had no conception what- 
ever of it. Faith doesn't mean to believe everything you hear. The Lord 
doesn't want us to believe everything we hear. He does not want us to 
believe lies or liars. He does not want us to believe falsehoods. What 
does he want us to believe ?

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Believe 
the Truth. Believe in his Gospel ; his Gospel is the truth. That is what 
the Lord wants us to believe and he has not left us without the means of 
knowing, for the spirit of Christ has been given to every man that he 
might know good from evil, (B. of M., Moroni 7:16) and by that spirit 
we know when we are doing right and when we are doing wrong, and if 
our hopes are right and if our deeds are right then we know what we shall 
believe. We shall believe the truth as it is embodied in the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

Faith is a principle of power, for we read in the same Epistle, 
"Through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of 
God." What was that word? In the very beginning, "Let there be light," 
and the whole universe was ablaze with it, and the worlds were framed 
by his unbounded faith and his almighty word, the word of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. "All energy manifest on this planet is transmitted to us through 
the light of the sun," said one of the scientists in the recent world congress 
in Chicago. Modern revelation informs us that all the energy of the uni- 
verse emanates from the Light of Christ. (D. & C. 88 :7-13). 

Again, let me quote : 

"For without faith it is impossible to please God." If you want to 
please God you must have faith. "For he that cometh to God must believe 
that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." 

Surely no man will bend the knee in humble prayer unless he has 
faith in God. If you really desire to please God then seek him diligently 
and your faith will never fail. 

There are many people who foolishly think they know all there is 
about faith and repentance. As a matter of fact such people are totally 
ignorant of them. A prominent teacher, a scholar and withal a fine Latter- 
day Saint, once said to me that he would like to have something new to 
learn. He knew all there was about faith and repentance ; he wanted to 
study something else. To which I replied; "If you know all about these 
doctrines then there is nothing else that we can teach you, for they include 
everything that there is to learn." 

These doctrines are all-inclusive; they enter into all the affairs of 
men ; into every thought and into every action. They have to do with all 
our business transactions, all our amusements and recreations and indeed 
with every thought, every desire, and every ambition that enters into the 
human heart. This will be apparent to every thoughtful mind when we 
consider the fact that there is a right way and a wrong way of doing 
everything. Good and evil are ever present. The Spirit of Christ is given 
to every man that he might know good from evil (B. of M., Moroni 
7:16) ; but the devil came also; the necessary opposition which places 
us in the position where we have to choose whether we want to or not. 
There is no escape from this responsibility for we are endowed with our 
own free agency, without this there could be no progress. There is no 
compulsion. To choose the good is faith — to reject the evil is repentance. 
"Whomsoever ye list to obey his servant ye are" ; therefore, "Resist the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 89 

devil and he will flee from you. Draw nigh unto God and he will draw 
nigh unto you." Drawing night unto God is faith — resisting the devil is 
repentance. These, then, should be the governing principles of all human 
conduct. Then "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be 
saved." 

Now, hope follows our faith be it good or evil. What should we hope 
for? Surely not for the sordid things of the world but on the contrary 
for the triumph of God's work that his kingdom may come — his will be 
done on earth as it is in heaven ; for a life beyond the grave and a happy 
reunion with loved ones that have gone before. Yes, let us hope for 
eternal life, God's greatest gift to man. Whence come such hopes as 
these? Only from faith in God. Who inspires us with these exalted 
hopes ? Only our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who overcame death and 
the grave. Then true and living faith in him, which is only manifest in the 
works of obedience to his will, is the very substance and assurance that 
God gives us that our exalted hopes shall surely be realized. 

Some people say they have no faith, no hope, when we die that is the 
end. What darkness ! What despair ! How I pity such people. 

"Cease every joy to glimmer on my mind, 

But leave, oh leave the light of hope behind," says the poet. 

Now comes charity, the greatest of all the divine attributes. "Though 
I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity I am 
become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol." 

The biggest thing in all the world, then, is charity. We must not 
confuse that with what we call almsgiving. Almsgiving is very truly a 
part of charity and I might say a very important part of it, but charity 
goes far beyond that. It means to give all that we have and all that we 
are, our whole being, and even life. Christ was the embodiment of that 
love and that charity, for he gave his life and suffered on the cross for 
the whole world, and "greater love hath no man than this, that he lay 
down his life for his friend." 

"Charity is the pure love of Christ," is among the sayings of one of 
the prophets of the Book of Mormon. 

"Now abideth faith, hope and charity." 

Charity never faileth ; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail ; 
whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, 
it shall vanish away. 

For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 

But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part 
shall be done away. 

The love of Christ is the perfect thing that will supersede everything 
else. Then cultivate these Christian attributes, these divine attributes. 
They are ours to develop ; they are in us, a part of our nature. Develop 
and practice them by seeking the Lord, "if, happily, you may feel after 
him and find him, for he is not far distant from every one of us, for in 
him we live, and move and have our being." 

God help us to do so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I crave an interest in your faith and prayers, my brethren and 
sisters, that in the short time that I stand before you I may be able, 
under the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord, to give utterance to a thought 
or two that I have had in my mind for some time. 

There have been several references to the dedication of the very 
wonderful monument at Winter Quarters. It was my good fortune, 
together with my wife, to be numbered with that party. I sat under 
the canopy and listened to the wonderful addresses that were made by 
our own leaders and the leaders of the State that was host to us on that 
occasion. I had very many interesting thoughts pass through my mind 
as that program unfolded. The outstanding feature of it all, of course, 
was the very friendliness of the people who were receiving us and bidding 
us welcome, a very great contrast to the condition that prevailed at the 
time when that cemetery in which we were dedicating the monument 
became a necessity. 

I sat right behind the Governor of the State of Nebraska when 
the President of the Church made reference to the fact that our people 
had been driven from one place to another until they were finally forced 
to occupy Winter Quarters under the very adverse circumstances which 
prevailed. 

The Governor turned to the Mayor and said, "We must remember 
that that was twenty years before the State of Nebraska came into 
existence." They were very grateful for the fact that they had not been 
a party to that persecution. 

My mind went back to the organization of the Church and the very 
difficult task which devolved upon the Prophet in its organization in the 
harmonizing of the many conflicting attitudes of men who came into 
the Church in the early days. His was, indeed, a herculean task, and 
he did his duty well and nobly. I am quite sure that without the inspira- 
tion of the Lord which he enjoyed this task would have been impossible. 
To bring from the many nations of the earth the people that he did, and 
to crystallize their thoughts into a unit and harmonize them in their 
activities was indeed a tremendous task, and he did it well. 

It brought into my mind a picture with two sides. I saw on the 
one side men and women of sterling character, firm in their purpose, 
true in their faith and courageous in sustaining their officers, willing to 
do as those people did who lie buried in that cemetery — to lay down 
their lives at any time should it be required. I am sure that my grand- 
father and grandmother stood ready to do that, along with yours. A 
faithful people they were, a struggling people, trying to find the truth, 
or to live according to the truth they had found, and do their full duty. 

On the other side of that picture, I saw a smaller number perhaps 
of people who had come into the Church with different motives, whose 
faith was not of the same high and pure and holy character, who were 



ELDER ANTOINE R. WINS 



91 



avaricious, ambitious, and designing men who came in and availed 
themselves of the counsels of the Prophet and the leaders of the Church 
only to misapply them and turn against them. I believe that the perse- 
cutions that came upon the people were largely due to the activity of 
such men. So the Evil One came in, as he always does, and opposed 
the truth. I believe that to be an actual fact. 

I believe also this to be true : that there is a way to bind the Devil — 
the way of faith. If we want to bind him up and bind him strong, we 
will unite ourselves together in a solid band, with a single purpose, to 
sustain our leaders, to live the Gospel, and to honor God. If our people 
at that time had been a unit in that purpose, had there been no opposi- 
tion and no treason within the Church, I wonder if the sacrifices of 
Winter Quarters would have been necessary. I believe they would not. 
To bear me out in that statement, I am going to read just one or two 
verses from the 105th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that 
you miv learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people — 

Behold, I say unto ycu, were it not for the transgressions rf my people, 
speaking concerning the Church and not individuals, they might have been 
redeemed even now. 

That is the answer to that question in my mind. If they had been 
sufficiently united, sufficiently of one mind and one purpose, had they 
been able to so completely eliminate from their hearts selfishness and 
greed and avarice, so that they could walk together with their arms 
around each other in that unity of purpose, then the redemption of the 
center stake of Zion would, according to the word of the Lord, have 
been a possibility. 

They were not so united, unfortunately, and they had to pay the 
penalty in trouble and sorrow and death to learn the lesson. Now out 
of those experiences, evidently, we have learned some lessons, because 
we are now, I believe, a more united people, and I believe that that 
is the reason the Lord turned the good will of the people who were 
once our enemies to us and that we are now enabled to be friends with 
them. 

That does not mean in any sense that we tolerate the things which 
we deem sin, which some people indulge in and which we try to eliminate 
from our midst — not by any means. But it does mean that we can be 
charitable towards them, that we can lend them the hand of fellowship 
and assistance where it is possible. 

We are faced with a problem right now. The Presidency of this 
Church has made a promise to the people, not only to the people of the 
Church but to the people of the world, and we have the problem of re- 
deeming that promise. It will be possible only through a united effort 
of this people. If there be those among us who go around sowing the 
seeds of dissension, distrust and criticism of their policies, success will 
not be so great. But if we can eliminate from our hearts all distrust 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and attack our problem with a sympathetic urge and an interest in its ac- 
complishment the world will see this people redeem that pledge. 

I trust that we may rally to it, every man and woman of us, that we 
may show the world that there is in this Church a power in the priesthood 
which is active, vigorous, and will endure. 

God bless you all. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to be able 
to attend this conference and listen to the testimonies that have been 
borne. The addresses that have been made have all been for our good 
and benefit. 

The longer I live the more I am convinced that the Lord, our God, 
has a planned program and that he is anxious that it be taught to his 
children in their daily walks of life. I am sure that the Savior had received 
this plan from his Father when he said: "My doctrine is not mine, but 
his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." 

I think the scriptures are absolutely correct in their teachings con- 
cerning the great work which our Father intended should be done by his 
sons and his daughters. Men and women were known of him long 
before the foundation of this earth was laid. He knew them and gave 
them promises upon their obedience, as a result of the life they had 
lived. 

When the Lord showed unto Abraham the intelligences that were 
created before the world was organized and that among them there were 
many of the noble and great ones, he said : "These I will make my rulers. 
. . . Abraham, thou art one of them ; thou wast chosen before thou wast 
born." 

And again to Jeremiah : "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew 
thee ; and before thou earnest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and 
I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations." 

I think we knew the plan that was to be brought about in this earth. 
There were great men and undoubtedly great women in the spirit world, 
who were selected, and ordained to take part in the work to be accom- 
plished for the salvation of men. In that pre-mortal state men and women 
enjoyed free agency. They enjoyed the gift of intelligence and had the 
power to choose their course, and through faith and works they achieved 
success. They were known unto the Lord, and they grew and developed 
in character under the leadership and under the planning of God. They 
were to be prophets when they came into the world. They were to be 
leaders of men. 

We find that in this dispensation of time in which we live the 
Prophet Joseph Smith made the statement that every missionary who 
has a call to go into the world was ordained to that calling before the 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 93 

world was. And that tells me that those men had an understanding of the 
plan of God so far as they had lived it, and that they were given the right 
and the privilege of coining into the world to preach the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and to bear testimony to the children of men concerning 
the great plan of God. This plan, fully substantiated in Holy Writ, is 
taught by this Church, and all men and women need only to make 
investigation of it. 

I hope and pray that the honest in heart may be reached, that they 
may be led to conclude that this is not the beginning of men's strength 
or ability, but that the Lord God gave them strength, — his strength and 
his power, — and planned for them to take a part in the great program 
that he would establish in these, the last days. 

I think the Latter-day Saints are carrying out the program of 
God. There is faith in the Church and diligence. There is power among 
men where they stand together, as this people stand together, for the 
things that are taught them by the leaders of the Church. They become 
convinced that only through obedience to God can they grow or can 
they become useful. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is making history — marvelous history in this dispensation ; the leadership 
of the Church has been inspired; they have been prepared for the 
emergencies that they have had to meet, and will have to meet. 

I recall the statement that President Grant made yesterday when 
he told of how he and Francis M. Lyman took horses and wagons, 
buggies, etc., and traveled all through this country building up the Church 
and Kingdom of God — sleeping on the ground, taking their chances 
with the elements, with nothing in their minds but the fact that they 
were called of God to build up and establish Zion in this great inland 
country. They planned better than they knew. 

The Lord has produced out of that pair of missionaries two great 
men. President Lyman through the powerful testimony he bore and the 
great work he accomplished has left a name in the earth ; and President 
Grant, who stands here today in his eightieth year, is a leader directed 
by the inspiration and power of God. He is given strength to go and 
come and to speak in the name of God, thereby reaching the hearts of 
the children of men. It is faith-promoting to contemplate such lives 
as those of these two men. In them we see the fulfilment of the promises 
of the Lord. 

This Gospel is the plan of our Eternal Father. His program will be 
more fully revealed. This last movement (the Church Security Plan), 
pertaining to us temporally, will be just as He has planned. It will be 
made a method by which our Lord will introduce the thing that is most 
needed in the Church and in the world at large. 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord to hold us together, that we may 
be cemented as one, and stand together as his sons and his daughters, 
and carry on, as we are able to do, his purposes in the earth. May we 
hold up the hands of those who preside over us, that his work may be 
effective and that his work may be sure. That we may be able to take 
part in it I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

As you all are aware, Brother Joseph F. Merrill and Brother Richard 
R. Lyman are absent from this Conference, also Brother Alonzo A. 
Hinckley. Brother Lyman is presiding over the European Mission, 
having succeeded Brother Merrill who is on his way home. Elder 
Hinckley has returned from California and is at the home of one of his 
daughters in this city. He is greatly improved in health and is gaining 
in flesh. He is on the high road to recovery. 

The Relief Society "Singing Mothers" sang "Inflammatus" (Ros- 
sini) — Margaret Stewart Hewlett, soloist. 

Elder Edward J. Wood, President of the Alberta Temple, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, October 3. 



THIRD DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, October 3, 1936. 

Long before the time arrived for commencing the fifth session of the 
Conference every seat and available space in the great Tabernacle audi- 
torium and galleries was occupied, and thousands of people assembled on 
the Temple Block and in the large Assembly Hall immediately south of 
the Tabernacle, where, by means of amplifying equipment that had been 
installed, they listened to the Conference proceedings. 

The meeting commenced promptly at 10 o'clock. 

President Grant announced that the congregation and the Taber- 
nacle Choir would sing the hymn, "O Say, What Is Truth ?" 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder George E. Jorgensen, President of the Carbon Stake. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, the audience in this wonderful building 
is an inspiration, and it reminds me of the great faith and confidence 
of the members of the Church in its divine organization. 

IMPORTANCE OF SERVICE 

During the few moments that I shall occupy I desire to call your 
attention to what I think is of the greatest importance not only as 
affecting the Church and its growth, but in every worthy avocation of 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



95 



life ; that is, service — service to our God, service to our country, service 
to the family, service to the Church. Without such service, it seems 
to me, my brethren and sisters, there would not be in the hearts of the 
people a full knowledge of their duty, not only to God and country, and 
family, and the Church, but to all the activities of life in which they 
become engaged or interested. 

Service to our God — I doubt whether there is a people living on 
the earth as near to God and who recognize the duty that they owe to 
our Heavenly Father as do the Latter-day Saints. I am proud to say 
that I doubt whether there is a people — in fact I am positive of it — 
whose loyalty and service to the country is greater than that of the mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

We believe that the Constitution of the United States was an 
inspired instrument from our Heavenly Father, and we believe in being 
loyal and true to that document and to every requirement made of us as 
citizens of the greatest country in the world. 

We believe in service to family, one of the great and important 
things of life. I sometimes think, my brethren and sisters, that men 
of affairs give less attention to their own loved ones than they do to 
public interests. I hope not, I pray not, but I am fearful that some 
of us are guilty of this. There is no question in my mind about our 
loyalty and service to the Church. This vast audience demonstrates 
beyond question of doubt your loyalty, and we know of your service. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I desire to call attention this morning 
to some of the fundamental principles that should be in the lives not only 
of the Latter-day Saints, but in the lives of honest, devoted, true men 
and women no matter what church they may belong to. 

THE BURDEN OF DEBT 

We are living in a day of extravagance, and I might say not only 
we as individuals of the nation, but I am fearful that extreme extrava- 
gance reaches into every organization — city, county, state, and nation. 
I know how hard it is to reduce an obligation, even that of the govern- 
ment of the United States. At the close of the World War our govern- 
ment was owing $26,187,000,000. For ten years succeeding that time 
every effort was made, and I assure you that everything that I could do 
as chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the 
Appropriations Committee, was done to raise the money and meet the 
obligations of our government. It took ten long years to reduce the 
government indebtedness to $16,000,000,000. Now we are about to 
enter into the thirty billions. I want to call attention to that fact, not 
by way of criticism, but to emphasize what I have already said, that in 
the family, I care not where that family may be, every member of it, 
should be acquainted with what the head of the family receives, and 
make a plan to live within that income ; and I am going to add, if there 
is any possible way of saving a little each year do that. 

We do not know what is coming; we do not know, my brethren 
and sisters, altogether what obligations we will be called to meet, but 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I pray you to keep out of debt if it is possible for you to do so. I may 
say that the members of the home must be united in order to carry 
out this desirable condition. 

THE HUMBLE HOME OF A PRESIDENT 

I remember that upon one occasion I was asked by President 
Coolidge to attend a conference to consider the policy to be adopted 
by the United States respecting the indebtedness of foreign countries 
to the United States. The meeting was held at his father's home. I 
shall never forget the thoughts I had when I was called to the boyhood 
home of the President to consider the question of our national in- 
debtedness. It was built scores of years before, and as I ride through 
the different settlements of our state and look at some of the humble 
homes built years and years ago I say : "There was a home of a President 
of the United States that was just as simple, no more pretentious." 
Inside the home the fixtures and furniture were what you would expect 
to see inside a home in any of our little towns or cities within our own 
state. It taught me a lesson, and I then understood why he as President 
of the United States watched and guarded personally every item of 
expense, and wherever in his judgment there should be a reduction he 
never hesitated to call it to the attention of the Appropriations Committee. 

So, my brethren and sisters, the few words that I have said in 
relation to the matter of being careful, prudent, and saving are said 
in the hope that you will be watchful that nothing is done by way of 
extravagance to bring a debt upon yourself and loved ones. 

A PRAYER FOR BLESSINGS 

Father in heaven, we jointly ask of thee at this time for wisdom 
and judgment to carry on thy work, and may we all be loyal and true 
to the great cause that we have espoused. How wonderful has been its 
growth, and what an influence for good it is to be in the future and in the 
affairs of the world we cannot know, but we do know that it is going to 
be a power for good. God grant his choicest blessings upon the Presi- 
dency of this Church. Lead and guide them by thy Holy Spirit, that 
they may have the love, and the honor, and the respect of men of the 
world who are honest in heart, and that they may be upheld by the 
prayers of the people of this Church, that they may be one united body, 
with one thought in mind, that is : God's great work upon this earth, I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

TABERNACLE CHOIR AND ORGAN BROADCAST 

From 10:30 to 11:00 the following program of choral and organ 
music was presented by the Tabernacle Choir and Organ which program 
was broadcast by radio throughout the United States and Canada through 
the courtesy of the Columbia Broadcasting System, originating over 
Station KSL, Salt Lake City : 

"Glorious Things Are Sung of Zion" (Daynes) — Choir. 

"Prelude to the Deluge" (Saint Saens) — Organ. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 97 

"Listen to the Lambs" (Dett) — Choir. 

"Toccata" (Boellman) — Organ.

CHURCH OF THE AIR BROADCAST 

At the conclusion of the Tabernacle Choir and Organ broadcast, a 
thirty minute program was presented on the Columbia Broadcasting 
System's regularly scheduled Church of the Air series, this being a 
nation-wide broadcast. The radio announcer was Richard L. Evans. 

The program opened with the Tabernacle Choir and the congrega- 
tion joining in the singing of the hymn "High On the Mountain Top." 

Elders John A. Widtsoe and Melvin J. Ballard were the speakers. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The second greatest question of life was asked by the ancient psalm- 
ist: "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?" In importance, this 
query is next only to that concerning the nature of God. 

Inability to answer this question has often defeated fervent faith. 
The correct answer has enabled men and nations to build their futures 
securely. Faith has been most effective when accompanied by an un- 
derstanding of man's relationship to Deity. The way out of the world's 
tragic chaos — the terror of poverty, sickness and war — must be il- 
luminated by a comprehension of man's nature and destiny. 

Man is one of the eternal, imperishable realities of the universe. 
His story begins in the infinite past, before the earth was made. His 
eternity reaches into the yesterdays as into the tomorrows. He belongs 
to the endless ages. 

MAN A CHILD OF GOD 

In the beginning, man was with God, a child of God, begotten by 
Him. He has a divine pedigree. In the pre-existent, spiritual domain, 
as a son or daughter of the divine Father, he increased in knowledge 
and power and grew in spiritual stature. At length he was prepared 
for the earth career and willing to accept its conditions. Man is not an 
accidental or transient invader of earth. Instead, he is a creature of 
plan and progress. 

As a child of God, man partakes of the divine nature of his Father. 
Within him lie germs of infinite development. Potentially he is a God- 
like being. Therefore he may rise eternally toward the likeness of his 
Father in heaven. Upward, divine, unending, is man's high destiny. 

The long climb of man from the dim beginning to the noble present, 
came from self-effort guided and directed by the Lord. His future 
ascent into glorious realms beyond human understanding will likewise 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



result from his own strivings and struggles. True, man "lives and 
moves and has his being" under the law of progression; but progress 
is ever an inward, not an outward process. His increasing progress is 
not imposed upon him; salvation is a cooperative enterprise between 
God and man. 

All men are the very children of God. They are brothers. Every 
man, however humble, of whatever race, has the same origin and possible 
destiny. The heavens and the earth were made and the plan of salvation 
was provided for each individual member of the human family. God is 
not a partial Father; each child is alike in his love. Since the plan of 
salvation is for all, it is fully consummated only when it has been accepted 
by all. Therefore it becomes a common concern to save every soul. 
Hence every man bears a direct responsibility for his brother. 

WERE MAN'S DIVINE ORIGIN AND DESTINY UNDERSTOOD 

Were this conception, which raises the individual man to immeasur- 
able importance, more fully comprehended, there would come great 
modification of man's treatment of man. The inhumanity of man to 
man would soon vanish from the earth. The law of the beast would be 
replaced by the law of God. Love would triumph over hate. The record 
of history declares that nations which have recognized in part the true 
nature of man, have prospered most and survived the longest. 

Little men who seek to take advantage one of another ; rulers who 
look upon their people as pawns in a game ; nations who wantonly toss 
thousands into battle to be maimed or killed — these would falter in their 
evil designs before a knowledge of the divine origin and destiny of every 
human being, of his God-like nature. Righteousness would increase 
in the earth. We prattle about the brotherhood of man, but true fra- 
ternity can be realized only upon the acceptance of all men as our very 
brothers, possessing equal rights with us. There should be a compre- 
hension of the innate greatness of every dweller on earth, of the possible 
attainment by the humblest man of an infinitely high goal. Such knowl- 
edge, wide-spread over the earth, would refine individual conduct, make 
men take thought before action, and would help bring about peace, the 
world's greatest need. 

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 

A sense of individual responsibility grows out of an understanding 
of man's relationship to other men and to God. The world is in serious 
need of a compelling sense of personal, individual, responsibility. As 
men are, so is the social group. A righteous nation is but the assemblage 
of righteous men. National prosperity is but the sum of personal pros- 
perity. When each man sets his own house in order, the whole world 
will be in order. There is much talk of governmental or other organized 
provision for our wants, material and spiritual, when in reality our great- 
est needs must be satisfied from within ourselves. To lean upon others 
for support enfeebles the soul. By self -effort man will attain his high

destiny. It cannot be placed as a cape upon his shoulders by others. 
Upon his own feet he must enter the kingdom of God, whether on earth 
or in heaven. By conquest of self he shall win his place in the everlasting 
glory of God's presence. 

"What is man that thou art mindful of him?" He is a very son 
of God, endowed with God-like power, who, if he respect his divine origin 
and high destiny, may bring to pass the long sought reign of righteousness 
on earth. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a sacred 
mission to perform in the world. One of the most important features 
of that mission is to provide new witnesses to this doubtful and skeptical 
generation that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the very Son of the living 
God, who died for men and is still interested in them and presides under 
his Father over the destinies of this world. We proclaim with John 
that by him, as the Father's representative, was the world made. In 
the character of Jehovah before he dwelt among men in the flesh, he 
was the Spokesman of his Father, Elohim, delivering the commandments, 
inspiring the prophets and ultimately coming to dwell among men in the 
flesh, thereafter to be called Jesus Christ. He gave himself as a ransom 
to save the world and mankind; first, from the consequences of the 
fall which brought mortality and death. He brings us to immortal and 
eternal life. And through our obedience to his Gospel he redeems us 
from the consequences of our own sins. 

But his interest in this world did not end when he had performed 
his great sacrifice. He is the Savior of all men, no matter where or when 
they have lived upon the earth. To his disciples at Jerusalem he said, 
"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold : them also I must 
bring, and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold, and one 
shepherd." (John 10:16) It is generally agreed now that when he spoke 
those words there was a mighty multitude of people living in this western 
world. He was their Savior and knew of their existence. 

A TESTIMONY 

Prominent among the witnesses this Church produces to support the 
testimony of the disciples at Jerusalem concerning Christ and his ministry 
is the testimony of a nation living upon this western hemisphere which 
was visited by him after his resurrection. Unto them he said, "Ye are 
the other sheep of whom I spake." Great destructions had occurred in 
this land at the crucifixion of Christ. The multitude who survived 
were standing about one of the temples marveling at the great changes 
which had taken place. The following account of this visit is recorded 
in the Book of Mormon, the bible of America, Third Nephi, 11th 
chapter :

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with 
another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven ; and they cast their 
eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard ; and 
it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice ; nevertheless, and not- 
withstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to 
the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not 
cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause 
their hearts to burn. 

And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they under- 
stood it not. 

And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their 
ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they 
did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came. 

And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they 
heard ; and it said unto them : 

Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I 
have glorified my name — hear ye him. 

And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again 
towards heaven ; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven ; 
and he was clothed in a white robe ; and he came down and stood in 
the midst of them ; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned 
upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and 
wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared 
unto them. 

And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto 
the people, saying: 

Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come 
into the world. 

And behold, I am the light and the life of the world ; and I have 
drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have 
glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which 
I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning. 

And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the 
whole multitude fell to the earth ; for they remembered that it had been 
prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after 
his ascension into heaven. 

And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying : 

Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands 
into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands 
and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the 
God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world. 

And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their 
hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and 
in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all 
gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and 
did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it 
was written by the prophets, that should come. 

And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, 
they did cry out with one accord, saying: 

Hosanna ! Blessed be the name of the Most High God ! And they 
did fall down at the feet of Jesus ,and did worship him. (3 Nephi 11 :3-17) 

SPENDS THREE DAYS 

Jesus Christ spent three glorious days with the peoples of America. 
He organized his Church and taught them the same doctrine he had 
delivered to his disciples in Jerusalem. As he left them he promised 
to come again. This historic visitation is supported by the traditions of 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



101 



all the Indians of America who have the same story, that their fathers 
were visited a long time ago by a fair God who taught his Gospel and 
blessed them, promising to return again. The conquest of Peru and 
Mexico by a handful of white men was possible because of this tradition 
of the promised return of the white God. 

And now another witness which this Church furnishes that Jesus 
Christ not only lives but that he is deeply interested in this generation 
as he was in them of old is the witness of Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery that on the third day of April, 1836, one hundred years ago, 
in the Kirtland Temple, built by divine command to provide a place 
for the Lord's appearance, the following event occurred: 

A VISITATION 

We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, 
before us ; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color 
like amber. 

His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white 
like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the 
sun ; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, 
even the voice of Jehovah, saying: 

I am the first and the last ; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain ; 
I am your advocate with the Father. (Doctrine and Covenants 110:2-4) 

PURPOSE OF VISIT 

He further announced that the purpose of his visit and the sending 
of prophets of ancient times, who held keys of authority, was to inaugu- 
rate the dispensation of the fulness of times spoken of by the prophets, 
wherein all keys and authority of all former dispensations were to be 
reintroduced among men in the building and establishment of Christ's 
kingdom triumphant in the earth to which he would come to rule and 
reign as King of kings and Lord of lords for a thousand years, as the 
prophets had foretold. Jesus announced in this dispensation, therefore, 
that the hour had come when a great and marvelous work was about to 
commence among men, wherein everything would be shaken that could 
be shaken and only the truth would stand, and that the prophecies of old 
were about to be fulfilled, when the Spirit of God would be poured out 
upon all flesh and old men should dream dreams and young men should 
see visions (Joel 2:28), and that as a result of it men would see wonders 
in the heavens and upon the earth. 

What has happened in this world since that visitation a hundred 
years ago is in part at least a realization of the promise, for greater 
human progress has been made in the development of science in the 
last hundred years than in all the preceding ages combined. Surely 
the Spirit of God has been poured out upon all flesh, and men have 
caught visions of the secrets of God and the materialization of these 
visions has produced wonders in the heavens and upon the earth. The 
Lord's hand is in all that is now going forward. The conflict between 
good and evil will be fierce but out of every struggle will come the victory 
of the right and of the truth. Every man-made institution that stands 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the way of God's purposes will be shaken and fall to the earth, and his 
kingdom shall come and his will be done upon earth as it is in heaven. 

GIVES TESTIMONY 

Let all believers in Christ doubt not, for he delayeth not his coming, 
neither has he gone afar and forgotten us. Let us all join in continuing 
the glorious warfare to win this world for Christ, its rightful Ruler. 

I bear witness that I know that he lives and that he is the Redeemer 
of the world. When that day shall come that I may stand in his presence 
and hear his voice, or like the doubting Thomas thrust my hand into 
his wounded side and hands, I shall not know any better then than I do 
today that he lives and that he has visited the earth in this age in the 
reintroduction of his glorious Gospel in its fulness and that it shall be 
triumphant in the earth. God speed the consummation of this happy 
event. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A selection, "Lo, My Shepherd is Divine," (Haydn), was sung by 
a mixed double quartet. 

A selection, "Blessed Be the Lord God" (Buck), was sung by a 
mixed double quartet, after which the Tabernacle Choir and the congre- 
gation joined in the singing of the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

(End of Church of the Air Broadcast) 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have with us seven brethren who have recently returned from 
presiding over missions in Europe and in the South Sea islands. On 
account of the two national broadcasts occupying so much time — a full 
hour — we have not been able to hear from them as yet. We are going to 
take an extra half hour this morning, and before the close of the meeting 
this afternoon we would like to hear from all these brethren as well as 
from the General Authorities who have not yet spoken. We will ask 
our brethren from foreign missions to occupy not more than ten 
minutes each. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

INTRODUCTION 

The Lord has said : "My soul delighteth in the song of the heart ; yea, 
the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered 
with a blessing upon their heads." 

Your unison in song in the national broadcast this morning deeply 
impressed me — yours were truly songs of the heart. I pray that they will 
be visited with blessings upon your heads, and that this choir in rendering 
such a wonderful service to the Church, to the State, and to the Nation 
may receive added blessings. I would that the same oneness, unity and 
harmony manifested in that congregational singing might characterize 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



103 



every righteous endeavor of the Church. God bless those who have this 
music in hand, and bless him also who arranged the continuity and carried 
it out so successfully. 

THE CHURCH SECURITY PLAN 

Throughout this Conference frequent reference has been made, and 
appropriately so, to the plan inaugurated by the General Authorities of 
the Church for the relief of those who are unemployed. It is at present 
one of our greatest, and one of the most important concerns of the 
Church. During the few minutes allotted to me I desire to call attention 
to the spiritual value of this important and far-reaching undertaking. 

In the 29th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are told that 
"all things unto the Lord are spiritual, and not at any time have I given 
unto you a law which was temporal ; neither any man, nor the children of 
men ; neither Adam, your father, whom I created. 

"Behold I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself ; 
and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave 
I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual ; they are not natural nor 
temporal, neither carnal nor sensual." 

The development of our spiritual nature should concern us most. 
Spirituality is the highest acquisition of the soul, the divine in man ; "the 
supreme, crowning gift that makes him king of all created things." It is 
the consciousness of victory over self and of communion with the infinite. 
It is spirituality alone which really gives one the best in life. 

It is something to supply clothing to the scantily clad, to furnish 
ample food to those whose table is thinly spread, to give activity to those 
who are fighting desperately the despair that comes from enforced idle- 
ness, but after all is said and done, the greatest blessings that will accrue 
from the Church Security Plan are spiritual. Outwardly, every act seems 
to be directed toward the physical : re-making of dresses and suits of 
clothes, canning fruits and vegetables, storing foodstuffs, choosing of fer- 
tile fields for settlement — all seem strictly temporal, but permeating all 
these acts, inspiring and sanctifying them, is the element of spirituality. 

SPIRITUALITY EVEN IN ADVERSITY 

There are those who have met disaster, which almost seems defeat, 
who have become somewhat soured in their natures, but if they stop to 
think, even the adversity which has come to them may prove a means of 
spiritual uplift. Adversity itself may lead toward and not away from God 
and spiritual enlightenment ; and privation may prove a source of strength 
if we can but keep the sweetness of mind and spirit. "Sweet are the uses 
of adversity," said Shakespeare, "which, like the toad, ugly and venom- 
ous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head." 

Job at one time possessed wealth in abundance. He numbered his 
sheep, camels, and oxen by the thousand. His sons and daughters were 
prosperous, and Job was happy and righteous in his prosperity. He was 
the greatest of all men in the East. Then came disaster. The Sabeans 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



stole his cattle and slew his servants ; fire consumed his sheep and the 
men who tended them ; Chaldeans drove away his camels ; his sons and 
daughters perished in a cyclone. Then he himself was smitten with a 
loathsome skin disease. In the depths of his affliction his wife came to 
him and said: "Dost thou still retain thy integrity? Curse God and die." 
Yet from the depths of financial ruin, physical suffering and harrowing 
accusations of his would-be friends, Job rose to the very heights of spir- 
itual exultation when he declared : 

I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter 
day upon the earth : 

And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh 
shall I see God. 

"To bear adversity with meek submission to the will of God, to 
appear cheerful amid surrounding gloom, hopeful amidst despondent cir- 
cumstances, happy in God, when there is nothing else to make one happy ; 
he who does this has indeed made great advance in the divine life." 

CONTEMPLATION OF PLAN GIVES SPIRITUAL UPLIFT 

There is spirituality even in the conception of the plan that is going 
to carry alleviation to the suffering and comfort to the down-trodden and 
poor. An intellectual glow, if not a spiritual blessing, comes even in the 
contemplation of such things. No one can consider, however superficially, 
its motives and objectives without comparing in his mind the strife and 
selfishness as exemplified in the law of nature, which is a law of the sur- 
vival of the fittest, with the spiritual law expressed by Jesus when he 
said : "He that will lose his life for my sake shall find it." And associated 
with that thought this : "Inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these my 
brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

You see on every hand the struggle that goes on in nature. Birds are 
killing birds, animals are killing animals ; men, too, in the highest scale of 
existence are struggling and taking advantage of one another. "Envyings, 
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like" manifestations of the 
"works of the flesh" are rampant ; "and they which do such things shall 
not inherit the kingdom of God ;" they are not in accordance with the law 
of the Lord, nor in accordance with the law of happiness. 

Thank heaven, we can see also indications of tendencies to deny one- 
self for the good of others. Evidences are increasing daily of the fact 
that man is striving for higher things than the mere selfish and the sordid. 
"The race of mankind would perish," says Sir Walter Scott, "if they 
ceased to aid one another. We cannot exist without mutual help. All, 
therefore, that need aid should receive it from their fellowmen, and no 
one who has the power of granting can refuse it without guilt." 

SPIRITUALITY EXPRESSED IN GIVING 

There is more spirituality expressed in giving than in receiving. The 
greatest spiritual blessing comes from helping another. If you want to be 
miserable, just harbor hate for a brother, and if you want to hate, just 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



105 



do your brother some injury. But if you would be happy, render a kind 
service, make somebody else happy. The poet was right when he ex- 
pressed the truth in these lines : 

If you sit down at set of sun 

And count the acts that you have done, 

And, counting, find 

One self-denying deed, one word 

That eased the heart of him who heard — 

One glance most kind, 

That fell like sunshine where it went — 

Then you may count that day well spent. 

But if, thru all the livelong day, 
You've cheered no heart, by yea or nay, 
If through it all, 

You've nothing done that you can trace 
That brought the sunshine to one face — ■ 
No act most small 

That helped some soul and nothing cost — 
Then count that day as worse than lost. 

There is another thought, however, which I think reflects this spiritu- 
ality, and that is the realization, the consciousness that we are approach- 
ing, in desire at least, the two great commandments : "Love the Lord thy 
God with all thy might, mind and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself." 
All who have participated in the achievements reported October 1 by the 
stake presidencies have experienced this feeling. Tens of thousands of 
people who have cooperatively worked to make this plan a success have 
been motivated by a desire to have the Church a living activity for good. 
Christ's Church is his vineyard in which he invites everybody to work. 
The almost universal response seems to indicate that the Latter-day 
Saints throughout the land realize that a lazy church "tends towards un- 
belief ; and that an earnest, busy church, in hand-to-hand conflict with 
sin and misery, grows stronger in faith." 

Associated with this thought is the realization that we are doing 
something to make the world better. The well-known statistician, Mr. 
Babson, says : 

People should understand that before prosperity can return there must 
be a renewed interest in the spiritual life by both individuals and nations. 
Nations should realize that the world has always possessed raw materials 
and labor, but has been prosperous only when the people have been actuated 
by a religious faith to use these resources for advancement in service. This 
is the law of life, and now is the time when it should be taught in churches, 
schools and colleges. 

The Church is a means of rendering in order and wisdom mutual 
service. Jesus Christ is its author and the divine head. He himself, while 
in mortality, was the personification and exemplification of brotherhood 
and spirituality, and it is he who says to you and to all the world, "Learn 
of me and listen to my words ; walk in the meekness of my spirit and ye 
shall have peace in me." 

God help us to obtain that peace by mutual helpfulness I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The congregation and the Tabernacle Choir sang the hymn, "Come, 
Let Us Anew." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Listen to this glorious truth — It is found in the Book of Mormon : 

For it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become 
subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might 
become subject unto him. (2 Nephi 9:5). 

SERVICE THE PRICE OF CONTENTMENT 

Consecrated service is the road to the hearts of men. The mother 
becomes subject to her family, so to speak, by sacred service and sacri- 
fice, and therefore her high position as queen of the home is eternally 
assured. 

The sublime truth which I have quoted from the Book of Mormon 
foreshadows the condescension of God Almighty. Because of the Fall 
men were cut off from the presence of the Lord. Only an infinite atone- 
ment could save mankind from spiritual death and bring about the power 
of the resurrection to fallen men and make them incorruptible, immortal, 
living souls. 

To secure this priceless boon the Creator suffered "the pains of 
every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the 
family of Adam." Mankind was delivered by the power of the Holy One 
of Israel by his atonement. We belong to him : we are not our own. He 
bought us with the price of his precious blood. 

The Savior said : "My Father worketh hitherto and I work." I be- 
lieve that work is the weapon of honor. One of the evils that is oppressing 
this nation is the failure of a large number of men to work : many people 
unfortunately cannot find employment. Every able-bodied man should 
have "a mind to work." 

The locomotive that runs light is more likely to jump the track than 
the one that is pulling a load. If more of the young men and women in 
our country were married there would be fewer social and industrial dis- 
turbances. Long engagements, as a rule, are not good. There are too 
many men running light in this old world. More personal responsibility 
is needed. Henry Ward Beecher said that the darkest hour in a young 
man's life was when he sat down and planned and devised how to make a 
living without work. Without mental or physical labor an honest living 
cannot be made. 

When Erskine, the great British advocate was addressing a jury — 
the first time, by the way, that he had made an address in a court of law — 
he said that he must succeed for he felt that his wife and children were 
tugging at his coat tails. 

Jesus said : "And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



107 



your servant ; even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but 
to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." To give his life for 
a ransom for many — that was the grandest service ever beheld in the 
universe of God. 

We read in the New Testament the profound truth that God per- 
mitted His Only Begotten Son, the Being who created the world, to work 
in a carpenter shop at the carpenter's bench. I think as I read the Savior's 
words "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me * * * for my yoke is 
easy, and my burden is light," that he, the divine Son of God, made 
yokes in that workshop for beasts of burden. The yokes were so well 
made that they made no sore places. The man who wears the yoke of 
Christ has no sore spots on him, for in the wearing of that yoke there is 
perfect liberty and joy. He that would be great let him be the servant of 
his fellow creatures and minister to their needs. 

AN ILLUSTRATION OF UNSELFISHNESS 

Once upon a time, as the story goes, two men owned a field jointly, 
and side by side they planted, they watered, and they shared the crops 
share and share alike. One of these men had seven sons. Zimri lived by 
himself. One night when the crops were harvested, Zimri said, "I am 
alone, and my brother has seven sons ; it is not pleasing in the sight of 
God that I should have as much as he." So he stole forth from the field 
and took one-third of his sheaves and placed them with Abram's sheaves. 
Abram awoke and he thought of Zimri, and said he : "Here am I, sur- 
rounded by my sons, and Zimri is alone. At the end of the day's labor he 
goes to a cold, lonely home. I am going to give him one-third of my 
sheaves." He did so. The next morning both were astonished to find 
when they arose that they had not lost anything by giving to each other. _ 

The next night Zimri went into the field and took a third of his 
sheaves to Abram's pile and placed them there and then he hid. He saw 
Abram coming out. And now the words of the poet : 

Then Abram came down softly from his home 
And looking to the left and right, went on, 
Took from his ample store a generous third, 
And laid it on his brother Zimri's pile. 
Then Zimri rose, and caught him in his arms, 
And wept upon his neck, and kissed his cheek; 
And Abram saw the whole, and could not speak ; 
Neither could Zimri, for their hearts were full. 

"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord," for "when 
ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of 
your God." May this heavenly duty shine in our hearts with a broad and 
glowing light, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

With the blessing of the Lord and your help I trust that I may give 
voice to a thought or two that may be helpful to us. 

On Friday when we heard the report of the Social Security Plan 
read I thought of the question asked by the Pharisees of the Christ. You 
will remember, a lawyer asked the Christ which was the greatest com- 
mandment. And the Savior replied : 

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind. 

This is the first and great commandment. 

And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 

You will notice that the two commandments which I have quoted 
commence with the affirmative, "Thou shalt." There are people who feel 
that the Lord is behind the times educationally when he uses the negative 
form "Thou shalt not" in some of the commandments, so to bring the 
Ten Commandments up to date they want to reword them, or at least 
feel obliged to apologize when they quote the ones that are stated in the 
negative. 

I can understand why some people outside the Church desire to 
change and make constant explanations about the negative form of some 
of the Ten Commandments but it is hard to understand why any of us 
belonging to the Church should want to modify or think it necessary to 
reword the Ten Commandments so that the phrase "Thou shalt not" will 
be eliminated. I hope that we shall have the good sense, the propriety, 
and the faith to retain the thought and the wording as it came from God. 

My thought in connection with the two great commandments is their 
practical application to the Social Security Plan. At the present time 
there is a great emergency in the Nation and in the Church, and it has 
existed for some time. Although we may have thought about it and done 
some good things, seemingly we were not able to get together and agree 
on a common plan. But as soon as the people of the Church under its 
splendid leadership unite and agree to handle this emergency the success 
of the undertaking is assured. We immediately unite together and get the 
feeling or power and ability to do great things in the Church not only 
as individuals but as members of wards or stakes. And so, we have at 
the present time a splendid demonstration of all of the Church being 
united in common thought with common desires, trying to follow the ad- 
monition of the Lord wherein he said : "If ye love me, keep my com- 
mandments." And the two great commandments are the love of God 
and the love of neighbor. 

Our tithes and our fast offerings have increased, because our faith 
and our love of God have increased. Our ability to do the righteous, con- 
sistent thing in the Church is dependent upon the love of God that we 
have in our hearts. We can do other things in the Church in the same 



ELDER ARTHUR GAETH 



109 



way if we will unite ourselves together just as closely and just as splen- 
didly, realizing that it is the' work of the Lord. 

The Social Security Plan is not the only thing in the Church that we 
all need to get behind and support. I remember that when we had Pro- 
hibition we used, to hear young and old people say that the reason they 
drank and the reason they smoked was the prohibition part of it — that 
part, like the Ten Commandments, which said you could not do a thing — 
and the argument was that if we would eliminate this commandment and 
this process of compulsion, the young and the older people would very 
willingly walk forward in righteousness so far as the Word of Wisdom 
was concerned. We are where we are today in that commandment be- 
cause we lack unity of purpose and desire. We know that it is not the 
way a commandment is worded or even a knowledge that the thing is 
right which keeps us from smoking or drinking, or breaking any other 
commandment. The thing that keeps us straight, the thing that helps us 
to be obedient unto the law of God, is our love for God demonstrated in 
our lives. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to appreciate his commandments 
and to unite together spiritually and temporally in the keeping of all his 
commandments as we are now united in this great social program, that 
we may grow spiritually and progress in God's church, I pray in Jesus' 
name, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR GAETH 

Former President of the Czechoslovak Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I appreciate the opportunity of being again 
assembled in conference with you after a long absence. 

I wish to bear testimony to you this morning in behalf of our 
eighteen missionaries laboring in Czechoslovakia among the fifteen mil- 
lion people of that country. Eighteen among fifteen million is rather 
a small number, but we feel that our efforts have been blessed and that 
we have made an impression upon the people of that nation. The Lord 
has opened up the way so that we have, on different occasions, been able 
to bear a message to multitudes, not only to small gatherings of people. 
The Lord has led us so that we have been able to touch the hearts of the 
officials of the country, and have been able to obtain the right to preach 
and teach the Gospel in a time when much of Europe is being regulated 
and regimented, and when it is difficult for the voice of God to find its 
way into the hearts of the people. We have been preaching the Gospel 
under disturbed conditions. The people are beginning to lose faith 
in religion, because religion has not been able to light the way, has not 
been able to appease the hearts of men and to make them see the truth 
and live according to the principles for which Christ laid down his life. 
Because people have lost faith and confidence in each other, they have 
lost faith in the government by the people, so many of the nations today 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are in the hands of a few who are not being directed by the Spirit of the 
Lord, but who are striving to gain in their selfish way more of that which 
belongs to their neighbors. But in spite of those difficulties we have 
found a few who have listened to our message, and who have accepted 
the Gospel. Europe needs the Gospel of Jesus Christ today as she 
never did before, and we need to send our young men and young women, 
and our old men among those people to preach the Gospel to them. 

I feel that in our mission we have needed older men, men of ex- 
perience with burning testimonies of the Gospel, to move the hearts 
of those people, and I hope that as our economic program takes some 
of our older men and women from daily occupation that they will find 
the time and the courage to undertake a mission in a foreign country. 
I am of the opinion that any man who had the ability to learn a foreign 
language when he was 22 years of age still possesses that ability at 65 
or 70. We have had experiments in our work with English Clubs, 
and have discovered that old men and women, after they had been 
pensioned, have been able to acquire French, English, Spanish and other 
languages if they had the desire. 

I bear you my testimony that we are not of the world ; we are for 
the world, but as Christ said: "Ye are not of the world." And, therefore, 
it becomes necessary for us to be a light unto the world. I am thankful 
that the Lord has inspired our leaders in this Security Program, so 
that the people of this Church may be drawn closer together, that they 
may solve their own problems not according to the ways of the world, 
but according to the ways of the Lord and according to the inspiration 
which he vests in those who have been called to guide and direct this 
great work here upon the earth. And so I bear you my testimony 
that the Lord has spoken, and Joseph Smith was selected as an instru- 
ment to restore the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these the latter days. I am 
thankful for the privilege I have of mingling my voice with those who 
have borne testimony here, for I know that the Lord lives, and that he 
is in a position to answer our prayers if we will but bend our knees 
occasionally and ask for guidance and help. May the Lord bless us 
in our efforts, may he add to the number of those who are now engaged 
in missionary work among the peoples of this earth, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I never see an audience such as we have here today — all the seats 
taken, the aisles crowded, and people standing in the gallery — that my 
heart is not filled with gratitude for the wisdom and inspiration of 
Brigham Young in furnishing us with this magnificent auditorium. 

The Choir sang the "Hallelujah Chorus" (Handel). 
Elder George A. Bean, President of the Union Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock.

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened in the Taber- 
nacle at 2 o'clock p. m., Sunday, October 4. Again the great Tabernacle 
auditorium and galleries were crowded with people, and again thousands 
of people gathered in the Assembly Hall and on the Tabernacle Square, 
where they listened to the Conference proceedings as they were broad- 
cast from the Tabernacle by radio. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session, and sang 
as an opening number "How Beautiful Are The Feet of Him Who 
Bringeth Glad Tidings" (Handel's Messiah). 

Elder Horace A. Hess, President of the Yellowstone Stake offered 
the invocation. 

The Choir sang "The Music of Life" (Noble Cain). 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brothers and sisters : The Church as a whole, and we who are 
assembled particularly, rejoice that today we have among us again Brother 
Alonzo A. Hinckley. We thank the Lord for preserving his life, and 
he has our constant and daily prayers that the Lord will soon restore 
him completely to health and strength. 

FAITHFULNESS OF CHOIR COMMENDED 

Again, I would like to pay my homage to the Tabernacle Choir 
mission. I am sure that from one conference to another we can see 
a decided improvement. Brother David A. Smith informs me that 
this organization has an average attendance, counting its Thursday night 
rehearsals, its Sunday morning broadcast, and Sunday afternoon service, 
of better than 82 per cent. That is a record which is probably not 
excelled by any other organization in the Church. 

I want also to extend my congratulations and appreciation to the 
Singing Mothers (they delighted us, as always) and also to the Taber- 
nacle Choir Male Chorus. I told Brother Cornwall the other day that 
we should expect to hear from this chorus more frequently in the future. 
And, lastly, we are grateful for those who have sung for us here in 
solos. Sometimes I feel that we get nearer to the Lord through music 
than perhaps through any other thing except prayer. 

I am grateful to the Lord, more than I can tell, for the cultural life 
which is among this people. Those who are not familiar with us and 
our achievements sometimes speak as if we had no culture, but I am 
sure there is no group of an equal size in the whole world that has a 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



higher cultural rating than has this people, in music, in art, in literature, 
in science. 

PURPOSE OF THE SECURITY PLAN 

We have heard much during this conference regarding the Security 
Plan which the Church is putting into operation. That plan has behind 
it two essential things, first, that we shall see that nobody shall starve 
or really need for the things necessary for life; and, secondly, and just 
as importantly, that every one who can work shall have some work given 
to him or to her to do. I wish it were within my power, as I know it is 
not, to express what is in my heart regarding this great plan, and to 
say how I feel about the dignity and the honor of work. 

WORK THE LAW OF THIS EARTH 

I endorse everything that was said this morning by Brother Callis. 
Work is a great thing. It is the law of this earth. When Adam was 
cast out, upon him was passed the glorious sentence, "In the sweat of thy 
face shalt thou eat bread." Man as he is would not and could not have 
existed except for the promulgation of this law. Work is a wonderful 
thing, no matter what that work may be. 

The great Milton, in that wonderful poem, "Paradise Lost," pays 
this tribute to work, which he expresses, after he opens to us the vision 
of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden: 

God hath set labor and rest, as day and night, 
To men successive . . . 
Other creatures all day long 
Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest ; 
Man hath his daily work of body and mind 
Appointed, which declares his dignity, 
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ; 
While other animals unactive range 
And of their doings God takes no account. 

My brothers and sisters, if we can just get into our minds the dignity 
and the honor of work, no matter what that work may be, most of the 
ills from which we suffer will be solved. During the whole range of man's 
existence there has never yet been any plan by which men may live 
righteously in idleness, and no such plan, it is my faith, will ever be 
devised. 

RELIEF SOCIETY AND PRIESTHOOD PRAISED 

I want to thank the sisters of the Relief Society for the wonderful 
work which they have done in this Security Plan. We hear that many 
of them have worked and worked until they are worn out. This of course 
must not be. But how glorious is a tired body when in it there beats 
a heart filled with the light of righteousness. The exaltation and the 
exultation of having done one's duty ! 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK 



113 



How infinitely better to have a tired body from work and service 
for our fellow men than to have a nerve-torn body coming from the 
bridge gambling table, cocktails, and whiskey and sodas, with the moral 
decay which goes with them. 

I want to thank the Priesthood who have been untiring in their 
efforts. Brothers and sisters, I marvel, sincerely and truly marvel, at 
the work which this people can do when it sets its hands to do it; and 
I repeat what I said last night, that there is nothing that can stop this 
people in any movement which it sets up for the advancement of humanity 
if all will work together. No power on the earth or under the earth 
can defeat our purpose along these lines. And so I thank all the brethren 
from the bottom of my heart for all that they have done — including the 
general committee that is getting this Security Plan started. There is 
still work to do, brethren and sisters, if we are to carry on. 

TRUE HEROES 

As I observed last night, the distribution of this fund is going to 
be more difficult, in one sense, than its accumulation. The Bishops will 
have to supervise the distribution and it must be done in the spirit of love, 
in the spirit of fatherhood, without fear, without favor, without partiality. 
In no other way shall we succeed. 

Then I want to thank, and devoutly thank, that great group of 
Latter-day Saints who under this terrible depression, deprived of their 
jobs and livelihood, have lived on, struggling, using up the accumulation 
of the years that they might keep off the "dole," holding fast to the 
truths of the Gospel, cheerful, courageous, even to their last cent. They 
are true heroes, my brethren and sisters, and we whom the Lord has not 
so disciplined have been deprived of the blessings which that discipline 
has brought to them. To live on as they have lived, courageously, 
straightforward, honest, requires far more will and far more character 
than for us to live who have been blessed with a little more. Never forget 
them, my brothers and sisters. I repeat, they are the heroes of this 
terrible time. 

■GOSPEL AN INDIVIDUAL PLAN 

We have proclaimed to the world, and we have proclaimed what 
we knew, that we have the Gospel plan, and that the Gospel plan not 
only takes care of our spiritual needs, but our temporal needs as well. 
Under this plan there comes to us a double responsibility, for the plan 
provides how we shall guide and direct our work individually. It is an 
individual plan; it provides how I shall live and you shall live day by 
day, day in and day out, week in and week out, and throughout a long 
lifetime. For the individual, it leaves nothing to be desired ; it leaves 
nothing still necessary. But this plan does more than that, it teaches us 
how to live in a group under an organization and principles which enable 
us to live together as brothers and sisters, equal in all things insofar as 
we live for that equality. 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That places upon us a responsibility because this plan which has 
been given to us is a plan by which Christian rule can come and will come 
to the nations of the earth. We are in charge of that plan. No other 
people have had it given to them. We alone in all the world are possessed 
of this wonderful thing, this Christian plan, this Christian rule and the 
responsibility not to be escaped, is upon us, to make this rule known, 
to propagate it among the nations of the earth, in order that they may also 
know how to live as a truly Christian unit. We may talk and talk about 
Christian rule in the world but that rule will not come by talk. But we 
can bring Christian rule immeasurably forward if we shall ourselves 
adopt it. This Security Plan, which goes back to the principles which 
were given to the Church over a hundred years ago, puts us once more 
on the road leading to the establishment of a Christian rule. 

My brethren and sisters, such is our responsibility ; and our destiny 
is that if we shall live ourselves the Christian rule the Lord intends to 
use us by reason of our experience and our discipline, to extend this 
Christian rule throughout the world. We shall do it, by love, by mercy, 
by charity, by righteousness, by living the Gospel. 

LIGHT GROWS WITH RIGHTEOUS LIVING 

Every human being is born with the light of faith kindled in his 
heart as on an altar, and that light burns and the Lord sees that it burns, 
during the period before we are accountable. When accountability comes 
then each of us determines how we shall feed and care for that light. 
If we shall live righteously that light will glow until it suffuses the 
whole body, giving to it health and strength and spiritual light as well 
as bodily health. If we shall live unrighteously that light will dwindle 
and finally almost flicker out. Yet it is my hope and my belief that the 
Lord never permits the light of faith wholly to be extinguished in any 
human heart, however faint the light may glow. The Lord has provided 
that there shall still be there a spark which, with teaching, with the 
spirit of righteousness, with love, with tenderness, with example, with 
living the Gospel, shall brighten and glow again, however darkened the 
mind may have been. And if we shall fail so to reach those among us 
of our own whose faith has dwindled low, we shall fail in one of the 
main things which the Lord expects at our hands. 

My brethren and sisters, may the Lord bless us. May he give 
us faith, and hope, and charity; may he give us the vision to see the 
wisdom of the immediate task in which we are engaged. 

WIDESPREAD INTEREST 

I repeat what I have said several times since this conference began : 
The eyes of the world are upon us, newspapers from all over the United 
States are sending to us for information about this Plan of ours, and 
they want the details, how it is working, and why it is working. We are 
the city set upon a hill. If we should fail in this, and the Lord will 
not let us fail, great would be our condemnation. We should have 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



115 



lost the opportunity that has again come to the Church now after its 
early coming at the beginning of our Church life. 

I say, may the Lord bless us, bring us the vision of what we have 
undertaken and what we should do, give us the faith and the courage to 
carry on, as we know we should carry on ; give us unity, take from 
our minds and our hearts all bickerings and jealousies, and build us up 
into one great united people, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brothers and sisters, I have been thrilled with the spirit of this 
conference. I was thrilled in the first session of the conference and with 
the sessions that have followed. I was greatly thrilled with the broad- 
cast this morning, with the singing of the choir which has never in my 
judgment been better. I was deeply impressed and thrilled with the 
singing of the "Singing Mothers." I was thrilled when I looked upon 
these flowers, these beautiful flowers — a bouquet of Dahlias — because 
they are the expression of God's creative power, and I am deeply thrilled 
beyond expression standing here looking into the faces of this great 
congregation. 

There is a power here, my brethren and sisters, and an influence 
that is overwhelming. 

I was deeply thrilled with the Priesthood meeting last evening in 
this building. Think of it ! — this great Tabernacle filled to overflowing 
with men of the priesthood, men representing divine authority. What 
power can stand against the influence of such a representation as we 
had here last night. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS A BLESSED PEOPLE 

I would like to say a few words this afternoon on a great and 
important subject that is intimately related to a situation in the spirit 
world affecting the future welfare of a multitude of spirits who once 
dwelt in the flesh upon the earth. 

The great majority of them lived and died without hearing or re- 
ceiving the Gospel message. The reason is obvious. The true Gospel 
of Jesus Christ in its fulness and power was not to be found in their 
day upon the earth. 

The Latter-day Saints are a blessed people. Fortunately for them 
they were permitted to come forth in the flesh in a Gospel dispensation, 
which Gospel is described by Paul, the apostle, as "the power of God 
unto salvation to every one that believeth." 

They have the priesthood among them as I have already said, which is 
divine authority in men. They have a temple (in fact, they have a number 
of temples) of the Lord, the sanctuary of great and mighty blessings 
conferred upon the faithful without money and without price. 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



CLOTHED UPON WITH DIVINE AUTHORITY 

They have a living prophet in their midst, a man who is clothed 
upon with divine authority, a man who holds the keys of the kingdom 
of heaven upon earth. And where in the world will we go to find a 
man of this kind ? How did that authority come to this man ? It came 
to him very much as it came to Peter. On one certain occasion Jesus 
said to Peter: "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in 
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in 
heaven." 

What great and almighty authority was this? But it constituted 
Peter a living prophet of God in his day, clothed upon as he was with 
divine authority. 

Very much the same language was used by the Lord in conferring 
upon Joseph Smith, the prophet, like authority. You will find the 
words recorded in Section 132, most impressive words, most wonderful 
words ! The Lord said to Joseph Smith, the prophet : 

For I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, 
wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in 
due time. 

And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth 
shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name 
and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens ; 
and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in 
the heavens. 

It is such a blessing, my brethren and sisters, that constitutes a 
man a prophet of God. Surely it must be so. And the blessings of the 
holy temple of God were restored to the earth. These blessings are dis- 
pensed to those who are faithful but cannot be purchased by money. Gold 
and silver instantly lose their value when compared with these mighty 
blessings. 

ORDINANCES OF LIFE AND SALVATION 

Strangers come and look upon the temple here and marvel at its 
appearance of strength and beauty. They are eager to go into the 
temple, to walk through it, to see what is there. If they were permitted 
to go through it, they would simply see that which constitutes the furniture 
and furnishings of the temple. It is not the building or furnishings that 
give it value but it is the ordinances of life and salvation that are per- 
formed therein. 

Now, brethren and sisters, in the providences of the Lord the 
splendid blessings of the temple have been given to us while that great 
group of spirits beyond the veil heretofore mentioned through untoward 
circumstances are deprived of them. Thus you see their situation is very 
different from ours. They lived and died at a period when the true Gospel 
in its fulness and power was not upon the earth and they therefore could 
not receive it or secure the blessings thereof. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



117 



OUR OBLIGATION TO THE DEAD 

Are we not under obligation to do what we can for them since the 
blessings of salvation both for the living and the dead can only be had 
through the temple ordinances aclminsitered on the earth? 

Surely some plan was needed whereby these blessings could be 
given to the dead. Happily, a plan was instituted by our Heavenly 
Father to meet the situation. 

The Savior emphasized the vital importance of baptism in the plan 
of salvation when he said to Nicodemus, (John 3:5) "Except a man be 
born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of 
God." 

When Jesus said "a man," he meant every man (and every woman 
of course) whether they be living or dead. 

THE COMING OF ELIJAH 

Further light is thrown upon this important subject in the last 
chapter of the Book of Malachi, as follows: 

Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord: 

And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the 
heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth 
with a curse. (Malachi 4:5, 6) 

Joseph Smith, the prophet, and Oliver Cowdery testify that Elijah, 
the prophet, appeared in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836, in direct 
fulfilment of Malachi's prediction, stood before them, and said : 

► Behold the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth 
of Malachi — testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent, before the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord come — 

To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children 
to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse — 

Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands ; 
and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is 
near, even at the doors. (D. and C. 110:14, 15, 16) 

Since that day the hearts of the fathers in the spirit world have 
been turned to us their earthly children ; surely our hearts have been 
turned to them. 

THE GATHERING OF GENEALOGY 

The spirit of gathering genealogy is abroad among the nations. 
Many people are influenced by it. They know not why, but we under- 
stand it perfectly. 

If we would do the work of our fathers who have gone hence, 
we must have their genealogy that a proper record can be made of it and 
laid up in the archives of the Temple. Bear in mind, brethren and sisters 
and friends, that we are told in holy writ that "for this cause was the 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged 
according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." 
(I Peter, 4:6) 

It should also be remembered that when Christ was crucified, his 
body was laid in the tomb but his pure spirit went into the spirit world. 
He was not idle there. The record tells us that he preached the Gospel 
to the spirits in prison. Many of those spirits were doubtless ancestors 
of people now living. 

ORDINANCES PERFORMED IN TEMPLES 

If it is possible for us to bring salvation to them by proxy through 
the temple ordinances, and it is, ought we not to be up and doing? Well, 
the Latter-day Saints are working at the problem and something definite 
has been accomplished. 

There are nine temples in the Church, the Kirtland temple, the 
Nauvoo temple, St. George, Manti, Logan, Salt Lake, the Hawaiian, the 
Alberta and the Arizona temples. You will be interested to know what 
has been done in these temples covering the period from Nauvoo days 
until the present time, or until the end of 1935. The statement follows: 





Living 


Dead 


Baptisms 


37,062 


9,740,433 


Endowments 


275,362 


7,104,659

or a total of ordinances for the living of 585,764 and for the dead 
23,349,280, and a grand total of 23,935,044 ordinations and ordinances 
for the living and the dead in these temples. 

SPIRITS DEPENDING UPON US 

That appears to be a pretty good start. When, however, you think 
of the great multitude of spirits that depend on their earthly children for 
help, it is evident that we have hardly touched the problem. 

Let me plead with the Latter-day Saints not to forget their temple 
work. Your ancestors are waiting upon you and have been waiting 
hundreds of years, anxiously, no doubt, for this work to be done for 
them. It devolves upon you. What you have received it is up to you 
to give to others. 

God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



The congregation and Choir sang the hymn, "We Thank Thee, O 
God, for a Prophet." 



ELDER DANIEL J. LANG 



119 



ELDER DANIEL J. LANG 

Former President of the French Mission 

It was over three years ago that, in company with my wife, I left 
home to fill my third mission among the French-speaking people. This 
missionary part of my life, aggregating over seven years, has been a 
rich experience. I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for the privilege 
of having performed this service, — for the protection that he has given 
us in our extensive travels, and for his inspiration that we have felt 
in our ministry. 

It has been a joy to see the fruits of our labors, as made manifest 
by the increased number of baptisms performed. As fast as branches 
grew sufficiently in membership and in understanding, the local brethren 
have been given the priesthood and organized on a self-government 
basis. The auxiliaries are functioning in the French Mission. We now 
have all the auxiliary organizations represented, thanks, largely, to the 
efficient and devoted efforts of our lady missionaries who came into 
that mission recently. The recreational entertainments given under the 
auspices of the Sunday School, the M. L A., the Relief Society, Primary, 
etc., compare very favorably with the entertainments here at home — 
of course with our numbers very much smaller. 

It is interesting to see Zion being built and established in Europe, 
and to see the Latter-day Saint ideals permeating the homes of the 
faithful members of the Church. We feel the wholesome influence in 
these homes, just as fine and sweet as the influences we find existing 
in well regulated homes here. The Lord is blessing these people by 
inculcating into their hearts firm testimonies of the truthfulness of the 
Gospel. They are thereby given the strength to overcome many ob- 
stacles that beset the pathways of life in which worldly influences are 
very strong and sometimes tend to almost overwhelm them. 

We are building churches in Europe, and these are fine edifices. 
They are outstanding landmarks that make for stability among the na- 
tions in which we labor. It is gratifying to note the change of sentiment 
in favor of the Church. In traveling, especially on the steamers, we 
have many occasions to engage in conversation. We find people very 
much more interested in our work. In consequence of this, it was our 
joy in recent years to find that we have placed literature into the hands 
of many people who have studied and appreciated it. People coming 
from Algiers, from Morocco, Egypt, Palestine, India, Siam, China and 
Japan have accepted eagerly our literature. The newspapers are publish- 
ing items that are very much more favorable to the Mormon people 
than formerly. When they publish things that are untrue, we usually 
are able to get favorable responses in these newspapers. 

We are courteously received by the officials, and as a consequence 
we are introduced into some of the very best circles. Our greatest 
obstacle, of course, is the indifference among the people. I feel, however, 
that this indifference as to religious matters is not greater in France 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

than it is in any other country. The French people may be considered 
a religious people. They are a thrifty people and they are very moderate 
in their habits. We have learned to appreciate this condition very much. 
I don't think that the French people are very much different from others ; 
and, everything considered, I think the results will be just as great among 
them if we are able to put the effort in the missionary work there. 

I desire to say that those in charge of the Mission Home here and 
especially those in charge of our seminaries are very much to be con- 
gratulated for the fine work they are doing. The morale of our French 
missionaries is splendid, and especially is this true of the Elders coming 
into the field recently. I attribute this condition very much to the fine 
work that is being done in these institutions. 

I would urge also that our young men be taught the functions of 
our auxiliary organizations and especially the Relief Society for these 
are very valuable helps in proselyting in the world. We are pleased 
to report the excellent morale among our people and especially among 
our Elders. I believe that the spiritual development of our Elders in 
the French Mission is just as great as in any other mission because the 
opportunities are good. Our young men get to love the people, love the 
country and reluctantly leave the mission field. I wish to emphasize 
this. I find, also, that in the mission field we view with better retrospect 
the great work that is being done here. Certainly nowhere do ministers 
of the Gospel speak with greater strength, fervor, knowledge, and au- 
thority, and convey greater conviction to the human heart than the in- 
struction that is given here by our brethren in this sanctuary and its 
dependences. Nowhere else do men proclaim with such certainty and 
with such a firm conviction that God is our Father, that Jesus is the 
Christ. They affirm that by keeping God's commandments, as he has 
revealed them in the latter days to the Prophet Joseph Smith, it will 
produce the happiness and heart righteousness so much needed to heal 
the wounds of this woe-stricken world today. 

This message of salvation is broadcast by word of mouth and sung 
into the souls of the human beings encircling the whole globe. It is 
like a pebble being thrown into a pool of clear water. The waves go 
afar, and we in the mission field feel those waves. The brethren here 
are giving instructions that are valuable and they are permeating the 
whole world, and we feel the force of this in the mission field. I hope 
that we fully appreciate the blessings that we enjoy. I am thankful to 
be home and to associate with my brethren. I am thankful for the 
opportunity that has come to me. 

The other day a man who is more or less faithful said, "I don't 
know whether it is worth while for you men to go out and proclaim the 
Gospel." He was not living as he should live, and if he is under the 
sound of my voice I wish to tell him this : That no material advantage 
can compare with righteous impulse and the joy that is given us in 
going out into the world to do missionary work. I believe that we are 
building better than we know, that this great truth is permeating the 
world, and the time is not far distant when there shall be a spontaneous

seeking for the principles of righteousness as taught by the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ revealed in these latter days. I believe that is the only 
way that peace and joy can come to this world. 

May we appreciate our blessings. May we go forward with fervor. 
May we endeavor to do right in the material things of life. I rejoice in 
the practical way in which we apply the Gospel. The world is beginning 
to sit up and take notice. I hope that everyone will do his duty fully 
and that God will give us strength to carry on, and I ask this in the 
name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER CASTLE H. MURPHY 

Former President of the Hawaiian Mission 

Since my childhood it has afforded me great joy to attend the general 
conferences of this Church, and because of the thrills which have come 
it has been my pleasure, on various occasions, to invite my children and 
other people's children to attend the conferences with me. This after- 
noon it was my pleasure to bring two small girls into the balcony that 
they might see the General Authorities of this Church, know something 
of their background, and appreciate the more their testimonies which 
they give to us on these great occasions. 

For six years I have been absent from these conferences, and I, 
therefore, am thrilled today in the privilege which is mine to attend and 
sit in conference with you, my brothers and sisters, and be lifted up and 
built up in my faith because of the testimonies which are borne by the 
leaders of this great Church. 

It is my desire to report for a moment the physical, spiritual, and 
moral progress in the great mission which I had the pleasure of serving in, 
even that of Hawaii. I was called six years ago, with my wife, to go to 
Hawaii to preside over that mission, and to preside, also, in the Temple. 

The thrills which have come have caused me to rejoice more than 
I ever felt I might rejoice in the testimony which has been mine from 
childhood — that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ and that his authority 
is here in the earth to guide the people of these latter days. 

The Hawaiian Mission has progressed physically. We have built 
in six years eleven chapels, four mission homes, renovated and changed 
and improved eighteen buildings, secured eight pieces of fine land, to 
be used for chapel sites, from the Governor of the territory and from the 
managers of the various plantations. 

Spiritually we have progressed. The people of Hawaii have mani- 
fested their appreciation for the organizations of this Church, for the 
organizations which we have been privileged to establish among them and 
for the inspiration of Almighty God in the various districts of the mission. 
On each island there was organized, some five years ago, district councils, 
composed of ten or more men who, under the direction of the missionaries, 
labor perhaps in a way similar to that of a stake presidency in Zion, 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



directing these councils, and they have succeeded in increasing the faith 
of their people to the extent that already the Authorities of the Church 
have found it wise to go to Hawaii and organize a stake there. 

I rejoice as I read and hear of the progress of that mission and of 
that stake — that the movement is ever forward. We rejoiced in Hawaii 
to have a visit from the General Authorities of the Church. President 
Grant, President Clark, their wives and their party came to Hawaii 
and visited each of the districts there. Many tears fell. The courage 
of the people was greatly increased because of the fact that they had the 
privilege of touching the "hem of the garment" of these fine men of God. 
Later on, President David O. McKay and his wife came and inspired us. 

We rejoiced in their testimonies and I shall never forget the thrill 
that came to me as these brethren went through our mission, leaving 
their testimonies, singing the songs of Zion to the people and permitting 
them to look into the faces and feel the spirit of the Authorities of the 
Church, even the mouthpieces of the living God. As I contemplated the 
work which they performed there and the work which they are perform- 
ing here, I could not but thank God for the spirit of the present day and 
the spirit of times gone by. 

If you will look into the scriptures, you will find that nearly 2,400 
years elapsed from the time of that prophecy of Daniel, the 2nd chapter, 
the 44th verse, to the effect that in the days of these kings, the God of 
heaven shall set up a kingdom. 2,400 years, I say, elapsed from the time 
of that prophecy until its fulfillment. 

Then again we often quote from the 14th Chapter of Revelations, 
the 6th verse : that John saw an angel, flying in the midst of heaven. 
Seventeen hundred years elapsed from the time of that prediction until 
the angel came to visit the earth again and visited Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet of God. 

If you will read in I Kings (8:41), you will find that at the time 
of the dedication of Solomon's temple, Solomon, in his prayer, asked 
God, our Eternal Father, that he would remember a stranger who 
should come there and ask God that he would hear the words of his 
prayer and answer those words in behalf of that people. 2,845 years 
elapsed from the time of that statement until Orson Hyde went to the 
Holy Land and dedicated it for the return of the Jews. We do not think 
today that the prophecy of one of those who stand at the head of the 
Church should carry on for many years. 

The Prophet Joseph stated thirty years before the war between the 
North and South broke out — the Civil War — that it would come. A 
very short time after that he stated that the Saints would be driven to the 
tops of the Rocky Mountains. That was fulfilled. Later he said, "I 
go like a lamb to the slaughter." That was fulfilled almost immediately. 

In this day I have listened to the mouthpiece of God. I have heard 
President Grant make statements and promises to me, and I say to you 
that within a very short time those promises, those prophecies have been 
fulfilled. I thank God for the fact that I know that at the head of this 
Church there are prophets and that this is the Church of the living God. 



ELDER MILTON H. KNUDSEN 



123 



I bear testimony to you that it has been a joy to serve in Hawaii 
among those loving and lovable people. I bear testimony to you that they 
are receiving the truth and rejoicing in it and that their movement is ever 
forward. 

May God bless us that we may support those who stand at our 
head and that we may rejoice in life because of rendering that support, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MILTON H. KNUDSON 

Former President of the Norwegian Mission 

My dear brothers and sisters: I bring greetings to you from the 
land of the midnight sun where we have descendants of Ephraim, 
a branch of Joseph. I feel in this land we have, to a very great 
degree, the blood of that noble son of Joseph. As we sang this after- 
noon, "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet," I felt the same spirit 
as when I heard it sung in the far north. I want to bear testimony to 
you that those people of the north, when they sing that same grand 
and glorious song, they sing it from the depths of their hearts, just as 
we do here. What would you think if you had an assembly of several 
hundred people, every one of them being non-Mormons, with the ex- 
ception of the mission mother and father and the two Elders, singing 
that song and singing it with a fervor such as we hear it sung in the 
assemblies of the Saints? That has been our experience. Thanks to 
those noble Elders who teach those people to sing these song of Zion. 

Norway is ready for the Gospel. Thousands have come out of that 
country. There are thousands of others that will come. God is working 
with that people. Those people are seeking for the Gospel, but they 
are blinded by the craftiness of men. But the Father in his kindness 
is going to move that veil, for those people are noble sons and daughters 
of God. 

I bring a message to you parents from those fine sons of yours. 
They are doing splendid work. They are being well received by the 
people. I want to bear testimony to you that the work that President 
Widtsoe commenced, of having the auxiliaries organized thoroughly, 
being manned by the local brothers and sisters, is a very effective 
program. Some of the most effective work that we have at the present 
time is being done by our auxiliaries. What would you think of a 
Primary organization, hundreds of miles north of the Arctic circle 
consisting of ninety boys and girls, five nationalities being represented, 
and only one of that ninety a "Mormon" girl, with an average weekly 
attendance of over eighty, meeting all through the winter period? 
That is what the Primary work was doing in one of our branches in 
Norway, in the hands of our Elders last winter. The M. I. A. work with 
its wonderful program is bringing converts to us, and as a result of all 
these various activities the mission work in that foreign land is growing. 
Zion is being built there. 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I wish to bring a testimony to you concerning the faith of that 
people, particularly of those sons and daughters of the far north who 
have accepted the Gospel. They believe, and they show their belief 
and their faith by their acts, in paying their tithes and their offerings ; 
and every man and woman of that mission who is paying tithing honestly 
has good employment. I would like to bring the testimony to you of one 
of our prominent brethren who is president of one of our districts, a 
local brother, a very prominent merchant, internationally known, who 
said, "When I established myself in this community, Trondheim, I 
was not worth very much, financially. Shortly after that I joined the 
Church." 

He showed me a written statement of the banking institutions of 
that city, showing that he was the best recognized financial man of that 
entire community. He said, "It has been because I have paid my 
tithing." 

I want to bear my testimony to you of the power of healing among 
that people ; that is, they have faith, and through that faith, which is 
promised to us all, the deaf hear, evil spirits are driven out, the blind 
receive their sight, and those that may be broken down in health are 
marvelously healed. 

Brothers and sisters, it does one good to know that the God of 
heaven recognizes his children. When you hear the testimonies of our 
fine Elders, those sons of yours, in our mission meetings, and in the 
meetings of Saints and strangers — bearing testimony that when they 
make promises, the God of heaven recognizes those promises and they 
are fulfilled, it fills one's soul to overflowing. 

I would like to say a word about the land of Norway. Many people 
think that if you go to Norway you go to a land of bleakness and have to 
live with polar bears. It may surprise you to know that during the 
three years that we were there, we never once saw zero (Fahrenheit) 
weather. The marvelous Gulf Stream really has its source in the tops 
of these Rocky Mountains ; the waters that fall in the Rockies flow down 
to the Gulf of Mexico, are warmed there by the sun that God has created 
to give light, flow up to the north in that mightiest of all rivers on the 
earth, the gulf stream, and warm those shores; and those people live 
there in happiness, thousands of miles north of us. 

It is a goodly land. It is a beautiful land. If you receive a call 
to go to that mission, accept it gladly. I want to bear my personal 
testimony to you that you will not suffer from the cold and you will 
have the happiest surprise of your life coming to you, to see how moderate 
the climate is and to see how profusely nature produces flowers, fruits 
and all kinds of vegetables. 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. May we 
each and every one resolve to follow the example of that great man 
of God, Joshua — let us this day choose whom we will serve ; let us say 
that we will serve the Lord God of Israel, I pray in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER HUGO D. E. PETERSON 



125 



ELDER HUGO D. E. PETERSON 

Former President of the Swedish Mission 

My brothers and sisters, it is a pleasure to me and a great honor 
to be called on to report the Swedish Mission. I have walked, as it 
were, in the air since a few days ago, when I arrived back home. On 
the afternoon when my wife and I left for Sweden two years ago last 
spring, we were surrounded by our children and grandchildren who 
bade us farewell at the station. The emotions we had to fight back as we 
left them, we two aged, grey-haired people going out into the cold 
world to teach the Gospel, were quite different from those that we had 
when we returned. 

God's anointed servant had called us on this mission, and who were 
we that we should not be willing to accept? 

We are glad to be home again among God's people, to be among our 
loved ones and to see the faces of our file-leaders and to hear their voices. 
Some of my brethren have spoken and complimented themselves on 
having the opportunity to come back every six months to be encouraged 
by our leaders and to enjoy this beautiful sight of thousands of people 
in the congregation. It is quite different from being away for two 
and a half years and not having one of our leaders visit us and encourage 
us, but we have had the Lord to whom we could go, and he has been 
very kind to us. 

I also want to bring greetings from our missionaries to their parents. 
When I left Sweden we had forty-eight missionaries in that mission, 
besides the president and his wife. Two are on the way there now 
and there are some more, I understand, ready to go. They are doing 
a fine labor. Some of them are learning the language very quickly. 
They are determined to do their duty and they are a fine lot of young 
men, most of them at the age between nineteen and twenty-three years. 

Paul wrote once to his young friend Timothy, "Rebuke not an 
Elder but entreat him as a father." My wife and I have followed that 
advice. Our missionaries have been like a family to us, and we love 
them and have found them willing to do anything that we asked them 
to do. 

The Swedish people are a good people to labor among, but, as Elder 
Gaeth said regarding the people in Czechoslovakia, they do not like 
religion very much. They like pleasure, and yet there are tens of thou- 
sands of people there looking for the truth. 

"I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not ; if another 
shall come in his own name, him ye will receive." That is pretty much 
the condition in Sweden today, and for their sake — those who come 
in their own name and introduce teachings of men — I want to continue, 
shall the truth be spoken evil of, and it is, although many are seeking 
after it. 

I am a great believer in prayer, which I learned at my mother's 
knee. When I arrived in Sweden in 1934, there were nineteen mission- 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



aries in that mission, and a number of them were ready to be released 
to return home. I wrote the president, Joseph F. Merrill, and asked 
him to present our case to the First Presidency that we might have some 
more help and assistance. Shortly thereafter I received word from him 
that the depression was still on and it was hard to get missionaries to go 
out from home. He said, "It is most likely that you will not have as 
many missionaries this year as you had last year in the Swedish Mission." 

I turned to the mission secretary and asked, "How many mission- 
aries did we get last year?" 

He said, "We received three." 

I said, "Nothing doing. The Lord has sent me here to do his work 
and I cannot do it without help." 

I went before God on my knees and asked him for assistance. 
I told him I was willing to do my part but he must assist me. When the 
year was ended I counted up and found that we had received fourteen 
Elders. We have now about fifty or a few more in that long stretched-out 
country of six million people. 

I feel sometimes that it is a day of gleaning, and yet if we had say 
ten native Elders to work with the American Elders who are there 
we would do much better. However, we have had more baptisms so far 
this year than we had last year at the same time. 

Among our missionaries we haven't so many of the Andersons, 
Petersons, Johnsons, Carlsons, and so on, nowadays as we have others 
whose names are sometimes hard for the natives to pronounce. We have 
Atkinson, Young, dinger, Choates, Boyd, Coles, Barnes, Wasden, Crow- 
ther, Burke, Cahoon, Shurtliff, Newey and Cook; and the reason for 
this is that their mothers were born in Sweden or of Swedish parentage, 
and they are trying to redeem some of their relatives. 

I wish to mention that I believe in the Word of Wisdom. We 
were visited by Dr. E. G. Peterson of Logan, the president of the Utah 
State Agricultural College, this summer. He is a member of one of 
the national clubs. He told me one day, "I wish you would go with 
me to visit the Rotary Club tomorrow." 

And we went. I shall not endeavor to tell you in one minute 
what I said in seven on that occasion. There were present five foreigners 
— four Americans and one Canadian. I did not enjoy my meal for 
once, because I did not know what to say and how to say it, but Dr. 
Peterson gave me the key, and I was happy. He had been introduced 
as Peterson No. I, and I was introduced as Peterson No. 2. I was the 
last speaker. 

He said, "I am a Mormon and so is my friend, Mr. Peterson," and 
he explained our belief. He told them that he was not there as a repre- 
sentative of the Church on that occasion but that I was, and there was 
no escaping — I had to represent the Church. 

When the time came for me to speak, I said, 

"Gentlemen, you were no doubt very much surprised to have two 
Mormons in your midst today." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



127 



There were present about fifty or sixty of the most prominent 
men of Stockholm. 

"You have heard some stories about our people that are not very 
nice to repeat. Isn't that true?" 

They nodded their heads and smiled. 

"Now let me tell you something about the good side of the Mormons. 
They must not use tobacco in any form and they cannot use liquor 
and be good Latter-day Saints." 

These gentlemen were smoking all around us and they were drinking 
their coffee and they had a good time. They laughed at what I said. 

I said, "The Lord did not mean you, particularly, when he spoke 
about it. We all have our free will, but he advises us not to use it." 

Dr. Peterson introduced me as a seventy-five year young man 
and I said, 

"I have never used these things and that is perhaps one reason 
why I have all my faculties and all my strength." 
I referred them to the scripture which says : 

"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of 
God dwelleth in you; if any man defile the temple of God, him shall 
God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" — a 
mighty good lesson to some of our own people. 

While I was talking I was surprised at being applauded several 
times. After I sat down the chairman stood up and said, 

"I know that the Mormons live these principles. One of my 
relatives is a Mormon and she repeated these things to us often when 
we were in her company, and I will say this : If that is true — and I 
have no reason to doubt it — then we have something to learn from the 
Mormons." 

You may imagine how happy I felt when he said this, and how 
thankful I was that the Lord had put words in my mouth to speak. 

Brothers and sisters, let us be honest and true to ourselves. (The 
clock before me runs too fast, but it reminds me that I am talking on 
somebody else's time.) Let us be true and honest to our leaders who. 
night and day, are planning for our welfare. Let us be honest and 
true to our God, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are very grateful to Brother and Sister J. P. Fugal of Pleasant 
Grove for these very beautiful flowers. They were sent to my wife, who 
is a Pleasant Grove woman.

We are very grateful to Brother and Sister J. P. Fugal of Pleasant

EXPRESSES APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE 

I want to endorse all of the very splendid compliments that have 
been paid to the Choir, the organist and the soloists, and I am very 
grateful for the remarkable attendance at this conference. 

I am particularly grateful for the rich outpouring of the Spirit 
of the Lord in our Priesthood meeting last night. It was a marvelous 
sight to see this entire building filled with men who were here because 
of their love of God and their desire to serve him. 

ASKS GOD'S BLESSINGS UPON THE PEOPLE 

So far as it is within my province, I pray God to bless this people 
with whom I am faced at the present time, and to bless the Latter-day 
Saints at home and abroad, to prosper those that are in the mission field 
proclaiming the Gospel, and to bless the soil that it mav yield abundantly. 

I pray that the Lord may forgive each and all who have made 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



mistakes. We find recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, "I, the 
Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to 
forgive all men." 

JOY COMES FROM KEEPING COMMANDMENTS 

I have nothing but love in my heart for the Latter-day Saints; 
I have nothing but a desire for their welfare here and hereafter, and one 
of the principal reasons that I have pleaded and continued to plead with 
the people to serve God is because it is the duty of every human being, 
young or old. The Lord blesses us with the spirit of joy when we keep 
his commandments. "Man is that he might have joy," and obedience 
to the laws of God brings supreme joy. 

IN BEHALF OF ELDER HINCKLEY 

I desire to express my particular joy and gratitude that Brother 
Alonzo A. Hinckley was able to be with us for a short time this after- 
noon, and I ask for a continuation of the faith and prayers of the people 
in behalf of Brother Hinckley. May we continue to supplicate the Lord 
to give him back that vigor of body and of mind and that wonderful 
force of character and integrity and devotion that he has manifested all 
the days of his life. 

May the blessings of the Lord attend us one and all until we meet 
here again is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of our Redeemer, 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 



The Choir sang the "Hallelujah Chorus," from the "Messiah"

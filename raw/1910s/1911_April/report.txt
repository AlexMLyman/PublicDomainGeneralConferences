of Latter-day Saints convened in 
the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, at 
10 a. m. on Thursday, April 6, 1911, 
President Joseph F. Smith presid- 
ing.

by the choir and congregation sing- 
ing the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land. 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, 
Feed us till the Savior comes. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH.

condemned. — Erroneous doctrines can- 
not deceive enlightened Saints. — 
Strong re-affirmation that plural mar- 
riages have ceased in the Church. — ■ 
Legislation by Congress in regard to 
marriage and divorce approved. 

I do not feel at this moment that 
I shall occupy very much time. I 
am suffering, to some extent with a 
cold. Of course it is always a bad 
cold, however light it may be ; we 
never have good ones. 

I am extremely thankful to my 
Father in heaven, on my own be- 
half, for the many blessings that 
have come to me personally since 
our meeting at the last conference, 
in October. Then I was suffering 
extremely with sciatic troubles, and 
felt that I had my portion of suf- 
fering at that time. I am thankful 
to say that I feel almost new again, 
so far as that affliction is concerned. 
But we never can tell how long we 
may be free from the ailments in- 
cident to human life; and while we 
mention the favors of the Lord and 
His blessings upon us, and rejoice 
exceedingly in the health, vigor and 
strength that we possess, we do not 
do so boastingly but always in re- 
membrance of the fact that we are 
subject to the favor and mercy of 
God, every hour and every moment 
of our lives. For I feel that it is 
the duty of all Latter-day Saints, 
especially, and of course of all man- 
kind, to acknowledge the hand of 
God in all things. Sometimes af- 
flictions are permitted to come up- 
on us for the purpose of a trial, per- 
haps, or for some other reason, in 
the wisdom of Providence, for our 
good. I believe that everything 
with which we have to do in the na- 
tural and proper affairs of life, will 
be overruled, by the providence of 
God, to the good of those who love 
Him, who strive to keep His com- 



mandments, and who exercise wis- 
dom and judgment according to the 
intelligence that they possess, in the 
care and protection of their own 
lives, the preservation of their 
health, and strength, and the main- 
tenance of pure, moral character 
and manner of life. 

I feel grateful' for the beautiful 
morning which has dawned upon us 
at the opening of this eighty-first 
anniversary of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I feel 
grateful, too, for the presence of so 
many of the Latter-day Saints as 
are assembled, which is an indica- 
tion to me, at least, and should be I 
think to all, that we do take that in- 
terest which we should feel in these 
assemblies, or conferences of the 
Church. There is not one of us but 
what should feel a lively personal 
interest in the upbuilding of Zion, 
and in the welfare of all her people. 
No man or woman holding a mem- 
bership in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints should 
feel indifferent to the cause of Zion, 
but they should, one and all, feel a 
lively interest in the welfare of the 
work of the Lord, in which they are 
engaged. They should contribute 
whatever influence they can and 
whatever effort it is possible for 
them to contribute for the upbuild- 
ing of Zion and for the joy, peace, 
comfort, happiness, and well-being 
of all her inhabitants. 

I think I can truthfully say that 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints is in a prosperous 
condition in the world. I believe I 
can justly say that Zion is enjoy- 
ing the favor and the blessing of 
Ahnighty God. J feel confident 
that those who are entrusted with 
the watchcare of the people in var- 
ious organizations of the Church 
are faithful to their trusts and are

diligently exercising their influence 
and power for the good of the peo- 
ple over whom they are placed to 
preside. I can say this, so far as I 
have any personal knowledge, of 
every presidency of the stakes of 
Zion. I think I may, consistently 
and properly, say the same with ref- 
erence to the bishops of the wards 
in Zion. These important officers 
of the Church, holding the keys of 
the priesthood/ of authority and of 
presidency over the people in their 
various organizations are men of 
truth, men of soberness, men who 
are honest, faithful, prayerful, up- 
right, and men who enjoy the Spirit 
of the Lord God, in their hearts and 
who are disposed to do right, and 
shun even the appearance of sin. I 
think I may say this in all sincerity 
and honesty before the Lord and 
before all the Latter-day Saints. If 
there are any who are negligent or 
unfaithful in the performance of 
their duties, — I mean of those who 
are occupying these prominent po- 
sitions in the household of faith, it 
has not been brought to our atten- 
tion, and we do not know of any, 
of whom it may not be said, they 
are good, faithful men, who are 
faithfully discharging their duty for 
the welfare of the people over whom 
they preside. This I believe may be 
said consistently with reference to 
all the regularly organized stakes 
and wards of Zion; and the same 
may be said truthfully, too, so far 
as we have any knowledge — and 
we think we are pretty well posted 
with reference to these things — in 
regard to our various missions. The 
men who have been appointed to 
preside over them are men of integ- 
rity, men of honor, men who are 
faithful in the discharge of their du- 
ties, men who have the love of God 
in their hearts and the love of the 



people in their souls, men who are 
willing to sacrifice their time, their 
associations, dear to them, and 
many precious ties, that they may 
devote their time and energy and 
the gifts of the Lord, which are 
bestowed upon them, for the salva- 
tion of the children of men who are 
sitting in darkness and know not 
the truth. 

I need not give out any expres- 
sion with reference to the presi- 
dency of the Church. They are be- 
fore the people. Their lives are an 
open book to all the Church, and 
their integrity and labors are known 
to those who are associated with 
them in the business and in the 
spiritual affairs of the Church. 
They are accessible to all who call 
upon them, with business pertain- 
ing to the building up of the Church 
or who desire aid with reference 
to spiritual matters, or the dis- 
charge of other duties that devolve 
upon them, they all know us, and 
we leave it to them to say, or to 
judge whether the presidency are 
in good standing before God, and in 
the Church, or not. We haven't 
anything more to say about it. I 
will bear my testimony, however, 
with reference to the Twelve Apos- 
tles. They are faithful men, will- 
ing to do whatever is required at 
their hands to the inmost of their 
strength and ability. This may al- 
so be said of all the general au- 
thorities of the Church. In their 
hearts we believe them all to be true 
and faithful to their covenants, true 
and faithful to the people and to 
the Lord who has commissioned 
them to labor for the salvation of 
the souls of men and for the build- 
ing up of Zion. 

I have had preoared just a few 
little statements which will indicate 
to you, I think, better perhaps than

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I could tell you from memory, al- 
though they are familiar to me, the 
condition of the Church and of the 
labors and accomplishments there- 
of during the year that has only re- 
cently closed. I have an item here 
that there have been two new stakes 
organized in 1910, namely the Du- 
chesne and the Carbon stakes of 
Zion. There have been organized 
fifteen new wards during the same 
period. There are now 62 organ- 
ized stakes of Zion, and 696 wards, 
and 21 missions. All of these re- 
quire the constant supervision and 
attention not only of the bishops 
and the presidents of stakes, and 
the high councils of these various 
organizations, but of the presidency 
of the Church, by whom communi- 
cations are constantly received from 
all these presidents, or the most of 
them, and frequently many of them, 
and frequently from almost all these 
wards. The number of persons that 
have been baptized in the stakes of 
Zion and in the missions, during the 
year 1910, was 15,902. 

The birth-rate of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
for the year 1910, was 38 per thou- 
sand, the highest birth-rate in the 
world, as far as available statistics 
show. 

The death-rate of the Church, for 
the year 1910, was 9 per thousand, 
the lowest death-rate in the world, 
as far as we have been able to as- 
certain from published statistics. 

There were 1,360 couples mar- 
ried in the temples in 1910, and 
there were 1,100 couples married, 
of Church members, by civil cere- 
mony during the same year. 

There was one divorce to each 
5,000 Church members. The av- 
erage divorce rate in the United 
States is one to each 1,100 souls. 
This shows that our divorce rate is 



only about one-fifth of the average 
rate in our nation 

There were 2,028 missionaries 
laboring in the various missions on 
December 31st, 1910. 

There was expended by the 
Church, in maintaining missions and 
for fares of returning missionaries, 
during the year 1910, the sum of 
$215,000.00. This amount does not 
include the very large sum, in the 
aggregate, furnished by the people 
to assist their sons and daughters, 
or husbands and fathers, while in 
the mission field. 

Upwards of $300,000.00 was paid 
by the Church during 1910 for 
maintaining our Church schools ; 
and over $200,000.00 was paid out 
in the Church to assist the poor, 
during the year 1910. 

All expenses incurred on account 
of the general authorities of the 
Church, of operating expenses of 
the president's office, the historian's 
office, and the presiding bishop's 
office, were paid out of revenues de- 
rived from investments made by the 
trustee-in-trust, within past few 
years. This leaves the tithes of the 
Church to be used for the building 
of ward meeting houses and stake 
tabernacles, for maintenance of 
Church schools and temples, for 
missions abroad, and for the support 
of the poor. 

On December 31st, 1910, it was 
reported that there were 444 high 
priests, 632 seventies, 2,200 elders 
who are not enrolled in any organ- 
ized quorums of the priesthood. 

We will not say anything about 
a long list of non-tithepayers, that 
we have recorded in the archives of 
the Church, of those holding mem- 
bership in the Church. I do not care 
to make enumerations of this char- 
acter, but I would like to say to the 
Latter-day Saints who are tithe-

payers, who honor this law, and 
who provide out of their means, 
voluntarily, the revenues necessary 
to carry on the work of the Church 
— in the maintenance of temples, in 
the missionary cause, in the conduct 
and maintenance of our schools, in 
assisting to build our meeting- 
houses and other adjuncts to our 
schools, such as gymnasiums, which 
have become, apparently, a very ur- 
gent necessity of late, and also 
places of amusement. For we must 
not only provide places of worship 
for the youth of Zion, as well as for 
their fathers and mothers, but we 
must also provide and find places 
for rational amusement for our chil- 
dren, in order that they may be 
kept under proper influences and 
away from the contaminating, de- 
grading, and debasing practices too 
common in the world, with refer- 
ence to and in connection with the 
amusements of the people. There is 
one thing that I desire to say — not 
that it will amount to anything, I 
suppose ; but it will be a satisfaction 
to myself, at least, to speak what I 
feel to be the truth, and it is this : 
I regret most deeply the senti- 
ments that are expressed by the 
people generally with reference to 
their choice of amusements. We 
have some interest in the old Salt 
Lake Theatre here, built by Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, to afford a 
hisrh class of amusement that would 
be intelligible and entertaining, in- 
teresting and instructive to those 
who desire such entertainment. It 
has been conducted along these lines 
for many years in as high class 
character of performances as it was 
possible, but when we get really 
high class performances in that the- 
atre the benches are practically em- 
pty, while vaudeville theatres, where 
are exhibitions of nakedness, of ob- 



scenity, of vulgarity, and everything 
else that does not tend to elevate the 
thought and mind of man, will be 
packed from the pit to the dome. 
When you have performances of a 
high class, that are intellectual, peo- 
ple do not largely patronize them ; 
but when you bring in a class of 
performance that appeals to the vul- 
gar, the sensual and evil propensi- 
ties of men, the seats are full. I do 
not speak of this as existing mere- 
ly here in Utah; I speak of it as a 
common thing throughout all the 
length and breadth of the land. It 
shows a degradation of sentiment, 
a lowering of the standards of in- 
tellectuality, of purity of thought, 
of nobility of desire for proper as- 
sociation, of the people generally. I 
regret this ; I am sorry for it ; and 
I wish to say to the Latter-day 
Saints that I hope they will distin- 
guish themselves by avoiding the 
necessity of being classed with peo- 
ple who prefer the vulgar to the 
chaste, the obscene to the pure, the 
evil to the good, and the sensual to 
the intellectual. I hope that we will 
stand by our principles, abide by that 
which is good, elevating and ennob- 
ling in character, rather than fall in 
with the habits of the world, and 
patronize that which is beneath the 
dignity of pure-minded and intelli- 
gent people. 

Again I wish to refer to those 
who voluntarily provide revenues 
for the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, for its legitimate 
purposes, as we have enumerated — 
for the maintenance of the poor, and 
of the temples, and of the schools, 
and missions, and of all other things 
necessary to the building up of 
Zion in the latter day. God bless 
you for your faithfulness to this law 
of the Lord, for it is a law of the 
Lord, and yet, like all the other 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



laws of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
it is obeyed voluntarily by those 
who obey it, and those who do not 
obey it voluntarily choose to 
disobey it, and the consequences will 
rest with us all in accordance with 
our works and our faithfulness. 

Today we are under the necessity 
of cutting down, within the limit 
to the various wards and stakes of 
Zion in building their meeting- 
houses. We cannot give them all 
the help they ask for because we 
haven't got it; but we have given 
and we are giving to the extent of 
the means within our control, to 
help build ward houses. As you 
have heard here of the many new 
wards that have been established, 
all of which have to build meeting- 
houses for the convenience of the 
people ; and besides these there are 
hundreds of wards that have no 
suitable meetinghouses as yet. 
They are contemplating building 
them, and some of them are in the 
course of erection, and we are con- 
tributing what we can, as we have 
done heretofore, to help them com- 
plete their work. But the heft of 
the burden still rests upon the peo- 
ple of these wards and stakes, be- 
cause we have not the means to 
help them as we would like. If 
these multitudes of non-payers of 
tithing would only honor the law 
of the Lord, and live up to their 
privileges, I believe we would soon 
have ample means to meet every ne- 
cessity of the Church. If they 
would but do it! but will they or 
will they not? If they will not of 
course the consequences will rest 
with themselves. We are dealing 
with our faith and consciences, you 
are dealing, not with me, not with 
the presidency of the Church, but 
with the Lord. I am not dealing 
with men respecting my tithing, 



my dealings are with the Lord ; that 
is, with reference to my own con- 
duct in the Church as a tithepayer, 
and with reference to my observ- 
ance of the other laws and rules of 
the Church, if I fail to observe the 
laws of the Church, I am responsi- 
ble to my God, and will have to an- 
swer to Him, by and by, for my 
neglect of duty, and I may have to 
answer to the Church for my fel- 
lowship. If I do my duty, accord- 
ing to my understanding of the re- 
quirements that the Lord has made 
of me, then I ought to have a con- 
science void of offense ; I ought to 
have satisfaction in my soul, in the 
consciousness that I have simply 
done my duty as I understood it, 
and I will risk the consequences. 
With me it is a matter between me 
and the Lord ; so it is with every 
one of us. 

I am sorry I have to announce that 
Brother John Henry Smith was tak- 
en suddenly with an attack of lung 
trouble, which has laid him up, and 
which was, for a few moments, con- 
sidered very serious ; but he is im- 
proving and is better this morning. 
That accounts for his absence from 
the stand. 

Now, the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. We have spok- 
en of the general and of the local 
authorities of the Church, that are 
provided for in the revelations of 
the Lord to us, which have been or- 
ganized in accordance with the pat- 
tern the Lord has given for the or- 
ganization of His Church. It is my 
duty also to refer to the auxiliary 
organizations that have been de- 
vised for the benefit of the youth 
of Zion as well as for the benefit of 
all concerned. I believe that the 
officers of our Mutual Improve- 
ment associations, both the young 
men and the young women, are do-

ing their duty as faithfully as they 
know how. I believe that the offi- 
cers and the board of directors of 
the Sunday School Union are doing 
their duty ; and I can speak of them 
knowingly, for the reason that we 
meet with them, week by week, 
and they are punctual in attend- 
ance on their duties, always pres- 
ent, always willing to take upon 
them the parts or responsibilities 
that are assigned to them, to go and 
to come as they may be sent to min- 
ister to the youth of Zion, or assist 
with the Sunday School work 
throughout the stakes. I can say 
the same of our Primary Associa- 
tion. I believe that much good is 
resulting from the labors in that di- 
rection. I can say the same with 
reference to our Religion Class 
work ; and I can say the same with 
reference to the first and most im- 
portant auxiliary organization of 
the Church, that of the Relief So- 
ciety. They have been doing the 
best they could; but now we have 
suggested a complete organization 
of that society, that is, the general 
authorities of that organization ; and 
we trust that from this time forth, 
they will be able to begin with re- 
newed energy, judgment and wis- 
dom, the performance of the du- 
ties that devolve upon them, even 
those who are called to take the 
oversight of this great work in 
Zion, the Relief Society organiza- 
tion. 

Now, if I have omitted to men- 
tion any organization that I should 
have mentioned, you may take it for 
granted that I believe, as far as I 
have any knowledge of them, that 
they are all doing their duty, ac- 
cording to the best understanding, 
and wisdom, and strength which 
they possess. So I will repeat, Zion 
is prospering. The Lord is blessing 



His people. I believe that most 
of the Latter-day Saints are increas- 
ing in their faith. I believe, too, 
that the most of the Latter-day 
Saints are wise enough, that they 
have sufficient intelligence and a 
sufficient portion of the Spirit of 
the living God in their hearts, to de- 
cide between truth and error, be- 
tween right and wrong, and 
between light and darkness ; and I 
will say I believe they have sense 
enough to abide by the simple, pure, 
truthful principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, in preference to all 
the vagaries of philosophers, or of 
scientists, or of anybody else. There 
is no science, nor philosophy that 
can supersede God Almighty's 
truth. The Lord has said, "My 
word is truth," and indeed it is ; and 
I believe that the Latter-day Saints 
know enough about the word of 
God to know it is His word when 
they see it and shun whatever is 
not; and that they will abide by 
the word of God, for it is truth. 
As the Savior said, "If ye will abide 
in my word, then are ye my disci- 
ples, indeed; ye shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make you 
free." I believe that the Latter-day 
Saints, and especially the leading 
men in Israel, have sufficient knowl- 
edge and understanding of the prin- 
ciples of the gospel that they know 
the truth, and they are made free by 
its possession — free from sin, free 
from error, free from darkness, 
from the traditions of men, from 
vain philosophy, and from the un- 
tried, unproven theories of scien- 
tists, that need demonstration be- 
yond the possibility of a doubt. We 
have had science and philosophy 
through all the ages, and they have 
undergone change after change. 
Scarcely a century has passed but 
they have introduced new theories 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of science and of philosophy that 
supersede the old traditions and the 
old faith and the old doctrines en- 
tertained by philosophers and sci- 
entists. These things may undergo 
continuous changes, but the word of 
God is always true, is always right. 
I want to say to you that the prin- 
ciples of the gospel are always true 
- — the principle of faith in God, of 
repentance from sin, of baptism for 
the remission of sins by authority 
of God, and the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost; 
these principles are always true and 
are always absolutely necessary for 
the salvation of the children of men, 
no matter who they are or where 
they are. These principles are al- 
ways true, and you cannot get away 
from them. No other name, under 
heaven, is given, but that of Jesus 
Christ, by which you can be saved 
or exalted in the Kingdom of God. 
No man can enter into the king- 
dom of heaven except he be born 
again of the water and of the Spirit. 
These principles are indispensable, 
for God has declared them. Not 
only has He declared them, not on- 
ly has Christ declared them by His 
own voice, but His disciples from 
generation to generation, in the old- 
en time, but in these latter days, 
they have taken up the same testi- 
mony and declared these things to 
the world. They are true today as 
they were true then, and we must 
obey these things. 

Another thing, we must obey the 
rules of the Church with reference 
to marriage, at least we ought to do 
so. We do not all do it. You will 
see by what I have stated that dur- 
ing the last year eleven hundred 
marriages of our people have been 
contracted or solemnized in a man- 
ner not provided for in the law of 
the Church, I refer to civil mar- 



riages, so that we do not all do our 
duty yet with reference to that. 
And another thing, as we have an- 
nounced in previous conferences — 
as it was announced by President 
Woodruff, as it was announced by 
President Snow, and as it was re- 
announced by me and my brethren, 
and confirmed by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
plural marriages have ceased in the 
Church. There isn't a man today 
in this Church, or anywhere else, 
outside of it who has authority to 
solemnize a plural marriage — not 
one ! There is no man or woman 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints who is authorized 
to contract a plural marriage. It is 
not permitted, and we have been 
endeavoring to the utmost of our 
ability to prevent men from being 
led by some designing person into 
an unfortunate condition that is for- 
bidden by the conferences, and by 
the voice of the Church, a condition 
that has to some extent at least, 
brought reproach upon the people. I 
want to say that we have been doing 
all in our power to prevent it, or to 
stop it ; and in order that we might 
do this, we have been seeking, to 
our utmost, to find the men who 
have been the agents and the cause 
of leading people into it. We find 
it very difficult to trace them up, 
but when we do find them, and can 
prove it upon them, we will deal 
with them as we have dealt with 
others that we have been able to 
find. 

Now with reference to the threat 
that is made about us, from time 
to time, that in order to estop plural 
marriages among the Latter-day 
Saints, it is recommended to amend 
the Constitution of the United 
States, giving to the parental gov- 
ernment the exclusive right to deal

with polygamy and prevent it. So 
far as I am concerned, I am just as 
ready, this moment, as any other 
man in the world to consent to Con- 
gress taking the measures necessary 
to bring about the amendment to 
the Constitution, and pass laws to 
regulate plural marriage. We want 
them, while they are at it, to regu- 
late marriage and divorce as well. 
We will turn it all over to them, 
and we are just as ready for it to- 
day as any people on God's earth, 
no matter where you go. Now, in 
reference to this, I want to make 
this distinction, for it is a distinc- 
tion with a difference, and that is 
this ; I don't mean to interfere with 
men who had their wives before the 
Manifesto was issued by President 
Woodruff, men who entered into 
this covenant when it was the law 
of the Church, or who took wives 
under the authority of the presid- 
ing officers of the Church. We do 
not mean to interfere with them. 
To them I would say : take care of 
your wives. If you do not, vou 
are not genuine men at all. Take 
care of your families ; take care of 
your children, educate them, feed 
them, clothe them, house them, and 
do everything in your power to 
make of them men and women who 
will be an honor to our nation, to 
our state and to our Church. I 
mean future plural marriages must 
stop ; that is what I have reference 
to, the marrying of more than one 
wife in the future in plural mar- 
riage. That is what we have under- 
taken to stop in conformity with the 
laws of the land ; and we are doing 
our best. Now let the United States, 
authorize Congress to pass an 
amendment to the Constitution reg- 
ulating marriage and divorce, 
throughout all the nation. I think 
it will be a great blessing to our 



country. When we read of the vast 
number of divorces, and of the 
heartaches, and the sorrows that are 
occasioned by them, and by vanity, 
profligacy, lust, and corruption, 
throughout the world, we feel as if 
it would be a Godsend to the peo- 
ple to have some strong hand take 
hold of the matter and regulate it, 
so that there will not be so much of 
this evil as exists today. 

Now, the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. I love this 
work, I know it is right. I love 
the gospel with all my heart ; and I 
propose to continue, while I live, in 
the discharge of my duty to the 
best of my ability. Whatever that 
duty may be, I propose to do it as 
well as I can, and leave the result 
in the hands of the Lord. 

God bless the presidents of the 
stakes of Zion, and their counselors, 
and the high-councils in the stakes 
of Zion ; the Lord bless all our bish- 
ops, who are fathers to the people, 
and their counselors, the common 
judges in Israel. The Lord bless 
them and give them wisdom, fath- 
erly spirit, and kindness, that they 
may deal mercifully with the erring, 
and that they may seek earnestly 
and diligently to reclaim the err- 
ing from the error of their ways, 
and to keep those that are in the 
paths of righteousness and truth 
steadfast and firm in those right- 
eous paths, as fathers would do with 
their own children. 

May the Lord continue to bless 
the presidents of our missions 
throughout the land. Oh, how we 
feel to appreciate them, and how 
satisfying is the feeling that comes 
to us when we realize that we have 
men presiding over missions who 
are as true, according to the light 
and knowledge that they possess, 
as the Son of God Himself— true to 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



their covenants, true to their peo- 
ple, true to their mission. They are 
faithful, bright, intelligent, and ac- 
tive in the performance of their du- 
ties. The Lord bless you, brethren, 
in the discharge of your duties. 
And those who labor in the 
temples, the Lord bless them. I do 
not intend to slight the officers and 
faculties of our Church schools, 
May the Lord bless them abundant- 
ly. I believe they are faithful and 
reliable men and are doing their 
duty to the very best of their abil- 
ity. I do not think that there will 
be or can be any discount on the 
character of our Church schools, 
•under the direction of those who 
are at present in charge of them. 

The Lord bless all Israel, and 
especially,— I need not ask especial- 
ly for blessing upon those who do 
their duty, for I know that they will 
be blessed; but I do pray that the 
Lord will bless those who are luke- 
warm, who are indifferent, and un- 
interested in the work of the Lord, 
that they may awaken to their duty 
and learn to earn the reward of the 
faithful, that they may not be ig- 
nored when God shall choose His 
own and set the sheep on His right 
hand, and the goats on the left, and 
shall say to the latter "depart from 
me" (Matthew 25:31-41). 

May the Lord bless us all, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The beautiful hymn, written by 
Apostle Parley P. Pratt, "The 
morning breaks, the shadows flee, 
was sung, as a duet, by two of his 
grandsons, Mathoni W. and Noel 
Pratt; music composed by Prof. 
Evan Stevens. 

The following notice was read by 
President Joseph F. Smith : 

For the convenience of conference 
visitors who have not proper ac- 



commodations while in attendance 
at conference, a bureau of enter- 
tainment has been opened at the of- 
fice of Elias Morris & Sons com- 
pany, corner of Richards and South 
Temple streets. 

Those desiring accommodations 
should apply at that place, and any 
who have accommodations to offer 
the visitors, will please leave their

place. 

PEESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Health and happiness result from keep- 
ing Word of Wisdom. — -The people 
urged to eliminate the saloon and 
tobacco evils. — ■ Investigation of 
"Mormon" missionary work in Eng- 
land desired. — Marriage in Temple 
a safeguard against divorce. — Un- 
selfish and successful work of aux- 
iliary organization officers. 

I have been very much interested 
in the remarks of our president, as I 
know you all have been. I know that 
what he has said to us is true, and 
his counsels are for our best good. 

I was struck with the statistics 
that were read to us, and was 
pleased to learn that the death-rate 
among the Latter-day Saints is 
smaller than the death-rate in the 
world. Nine to a thousand is in- 
deed a good showing. Now, I be- 
lieve there is a cause for this. The 
Latter-day Saints, if they live their 
religion, have been promised long 
lives and health. The Lord has giv- 
en us a revelation in regard to pre- 
serving our health. We have in- 
quiries from several persons, ask- 
ing us when the Word of Wisdom 
was made a commandment. I do 
not know that we can give such in- 
formation, but the revelation speaks 
for itself; it tells us that the Word 
of Wisdom is the order and will of 
God — the will of God. Need we 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



ask to have it made any stronger? 
Why did He give that Word of 
Wisdom unto us Latter-day Saints ? 
Was it to deprive us of enjoyment 
in life ? Did He want to curtail the 
pleasures of life? No, on the con- 
trary, He wanted to give us advice 
how to live to preserve our health ; 
and as He has given it unto us, call- 
ing it the Word of Wisdom, I hope 
the Latter-day Saints will be found 
among the wise virgins, not among 
the foolish ones. All that has been 
given to us by revelation has been 
for our blessing and for our good, 
and we should not feel to violate the 
Lord's will in regard to this matter, 
even if we should say to ourselves, 
It is not a commandment,but a word 
of wisdom. Let us make it the re- 
solve of our hearts that we will fol- 
low the advice given therein, and 
then we will be blest, not alone phy- 
sically but also spiritually. We will 
be enabled to do much more good, 
to labor more and harder than if we 
indulge in those things that sap the 
strength of our bodies and under- 
mine our health, for that is the ef- 
fect of violating the Word of Wis- 
dom. 

Our legislature has given us a law 
on the liquor question, and there is a 
time appointed when the people will 
be at liberty to express themselves 
on this question. It seems to me 
that all through the settlements of 
Zion, where we the Latter-day 
Saints are in the majority, the sen- 
timent should be to do all in our 
power to eliminate the liquor traffic 
from our midst. Ever since the 
Word of Wisdom was given, there 
has been a feeling among us Latter- 
day Saints that it is our duty to obey 
this law, and in placing men in po- 
sitions in the Church we have 
charged them that they must obey 
the Word of Wisdom. This is not 



a request that has been made so 
strong lately. Seventy years ago, 
and more, it was voted by the 
Church that no officer should hold 
office in the Church, who violated 
the Word of Wisdom. This was 
under the prophet Joseph, and if he 
felt to make it that strong, we ought 
not to try to make it lighter now, 
but urge our brethren who are 
called to lead the people, and to la- 
bor in the ministry, to observe this 
requirement, and not show the bad 
example of failing to heed the ad- 
vice given by our heavenly Father. I 
hope that at the election the people 
will show that they stand for tem- 
perance. If we cannot get a whole 
loaf, let us be satisfied with a half, 
but let our efforts be to save our 
young people from the evils of the 
saloon. Let us try to provide for 
them places where they can go and 
have healthful entertainment, and 
not have them seek to get their recre- 
ation in low places, and I look upon 
the saloon as such a place ; it should 
not be found in the settlements of 
the Latter-day Saints. I need not 
talk upon the evils that follow in- 
temperance ; they are so well 
known. When we travel where 
such things are found, how it 
grieves us to see men degrading 
themselves by overindulgence in 
liquor and other stimulants. 

The tobacco habit should be 
avoided. The use of tobacco is very 
harmful and injurious to the sys- 
tem, and' we should do all in our 
power to have our young men grow 
up without indulging in this. I was 
pleased, the other day, to read of 
one settlement where it was said 
there was not a boy under twenty- 
one who used tobacco. I wish it 
could be said of all Israel, that all 
our boys abstain from that habit. 
Statistics from different institutions 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



show that the boys who indulge in 
tobacco do not excel, and that those 
who really come to the fore, and ex- 
cel in their studies, are those that 
are not indulging in the tobacco 
habit, or using stimulants. 

I was pleased to hear the Presi- 
ident's words about our mission- 
aries, and I believe his blessing up- 
on them will be felt by them. I be- 
lieve our Father in heaven will be 
with them in their labors, their un- 
selfish labors out in the world. They 
devote their time to forward this 
work, sustaining themselves ; and as 
they go forth they are often mocked 
and scorned, and meet the rebuffs of 
the people, but they have a message 
to give unto the world, that they 
know is of the utmost importance. 
There has been published both here 
in America and abroad, in England, 
Scandinavia, and Germany a mass 
of scurrilous articles, lying about 
and abusing the Latter-day Saints. 
Hans P. Freece, a Utah man trav- 
eling in England, for instance, is 
trying to stir up the English people 
against us. His talk has even come 
to the government, and the prime- 
minister has been urged to institute 
investigations concerning the things 
that this Mr. Freece has been tell- 
ing. 'What does he know of what 
is going on in England? He is 
accusing us of taking girls from 
there and bringing them here for 
immoral purposes, as if our elders 
were sent out to bring girls here. 
Our elders go to preach the gos- 
pel to all. Statistics show that the 
"Mormon" emigrants from Eng- 
land do not amount to more than 
a small fraction of one per cent, 
but that small fraction is enough 
to stir up the people there. We 
have asked for an investigation. 
We know that we are free from 
the things they accuse us of. You 



know, Latter-day Saints, that the 
gospel has not given you license to 
sin. You know that when you went 
into the waters of baptism, you 
made the covenant that you would 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord, and you know as long as you 
have lived up to that covenant the 
peace and joy of the Holy Spirit has 
been yours. You know that you 
have not been taught, by the elders, 
anything contrary to the command- 
ments of God. Why is it that all 
this opposition is arrayed against 
us? Are we any worse this year 
than last year, or past years ? I be- 
lieve, as the president said, that the 
Latter-day Saints are growing in 
faith, in live faith, and that will 
lead to good works. Wherever you 
go, you will find, throughout the 
stakes of Zion, that the Saints are 
alive to their duties. We are thank- 
ful to them for showing their faith 
in the gospel in their duties, in their 
fast offerings and in the great 
amounts that they are paying to- 
wards erecting houses of worship, 
where they can go and learn more 
of the ways of the Lord. We feel 
to praise the Latter-day Saints for 
this. The Latter-day Saints are a 
God-fearing people, a duty- fulfilling 
people, a people who have joined to- 
gether in covenants to serve the 
Lord and to work out the salvation 
of their souls, in fear and trembling 
before God. They are not a peo- 
ple sunken in vice and iniquity. 
Where such is found, the brethren 
who are in charge are seeking to 
eliminate such from the Church. 

The divorce question was men- 
tioned here. By statistics it is 
found that those who have been 
married in our temples and have 
been sealed at the altar of God, are 
not the ones that are being divorced, 
that there are far fewer divorces in 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 13 



that class than in the case of those 
who have been married outside of 
the temple. I am glad that I can 
state this, and I would exhort all 
the youth of Zion to prepare them- 
selves to be worthy to have a rec- 
ommend to go to the temple of the 
Lord, to be sealed, to begin their 
marriage right, that they may be 
under the covenant, and their pos- 
terity be born under the covenant 
and be heirs to the blessings there- 
of. I believe that marriages, en- 
tered into so solemnly as they are 
in the temple, will make a deeper 
impression upon the hearts and 
cause a stronger resolve to be made 
to live as husband and wife ought 
to live. Divorces should not be 
known amongst us. It is too sol- 
emn a thing to enter into the mar- 
riage relation and then have it dis- 
solved. So we would say to the 
young people, begin marriage right, 
and then try to make marriage 
bring unto you happiness and bless- 
ings. Avoid everything that tends 
to make that bond galling and the 
relation unhappy. Much can be 
done by each one in this direction if 
both parties are determined to live 
in peace and harmony. 

The reports given us of the aux- 
iliary organizations are very pleas- 
ing to us, and they are true. The 
men who are laboring on the boards 
are putting their whole mind and 
soul to the work in which they are 
engaged; they are studying and 
trying to devise plans for the wel- 
fare and the uplift of our youth. 
I say, the Lord bless these men and 
women who are engaged in this 
work. They spend much of their 
time in the interest of these institu- 
tions, and they do it out of pure 
love for the young. I want all the 
Latter-day Saints to feel to honor 
these men and women, not alone 



those on the general boards, but al- 
so on the stake boards, and those 
who are laboring in the wards, who 
are giving their time to teach and 
instruct our young people in the 
ways of the Lord. 

Now, may the Lord bless the Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; may He bless us 
during this conference, that the 
Spirit of the Lord may be poured 
out in a rich measure, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Each cooing dove, and sighing bough, 
That makes the eve so blest to me, 

Has something far diviner now, 
It bears me back to Galilee. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder John L. Herrick. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
David McKay. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Judgment by principles of Sermon on 
the Mount. — The people familiar 
with Church leaders, and know their 
integrity.— Righteous people are not 
persecutors. — Prohibition needed to 
help the weak. Latter-day Saints 
advocate and practice righteousness. 

It is delightful for the Latter- 
day Saints to meet together to wor- 
ship the Lord and to consider the 
blessings He has bestowed upon us, 
to listen to a recital of sqme of the 
advancement that has been made in 
the Church, and some things in re- 
lation to our good record. We com- 
pare very favorably with our neigh- 
bors and with conditions that exist 
at the present time, in the world, 
hence there is no excuse for the agi- 
tation that is being provoked by 
some who feel that it is their duty 
to arraign the Latter-day Saints be- 
fore the public opinion of the world. 

I was reminded, this morning, in 
my early waking moments, it being 
the sixth day of April, the occasion 
for the general annual gathering of 
the Saints to transact the business 
of the Church, and to hear the word 
of the Lord, I was reminded of the 
conditions that exist around us, and 
I thought of the Sermon on the 
Mount. My mind was turned to it, 
and I feel that to read just a few 
verses from that memorable sermon 
by the Savior will give us an oppor- 
tunity to consider and to examine 
ourselves and, possibly, draw the at- 
tention of our friends to an examin- 
ation of their condition as well as 
ours. I believe you will discover 
that it is a very fitting text for a 
little talk, for us to look over the 
field and regard ourselves, and to 
remind our friends and neighbors of 
the opportunity, also, to consider 
our faith and our standing and fel- 
lowship with the Lord. We can 



profit much by this, and we may 
discover, possibly, some reforma- 
tion that we need to make ourselves, 
in order to be fully in harmony with 
the doctrines of the Lord ; but I be- 
lieve that the comparison will be 
very favorable for the Latter-day 
Saints. I will just read a few verses, 
in the fifth chapter of Matthew, 
commencing with the third verse : 

"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

"Blessed are they that mourn: for 
they shall be comforted. 

"Blessed are the meek: for they 
shall inherit the earth. 

"Blessed are they which do hunger 
and thirst after righteousness: for they 
shall be filled. 

"Blessed are the merciful: for they 
shall obtain mercy. 

"Blessed are the pure in heart: for 
they shall see God. 

"Blessed are the peacemakers: for 
they shall be called the children of 
God. 

"Blessed are they which are perse- 
cuted for righteousness' sake: for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

"Blessed are ye, when men shall re- 
vile you, and persecute you, and shall 
say all manner of evil against you 
falsely, for my sake. 

"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad : for 
great is your reward in heaven: for so 
persecuted they the prophets which 
were before you. 

"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if 
the salt have lost his savor, wherewith 
shall it be salted? It is thenceforth 
good for nothing, but to be cast out, 
and to be trodden under foot of men. 

"Ye are the light of the world. A 
city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. 

"Neither do men light a candle, and 
put it under a bushel, but on a candle- 
stick; and it giveth light unto all that 
are in the house. 

"Let your light so shine before men. 
that they may see your good works, 
and glorify your Father which is in 
heaven." 

Now, I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Latter-day Saints 
have great reason to take courage 
and feel consoled when we look 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



15 



over the field and consider what is 
being said in regard to us, when 
we consider our own position, how 
carefully and exactly the Latter- 
day Saints are attending to their 
own duties, magnifying the priest- 
hood we bear, devoting ourselves to 
preaching the gospel throughout the 
earth, preaching the doctrines of 
life and salvation, and ministering 
for the salvation of the children of 
men. 

We work for those who live and 
also for the dead, thus following in 
the footsteps of our Lord and Mas- 
ter, for as soon as He had finished 
His mortal mission here on the 
earth, before He returned to His 
Father, before He arose with His 
body and went to heaven, His first 
mission and attention was given to 
those, who had died, those who were 
indifferent and cared not for the 
truth when it was taught to them in 
the flesh. He went to the spirits in 
prison, to preach the gospel and 
labor for their salvation. He turned 
the key, opened the door, and es- 
tablished a mission among those 
who had rejected the gospel — not 
those, altogether, who had not 
beard it, but also those who had 
beard and had rejected it and con- 
cluded not to receive it. To such 
He went and preached the gospel. 
Now, you know, my brethren and 
sisters, what our works have been, 
especially these thousands of men 
who are present here this afternoon, 
who hold the priesthood. This con- 
gregation is made up, largely, of 
men bearing the priesthood, men 
who have been called into the min- 
istry in the world, and they have 
been preachers of the gospel and 
■defenders of the faith. You know 
your brethren who preside over 
you ; you know those who have pre- 
sided over this Church from its in- 



ception, eighty-one years ago; you 
know the history of all the prophets 
and the apostles of the Latter-day 
Saints ; and when the world, or men 
in the world take up a mission to 
war upon the Latter-day Saints, and 
charge us with insincerity, with im- 
morality, and with any kind of 
wickedness, you are my witnesses 
that these statements are untrue. 
You know, this congregation knows 
the truth concerning these things ; 
and other people who are here, who 
are not Latter-day Saints but who 
live among us, they know also the 
integrity of our course, and our de- 
votion to the work in which we are 
engaged for the salvation of the 
children of men. We are known; 
our doctrines are known; our prin- 
ciples are known. 

I would like you who want to 
consider this matter, to look over 
the history of those who are mak- 
ing trouble for the Latter-day 
Saints, those who have made trou- 
ble for us in the past, and those who 
are thus engaged today. I would 
like you to weigh and measure them 
by this standard that the Savior 
has laid down, and find out wheth- 
er those trouble-making men are 
persecuting people, whether they 
are persecutors or being persecut- 
ed. Are the Latter-day Saints per- 
secutors, or are they being perse- 
cuted? Are they being betrayed? 
Are falsehoods being uttered in re- 
gard to the Latter-day Saints ? Are 
we being imposed upon, or are we 
imposing upon the world? My 
brethren and sisters, are we not la- 
boring for the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men, carrying the same mis- 
sion of faith to the world that the 
Savior Himself brought? Are we 
not teaching the doctrine of repent- 
ance, and of baptism, by_ immer- 
sion, for the remission of sins? Are 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we not teaching, also, the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, through the laying on 
of hands, by men who are author- 
ized of the Lord and commissioned 
of Him? Are we not thus labor- 
ing all the time in the world, car- 
rying the gospel as far as we pos- 
sibly can, and do we not expect to 
carry it to every creature ; is not 
that the truth ? Are they telling the 
truth about us when they are pub- 
lishing, in their magazines, those 
articles that are being published 
against us ? What kind of men are 
those who put forth those doctrines 
and make these efforts against the 
Latter-day Saints, what is their 
character and standing? Are they 
trying to improve the Latter-day 
Saints? Are they better than the 
Latter-day Saints in their lives, is 
their morality superior to ours ? Or, 
are we the people who are being 
persecuted? Is this not an evidence 
and a mark that designates the Lat- 
ter-day Saints as the followers of 
the Lord Jesus ? The very fact that 
wicked men stand up and undertake 
to berate and impeach the character 
of the Latter-day Saints, is it not 
a positive testimony and evidence 
that we are the followers of the 
Lord Jesus? 

You know your own people; you 
are acquainted with them in your 
own wards ; you know them in your 
own stakes, the Latter-day Saints 
that are gathered together ; and you 
know the class of men that are be- 
ing sent out from among you into 
the world. You know how careful- 
ly they are trained, how carefully 
they are instructed at home and 
abroad. You know, also, that if 
any fall into sin, how quickly it is 
. discovered, how soon they are de- 
tected, when that occurs, which 
sometimes does. Men are fallible 
and liable to fall, but as a rule the 



Latter-day Saints are stable. They 
are superior because of the spirit 
that is with the work of the Lord, 
the Holy Ghost that has dwelt with 
us, that we received at our baptism 
and confirmation, through our faith 
and repentance. The Latter-day 
Saints would not be gathered to- 
gether without that measure of faith 
that the Lord has bestowed upon 
us, which He has been generous 
enough to bestow upon all people. 
He would be delighted, as a loving 
Father, for all His children to re- 
ceive the same spirit that our elder 
brother received, the Holy Ghost 
that was conferred upon Him, and 
that descended upon Him, succeed- 
ing His baptism. Have we not 
been so laboring, and are we not 
thus engaged at the present time? 
All this army of men have labored 
either at home or abroad. That is 
the labor which has been required 
of the Latter-day Saints. We have 
been trained in morality, in purity, 
in sobriety, in temperance, in faith, 
in charity, and in all the gifts and 
graces of the gospel. That has been 
the mission and ministry of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. That was the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph, and of 
his brethren, all who have shared 
with him in the priesthood that has 
been restored from heaven. 

You know the attitude of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints toward these princi- 
ples ; and not only do we know, but 
our neighbors, among whom we 
live, and those who live in our 
neighborhood, they know perfectly 
well that the Latter-day Saints are 
a good people, an honest people, a 
conscientious people, and a moral 
people. We are not encouraging im- 
morality, neither here nor abroad. 
We do not want immoral men. We 
have not preached for immorality, 
nor for immoral people. We have

not advocated the coming of wicked 
people; we have not desired that 
any one should come here for wick- 
edness. That is a false accusation, 
and those who have taken that stand 
and position fgainst the Latter-day 
Saints, to try to make trouble for 
this people — this little handful of 
people, gathered together here — 
they are not inspired of the Lord; 
they are operating against the truth, 
and they have need of repentance 
themselves ; they have need for ref- 
ormation. They have been berating 
better people than they are them- 
selves ; that is what they have been 
doing, and that is what the wicked 
do. That is what they did in the 
days of the Savior ; they persecuted 
Him to His death. They will not 
persecute us any more than they 
did Him. But they are persecu- 
tors; they are not peacemakers; 
they are not the righteous that are 
laboring for the salvation of the 
children of men. It is not their 
exceeding purity and righteousness 
that is prompting them, but it is the 
spirit of evil, the spirit of Satan, 
and not the Spirit of the Lord. 

You will not find good people 
persecuting bad people. Now, you 
look for persecutors, look for people 
right at home that are trespassers 
and you win find that the righteous 
are not transgressors. The right- 
eous are not seeking to do injury 
to the wicked, but it is the wicked 
that persecute, that speak evil, and 
that revile their neighbors. We sim- 
ply endure what is put upon us ; 
and we have this assurance, my 
brethren and sisters, that this king- 
dom which the Lord has established 
is so sustained by the power of God 
that it will never be overthrown. 
You may be overthrown, if you do 
wrong; if we go into transgression 
and sin, we shall be disturbed and 



overthrown; but not so with this 
work. It is a mark of the Latter- 
day Saints that they are struggling 
for righteousness and truth, for 
justice and for mercy. They love 
peace and work for it ; they are not 
a warlike people but a peaceable 
people, a spiritually minded people, 
a people who love justice, right- 
eousness, and truth. I thought that 
this doctrine of the Lord upon the 
Mount was very fitting to our con- 
dition at the present time, advising 
us that if we were persecuted we 
need not be surprised. Why, the 
Saints were persecuted in the days 
of the Savior, and as long as He en- 
gaged in His ministrations among 
the people He was not exempt, al- 
though He was the Son of God. We 
need not worry, if persecutions 
come upon us. The wicked do not 
need to be persecuted ; the wicked 
can be handled by the law, and can 
be dealt with and treated by the 
law ; but if you want to disturb the 
righteous, the pure, and upright, it 
must be done by persecution, and 
not legally or lawfully. 

There is no need of troubling 
about the Latter-day Saints on ac- 
count of their alleged sins. If we 
are sinners, we stand in the pres- 
ence of the law, as we stand in the 
presence of the Lord, and are an- 
swerable — ready to answer for 
everything that we are guilty of. 
The Lord will sustain His people. 
He will sustain u=> as individuals, 
men and women, members of His 
Church. Now, that is right and 
proper and pleasing in His sight. 
We ought to appreciate the fact, my 
brethren and sisters, that the trou- 
bles that are arrayed against us in 
the world only tend to refine us, pu- 
rify us, and do us good, possibly 
cutting us a little closer on guard 
in the future, that we may be bet-

ter than we have been. We are 
not afraid to stand in the presence 
of the law, as we heard this morn- 
ing from our president, in regard 
to conditions that exist among us 
in regard to marriage, in regard to 
divorce, and so forth. We can 
stand to be taken care of, certainly, 
as well as the people of the earth, 
for it is discovered that we are 
fully as good as they are, and, in 
some things, a little better than 
the people of the world. We have 
information, knowledge, truth, and 
revelation superior to what the peo- 
ple of the world have. The Lord 
has been generous to us. We have 
been fortunate enough to come up- 
on the earth at the very time when 
the gospel has been sent, and are 
favored with taking part and por- 
tion therein. The Lord is pleased 
with His people, as a whole. There 
are, no doubt, individuals among us 
who have not pleased the Lord in 
all things. We have not always, all 
of us, done right, but as a people, as 
Latter-day Saints, the Lord is 
pleased with His people, for their 
righteousness, not for their sins ; 
but we are struggling, all the time, 
to do better. We are struggling 
to make all the people better. We 
are endeavoring to gather the good 
and honest from the world, and to 
reclaim those who are wayward. 
I was impressed with the prayer of 
the president, not only for the lead- 
ing brethren among the people, and 
the Latter-day Saints, but those who 
are wayward as well, those who 
need the favor and blessing of the 
Lord particularly, those who have 
not been so favored in their dispo- 
sitions, those who have not felt in- 
clined to repent, to reform and work 
righteousness as they should. The 
blessings of the Lord were asked 
upon them. That should always be 



so, as it is the sick that need the 
physician. Let the petitions and 
faith of the people go out for the 
advantage and benefit of those who 
need to be encouraged and strength- 
ened. 

I thought the conversation of the 
president, this morning, was very 
encouraging for the Latter-day 
Saints, and he spoke the mind of 
the Lord, the will of the Lord ; and 
so did President Lund, upon the 
subject of the Word of Wisdom, 
and also the subject of temperance. 
We find ourselves, just now, as he 
drew our attention to the fact, con- 
fronted with this question, and in 
a little while we are to determine, 
the Latter-day Saints and our 
neighbors and friends who live 
among us, are to determine what 
shall be done. I am persuaded that 
our friends, very many of them, I 
think I would be perfectly safe in 
saying that the majority of our 
friends and neighbors who live 
among us, who ar*: not Latter-day 
Saints, are in favor of temperance, 
in favor of good order, in favor of 
law and of peace. I think we can 
say that concerning most of the peo- 
ple of our state. There are, of 
course, exceptions to the rule, but 
as a rule I believe that our neigh- 
bors, as well as the. Latter-day 
Saints will demonstrate, on the 27th 
day of June, this year, that the peo- 
ple of the State of Utah are in favor 
of sobriety, of temperance, and of 
prohibition. I hope so; I hope they 
will be ready for that. I have been 
personally under the law of prohi- 
bition so long that I want every- 
body else under it ; I have found 
that it is good, very good indeed. 
I can commend it to all the people 
of our state, and I want to sound a 
note of advice for the people of 
Utah: Let us be a sober people, 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



and let us help those who are weak. 
If we are strong ourselves, and feel 
that we can get along, that we do 
not need any law or anything to 
help us, let us help those who need 
to be helped; let us strengthen 
them. If we have been strength- 
ened and converted, and are able 
to stand fairly well ourselves, let 
us help our neighbors about us, and 
let us be Latter-day Saints in very 
deed. We have made profession 
to do this. We should keep the 
commandments of the Lord and re- 
frain from all evil; we should be 
temperate not only in regard to the 
use of liquor but in regard to the 
use of other things that are forbid- 
den in the Word of Wisdom. Let 
us be Saints, and encourage our 
neighbors about us to follow our 
good example. Let them see; let 
our light so shine before all men, 
and in their presence, that they will 
discover our good works. We do 
not want them to discover in us 
any bad works, we do not want to 
engage in any bad works ; it is not 
necessary; and the Lord will not 
excuse us, not near so readily as He 
will excuse those who have not been 
instructed, and who do not know 
as we know. 

We have received of the Spirit of 
the Lord. Other men have re- 
ceived of other spirits. There is a 
world of spirits about us and among 
all peoples. Every denomination 
and every organization, political or 
otherwise, have their spirit, the spir- 
it of their organization; and they 
partake of it, and it seems altogeth- 
er right to them, I presume; but 
it takes the Spirit of the Lord, the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, in 
order for men and women to serve 
the Lord, to find out, and to know 
Him. We can't do it without faith, 
without Repentance, without bap- 



tism, without the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost which we receive by 
the laying On of hands. These are 
the initiatory doctrines of the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus, and they are. 
imperatively necessary. I want to 
bear my testimony before my breth- 
ren and sisters, here today, that 
these doctrines and principles are 
indispensable for Latter-day Saints. 
Other people may not care for them 
and will not, possibly, until they 
have some other chance on the other 
side. They may reject these princi- 
ples here; they may not see; they 
do not see ; they can not receive the 
same spirit that we have received 
except on the same conditions, and 
that is through the principle of 
faith. Again, a mere profession of 
faith is not enough, but it must be 
a genuine, living faith that will pro- 
duce repentance and works of right- 
eousness. That is what is necessary. 

The Lord has arranged for His 
people, and He will sustain His peo- 
ple, and the truth concerning this 
work and the true character of this- 
people will be demonstrated before 
the world. The world will find out 
that the Latter-day Saints are a 
peculiar people ; that although there 
are so many bad things said about 
us, they will find us a good people. 
That is what we are laboring for. 
We are preaching righteousness, ad- 
vocating the doctrine of faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ. There is no law 
against that. Isn't that good doc- 
trine? We also teach repentance. 
Isn't repentance good doctrine, and 
is it not effective? You can't save 
a man without repentance, of 
course ; and a man will not repent 
who has not faith ; it is the princi- 
ple of faith that will produce re- 
pentance. There is no repentance 
without faith in God, and there is 
no forgiveness of sins without the

ordinance of baptism; it is impor- 
tant and necessary, and we can't 
avoid it. We can't relieve ourselves 
of the sins we have committed, ex- 
cept in the way I have explained. 
We may cease to sin, and sin no 
more, if we please, but in order to 
free ourselves from the sins that we 
have committed, and to enter into 
the kingdom of God, as the Son of 
God did, Himself, we must do it 
through baptism, genuine baptism, 
the baptism that the Lord has laid 
down and so instructed us. It must 
not be looked upon as unnecessary ; 
it is important; we can't free our- 
selves from it at all ; it is the law. 

This is the work that the Latter- 
day Saints have been engaged in, 
and they have done a wonderful 
work in eighty years. It is a re- 
markable work, and our position 
is unique, and remarkable in the 
world, among the Christian denom- 
inations of the earth. I say it is 
very remarkable, and what a sensa- 
tion is made throughout the world 
today by this good people. It is not 
for our sins, not because we are 
wicked. We have not clogged the 
courts with the necessity of taking 
care of us for our wickedness. We 
have not advocated immorality or 
impurity at all. It has never been 
countenanced by the Latter-day 
Saints, and is not today ; and what- 
ever of evil there is among our peo- 
ple, and in this state, is not charge- 
able to the Latter-day Saints ; it is 
properly chargeable to men of cor- 
ruption, wickedness, and the worst 
of immorality ; that is what it is. It 
cannot be charged to us ; we are not 
guilty of these things, they have not 
been established by us. We have 
not advocated them abroad, or 
brought them here and established 
them; not at all; and we are not 
engaged in any kind of wickedness. 



The Latter-day Saints are not do- 
ing it. That is my testimony for 
the Latter-day Saints who are gath- 
ered together in Zion, that we are 
laboring for purity and righteous- 
ness and for the salvation of the 
children of men and our sons and 
daughters. We rejoice exceedingly 
at their devotion and faithfulness to 
the Lord, and our hearts are broken, 
and sorrowful, and tender, when we 
find one straying from the path of 
truth and righteousness. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters ; and I com- 
mend to you the words of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that I have read to 
you. Read them in your own Bi- 
bles at home, and see if they are 
not very fitting for the conditions 
under which the Latter-day Saints 
are living at the present time, and 
the experiences that we are having 
in connection with the world. May 
the Lord bless us during our con- 
ference, that we may rejoice ex- 
ceedingly and take home the word 
of the Lord from His servants, and 
be better and stronger in the future, 
and realize that the Lord has es- 
tablished His kingdom and will sus- 
tain it and preserve it to the end, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



21 



Latter-day Saints in general confer- 
ence, and I rejoice in seeing so large 
an attendance at the opening meet- 
ings. It is evidence, to me, of great 
interest on the part of the people, 
and of their desire to hear what may 
be said by those who shall be called 
upon to address the Saints during 
this conference. I have rejoiced in 
the remarks that have been made in 
our hearing, thus far, and I earn- 
estly desire that the same good spir- 
it, which has attended the brethren 
who have spoken, may be with me 
in the remarks that I shall make. 
I desire to say only tliose things 
which will be for the good of the 
Latter-day Saints ; and I am con- 
vinced that the desire which I have 
is the same that has always inspired 
the servants of the Lord when 
standing before the people to pro- 
claim the gospel unto them. From 
my early childhood, when I had the 
privilege of attending meetings in 
the old tabernacle and in the old- 
bowery, as I look back and recall 
the counsel and advice given by 
those who spoke in our conferences, 
I realize that it was always good, 
and for the uplifting, for the ad- 
vancement, and foi the welfare of 
the people. I have never heard, in 
all my life, any of the servants of 
the Lord giving any vicious advice, 
advising anybody to do wrong, or to 
perform any act other than a good 
act. The constant burden of the 
teaching that I have listened to, all 
my life, from my earliest recollec- 
tions, from the servants of the Lord, 
has been : Serve God and keep His 
commandments ; live lives of virtue ; 
be honest ; be sober ; be loyal ; be 
patriotic ; serve God, and serve your 
country ; be good ; be kind ; be char- 
itable ; be longsuffering. I do re- 
joice exceedingly in knowing that 
each and every one of the leading 



officials of the Church of Christ, 
from my earliest recollection to the 
present day, have labored, and la- 
bored unceasingly, for the benefit 
and the uplifting of the people. 

One of the great testimonies, to 
me, of the divinity of the work in 
which you and I are engaged is the 
fact that those who have turned 
away from the truth, without one 
single, solitary exception that I can 
recall, have done so because they 
have failed to keep the command- 
ments of God. To me it is little less 
than marvelous that no faithful man 
or woman, within my recollection, 
has ever lost the faith of the gospel. 
Only those who have neglected to 
serve God, only those that have not 
kept the light of the Holy Spirit 
burning within their hearts, by 
obeying the commandments of the 
living God, they are the only ones 
who have lost the faith and turned 
away. This gospel of Jesus Christ 
has been proclaimed all over the 
world, and from the day the Church 
was organized, not one single, soli- 
tary missionary, who was diligent 
and true in serving God, has ever 
lost the faith ; and no missionary has 
come home with increased light and 
knowledge to tell us tnat the gospel 
is wrong, or that he has discovered 
the truth in some foreign land. But 
they have come home with increased 
faith, with increased knowledge, 
with greater love for the work of 
God than they had when they went 
away. I rejoice in these things. I 
rejoice that in all the travelings of 
all the elders, wherever they go, in 
every land and clime, they are con- 
stantly gaining increased testimo- 
nies, and evidences, and knowledge 
regarding the divinity of the work in 
which we are engaged ; and this is as 
it should be. I regret, however, that 
there should be any of the Latter- 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



day Saints, that is, any of the pro- 
duct from the homes of the Latter- 
day Saints, who should go out into 
the world and become the enemies 
of this people. I regret that some 
of the sons and daughters of faith- 
ful men and women in the Church 
should turn away from the truth 
and should become the enemies of 
the people and be numbered among 
those who malign, and belie, and 
villify the leaders of the Church and 
the people generally; but I am 
thankful that those who do this al- 
most without an exception have 
made a record for wickedness, for 
corruption, for licentiousness. I 
thank God that by their fruits ye 
shall know them, and that the fruits 
of all those who have turned away 
from the gospel and are fighting 
against it today are unworthy. I 
confess freely and frankly that it 
would stagger me and the reason- 
ing faculties with which God has 
endowed me, if I should discover 
that as men and women grew in 
good deeds, as they grew in vir- 
tue, as they grew in the love of their 
fellows, as they grew in ability to 
serve God, they lost the faith of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ ; but I have 
never discovered one such indivi- 
dual. 

I remember purchasing a North 
American Review, some years ago, 
on the train or at the depot in San 
Francisco, and I found in that 
North American Review a very vic- 
ious attack upon the Latter-day 
Saints, by a grandson of the proph- 
et Brigham Young. This man ac- 
cused Brigham Young and the 
Mormon people of disloyalty to the 
Government of the United States. 
From my earliest recollection, at 
my mother's knee, I have been 
taught by her, and in public and in 



private, by all those with whom I 
have ever mingled, loyalty to this 
country! At the very time that 
this young mari wrote his article at- 
tacking the "Mormon" people as 
being disloyal — this young man 
had been recreant to his faith — his 
own half-brother, a man loyal to 
his faith, true to God and the re- 
ligion of his grandfather, was com- 
manding the Utah batteries in the 
Philippines. "By their fruits ye 
shall know them ;" and the fruits 
of the young Latter-day Saints 
have ever been the fruits of loyalty 
to our country. Today we are be- 
ing attacked by a son of one of the 
late presidency of the Church, than 
whom no young man in all Israel 
has made a more unsavory record ; 
no young man in all Israel has been 
more guilty of bringing sorrow 
and pain and humiliation to his 
parents ; no young man has been 
more guilty of lying about the ser- 
vants of God than this same man 
who today is publishing attacks up- 
on the Latter-day Saints. "By their 
fruits ye shall know them." I re- 
joice that the wicked and the cor- 
rupt have no part with us. When 
I read such articles against us, I 
rejoice in knowing that they are 
false. The truth hurts, but false- 
hood never. "A lie lives only until 
it is found out;" but truth lives 
and survives; it will live forever, 
and it is bound to triumph. I re- 
joice in knowing that one of the 
most honest, one of the most God- 
fearing, one of the most humble, 
one of the most diligent of all the 
men whom I have ever known in 
the Church was the late Karl G. 
Maeser, ,and a vile, wicked: and 
corrupt article, written against the 
Latter-day Saints, was the cause 
of his "investigating the truth, it 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



23 



has been said that nothing can be 
done against us but what shall be for 
us — nothing against the truth but 
what shall redound for the benefit 
of the truth. When Brother 
Maeser read this article — that the 
"Mormon" people were industrious, 
that they were frugal, that they 
took care of their poor, better than 
any other people, that they were 
honest and temperate, and yet that 
they were wicked and vile and cor- 
rupt — "why," he said, "the man 
who wrote this article is a liar." 
The article gave the address where 
missionary work was being carried 
on in Scandinavia, and he wrote at 
once and received information 
which eventually led to his investi- 
gating and embracing the Gospel. 

I maintain that no man can re- 
flect upon what has been read to us 
here today, unless his head needs 
fixing, and not be able to see a refu- 
tation of the charges made against 
the Latter-day Saints. The great 
life insurance companies of Amer- 
ica, the greatest in all the world, 
being mutual companies, having no 
anxiety to make money for the 
stockholders, as they have none, 
and they will not insure a man's life 
unless he is up to a certain standard 
of health — they would not have me 
until after I was over forty years 
of age ; they thought I was going 
to die, and would not take my mon- 
ey — but with all their selection of 
risks who come up to their standard, 
they have ten and a fraction who die 
to the thousand. With the lame, 
the halt, the sick, and all kinds 
among the Latter-day Saints, we 
have nine and a fraction. What a 
wonderful refutation that our peo- 
ple are vile ! Do a corrupt people 
live long? No, they do not. Are 
they healthy? No, they are not. 



And in the divorces — five times as 
many divorces in the United States, 
on an average, as among the Latter- 
day Saints ; and the crying evil, to- 
day, in this country, is the breaking 
up of families, a lack of fidelity, 
men not being true to wives and 
children. Another great crying evil 
is the destroying of life, and the 
failure to have families. We lead 
them all, multiply them time and 
time again, by the number of chil- 
dren who are born among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. In all the vital sta- 
tistics that go to make for good, we 
stand at the head. Years ago, when 
we were eighty-five per cent of the 
population of Utah, we had less 
than fifteen per cent of the crim- 
inals ; and the remaining fifteen per 
cent of the population furnished 
the eighty-five per cent of the crim- 
inals. When it comes to insanity, 
we have, less of insanity. When it 
comes to sobriety, we have more of 
sobriety. When it comes to drunk- 
enness, we have less of drunken- 
ness. And so in all the vital statis- 
tics that go to make for good, we 
are not afraid to compare with the 
whole world. Let us remember that 
the fruits of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ speak for themselves in the 
lives of the Latter-day Saints ; but 
let us, each and every one, make up 
our minds that we are going to im- 
prove our already splendid record. 

I rejoice in the key note that 
has been sounded here that, under 
the law which has been enacted, we 
can and should do away with the 
saloon in every community where 
the Latter-day Saints are in the ma- 
jority. I read a few verses today 
along this line. When I read a 
thing that strikes me, I write it 
down, or if it is in a newspaper, I 
cut it out. I read something about 



24

a saloon, and I will read it to you: 

THE SALOON BAR. 

"A bar to heaven, a door to hell — 
Whoever named it, named it well! 
A bar to manliness and wealth, 
A door to want and broken health; 
A bar to honor, pride and fame, 
A door to sin and grief and shame; 
A bar to hope, a bar to prayer, 
A door to darkness and despair; 
A bar to honored, useful life, 
A door to brawling, senseless strife ; 
A bar to all that's true and brave, 
A door to every drunkard's grave; 
A bar to joy that home imparts, 
A door to tears and aching hearts; 
A bar to heaven, a door to hell — 
Whoever named it, named it well!" 

I recommend that you expel this 
door to hell from your communities. 
You have the ability to do it ; and if 
you do not do it, it will be your own 
fault. If, in years to come, the 
tears and the dishonor and the 
shame that are depicted in this little 
piece of poetry, come into your 
own home by the lives of your 
own children, a part of the sin will 
fall upon your own heads. We 
find recorded in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, that it shall be the duty 
of parents in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes that are organized, to teach 
their children faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that they are to teach 
them to pray and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord, and that they are 
to repent and be baptized before 
they are eight years of age. If the 
parents do not do this, the sin shall 
be upon the heads of the parents. 
Now, teaching by precept, without 
example, is mighty poor teaching. 
The apostle James is one of my fa- 
vorites ; he says : How much does 
it profit a man to say to the man 
who is hungry, Be thou fed, with- 
out giving him any food? Nothing 
at all. How much does it profit us 
to teach our children to serve God 
and to keep His commandments, 



and yet to put temptation in the way 
of our children. We have the pow- 
er, so we are told in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, wherein we are 
agents unto ourselves, and that we 
should bring to pass much right- 
eousness of our own free will and 
accord. Now, I would have liked, 
very much, during the last year or 
so, to have made a whole lot of 
speeches in favor of prohibition ; but 
do you know that the disease of 
politics is of such a character that 
a man can't open his mouth, in the 
presence of some people, but what 
he is misunderstood, and they think 
lie is preaching politics. Politics, 
as I have often said, are a great deal 
like the measles : The measles don't 
hurt very much, if you will take 
some saffron tea and keep them on 
the surface ; but if they once set in 
they turn your hide yellow and you 
can't see straight. (Laughter). And 
politics have more or less of the 
same effect. Let us keep politics on 
the surface, so far as any reforma- 
tion is concerned, anything for the 
benefit of the people, for the ad- 
vancement of the people, to help 
them to better serve God. We 
should not let politics interfere with 
anything of this kind. 

Now, another thing, I maintain 
that we have been very careless 
about sustaining and upholding law 
for the benefit of the general health 
of the people. There is a lack of 
interest, on the part of the people, 
in observing sanitary regulations. 
Let us improve in this regard. I 
took quite a lively interest in this 
question recently, and by request 
spoke once at a tuberculosis exhibit. 
The result was that I was asked to 
speak again and again, which' I did, 
and finally I was asked to contribute 
mv money and become a member 
of the association, which I did, be-

cause one good turn, they say, de- 
serves another, (laughter) and you 
have to keep it up. I was astonished 
to find the lack of interest, a lack 
on the part of the people in heing 
interested in a thing of this kind, 
something for the general benefit. I 
was astonished to find that we could 
spend any amount of money legally 
for schools, for roads, for bridges, 
for public improvements, but we 
could not spend a dollar from the 
county funds to aid educationally, 
for the benefit of the people's health. 
I read of one good lady up in Da- 
kota who said, if one of her hogs 
was sick, or if anything was the 
matter with any of the fruits, or 
flowers, or vegetables and garden 
truck, if there were troublesome in- 
sects or anything of that nature, all 
she had to do was to send down to 
Washington, and the Agricultural 
Department would supply her with 
information how to cure the hog or 
protect the plants in her garden. 
But, if her husband, her son or her 
daughter was sick, and she should 
write to the Government, she could 
not get any information or help. 
Moral: Be a hog, and the Gov- 
ernment will take care of you, if 
you get sick. (Laughter). I hope 
we may be able to develop a better 
public sentiment for the improve- 
ment of the health of the people. I 
hope the people will think enough of 
the health of their fellows to quit 
expectorating all over the side- 
walks. There has been a law against 
this for years, and yet some of the 
people pay no attention to it. 

Let us seek to better our condi- 
tion — intellectually, physically, mor- 
ally, and above all let us seek for the 
inspiration of Almighty God to 
guide us in all the walks of life, I 
ask it, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELD EE HYETJM M. SMITH. 

President Joseph F. Smith's life book 
opened, revealing a life of right- 
eousness. — Love of God, of coun- 
try and mankind, sustained by pre- 
cept and example. — Participation in 
Temple ordinances increases pa- 
triotism and all virtues. — Marriage 
contract for time and eternity. 

Many of the things that have al- 
ready been spoken have been pass- 
ing through my mind, and if I shall 
repeat some of them I trust the 
congregation will charge it to the 
spirit that seems to pervade the 
conference. This morning, in the 
address of President Smith, in re- 
ferring to the presidency, he re- 
frained from saying much about 
themselves. He declared that their 
lives were as an open book to the 
people ; that we were familiar with 
them and their lives ; and hence he 
felt it not necessary to make any 
special remarks concerning them- 
selves and their labors. However, 
I should like, for a few moments 
this afternoon, to read a few pages 
from the book of the life of the 
President of the Church, inasmuch 
as I am more or less familiar with 
the contents thereof. My experi- 
ence in connection with him, of 
course, covers the period of my 
own life, during, which time I have 
read, very extensively, the things 
contained in this book. We find 
therein written that he always has 
been very conscientious in the care 
and protection that he bestowed 
upon his wives and his children, 
and religiously endeavored to in- 
struct them in the ways of truth 
and righteousness. He has taught 
his children from their infancy to 
be truthful and honest, to be virtu- 
ous and chaste, to be kind and just, 
and merciful, to be temperate and 
sober, and obedient. He taught his 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sons to love their country, to love 
the United States government, to 
love America. They were told that 
it was a chosen and highly favored 
land, choice above all other lands. 
That it has been held In reserve by 
the Lord as a land that should be 
inhabited by a people who should 
love God, and fear Him, and keep 
His commandments. His sons and 
daughters were taught that the dis- 
covery of this country was the re- 
sult of the inspiration of God upon 
Columbus, and that the men who 
established the government were 
also servants of God, raised up and 
prepared and inspired to establish 
in this goodly land a government 
which should offer to the oppressed 
and the downtrodden of all the 
world a haven of refuge, where 
they might enjoy freedom and lib- 
erty, and also have the privilege of 
taking advantage of the unparal- 
leled resources and opportunities 
for prosperity, advancement, and 
education that this great republic 
held out to them. 

Now, I may reveal, perhaps, 
something that has not been intend- 
ed necessarily for the public. It is 
there recorded that he exemplified 
in a most wonderful degree, the 
principles of justice and impartial- 
ity among the members of his 
household — his wives and his chil- 
dren — so that it could not be dis- 
covered, that any one of them was 
held more dearly and more closely 
in his affections than any other. 
There was no favoritism, no injus- 
tice, no partiality shown ; but on 
the other hand, as near as it is pos- 
sible for man to execute judgment, 
and justice, and mercy, equitably, 
these things were so imparted to his 
family. He loved them all with a 
love akin to the love of God for 
His children. We have seen, upon 
more than one occasion, the presi- 



dent bowed and crushed in sorrow 
over the bier of one of his departed 
children. We have seen him weep as 
only a great and strong man can 
weep ; yet in the private instruction 
imparted to his sons and daughters 
he has told them that he would 
rather carry every one of them to 
the grave, in their purity and their 
innocence, than have one of them 
ever deny God, or turn away from 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ and de- 
part from the Church, as it has 
been established through Joseph 
Smith, the prophet. He has taught 
and so impressed it upon his sons 
and daughters that they knew he 
spoke the truth — that notwithstand- 
ing his great love for his children, 
he would rather bury them, or die 
a thousand deaths himself than to 
see them fall from virtue and chas- 
tity, or into drunkenness and im- 
morality. These things were taught 
at home to his children as they 
grew from infancy to youth, and 
from youth to manhood. 

We have also known him as a 
man of God, as a servant of the 
Lord, ministering among the peo- 
ple, in public. We have heard him 
on numberless occasions, and we 
have never found that he taught a 
different doctrine in public than 
that which he taught in private, but 
that the same principles of justice, 
mercy, righteousness, prayer, chas- 
tity, charity, and sobriety, loyalty 
and patriotism, were preached unto 
the Church. The pages that consti- 
tute the public part of that book, as- 
was said this morning, are open be- 
fore the people ; you know them ; 
you may read the contents and 
judge whether or not I speak the 
truth. Now, I have been through 
the temple ; I have received the 
blessings of the house of the Lord ; 
I have received, perhaps, all that 
may be imparted to members of the 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



27 



Church therein ; and I have never 
been taught anything that is in the 
least contrary to the instructions 
which I have received in private 
and in public from the President of 
the Church and from the servants 
of God, the elders called to preach 
the gospel. I have never taken an 
oath, nor made a covenant that is 
mimical to our country or its gov- 
ernment, nor have I ever been re- 
quired or even asked to do so. Is 
it not impossible to even think of a 
man teaching that this is a land of 
Zion, a choice land of God, reserved 
for a government that shall extend 
liberty and freedom unto all men, 
preserving their rights unto them; 
and teaching that his children 
should be loyal, should sustain the 
government and uphold it, and 
never upbraid nor rail against dig- 
nitaries who are selected and 
chosen to hold responsible and gov- 
erning positions, teaching his sons 
to lay down their lives, if need be, 
in defense of their country, and of 
their people, and of their govern- 
ment, just as they had been taught 
to lay down their lives, if need be, 
for virtue's or Christ's sake — I say 
it would be impossible to think of a 
man giving such instructions as 
these to his sons if he was himself 
disloyal and knew that at manhood 
and maturity they would be permit- 
ted to go into the house of God and 
there be required to take a cove- 
nant or oath that was treasonable to 
the government. Now, then, so far 
as that charge is concerned, let me 
again say what has often been said, 
and what every Latter-day Saint 
who has been in the house of God 
knows, that there is nothing there 
that requires any man to be disloyal 
in any degree to his country. But, 
. if it is possible for a man, born an 
American citizen, of parents them- 
selves American citizens, descended 



from an ancestry of loyal Ameri- 
cans who fought and bled in de- 
fense of the principles of liberty 
and freedom and right, to have his 
love for his country increased, then 
the obligations and covenants im- 
parted to him in the house of God 
would accomplish it. No man who 
goes into the house of the Lord in 
worthiness but that will come out 
again more loyal and patriotic to 
both God and his country, than he 
was before, also more willing and 
determined to sustain and uphold 
this government, which God has es- 
tablished, and to perpetuate it and 
its benign influences. 

Why, my brethren and sisters, 
you know these things as well as I 
know them ; and so far as the pres- 
ident of the Church is concerned, 
let me say that it is given to few 
men to more thoroughly and honor- 
ably exemplify, in their lives, these 
noble precepts which he and his as- 
sociates have been engaged in 
teaching, both in private and in 
public. 

Now, we say this to Latter-day 
Saints, who know it to be the truth, 
in the hope that it may go beyond 
the Latter-day Saints and find its 
way among strangers, who do not 
understand the truth, and who are 
misinformed. It may be like cast- 
ing pearls before swine ; the swine 
may trample them beneath their 
feet ; but the lustre of such jewels 
as these cannot be dimmed, they 
will be seen and discovered, gath- 
ered up and cherished by those who 
are seeking for the truth. They will 
be enlightened, and they will be im- 
pressed that the Latter-day Saints, 
as has been testified of them today, 
by President Lyman, Brother 
Grant, and others, are a good peo- 
ple. They are a good people, be- 
cause they have been taught to be a 
good people, because all the pre- 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cepts of the gospel are good, be- 
cause every principle of the gospel 
of Christ is a good principle. Every 
doctrine of the gospel and every 
precept imparted, in this Church, 
tend to exalt, and uplift, and enno- 
ble men and make them better, pur- 
er, and more righteous men and 
women, more devoted, and full of 
integrity, loyalty, and faithfulness 
both to God and to man. I know 
whereof I speak, concerning the 
President of the Church, because 
my life has been enwrapped with 
his to this moment ; I do not know 
any one who can better, perhaps, 
bear testimony of these truths than 
I, though it may be rather personal. 
And such a man as he has been, all 
Latter-day Saint men should be , 
and many Latter-day Saint men 
are. This is the kind of fathers and 
mothers the gospel teaches men and 
women to be. 

I rejoiced most wonderfully 
when those statistics were read con- 
cerning the fidelity, the unswerving 
loyalty and faithfulness on the part 
of wives to their husbands and hus- 
bands to their wives in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. The gospel requires men to 
be true to their wives ; as well as it 
requires women to be true to their 
husbands. The covenants we take 
in the house of God make an im- 
pression upon our hearts, as great 
as life itself, and more enduring 
than mortal life. Those joined in 
the holy bonds of matrimony, by 
the servants of God, clothed upon 
by the authority of the priesthood, 
are precious to each other. They 
must cherish and love and be true 
to one another as long as they live, 
because they are married for time 
and for all eternity. There can be 
no trivial thing allowed to come be- 
tween man and wife who are united 
in accordance with the principles 



and doctrines and ordinances of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Jealousy, human weaknesses, frail- 
ties, mistakes must be tolerated and 
borne with in love and patience. We 
are all subject more or less to these 
human frailties, and we expect that 
those given to each other in the 
holy bonds of matrimony will be 
tolerant, kind and long suffering. 
They know that they must not al- 
low little things to so grow that 
they bring about a separation and 
divorce and a severing of those 
bonds so sacredly entered into. No, 
we are not like the world; trifles 
can't separate men and women 
whom God joins together. Trifles 
often come between those joined to- 
gether by men and result in sep- 
aration and sorrow, because there is 
no virtue, or little, it seems, in the 
ceremonies thus enacted and en- 
tered into by the authority of man 
alone. With us it is different ; we 
are joined by the power and the au- 
thority of God, and we must en- 
dure. Thank God, men and women 
thus united, who are full of the 
principles of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ and the love of the truth, are 
willing to do their duty and fulfill 
the measure of their creation, to 
become fathers and mothers in 
Israel, with the hope and knowl- 
edge that in thus obeying God they 
are laying the foundations for their 
kingdoms and exaltations, in the 
presence of the eternal Father. 

I rejoice in the record we have 
thus made, and I pray that the Lord 
will give us strength and power to 
ever increase and make better our 
splendid record of fidelity and 
truthfulness, of sincerity and virtue, 
one to another, as husbands and 
wives, as fathers and mothers, as 
parents and children, and as a peo-- 
pie before the Lord and before our 
fellow men in the nation. God help

us to fulfill the mighty and glorious 
destiny that we have set set forth 
to accomplish, under His direction 
and inspiration, and all honor, and 
glory, and power, and dominion be 
unto God the Father, and Jesus 
Christ, the Son, forever and ever. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 



Let us all press on in the work of the 
Lord, 

That when life is o'er we may gain a 
reward ; 

In the fight for right let us wield a 

sword, 

The mighty sword of Truth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Melvin J. Ballard. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m. Friday, April 7th. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Friday, April 
7th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by- 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ben 
E. Rich. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Sins of omission as well as of commis- 
sion. — Two important points in Presi- 
dent Smith's opening address. — Mar- 
riage and divorce. — Eternal wedlock. 
Christ's teachings as to marriage in 
the resurrection. — Also as to Divorce. 
— The sealing and loosing power. — A 
spirited testimony. 

I am very thankful for the priv- 
ilege of meeting with the Latter- 
day Saints in general conference, 
once more. A person has to go away 
from home, I think, in order to fully 
enjoy the blessings of home on re- 
turning; and I think we will find 
that to be part of our history; if 
we are privileged to return home 
to our Father in heaven, and renew 
the associations which are to be had 
in His presence, we will enjoy them 



more than ever in consequence of 
our absence for a while on the face 
of this earth. I think, also, that one 
enjoys the blessings of health very 
much more because of occasionally 
receiving a reverse. The Lord has 
been very merciful to me in this re- 
gard, as well as in many others, for 
which I feel deeply grateful. But 
this morning, and for two or three 
days past, I have been suffering 
from a severe cold, which I hope to 
overcome and then to appreciate 
still more, if possible, the blessings 
of good health. I trust that during 
the time I occupy this morning I 
shall be inspired by the Holy Spirit, 
which has rested down so gener- 
ously upon our brethren who have 
addressed us already, and that I 
may be able to make myself heard, 
without difficulty, in this large con- 
gregation. This is a beautiful sight 
to look upon. To see so many of 
the sons and daughters of the living 
God, gathered in solemn convoca- 
tion, to worship the Lord, to sing 
His praises, to call upon His holy 
name, to receive instructions from 
those who are appointed to be min- 
isters of the Most High to the 
Saints and to all the world, is a great 
privilege which I hope all who are 
present appreciate and also the 
blessings of the beautiful weather 
we have. 

I have closely followed the re- 
marks that have been made to us 
while we have been in conference, 
and particularly the opening address 
by President Joseph F. Smith, in 
which he covered a large area of 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



31 



thought and of action, and present- 
ed to us in terse sentences, very 
pointedly, the conditions of the 
work of the Lord in the different 
parts of the earth. I found in them 
great cause for congratulation, to 
think that the work of the Lord is 
spreading and extending so widely, 
and that the faith of the Latter- 
day Saints is manifested in their 
good works. We expect that there 
will be some people, always, in the 
Church — until that which is perfect 
has come — who will not live up, 
fully, to the teachings of the Lord 
through His servants; and to the 
covenants and obligations which 
they are under to serve Him in all 
things. So we hear something on 
both sides — the good works that are 
being performed and the things that 
are omitted ; for there are sins of 
omission as well as sins of commis- 
sion. When the time comes that 
we shall give an account for our 
deeds while we were in mortal 
flesh, we will find that we shall reap 
the consequences of our actions, 
and also the effects that follow 
from neglect and from omission or 
failure to live up to the require- 
ments of the gospel. These things 
are brought to our attention when 
we assemble in conference, so that 
we may do better in the future than 
we have done in the past. There 
is always room for improvement. 
We hear that very frequently, and 
we realize it for a fact, in our ex- 
perience, when we look upon the 
past. We should be prepared for 
the future ; that is to say, we should 
be more diligent, if possible, than 
we have been, and not again neglect 
those things that we have left un- 
done. Our minds are called to those 
things that we have left undone, 
by the teachings of our brethren, 
and I hope that when we go away 



from this great assembly to our re- 
spective places of abode, we shall 
feel determined in our hearts to 
live according to the principles of 
eternal life which have been taught 
to us while we have been together, 
and to serve the Lord in all things. 

One subject touched upon by the 
president, in his remarks to us at 
the opening, was in relation to the 
marriage question. We learn from 
him that during the year 1910, in 
addition to the marriages performed 
in the temples of the Lord, in which 
that grand sealing ordinance is ad- 
ministered, by which men and wom- 
en are united together in holy matri- 
mony for time and all eternity, 
about eleven hundred unions had 
taken place outside of the temples, 
most of them, perhaps, performed 
by what is called a civil ceremony 
— according to the civil law. Now, 
while this is a matter to be regret- 
ted, to think that so many people 
who are members of the Church 
neglect their opportunities to re- 
ceive the highest blessings, and will 
be content with that which comes 
from a marriage for time only. We 
do not repudiate these ceremonies 
when they are administered by a 
person authorized by the law of the 
land to perform marriages. They 
are recognized in the Church for 
what they are ; they are civil con- 
tracts, when not solemnized by a 
man holding the priesthood of God ; 
but they are legal contracts, and the 
people who enter into them are 
bound by them — in honor and ac- 
cording to law. We understand 
that, or should understand it, and 
our friends who are not of us ought 
to know, that we recognize the or- 
dinances that are performed under 
the laws of the country, as binding 
according to what they are; that 
the civil marriage that is performed 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



by men holding civil authority is 
simply till death parts the pair. 
When death comes, that is the end 
of the contract, as we understand 
it ; and we understand it that way 
because the Lord has so revealed it. 

In a revelation contained in sec- 
tion 132 of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, we learn a little about the 
eternity of the marriage covenant. 
The Lord has revealed, that when a 
marriage is performed under the 
sealing ordinance which He has re- 
vealed, by persons who are appoint- 
ed and ordained and authorized to 
seal on earth and it shall be sealed 
in heaven, that a union of that kind 
will extend beyond the grave; and 
that when death parts the individ- 
uals, the marriage is not dissolved, 
but continues and goes on, and if 
the parties are fit for it, worthy of 
it, it will be continued forever, and 
of the increase of their posterity 
there will be no end. There is some- 
thing grand and glorious in this 
manifestation of light and intelli- 
gence from the Lord. When peo- 
ple have that real regard for each 
other which is true affection — I do 
not refer merely to that which is 
sometimes called love, and is merely 
passion — but when two souls, 
though perhaps not with "but a sin- 
gle thought," and two hearts which 
may not, perhaps incessantly "beat 
as one," are really united in spirit, 
loving each other, trusting each oth- 
er, having confidence in each other, 
having that admiration for each 
other which comes from true respect 
and from a recognition of virtue 
and honor and everything that is 
good and great, and having the de- 
sire and disposition to pass by the 
weaknesses of mortal flesh, of hu- 
man nature — those little failings 
that sometimes disturb the heart 
and the home, — I say when people 



are thus joined together in spirit, 
in addition to the sealing ordinance 
and ceremony which the lx>r& has 
instituted, there is something very 
hopeful, and encouraging and joy- 
ful in the thought that though death 
may part them, yet in the resurrec- 
tion from the dead they shall come 
forth and enjoy the fulness of the 
blessings of the family relation. In 
the resurrection, the man will be a 
man, and the woman will be a wom- 
an, with all the faculties and powers 
with which the sexes are endowed, 
both of spirit and of body, the body 
being restored to the spirit, and the 
spirit to the body. These being 
living souls, — like Adam and Eve 
when united in the garden of Eden 
before death came into the world- 
will go on, increasing in that affec- 
tion, and love, and admiration, in 
power, and in dominion, and in the 
blessings of the family relation. 
This will continue forever, and 
there will be no more partings, be- 
cause there will be no more death; 
sorrow and sighing will flee away, 
and happiness and joy will abound; 
and in the presence of God, the 
Father, and Christ, the Son, and 
holy beings of that order, they will 
associate in all things that are good, 
and great, and elevating, — and all 
eternity will be opened to them for 
exploration, and experience, and in- 
crease in that bliss that can only be 
had in an eternal state of existence. 
This is one of the glorious things 
revealed through the great prophet 
of the nineteenth century, of which 
the world was in ignorance, and on 
which the world, today, is in the 
dark. We should rejoice in the 
manifestations of the Lord in this 
as well as in a great many other 
respects. 

Now, in relation to this subject, 
I have heard some people, not only 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE.

in the world but even among the 
Latter-day Saints, making a query 
as to the correctness of this doctrine 
because of a few words spoken by 
the Savior, when He was consulted 
by the Sadducees in regard to a 
woman who had a husband, and he 
died, and under the Mosaic code the 
deceased man's brother had to take 
that woman for his wife. She had 
a long experience in the marriage 
relation, for it appears that con- 
secutively she had seven husbands. 
The Sadducees wanted to know 
what Jesus had to say in regard 
to this matter and, particularly, 
whose wife she would be in the res- 
urrection. I think perhaps I had 
better read a few verses on this sub- 
ject. You will find them in the 
22nd chapter of Matthew, also in 
the 20th chapter of Luke. When you 
have time, read both together, be- 
cause Luke uses a little different 
language from that which is em- 
ployed by Matthew, but the ideas 
are the same. I shall commence at 
the 23rd verse : 

"The same day came to him the Sad- 
ducees, which say that there is no res- 
urrection, and asked him, 

"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a 
man die, having no children, his broth- 
er shall marry his wife, and raise up 
seed unto his brother. 

"Now there were with us seven 
brethren: and the first, when he had 
married a wife, deceased, and having 
no issue, left his wife unto his brother: 
"Likewise the second also, and the 
third, unto the seventh. 

"And last of all the woman died 
also. 

"Therefore, in the resurrection, 
whose wife shall she be of the seven? 
for they all had her. 

"Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Ye do err, not knowing the scrip- 
tures, nor the power of God. 

"For in the resurrection they neither 
marry, nor are given in marriage, but 
are as the angels of God in heaven." 

Now, generally, when this matter 



is touched upon by persons who do 
not view the subject in the same 
light that we do, they simply quote 
this one verse : "For in the resur- 
rection, they neither marry nor are 
given in marriage, but are as the 
angels of God in heaven." In read- 
ing the scriptures, whether the Old 
Testament or the New Testament, 
in order to understand them prop- 
erly we should not take one isolat- 
ed text, but read it in conjunction 
with the context, then we get the 
meaning of the writer or speaker. 
The Sadducees came to Jesus, as 
the Pharisees also did occasionally, 
tempting Him and trying to get 
Him into a tangle in His sayings ; 
but they did not succeed; to use a 
modern popular expression, He gen- 
erally "came out on top." The Phar- 
isees, on this occasion, were very 
much elated when they found 
the Sadducees had been turned 
down, and they came and congrat- 
lated Jesus on His replies. Now, 
he was speaking of the class of 
people to whom the Sadducees 
referred. Under the law of 
Moses marriage for eternity was 
not celebrated, except at the ex- 
ceptional times when the Melchiz- 
edek priesthood was given to men on 
the earth, which we can read about 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, sec- 
tion 132. Therefore, the marriages 
under consideration were for time 
only, and those persons to whom 
Jesus Christ was referring, were, as 
we read in the 20th chapter of Luke, 
where the same subject is touched 
upon, "the children of this world," 
not the children of the kingdom. 

"The children of this world marry, 
and are given in marriage : But they 
which shall be accounted worthy to ob- 
tain that world, and the resurrection 
from the dead, neither marry, nor are 
given in marriage." 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ said further : "They are 
as the angels." What is the condi- 
tion of the angels? According to 
the revelation that I have briefly re- 
ferred to, they are those that are not 
worthy of that "far more and eter- 
nal, and exceeding weight of glory" 
that comes to those who obey the 
fulness of the gospel and receive 
the ordinances of the new and ever- 
lasting covenant, who are sealed for 
time and for all eternity on the 
earth, and their marriage is sealed 
in heaven. They, then, who are 
called "the angels," are "minister- 
ing spirits unto the heirs of salva- 
tion and exaltation." They are 
waiters upon those who are worthy 
of this "more exceeding weight of 
glory" — the exaltation that "contin- 
ues the seeds forever and ever, 
wherein the Father is glorified ;" so 
that those who only obtain the po- 
sition of the angels are not in the 
condition of those who obtain the 
greater blessing and exaltation. 
They come forth in the resurrection, 
according to that revelation to us, 
"in their saved condition, separately 
and singly ;" therefore, they are not 
numbered among the Gods, but 
among the angels, or those that min- 
ister unto and are messengers and 
servants of "the heirs of God and 
joint heirs with Jesus Christ." Now, 
you take these two chapters, that I 
refer to, together, and I think the 
matter will be made very clear to 
your minds. Jesus did not say, as 
some people imagine He did, that 
there is no marriage after the resur- 
rection. You can't find it anywhere. 
I do not say, this morning, that mar- 
riages are solemnized in the resur- 
rection state, but I do say that mar- 
riages can be performed on the 
earth by representatives of those 
who have passed away; and that 
these, being sealed by the holy spirit 



of promise, by him who is anointed, 
both for time and for all eternity, 
having the keys thereof, will stand 
good forever, and those for whom 
they are performed will receive the 
full benefits and blessings thereof. 
I say again that what I have read 
to you and what there is in other 
parts of the scripture, concerning 
this subject, do not convey the idea 
that there is no such thing as mar- 
rying and giving in marriage after 
the resurrection. All these affairs, 
of course, are in the hands of Him 
who knoweth all things. Thank 
God, there is one great Supreme 
Judge, and many things that may be 
done here on the earth, in the flesh, 
or left undone and neglected, can 
and will be supplied by the supreme 
judge of all, when necessity re- 
quires, and those who are worthy to 
enter into this great exaltation will 
find that a plan is prepared and that 
God, who is the Great Judge, will 
put all things right that may have 
been done wrong here on the earth. 
Many things may be performed here 
in ignorance, or with lack of experi- 
ence, but the Lord will make it all 
up, in the future, to those who are 
worthy of obtaining this great ex- 
altation. 

Now, I regret that there should 
be so many persons, eleven hundred 
persons, connected with the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, who have not been able or 
have neglected to obtain the bene- 
fits of this sealing ordinance. These 
grand Temples that have been erect- 
ed according to a divine pattern re- 
vealed from heaven, are for the 
benefit of this people. I am glad 
that we have four of them ; I hope 
the time will come, and I have no 
doubt of it, when many more will 
be erected in different parts of this 
glorious land of Joseph, and even 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



35 



in other lands; when necessity re- 
quires they will be erected for the 
performance of ordinances for the 
living and for the dead, that the 
great work of the Millennium may 
go on, and the way be prepared for 
God to come and dwell among His 
people, and "wipe away all tears 
from their eyes." I would exhort 
my brethren and sisters who have 
influence among the people, partic- 
ularly our brethren who are called 
to preside in the various wards and 
stakes of Zion, to instruct the Saints 
on these matters ; instruct the fath- 
ers and mothers as well as the 
young people upon the blessings 
and benefits of obtaining a proper 
ordinance of marriage, which is not 
merely till death parts them, but 
which will extend beyond the grave. 
This is an ordinance that will enter 
into the world behind the veil ; that 
will stand good and true before the 
Lord in the resurrection of the 
dead, when the man and the wom- 
an, separated by death, but who 
have been sealed by this sacred or- 
dinance, shall come together again 
and stand at the head of their pos- 
terity ; and all of their posterity who 
are worthy will enter into that 
grand patriarchal order of family 
government, and, as I have said, of 
the increase thereof there will be no 
end. 

The Lord told Abraham about 
this matter when He showed him 
the stars by the gift and power of 
God, by which he could discern 
things something like God does 
Himself. Abraham beheld the mul- 
tiplicity of worlds that the Father 
had created, as the Lord also 
showed Enoch. The Lord told 
Abraham that if he could count 
them, so he could count his seed; 
that his seed should be as numer- 
ous as the sands on the seashore, 



and as the stars of the heaven, for 
multitude. You cannot count them. 
The multiplicity of the posterity of 
those who enter into this grand or- 
der of family government, sealed 
on earth and sealed in heaven will 
go on forever, while the stars shine, 
while the throne of God endures ; 
while the glory of God, which is in- 
telligence, continues to scintillate 
and be manifested among the myri- 
ads and hosts that inhabit the eter- 
nal worlds. This opens up a sub- 
ject too broad and wide for me to 
enter into fully this morning; but 
I draw the attention of my breth- 
ren and sisters to this grand and 
solemn ordinance that God has in- 
stituted — the everlasting covenant; 
and those who have the opportu- 
nity to enter into it, and do not are 
under condemnation. A stronger 
term is used in the revelation — 
"then are they damned." Why? 
Because the end of their increase 
comes at death; their power and 
dominion at the head of a family 
ends when the grave yawns to re- 
ceive their mortal bodies. But those 
who obey these ordinances, in the 
spirit and power thereof, arise when 
the Lord shall call them; they will 
be "Christ's at His coming," and 
He will call their sleeping dust to 
life, and they will be joined to- 
gether, not only the spirit and the 
body be reunited, but the happy 
parents will come together again, 
as "Adam and Eve will stand at 
the head of a multitude, quickened 
and raised from the dead." Teach 
this to the Saints, and if they will 
not receive it, then they will have 
to suffer the consequences. 

Now, a few words in regard to a 
kindred subject, touched upon by 
President Smith; that is in regard 
to divorce ; for the questions of mar- 
riage and the question of divorce, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



particularly in these latter days, 
have to be viewed together. The 
president expressed his feelings that 
he had no objection if the Congress 
of the United States desire to take 
up this matter, but that they should 
legislate upon the whole question of 
marriage, forbidding plural mar- 
riage, if they wish to do so, estab- 
lishing what shall be a legal mar- 
riage, if they desire, and showing 
in what manner that civil mar- 
riage can be dissolved by compe- 
tent divorce. Now, what I wish to 
draw attention to, particularly, is 
this : There is an idea prevalent in 
the Christian world, and it obtains 
to some extent among us, that the 
Savior of mankind declared 
there could not be a proper divorce, 
except for one great sin. On that 
matter we must read the context as 
well as the text, in order to under- 
stand what he had to say concerning 
it. This time it was the Pharisees 
that came to Jesus Christ and asked 
Him a question. He made a reply, 
but his reply is only partly quoted, 
generally. Here is what is quoted: 
"And I say unto you, whosoever 
shall put away his wife, except it be 
for fornication, and shall marry an- 
other, committeth adultery: and 
whoso marrieth her which is put 
away doth commit adultery." That 
is taken in an isolated way and es- 
tablished as a rule — not that the 
Christian world carry it out, by any 
means ; but they point to it, and the 
great preachers of the times, in the 
various Protestant churches as well 
as in the Catholic church, hold to it 
as a principle — that a man or wom- 
an cannot be divorced properly, ex- 
cept for that one offense. Now, did 
Jesus say that? No, He did not. 
Here is what He said, as I will read 
to you: 

"The Pharisees also came unto him, 



tempting him, and saying unto him, Is 
it lawful for a man to put away his 
wife for every cause? 

"And he answered and said unto 
them, Have ye not read, that He which 
made them at the beginning made 
them male and female, 

"And said, For this cause shall a 
man leave father and mother, and shall 
cleave to his wife: and they twain shall 
be one flesh? 

"Wherefore they are no more twain, 
but one flesh. What therefore God 
hath joined together, let not man put 
asunder. 

"They sav unto him, Why did Moses 
then command to give a writing of 
divorcement, and to put her awav? 

"He saith unto them, Moses, be- 
cause of the hardness of your hearts, 
suffered you to put away your wives: 
but from the beginning it was not so." 

Then He goes on with the words 
I have read to you, referring to the 
arbitrary rule which you can read 
in Deuteronomy twenty-fourth, in 
regard to putting away a wife. 
Moses said if a man married a wife, 
and he found some defilement in 
her, he could give her a writing and 
tell her to get out, give her a bill 
of divorcement and tell her to go 
away. That is what they were talk- 
ing about, and Jesus Christ did not 
believe in that kind of thing; and, 
therefore, He said a man could not 
put away his wife except for one 
cause. That is not a question on 
the principle of divorce, when the 
decision is given by a civil or ec- 
clesiastical tribunal. Jesus Christ 
did not say that a woman should be 
compelled to live with a man who 
is a brute, filled with all kinds of 
filthiness, who injures her and beats 
her ; or, if he does not use a club 
beats her in spirit till she is sore 
and wounded and distressed, and it 
is a misery for her to live with such 
a being. He did not say it was 
wrong that she should get a divorce ; 
He did not say that if she married 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



37 



a man who was vile, and drunken, 
and corrupt, a disgrace to humani- 
ty, that she should be compelled to 
live with him. Nothing of the kind. 
I might go on and describe condi- 
tions that exist in many married 
families, but I do not want to take 
up the time ; I merely want to call 
your attention to this fact, that in 
these passages which are so fre- 
quently quoted, Jesus Christ did not 
lay down any rule by which divorces 
should be obtained either in an ec- 
clesiastical court or a civil court; 
He was talking to the question that 
was propounded to him, which was, 
Is it lawful for a man to put away 
his wife "for every cause," as under 
the law of Moses, giving her a bill 
of divorcement and telling her to go 
away; and He pronounced against 
that. 

Under the law of God a man and 
woman should be joined together 
for all eternity, she to be bone of 
his bone, and flesh of his flesh, spir- 
it answering to spirit, soul to soul, 
joined together with an eternal 
bond, to exist in life, in death, in 
the resurrection, and throughout the 
countless ages of eternity; this was 
the union at "the beginning;" that 
is the right kind of marriage, and 
the marriage that we Latter-day 
Saints should support and sustain 
and teach to our children, that they 
may enter into it prepared to gain 
the benefits thereof. But the power 
that can seal can unseal ; the power 
that can bind can loose, according 
to the eternal principles of right, 
and that power has been in the 
Church of Jesus Christ whenever 
it has been established. These 
things can be regulated in the 
Church under proper rules and reg- 
ulations according to justice, mercy, 
equity, and truth. But in the quota- 
tion I have read, Christ was talking 



about the old Mosaic practice of a 
man putting away his wife, simply 
by giving her a bill of divorcement, 
he being the judge and the executor 
of his own decree. Christ taught a 
better law, and, thank the Lord, it 
has been revealed anew in the days 
in which we live. We have it writ- 
ten in the book of the Lord, in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, which we 
can read at our leisure. 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
thankful that I am connected with 
a Church in which the word of the 
Lord is declared, in which the coun- 
sels of God are made manifest, in 
which everlasting covenants can be 
entered into and sealed for time and 
for all eternity, which shall not be 
disrupted at death but shall be con- 
tinued forever and ever, for the 
glory of God and the joy of His 
people. I bear my testimony to you, 
this morning, that I know this work 
is God's work. I know that He 
lives, that he is our Father, the 
Father of our spirits ; that our spir- 
its are, in form, like unto Him, and 
our bodies have been made to con- 
form to the spirit, under the laws of 
generation that God has established, 
to which there was no beginning, 
and of which there shall be no end. 
We have not sprung from the lower 
orders of creation ; we are the sons 
and the daughters of the living God. 
I bear testimony that Jesus of Naz- 
areth was the Christ and is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God, 
in body and in spirit; that He is 
our Redeemer, and that by obedi- 
ence to His laws and command- 
ments we shall go on through all 
eternity increasing in light, and 
knowledge, and bliss, and power, 
and dominion. I pray God to bless 
this congregation. I bear testimony 
that we are led today by the living 
oracles. The man who stands at 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the head succeeds to all the keys and 
powers and authorities revealed 
from God, through men who lived 
on the earth in the past, who re- 
stored their keys to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. Every key and power 
restored by that means is held in 
the Church and vested in the man 
who now stands at the head. I bear 
testimony to his integrity, and his 
honor, and his truth, and his de- 
votion to that which is good, which 
I have learned through long exper- 
ience and acquaintance. I hold him 
up in my faith, in my prayers, in 
my acts and works, and I am glad 
to know that the great bulk of the 
Latter-day Saints do the same. God 
bless him and preserve him, that 
he may stand at our head for 
many years. God bless this 
work, that it may go forth to 
victory in every land and clime. 
I know that the efforts which are 
now being made to retard its pro- 
gress will hasten it onward, will op- 
en the way by which thousands will 
be brought to investigate and come 
to a knowledge of the truth. The 
work of God shall prevail ; evil shall 
be overcome ; darkness shall be dis- 
persed; and the rule and govern- 
ment and dominion of the Almighty 
shall be established from the rivers 
to the ends of the earth. God help 
us to be faithful and true in all 
things, to understand the truth as it 
is before Him, and walk in the light 
thereof, to do those things that we 
should do, and to leave undone those 
things that we ought not to do, to 
have no sins of omission any more 
than of commission; that we may 
gain the great exaltation in the pres- 
ence of God our Father, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The popular hymn, "School thy 
feelings, O my brother," written by 



Elder Charles W. Penrose, was 
sung by Elder Horace S. Ensign, to 
appropriate music recently com- 
posed by Prof. George Careless. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, if the 
Lord will condescend to favor me 
with His Holy Spirit, I shall en- 
deavor to address you, for a few 
moments, in response to the instruc- 
tion of our beloved president. 

My soul has feasted upon the 
good things we have heard during 
this conference. The great thought 
that has been borne home to my 
soul is this, that not only do we de- 
sire the friendship of all good men 
and women, but it is the desire of 
our hearts to be friends to all man- 
kind. Paul says that unto the am- 
bassadors of Christ is committed 
the gospel, or the ministry of recon- 
ciliation. Men are reconciled to 
God and to principles of righteous- 
ness by obeying the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. We do desire 
and work, with our hearts and with 
our hands, to this end, that all men 
may come to a knowledge of the 
principles of the gospel and to the 
truth of the glorious fact that Jesus 
is the Christ. 

There is no better friend to hu- 
manity than the president of this 
Church. There are no better friends 
to all the people of the world than 
the authorities of this Church ; from 
the general authorities to the stake 
authorities and to the ward author- 
ities, all are the friends of mankind, 
and they are working day and night 
to bring to pass the salvation of the 
sons and daughters of God. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



39 



There is no way that men and 
women can be reconciled unto the 
Lord, except by obedience to the 
principles of the gospel, that teach 
men and women to have faith in 
God. In this age of unbelief and 
skepticism, we are pleading with 
the children of our Father to be- 
lieve in the Lord, to have faith in 
Him. The friendships of the 
world shall perish and pass away, 
but the love of God will live for- 
ever. We are told in holy writ that 
the man who puts his trust in the 
arm of flesh shall be cursed. You 
remember reading of the noted Car- 
dinal Wolsey who lived to please his 
king. He enjoyed the favors of 
that mighty monarch for a time ; 
but the smile of the prince changed 
to a frown, and he dismissed Wol- 
sey from his presence. Wolsey, 
when he went into exile, uttered 
these memorable and pathetic 
words : "Had I but served my God 
as faithfully as I have served my 
prince, he would not have deserted 
me in my old age." 

We believe that men should re- 
pent of their sins and come unto 
God. Men and women should take 
upon themselves the yoke of 
Christ, for His yoke is easy, and 
His burden is light ; but the burden 
of the transgressor, the man who 
dissipates, of him who elects to 
serve Satan is grievous to be borne, 
and he goes down a slave to sin and 
a victim to those passions and ap- 
petites for gratification of which he 
has sold his birthright. It is not 
good business to sell our birthright 
for a mess of pottage. Thank God 
that in this day He has ordained 
a means for us to obtain a forgive- 
ness of our sins. Those who enter 
the Church by baptism, who take 
upon themselves the name of Christ 
by being baptized, come up out of 



the water, their faces glowing with 
happiness, and they testify that God 
has forgiven their sins, having been 
baptized by one holding authority. 
After baptism they receive the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, by ffle laying on 
of hands, and they walk in the fear 
of the Lord and, "In the comfort 
of the Holy Ghost." We are com- 
forted by the Holy Ghost, because 
we are established in a knowledge 
of the truth, and we need not to be 
taught by, nor accept the vagaries 
of men. In this day and dispensa- 
tion men have been raised up who 
can say, by the power of God, "Thus 
saith the Lord." We are told by the 
Psalmist that "the law of the Lord 
is perfect, converting the soul : the 
testimony of the Lord is sure, mak- 
ing wise the simple." So in this 
intelligence, walking in this com- 
fort, what care we for what the 
world say about us ? What need we 
care for the slanders that are ut- 
tered against our leaders? We 
know and God knows that these ac- 
cusations are false. Some day the 
world will learn that they are false, 
and will give these traducers the 
treatment they deserve for the scorn 
and ridicule they have heaped upon 
us, they will surely receive the treat- 
ment that their untruthful utter- 
ances deserve. 

I thank God that when we are 
in the line of our duty we are serv- 
ing Him, and that we truly are 
friends to all mankind. I am proud 
of the body of noble men who lead 
this Church. They are men who, in 
the various professions would make 
brilliant, and successful careers, but 
they are wearing out their splendid 
lives and using their talents to serve 
the Church and people of God, and 
thus are serving the Lord Himself. 

The liberty of the gospel gives us 
a larger conception of the liberty 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we enjoy under this great govern- 
ment. We stand alone among all 
the churches in teaching that the 
Constitution of the United States is 
a divinely inspired instrument, that 
God raised up those self-sacrificing 
and heroic revolutionary fathers to 
struggle for, and to achieve that 
measure of freedom to which the 
children of men were entitled. 
Again, in preaching what is con- 
tained in the Book of Mormon we 
are declaring and affirming that 
America is choice above all other 
lands, that it is a land given to the 
seed of Joseph, by our Father in 
heaven. Right here is evidenced the 
broadness and liberality of our be- 
lief, respecting the rights and priv- 
ileges that may be enjoyed bv the 
people dwelling on this hemisphere. 
Though this land was given to the 
seed of Joseph, though it was re- 
served by the Almighty especially 
for those to whom it was promised, 
yet the Book of Mormon tells us 
that the Gentiles, if they repent and 
believe in Jesus Christ the God of 
Israel, shall share in that inherit- 
ance, share this glorious land with 
the children of Joseph, and receive 
the blessings of this land, which is 
choice above all other lands on the 
face of the earth. This splendid 
promise in the Book of Mormon is 
in harmony with, and like unto a 
similar and equally splendid prom- 
ise contained in the Bible, concern- 
ing the Gentiles on the eastern hem- 
isphere. The Apostle Paul de- 
clared that all those who had faith 
should be called the seed of Abra- 
ham, that they should rejoice, and 
enjoy the blessings of Abraham. So 
upon this land, the Gentiles, if they 
repent and come unto the Lord, will 
be numbered among the remnant of 
Jacob, and they will share in the 
blessings and joys that await the 



descendants of Joseph, the patriarch 
of old. 

I rejoice in the completeness of 
this gospel, it is the same gospel 
that was taught by Jesus and the 
apostles, many centuries ago. Can 
a people who believe in the Book of 
Mormon be disloyal ? Can a people 
be disloyal who sincerely teach and 
preach from this book that no kings 
shall be raised up unto the Gentiles 
on this land? No, it is impossible, 
impossible ; we are loyal, and true. 
We believe in the glorious destiny 
of this great republic ; we believe 
that its principles shall extend to the 
uttermost parts of the earth, that 
the shackles of bondage, and serf- 
dom of all kinds, shall be stricken 
from the limbs and consciences of 
mankind, until the children of men 
everywhere shall stand forth in the 
enjoyment of that full measure of 
political and religious freedom 
which God the Father designed that 
they should have. This we are pro- 
claiming to the world. 

We say to all people : Believe in 
God, believe in Jesus Christ, the 
God of the whole earth, and you 
shall share these blessings. Is this 
wrong doctrine? For which of these 
good works does the world stone 
us? Is it disloyal to preach faith 
in Jesus Christ? Is it narrow to 
say to all the world, to all mankind, 
If you will repent of your sins and 
come unto the Lord, He will accept 
you as His children and you will 
enjoy the salvation that God has in 
store for all His sons and daugh- 
ters? I rejoice in this mighty re- 
public. If we believe in Jesus, if 
we follow His commandments, this 
nation, God has declared, shall be 
fortified against all other nations. 
If the people will but serve Him, 
no nation shall conquer this ; no 
nation, no two nations, or any num-

ber of nations, can ever prevail 
against this mighty republic if we 
ground our faith and works in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and honor 
Him as the Redeemer of the world. 
Standing on this faith' we can say : 

Then conquer we must, 
When our cause it is just, 

And this be our motto : 
"In God is our trust." 

And the Star Spangled Banner 
In triumph shall wave 

O'er the land of the free 
And the home of the brave. 

Amen. 

The choir and congregation 
standing, sang, with enthusiasm, 
two verses of the American patri- 
otic hymn, "The Star Spangled 
Banner."

Episcopal Bishop D. S. Tuttle's trib- 
ute to the "Mormons." — Personal 
testimony concerning integrity of 
Church authorities. — The Church 
should not be judged by actions of 
some wayward members. 

We have heard, during this con- 
ference, many testimonies and some 
statistics in evidence of the faithful- 
ness and the goodness of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I have another wit- 
ness and testimony to present to the 
Latter-day Saints, this morning, a 
clipping from this morning's paper. 
It is so refreshing to hear, from the 
lips of a minister of the gospel in 
the world, good words spoken of 
the Latter-day Saints, and especial- 
ly out in the world where it could 
not be charged they were for the 
ears of this people. I felt to appre- 
ciate this testimony and to read it 
in your presence : 



"Pays High Tribute to the Mormons 
They are Among Best People in 
America, 
"Says Episcopal Bishop Tuttle. 

"Special to the Herald Republican. 

New York, April 6, 1911.— Daniel 
Sylvester Tuttle, presiding bishop of 
the American Episcopal Church, 
preached today in Saint Clement's P. 
E. Church, before a large congrega- 
tion. The church's mission work was 
his text. In 1867, immediately after 
the Civil War, he said, I was sent by 
the Episcopal Church as a missionary 
to the Mormons in the state of Utah. 
I can say, without exaggeration, that 
the Mormons are among the heartiest 
and best people in America, and are 
known in the West as kind-hearted 
and pleasing in manners. In Utah I 
had a class of boys and girls which 
was instrumental in giving me the 
idea of how essential the youno- folks 
are in building up the church of the 
future." 

I desire to avail myself, my breth- 
ren and sisters, of this opportunity 
of bearing testimony to the truth of 
the things we have heard during 
the several sessions of this confer- 
ence. I know that they are true; 
and that they have been prompted 
by the Spirit of the Lord, and by 
that Spirit I know that they are true ; 
and I feel thankful that 'they have 
found a ready response in my soul. 
I would make the sentiments and 
truths expressed my sentiments on 
this occasion. I am sure there is 
conviction in the hearts of all those 
who heard the words of our be- 
loved president, in the opening ses- 
sion of this conference, for his 
words had no uncertain sound or 
meaning. There is no equivocation 
nor ambiguity either in the words 
spoken or in the spirit which actu- 
ated them. I rejoice that God has 
given to the Latter-day Saints a 
measure of His Holy Spirit by 
which, when we hear these things, 
we can determine and know wheth-

er they are of God or whether they 
are of man. 

I bear my testimony to the faith- 
fulness and devotion of the author- 
ities of the Church, and of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints — during the past five 
years, I have been very intimately 
and closely associated with the First 
Presidency and the Twelve. Every 
week, when I have been within 
reach, I have attended, with them, 
solemn meetings of prayer and 
counsel for the welfare of the 
Church and of the Latter-day 
Saints, and I have been with these 
men in visiting the stakes of Zion. 
I have heard their testimonies, I 
know their lives, and I have been 
convinced, because of this more in- 
timate association, which I have had 
with these general authorities of the 
Church, during the past five years, 
that my judgment and conclusions 
formerly reached concerning them, 
and their integrity, were correct, 
that they are indeed righteous men 
of God, I do know that they are. 
Concerning our president, who is 
guardian of the means, the tithings 
of the Church, as trustee-in-trust, I 
know that he does guard the tith- 
ings of this people with a jealous 
care, jealous for the Church and 
for the Latter-day Saints. I know 
that he is not extravagant or un- 
wise in expending those means, and 
that he does not consent to their ex- 
penditure only when the recom- 
mendations therefor are indorsed by 
his brethren. I know him to be hon- 
est; I know him to be a pure man, 
a man who is perfectly trustworthy ; 
and I know that his counselors, and 
the twelve, and all these general au- 
thorities are men of the same kind ; 
that their hearts and souls are 
wrapped up in this work, that they 
seek the welfare of the kingdom of 
God and of His people, and the sal- 



vation of the souls of men, before 
everything else; they sacrifice all 
personal interests for the cause of 
truth. This is my testimony con- 
cerning these men. 

I rejoice in the testimony we have 
just heard, in the singing, and in 
the prayers. I am reminded, es- 
pecially, of the most excellent 
prayer offered this morning, and 
particularly that part of the prayer 
wherein our Father in heaven was 
petitioned to allow nothing to come 
between the Latter-day Saints and 
the authorities of the Church, to de- 
stroy their confidence. I see in this 
congregation, and have seen in the 
various congregations of the Saints, 
during this conference, representa- 
tives from our colonies in Mexico, 
from our stakes in Canada and the 
stakes in Arizona, the most remote 
stakes in the Church, and various 
other stakes throughout the Church. 
I would that all the Latter-day 
Saints could have been here, and 
could have heard and felt what we 
who have been privileged to be in 
attendance at these meetings have 
heard and felt, for I feel that their 
confidence in the authorities of the 
Church would have been strength- 
ened thereby. I feel that that is 
what is needed today, since enemies 
are assailing the leaders of the 
Church and would make the people 
of the world, including Latter-day 
Saints, believe that our leaders are 
insincere, that they are immoral, 
that they are everything but what 
the Saints believe and really know 
them to be. To hear the voices and 
feel the spirits of these men, I be- 
lieve, is convincing to the Latter- 
day Saints, although it may not be 
to those of the world who are not in 
possession of the Holy Ghost, not 
having yielded obedience unto the 
principles and ordinances of the 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



43 



gospel that would entitle them to 
that most choice gift. 

In considering the statistics, yes- 
terday, I thought of the devotion of 
the Latter-day Saints in the pay- 
ment of their tithings and offerings. 
With the proceeds, the tithings of 
the people, we heard what is being 
accomplished in the Church — not so 
much in detail what is being accom- 
plished in the mission field, or in the 
Church schools in Zion, but what 
has been expended from the tith- 
ings of the people in the legitimate 
enterprises and avenues in which the 
tithings are directed. But the 
thought was this, in my mind — who 
provides and supplies these means? 
Why, these humble Latter-day 
Saints. Though there are some 
who are in very humble circum- 
stances, I trust there are none really 
poor, or none who are suffering 
among us ; there ought not to be ; 
and we would charge the bishops of 
the wards that they see to it that 
there shall be none in want of the 
necessaries of life. Every man and 
woman, every individual who has 
contributed, who has paid a full 
tithing, has done his full quota in 
the great work of establishing and 
maintaining the Church schools, so 
far as the tithings of the people go 
in that direction. The same may 
be said with regard to the mission- 
ary work, and the maintaining of 
the poor, or for charitable purposes. 
The Lord will remember His people 
for their faithfulness, and will abun- 
dantly reward them with the things 
pertaining to this life and eternity. 
I admonish the Latter-day Saints to 
not tire but to continue on and on, 
and see to it that when we give our 
tithings that we give them ungrudg- 
ingly ; that when we give our offer- 
ings our hearts go out therewith, 
that it may' be counted unto us for 



righteousness, and that we may re- 
ceive a blessing from the Lord. 

Now, I feel to say that we are a 
good people, but we are not perfect 
Latter-day Saints ; and, until we at- 
tain perfection, we should continue 
to labor and strive to. overcome our 
imperfections, our weaknesses, and 
work the works of righteousness. 
There are some enrolled in the 
Church who are in such a condition, 
I am sorry to say, that were they 
outside of the Church they could not 
be admitted. The Lord has desig- 
nated some of the qualifications 
which men and women should pos- 
sess in order to become members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and here are some 
of those qualifications. 

"And again, by way of command- 
ment to the church, concerning the 
manner of baptism of those who hum- 
ble themselves before God and desire 
to be baptized, and come forth with 
broken hearts and contrite spirits, and 
witness before the church that they 
have truly repented of all their sins, 
and are willing to take upon them 
the name of Jesus Christ, have a de- 
termination to serve Him to the end, 
and truly manifest by their works that 
they have received of the spirit of 
Christ unto the remission of their 
sins, shall be received by baptism into 
the church." 

And I may say, and no others. 

There are some whose actions are 
such that we are convinced they 
do not possess the spirit of repent- 
ance, they have not broken hearts 
and contrite spirits before the 
Lord, and their conduct brings re- 
proach on the Church. We sorrow 
' at this condition, but what will you 
do? We are judged, as a people, 
largely, by the conduct of the ad- 
herents to this faith, and the doc- 
trines of the gospel ; so that no man 
claiming a standing in the Church 
is at liberty to disregard the com- 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mandments of the Lord, to be a 
drunkard, or to be immoral, or oth- 
erwise set a bad example. The lives 
of those who profess to be Saints 
should conform strictly to the pre- 
cepts of the gospel, should be in 
complete harmony therewith. When 
people see those whose lives are not 
in harmony and not commendable, 
I would have them know, whether 
they be in the Church or out, that it 
is due to the weaknesses and fallibil- 
ities of mortal men and women, and 
no action or conduct of any indi- 
vidual, however high he may be in 
authority, can affect the infallibil- 
ity of the Gospel, change the truth, 
or make the truth a falsehood, or 
render any ordinance of the gospel 
unnecessary. People ought not to 
reach wrong conclusions in judging 
the work of the Lord, and the peo- 
ple of the Lord, because of the un- 
righteous conduct of some indivi- 
duals. It may be asked, why do 
you retain them as members of the 
Church ? The only answer I have 
to make is this, Our mission is to 
save and not to destroy; and while 
they are members of the Church, 
we will labor for their reformation 
with a hope of bringing them, some- 
time, to repentance, and faithful- 
ness in serving the Lord. That is 
our mission. 

I want to say to the Latter-day 
Saints, if you would sustain the 
president of this Church and his 
counselors, and all these general 
authorities, and those who pre- 
side over you in the stakes and 
wards, and in the various or- 
ganizations of the Church, keep the 
commandments of the Lord and do 
your duties ; that will sustain them 
best and give those officers the 
greatest joy and satisfaction, as it 
brings joy and satisfaction to the 
Lord to see His children serving 



him faithfully. As the Lord has 
said in a revelation, His heart re- 
joices when one is brought to re- 
pentance. Now, since there is no 
salvation in sin, and no forgiveness 
of sins except through repentance, 
therefore repentance is in order for 
us all. According to the word of 
the Lord, through John, "all are 
sinners ;" of course, of different de- 
grees of gravity, some in the com- 
mission of sin in wrong acts, and 
some through neglect of duty, as we 
have been told here already, "for he 
that knows to do good, and doeth it 
not, to him it is sin." 

I desire to call attention to this 
truth, that while some of us have 
grown in the Church, have over- 
come traditions and faults which 
we had in the world, and have de- 
voted ourselves, in a measure, to 
the building up of the kingdom, 
since none of us are perfect there is 
room for advancement and pro- 
gress, and all should labor, regard- 
less of how high we have ascended 
the ladder towards perfection ; we 
should still continue to climb ; there 
is room for improvement for all. 
There are different sins, and there 
are different degrees of sin of the 
same kind. For instance, the word 
of the Lord has come to us that we 
must observe the Sabbath day, to 
keep it holy. Some men disregard 
this commandment to the extent 
that they go to their fields and work 
upon the Sabbath day; some attend 
horse races, or theatres, or pleas- 
ure resorts, etc., on the Sabbath 
day. Others have advanced so far 
towards perfection in righteousness 
that they cannot look upon such 
conduct with toleration ; it is sin 
and wickedness in their sight, and 
yet some of them, perhaps, will jus- 
tify themselves in going out for a 
carriage ride, or an automobile ride,

or perhaps remain at home on the 
Sabbath day, although the com- 
mandment is that we shall meet to- 
gether, partake of the sacrament 
and worship the Lord our God. 
Some justify themselves in sitting 
down in idleness throughout the 
Sabbath day. We have all an op- 
portunity to measure ourselves and 
see what we are, and how we com- 
pare with the standard given us by 
our great exemplar, the prototype 
to mankind, Jesus our Lord, and 
the doctrines which He taught. I 
exhort the Latter-day Saints to 
faithfulness, to be hearers of the 
word and doers also, and not hear- 
ers only, deceiving ourselves. 

Now, may the blessings of heav- 
en' rest upon you. I do feel the 
weight, the power and the blessing 
in the benediction pronounced by 
our beloved president, by virtue of 
his priesthood and authority, and 
in the name of Jesus Christ." I re- 
joice with you in it, and hope and 
pray that God will fulfill it to all un- 
to the very letter, and save us in 
the end in His kingdom, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Out of deference to the love we 
bear, and always have borne, and 
always hope to, toward the sons and 
descendants of President Brigham 
Young, I will read this telegram 
which I hold in my hand : 

"President Toseph F.Smith, Salt Lake, 
City, "Utah: 
"Regarding it as a sacred duty and 
glorious privilege, I report at confer- 
ence time with humble assurance of 
faith and prayers for you, the breth- 
ren, and Saints. As my hope to be 
present is unrealized, my prayers are 
more fervent for the way to open for 
October. With warm regards, 
"Respectfully yours, 

"John W. Young." 



The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! 
The Latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph E. Robinson. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., in the Tabernacle. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the congregation to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O, say, what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce; 
And priceless the value of Truth will be, 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Da- 
vid H. Cannon. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Onward, Christian soldiers ! 

Marching as to war, 
With the cross of Jesus 

Going on before.

A suggestive question. — The marvelous 
work of God. — The believing and the 
skeptical. — Illustrative anecdotes. — 
The Iconoclast abroad. — "Mormonism" 
remains unshaken. — Science and Re- 
ligion must agree. — All truth one. 

It is a common custom, too com- 
mon, I think, with some of the 
elders of Israel, when called upon 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to address a congregation, to pro- 
claim at the outset that they have 
nothing upon their minds. I have 
often thought it a most superfluous 
statement; for, when true, the con- 
gregation finds it out very quickly, 
without any information in advance. 
I have also thought this in relation 
to it — What right have men of God 
to have nothing upon their minds? 
What right have those who have 
been commanded by the God of 
heaven to become learned, to seek 
knowledge out of the best books, 
to seek learning by study and also 
by faith, to store up in their minds 
continually the word of the Lord, 
in order that the Holy Spirit may 
have materials to select from, when 
the proper time comes for the fram- 
ing of a discourse — what right have 
men, or a people, so instructed, to 
have nothing upon their minds? I 
leave the question here ; it is suffici- 
ently suggestive, without any fur- 
ther comment on my part. 

I cannot say that I have nothing 
upon my mind. Unreceptive, in- 
deed, would that mind be which had 
not received some good and last- 
ing impression, some suggestion of 
further ideas and discourses, from 
what has been so well said during 
the meetings of this conference. I 
have plenty upon my mind ; the dif- 
ficulty is to get it off my mind, to 
choose from the many subjects that 
have been running through my 
thoughts, the theme most suitable 
for this occasion. In the hope that 
I may speak that which ought to be 
spoken by me, I humbly place my- 
self in the hands of the Lord. 

Seven hundred years before the 
birth of the Savior, a prophet of 
God, gazing down the vista of the 
future, proclaimed the coming forth 
of a marvelous work, even a mar- 
velous work and a wonder, in the 



presence of which the wisdom of 
the wise should perish, and the un- 
derstanding of the prudent be hid. 
It is the belief of the Latter-day 
Saints that the fulfillment of this 
prediction, in its most marvelous 
phases, began in the spring of the 
year 1820, when Joseph Smith, the 
founder of this Church, received his 
first visitation from on High. It 
was something more than an an- 
swer to the boy's question, ad- 
dressed in prayer to Deity, as to 
which of all the existing churches 
he should join; it was the begin- 
ning of a work destined to bring 
about "the restitution of all things," 
to gather into one "all things in 
Christ," and consummate all pre- 
ceding phases of the work of God 
pertaining to this planet. 

A preparatory work, we may 
reasonably conclude, had been 
wrought before the setting up of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I refer to the discovery 
of America by Columbus, and to 
the founding, by the Patriot Fath- 
ers, of the Government of the 
United States. Do not deem it an 
arrogant assumption that these 
great events were preparatory to 
the marvels and wonders foretold 
by Isaiah for the last days. I am 
aware that sneering remarks are 
sometimes made when this state- 
ment is put forth. "The idea," says 
one, "that the 'Mormon' Church 
should have the audacity to assert 
that it had as a forerunner the 
founding of this nation, or the dis- 
covery of the western world !" 

In answer to this, I have but to 
say that something more than the 
setting up of a church was contem- 
plated by the ancient Prophet, when 
he made this wonderful prediction. 
It meant the opening of the last and 
greatest of the gospel dispensa- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



47 



tions ; it meant the gathering of the 
whole house of Israel from their 
long dispersion ; it meant the intro- 
duction of the millennial reign, the 
coming of Christ to sway the 
sceptre over this planet ; it meant the 
resurrection, the thousand years of 
peace, and the eventual glorifica- 
tion of the earth, which is yet to be 
converted into a celestial sphere, 
that beings of a celestial order may 
inherit it. And if you will only 
give the acorn a chance to spring — 
the oak an opportunity to grow, 
there will come a time when even 
the United States will not be 
ashamed to acknowledge that it was 
indeed a forerunner of this won- 
derful work; and the same with all 
governments, institutions, and 
events, all persons and powers that 
have been used by the Almighty 
from the beginning to prepare the 
way before the glorious advent of 
the King of Kings. 

What I desire, specially, to call 
attention to at this time, is the mar- 
velous character of the work of 
God. The opening event of this 
dispensation was the personal ap- 
pearing of the Father and the Son, 
and their proclamation of other 
wondrous events that were to fol- 
low. Surely it was marvelous, 
when God Himself broke the si- 
lence of the ages, spoke again to 
man, and announced the approach 
of the great consummation ! So 
marvelous, indeed, that many minds 
cannot grasp it, and are tempted to 
doubt, to deny, or give it an ex- 
planation unworthy of its stupen- 
dous character and significance. 
They hold that Joseph Smith did 
not really see the Father and the 
Son, but imagined that he saw 
them; that it was a mere concept 
or idea, and not an actual visitation. 
Some go so far as to declare that 



an epileptic fit was responsible for 
the glorious manifestation. 

I, for one, believe that Joseph 
Smith saw what he said he did ; that 
it was an actual visitation, and not 
a mere concept, or flight of fancy. 
The theory that would account for 
his visions by ascribing them and 
their wonderful results to an epilep- 
tic fit, is too ridiculous for serious 
consideration. I believe that Jo- 
seph saw the Father and the Son 
— just how, I do not know ; prob- 
ably it was not with the natural eye 
— most likely with the inward or 
spiritual sight ; but he saw them 
none the less, and they were there 
in person, speaking to him, while he 
beheld them. I accept his testi- 
mony concerning what the Method- 
ist minister told him was "all of 
the devil," I accept it as all from 
God. There is nothing more pa- 
thetic in "Mormon" history, to my 
mind, than those simple words in 
which the Prophet reasserts his 
claim to having seen, actually seen, 
the Father and the Son. Men 
might traduce him, might threaten 
him, might take his life, as they 
eventually did ; but his testimony 
would be, and was ever, the same : 
"I knew that I had seen a vision, 
and I knew that God knew it, and 
I could not deny it; for I felt that 
if I did, I would offend God and 
come under condemnation." 

Subsequently, as Joseph declares, 
an angel appeared to him, giving 
his name as Moroni, and revealing 
the existence of the plates from 
which was translated the Book of 
Mormon, a record of ancient Amer- 
ica, "the land of Zion." I accept 
that literally. I believe the Prophet 
actually saw the Angel Moroni, that 
he conversed with him, and re- 
ceived from him the plates contain- 
ing the Nephite record. Joseph al- 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



so affirms that John the Baptist, as 
a messenger from heaven, laid his 
hands upon him — upon Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and or- 
dained them to the Aaronic priest- 
hood, giving them power to preach 
the gospel of repentance, and to 
baptize by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins ; also promising them 
a greater priesthood, that would 
empower them to lay on hands and 
confer the Holy Ghost. That great- 
er priesthood — the Melchizedek — 
was afterwards bestowed upon 
these two young men, by the Apos- 
tles Peter, James, and John, and 
under the authority thereby con- 
ferred, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was organ- 
ized on the 6th of April, 1830. 

It was indeed a wonderful work. 
The words of Isaiah were vindicat- 
ed at the very beginning of their 
fulfillment; and in nothing more 
strikingly than in the realization of 
that part of his prophecy declaring 
that the wisdom of the wise should 
perish, and the understanding of 
the prudent be hid — bewildered, 
confounded, in the presence of 
God's marvelous work. More than 
ever is it "a rock of offense" — un- 
to the Jews a stumbling block, and 
unto the Gentiles, foolishness. But 
they will change their minds in re- 
lation to it. Give the acorn — the 
oak, time to grow. "Mormonism" 
is yet in its infancy, and "only chil- 
dren and fools," it is said, "criticise 
half finished work." 

There are tens of thousands of 
people who declare solemnly that 
God has given to them a testimony 
that these things are true ; but there 
are millions who have no such testi- 
mony, and have never had the op- 
portunity, most of them, to receive 
it. And even those to whom the 
opportunity has come, who have had 



their attention drawn to this work, 
do not all see it alike. There are 
many good and honest people in all 
churches, in all countries, who do 
not see as we see ; and I, for one, 
do not expect a Gentile to take a 
"Mormon" view of our subject. The 
spirit of this work is necessary to a 
proper understanding of it, and on- 
ly those who have received of that 
spirit can possibly comprehend the 
marvels that it makes manifest. Nor 
is this any reflection upon natural 
intelligence ; it is simply, the asser- 
tion of a divine principle, that the 
things of God are only to be dis- 
cerned by the Spirit of God. In the 
absence of that Spirit, which is only 
bestowed upon those who have 
bowed in obedience to the gospel, 
the wisdom of the wise perishes. 
Unless men and women humble 
themselves, and come as little chil- 
dren, believing in God and repent- 
ing of their sins, and have hands 
laid upon them for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, they cannot under- 
stand this work, no matter how in- 
telligent they may be. 

A man is not a bad man because 
he is not what we call spiritually- 
minded, quick to believe in the mar- 
velous, in spiritual mysteries and 
manifestations. The world is made 
up of two great classes of peo- 
ple — the spiritually-minded and the 
worldly-minded; and even among 
the former class some believe more 
readily than others. Some are na- 
turally believing, others naturally 
skeptical, or so intensely practical 
that they demand demonstration be- 
fore they will believe. We have a 
shining example in one of the orig- 
inal Twelve Apostles, — not a bad 
man — a good man, and one, more- 
over, who had the right to know, 
not merely believe, that his Lord 
had risen. That was the special 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



49 



prerogative of those Apostles ; it 
had to be more than belief with 
them. They could not go before the 
world merely with a message that 
they believed Christ had risen from 
the dead ; they had to know it ; it 
was their privilege to know ; but 
the rest of the world were required 
to believe their testimony. That, in 
my opinion, is the reason why the 
Savior came to Thomas after He 
had said, "I will not believe, un- 
less I can feel of the prints of the 
nails in His hands," etc. The Sa- 
vior, condescending to re-appear, 
said to him : "Reach hither thy 
hand, feel the prints of the nails, 
and be not faithless but believing." 
Thereupon Thomas, no longer 
doubting, fell at His feet, exclaim- 
ing, "O Lord, my God !" Jesus 
then imparted this lesson : "Thom- 
as, thou has believed because thou 
hast seen ; but blessed are they who 
have believed and have not seen." 
Because, after all, whatever God's 
special dispensations to individuals, 
this life was designed for the exer- 
cise of faith. For the sake of their 
own spiritual development, men are 
required to believe, without seeing, 
without hearing, without feeling, 
unless the Lord chooses to make 
them special witnesses, as He did 
the Apostles. Perfect knowledge 
swallows up faith, and removes the 
opportunity for its exercise ; while 
through the exercise of faith, made 
manifest by good works, we obtain 
the spiritual development for which 
we entered upon this our second 
estate. 

All good men and women do not 
quickly believe ; and all are not bad 
who desire demonstration. Hyoo- 
critical and corrupt "sign-seekers" 
are another class entirely. If only 
those quick to believe were accept- 
able to God, it would shut out mil- 



lions of sincere and honest souls, 
worthy of the kingdom of heaven. 
It would condemn some of my own 
ancestors. If it is natural for me 
to believe — if my first impulse, up- 
on hearing the testimony of a man 
of God, is to accept it, I owe it more 
to my mother than to my father ; 
and yet he was just as good a man 
as she was a woman, though he 
could not see spiritual things so 
quickly. It was the same with his 
parents ; his father was a business 
man, a practical man ; while his 
mother almost lived in another 
world, she was so spiritual; but 
Newel K. Whitney was just as good 
a man as Elizabeth Ann Whitney 
was a woman, every whit as faith- 
ful and true. In the case of my 
mother's parents, the order was re- 
versed. Heber C. Kimball was a 
giant of spirituality; he drank in 
the gospel as his mother's milk; 
while his wife, Vilate, was slower to 
comprehend and receive; yet there 
is no nobler name among the wom- 
en of this people than Vilate Mur- 
ray Kimball. She was not so ready 
to believe as was her husband, but 
once convinced, she was as firm as 
adamant, immovable. Therefore, I 
find no fault with those who are 
not spiritually minded, who cannot 
believe as readily as do others. It 
is largely a matter of temperament, 
and the work of the Lord has need 
of both kinds. 

What I deplore, is a disposition 
prevalent throughout the world, to 
strip God of His divinity; to take 
from Jesus Christ everything per- 
taining to His Godhood ; to do away 
with His miracles, His marvelous 
works, to question and even ridi- 
cule them ; to deny that they ever 
were ; to hold that Christ was mere- 
ly a good man, a wise teacher; that 
His principles are only human pre-

cepts, and that there is no virtue in 
His atoning blood; that he is not 
the Son of God more than any other 
man, and did not come with a mis- 
sion more divine than any good and 
great teacher before or after Him. 
I think this is carrying the practical 
too far. It suggests an abnormal 
development of the practical, result- 
ing, perhaps, from neglect of the 
spiritual. Still, we cannot overlook 
the fact that some are born that 
way. Some minds cannot grasp the 
marvelous, the miraculous, and are 
not willing to concede its possibil- 
ity. 

In the Eighteenth Ward, one 
Sunday evening, a Primary Con- 
ference was held, at which one of 
the sisters, gathering a class of lit- 
tle children around her, related to 
them how the Savior fed the mul- 
titude — fed five thousand people, 
with five loaves of bread and two 
fishes. Going home, a mother asked 
her little son what he had heard, 
and he repeated, as best he could, 
the teacher's instructions. The 
mother, anxious to impress the les- 
son upon the mind of her child, 
asked : "How, do you suppose, did 
the Savior feed five thousand peo- 
ple with five loaves of bread and 
two fishes ?" The little boy thought 
a moment, and then said : "Well, 
I don't believe those in the middle 
got any." (Laughter). I wonder 
if Saint Thomas was not that kind 
of a child. It seems to me a very 
good portrayal of the disposition 
of "the doubting apostle." 

I am reminded of another story, 
told by the famous temperance 
orator, John B. Gough, in a lec- 
ture delivered at the Salt Lake The- 
ater many years ago. He was de- 
precating the practice of simplifying 
the Bible for the study of children. 
"Children," said he, "understand 



much better than we give them 
credit for. Let them read the Bi- 
ble just as it is; they will under- 
stand it." To illustrate the point, 
he told of two little boys, Johnny 
and Billy, who were engaged in 
conversation. Johnny was seated 
on his mother's door-step, whittling 
a stick, and Billy had just caught a 
fly. He came with it to Johnny, 
and said: "What a funny thing a 
fly is. • See what lots of legs he's 
got ; and every time I blow him he 
buzzes." Then he would blow on 
the fly, and hold it up to his ear, to 
hear it buzz, grinning with delight 
at the sound. Finally he remarked, 
"I wonder how God made him." 
And the great orator paused long 
enough to observe, "Many a learned 
man has asked the same question, 
and could not answer it." But 
Johnny had an idea of how God 
made the fly. "Well, Billy," said 
he, as he whittled away. "God 
don't make flies like men make 
houses. When He wants flies, he 
says, Let there be flies ; and then 
there is flies." (Laughter.) 

Now, this boy, Johnny, would 
have understood how the Savior 
could feed the multitude in the 
wonderful manner described ; he 
had read in the Bible how light was 
made, and could grasp the idea that 
the power of God is greater than 
the power of man. He would not 
have insisted upon bringing the 
miraculous down to the level of the 
commonplace, and denying the 
truth or existence of things, simply 
because they were outside the range 
of ordinary human experience. 
Johnny was a believer in miracles, 
which, after all, are only the results 
of natural law — higher law, per- 
haps, than the finite mind can fully 
comprehend. Man, when he wants 
light, must strike a match, or press 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



51 



a button, and turn on the gas or 
electricity ; but God, when He wants 
light, says. Let there be light. Yet 
is it not the same light in both 

cases ? 

The two anecdotes I have related 
illustrate the two classes of people 
to whom I have referred — those 
who question or ignore "miracu- 
lous manifestations," and those who 
believe in them, and whose faith is 
equal to the acceptance of God's 
'marvelous work and wonder," pre- 
dicted as such by His prophets, and 
realized as such by tens of thou- 
sands of witnesses. What wonder 
that the prediction should have a 
fulfillment? And yet, even among 
the Latter-day Saints there are 
some who find it difficult to believe 
that God deals directly with man; 
that the heavens actually opened at 
the' beginning of this dispensation ; 
that the Father and the Son ap- 
peared in person to Joseph Smith 
the Prophet; and that angels or- 
dained him and Oliver Cowdery to 
the Priesthood. But the great body 
of this people have accepted these 
things as true, have received a testi- 
mony that they are true. They do 
not attempt to strip Christ of His 
divinity ; they do not doubt the mir- 
aculous phases of "Mormonism." 
It is clear to them that the proph- 
ecies concerning it would have been 
uttered in vain, would have been in- 
validated had there been nothing 
marvelous in connection with the 
Lord's great latter-day work. 

There is a disposition in these 
modern times to test the founda- 
tions of things ; and it is not alto- 
gether of evil significance. The 
Lord has decreed that everything 
that can be shaken shall be shaken ; 
and I think whatever can be, ought 
to be shaken. The gospel, going 
forth from Zion, is shaking the na- 



tions ; the Lord is threshing them by 
the power of His Spirit. But the 
world will retaliate ; they will come 
against us, and shake us if they can. 
Everything not built upon the rock 
will crumble and go down. Even 
the most sacred plinciples, and the 
most thoroughly established facts of 
history, are called in question by 
modern scientific and philosophical 
criticism. The iconoclast is abroad. 
Look to your idols ; for everything 
that can be broken will be broken, 
and the debris removed to make 
way for a better and higher order 
of things. But truth will endure, 
and withstand successfully every 
assault made upon it. 

I picked up a magazine the other 
day, a scientific periodical, issued 
about a year ago, in which was an 
article entitled, "The Ethnological 
Background of the Eucharist.'^The 
writer of it undertakes to prove that 
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, 
instituted by the Savior on the 
night of His betrayal, and given 
to His disciples as a solemn re- 
minder of His sacrifice, is of hu- 
man origin— was not originated by 
Christ at all, but introduced into 
the Church by the Apostle Paul, 
who discovered it through hh wide 
knowledge of doctrines and ordi- 
nances that preceded the coming of 
Christ ; such as those of the Gnost- 
ics, and the Mithraites, worshipers 
of the sun-god. The article goes 
on to show that there are indica- 
tions that these ancient peoples prac- 
ticed a ceremony similar to the Eu- 
charist, and that even savage tribes 
and barbarians have sacrificial cus- 
toms suggestive of the sacrament of 
the Lord's Supper. Hence this au- 
thor jumps to the conclusion that 
it is of human origin, a natural 
growth, and not a supernatural rev- 
elation. In short, that the Euchar- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ist is an example of ceremonial ev- 
olution. 

How can the Christian Church 
meet such an argument? The 
early Christian Fathers tried to an- 
swer it by declaring that Satan had 
imitated the Sacrament instituted 
by Christ and placed it among the 
Pagan peoples around them. Un- 
fortunately for this defense, how- 
ever, the practice of such ceremonies 
among the Mithraites and the 
Gnostics was older than the intro- 
duction of Christianity. Christian- 
ity cannot answer, but "Mormon- 
ism" can. Standing upon a rock 
that is not to be shaken, we reassert 
the divinity of the Sacrament, with- 
out fear of successful contradiction. 
How will we answer modern crit- 
icism ? Simply by proclaiming what 
God has revealed ; that this relig- 
ion, called "Mormonism" today, 
Christianism two thousand years 
ago, and known by some other nick- 
name, doubtless, in earlier ages, is 
the Everlasting Gospel, not owing 
its origin to any man, nor to any 
time, but instituted in the heavens 
before the creation of this world, 
and revealed to men upon the earth 
at different times and in different 
places* "Mormonsm" can say, with 
the Son of God: "Before Abra- 
ham was, I am." Adam had this 
Gospel — the Gospel of Christ — 
which was in the world before 
Christ's coming, and helped to pre- 
pare the way before His advent. 
One of the first things Adam did, 
after his fall from Eden, was to 
build an altar and offer a lamb 
thereon, to foreshadow the sacrifice 
of the Son of God. After the del- 
uge, when Noah with his family 
came forth from the ark, one of 
the first things he did was to erect 
an altar and offer a similar sacri- 
fice. He had the same Gospel that 



Adam, Enoch, and others had be- 
fore him ; and the sons of Noah— 
Shem, Ham, and Japheth — who 
peopled Asia, Africa, and Europe, 
doubtless took with them, wherever 
they went, the traditions of the. an- 
cient faith, the faith of their fathers, 
and practiced their customs and ob- 
servances. What wonder, then, that 
even among savage tribes, barbar- 
ous peoples, however ancient, there 
should be found remnants of this 
faith, fragments of this rock of 
ages ; or that science should even 
discover remains of other revealings 
from God to man, of which the 
Bible — a mere skeleton of history — 
says nothing? 

What is there in all this that 
should tempt a Latter-day Saint to 
throw away the revelations of God, 
and jump to the conclusion that 
these divine institutions are of fiu- 
man origin? Nothing, whatever. 
The foundation upon which we 
stand remains unshaken, unmoved 
by any discovery of science, or any 
onslaught of modern criticism. 

One word more. It is an absurd- 
ity to speak, as some do, of relig- 
ious truth and scientific truth, as if 
they were two different things. As 
if truth could be divided, any more 
than light, or eternal duration. Man, 
for his own convenience divides 
time into centuries, years, months, 
weeks, days, minutes and seconds, 
basing his calculations upon the 
movements of the earth and the 
heavenly bodies ; but with God there 
is no past, no future; it is all pres- 
ent, no yesterday, no tomorrow, — 
only today. And light, whether it 
comes from the sun, or the moon, 
or the stars, is all one ; the light of 
the sun being the same light that 
illumines our understandings. All 
light is one ; all truth is one. Truth 
cannot contradict itself. If science

and religion — true science and true 
religion — seem, in the least, to dis- 
agree, it is simply because man has 
not discovered enough, and God, 
perhaps, has not revealed enough, to 
bring us to the point of reconcilia- 
tion ; but that time will come. There 
is no need to disbelieve, or to re- 
ject truth already revealed, either 
through religion or through sci- 
ence, while awaiting the Lord's 
time for clearing up the mystery. 

"Blind unbelief is sure to err, 
And scan His work in vain ; 
God is his own interpreter, 
And He will make it plain." 

Amen. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

I confess to being just a little 
frightened in standing before such 
an audience as this, and following 
the speakers who have addressed us. 

We are living in the most won- 
derful age that the world has ever 
seen. The first ten years of the 
twentieth century have been more 
eventful than almost any number of 
years in the past history of the 
world. The world has developed 
and grown rapidly. In the matter 
of population the increase has been 
great. In the way of material de- 
velopment the world has never seen 
anything like it before. Great un- 
dertakings have been projected, like 
the Panama Canal, which are being 
pushed to completion. The wireless 
telegraph and the flying machine are 
products of this new century — the 
latter made possible only through 
the wonderful development of the 
gasoline engine which is a rapidly 
developing power in doing the work 
of today. In every department of 
human affairs there is hurrv and 
bustle as if there was not time 
enough to get the work done. 



The principle of liberty which the 
Lord caused to be established in 
this land, many years ago, is rap- 
idly spreading and growing in all 
lands. In these first ten years 
of the twentieth century we have 
witnessed political upheavals in 
many countries, which testify to us 
how this leaven of liberty is work- 
ing. In Russia the people have se- 
cured something of representative 
government, which has been wrung 
from the Czar and his advisers and 
a parliament, or douma, has been 
established ; something hitherto un- 
known in the great Russian empire. 
Even among the heathen in China, 
this same principle is at work, and 
representatives of that people are to 
meet in convention in 1913 and be- 
gin to assist in the governing of 
their own land. And so in Persia, 
and so in Turkey and to a greater 
or less extent in all parts of the 
world. In these recent years we 
see this spirit of liberty moving in 
the hearts of the people, overthrow- 
ing thrones and casting down the 
mighty ones of the earth. The peo- 
ple of the world are awakening from 
the sleep of centuries, and also from 
the degradation of centuries, and 
are coming gradually but surely in- 
to the light. In a material way, too, 
the people are improving, but 
whether the morals of the people 
are improving is an open question. 
Men of wealth and of large heart 
have given most liberally of their 
means for the establishment of 
schools, colleges, universities, hos- 
pitals, also for the promotion of sci- 
ence, and for the promotion of peace 
on earth. These benefactions are so 
enormous that they almost go be- 
yond imagination. All of this is 
good and makes for the blessing and 
uplifting of humanity. 

In the conquering of diseases too, 



. r >4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in medical science and surgery, 
there has been more development 
along those lines in the past ten 
years than in almost any other pe- 
riod of the world's history. The 
Yellow Fever, which always had 
been a scourge of the tropics, has 
been conquered in that time. Ty- 
phoid Fever may be said to have 
been practically conquered also. 
Consumption, the great white 
plague as it is called, if not entirely 
conquered is at least, to a very great 
extent, being subdued by the people 
learning just one practical common 
sense lesson, sleeping either in the 
open air or in rooms where there is 
abundance of fresh air. It has been 
discovered, too, in the ten years that 
I speak of, that the ordinary house 
fly is the most destructive and, per- 
haps, the most death dealing insect 
that exists in the world todav, and 
that many diseases which have hith- 
erto carried off millions of people 
can be practically controlled if we 
keep flies and filth out of our homes. 
This little fly, one writer says, car- 
ries more of death and destruction 
than all the reptiles, snakes, tigers, 
lions and all wild beasts in all the 
world put together. So we see men 
are growing in intelligence. The 
world, in respect to many of these 
matters, has grown and is becoming 
better. We know more about sani- 
tary measures and how to live and 
how to take care of our bodies than 
we did formerly. Science is prov- 
ing that that which has been re- 
vealed to the Latter-day Saints 
from the beginning, which we call 
the Word of Wisdom, is the truth, 
and is revelation from Almighty 
God ; which scientific confirmation, 
though a little late, is, nevertheless, 
appreciated by us. 

While all these good things which 
I have mentioned have come to the 



world, and many more could be 
mentioned that are good, there is 
one thing so very needful for the 
happiness and well being of man- 
kind that the world, instead of pro- 
gressing in, has actually fallen be- 
hind and retrograded. That is, in 
the spiritual or religious side of 
life. Man is a being who must be- 
lieve. Belief, says a distinguished 
writer, is great and life giving. So 
long as he is sincere in his beliefs, 
and in his worship, such belief and 
worship will, to a very gre^t extent, 
shape and control his life. But 
when he is trying to believe some- 
thing which has grown to be un- 
believable, his worship then becomes 
an insincerity and hollow mockery. 
So we see throughout the land that 
the churches, instead of being rea- 
sonably well filled, are practically 
empty. Men and women do not 
take interest in religious matters. 
They are lovers of pleasure more 
than lovers of God, and have a form 
of godliness which, in the main, is 
an insincerity and is attended to for 
form's sake only. The knowledge 
of God does not yet cover the earth 
as the waters cover the mighty deep, 
not by a long way. Indeed what 
little conception of God the world 
has hitherto had is being very rap- 
idly overthrown during these re- 
cent years. 

Now, here is the mission of 
"Mormonism." Here is the great 
need of this Church ; that faith shall 
not be abolished from the earth, 
from the hearts of the children of 
men. I thought, while sitting here 
today, when I heard some of these 
brethren of the apostles preaching, 
if ever there was a time, in the his- 
tory of the world, when there was 
need for special witnesses for the 
Lord Jesus Christ that time is to- 
day. Never so much as today. If 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 



55 



ever, there was a time when there 
was need for the testimony of these 
men that are sent out, these sev- 
enties, these elders, testifying for 
Jesus, standing for Jesus ; the mir- 
aculous Jesus, the Jesus who was 
begotten by His Father, the Lord 
God Almighty, and born of the vir- 
gin Mary — the Jesus of miraculous 
birth and miraculous life ; who went 
about performing miracles and do- 
ing good, doing no evil whatever ; 
the Jesus Christ who was crucified 
upon the cross, and who rose again. 
If ever there was a time that it was 
needful to stand for that testimony 
against the surges and billows of 
unbelief, that threaten the belief of 
the entire world, the time is now, 
right now. So this is our mission, 
my brethren and sisters ; and you 
are sustaining it who are contrib- 
uting of your means to send your 
sons and daughters to bear this 
testimony, that God has spoken in 
this last time ; that the same Jesus 
shall be testified of as having, in a 
miraculous way, revealed Himself 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. To 
testify of the miraculous coming 
forth of the Book of Mormon. To 
testify of the miracle of "Mormon- 
ism" in every way. "Mormonism" 
is very truly practical as well as 
spiritual, what with its colonization 
schemes, its building of roads, 
bridges, and canals, and carrying 
blessing with it to the people every- 
where, in every way, yet with all 
the good in the practical or ma- 
terial side of "Mormonism" we 
need to testify of the miraculous 
"Mormonism" as well. The won- 
derful visions and manifestations 
made to the Prophet, the founder 
of "Mormonism," under the Lord 
Jesus Christ; the work which that 
Prophet did, all demand our testi- 
mony. 



So you, my brethren and sisters, 
who are sustaining this work by 
contributing tithes and offerings, 
and by sending your sons and 
daughters out as missionaries, thus 
testify of the truth of this miracle 
of "Mormonism." The organiza- 
tion of this most wonderful piece 
of spiritual machinery, called the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, is a miracle in itself. 
We must instill this faith in the 
hearts of our children, and try to get 
it established in the hearts of the 
children of men everywhere. This 
is very important. To accom- 
plish this work our children should 
be educated. We believe in educa- 
tion; but some of us send our chil- 
dren away from home to be educat- 
ed, and many of them come back 
seemingly determined to claim re- 
lationship with the apes rather than 
with the angels. They lose their 
faith by failing to call on*the Lord 
in faith. Without faith it is im- 
possible to please God. We must 
teach faith in God and in His Son 
Jesus Christ. Faith in the Prophet 
Joseph Smith ; faith in the Book of 
Mormon, faith in the miraculous 
birth, life and resurrection of the 
risen Redeemer. 

On next Sunday week all Chris- 
tendom will be celebrating Easter 
Sunday. The theme of their ser- 
mons will be "He is not here, He is 
risen," and yet many disbelieve that 
He did really rise from the grave, 
that He is a living personality to- 
day, and that He will come again. 
How many of those who will hear 
in the churches throughout the land 
about this risen Redeemer believe 
that He is risen indeed? Perhaps 
not one in a thousand. So "Mor- 
monism" is here with a mission and 
the Lord has provided men and 
women who are stalwart and true 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to carry on this work. His servants 
are determined men of God. Men 
of faith who believe that God has 
spoken; who are assured in their 
very souls that this is His special 
work; that He has established it, 
and they believe and accept it with- 
out reservation or equivocation. I 
bear witness of it. Jesus Christ is 
the Son of the Living God, whom to 
know is life eternal. I bear witness 
of His mission, of His life and of 
His 'resurrection. If we Latter- 
day Saints do not stand for this 
faith, shall the Son of Man, when 
He cometh, find faith on the earth? 
I tell you, mighty little, indeed, un- 
less the Latter-day Saints, and their 
sons and daughters after them, car- 
ry out the mission whereunto we 
are called. 

I know that these men who are 
called to preside over the Church of 
Christ are men of God. I bear wit- 
ness of that also, for I know them. 
It has been my high privilege to 
know, better than most men, better 
than almost any, of the life and la- 
bors of President Joseph F. Smith, 
and I know what manner of man he 
is. I testify to you that he is a man 
of God, choice and most precious, as 
I believe, above every man whom I 
know or have ever known ; honest, 
sincere, devoted, patient, forgiving, 
loving and most precious. This is 
the kind of man that God has called 
to lead His Church, in this the be- 
ginning of the twentieth century. 
At. the beginning of this century 
Lorenzo Snow was President of the 
Church ; and, by the way, Pope Leo, 
the thirteenth was sitting in the pa- 
pal chair at Rome as president of 
that Church. It is scarcely worth 
while, except to refer to associa- 
mention any other churches, 
tions of individuals or societies, to 

I bear testimony to you, also, con- 



cerning the integrity of these men, 
the twelve apostles, special wit- 
nesses of Jesus Christ, that mirac- 
ulous Jesus, that same Jesus, the 
risen Lord. They are men of God, 
every one of them, and on Easter 
Sunday and indeed on every 
Sunday and every other day, they 
believe with all their souls, — 
with all the earnestness that men 
and women command, and they try 
to make other people believe that 
Jesus has indeed risen, that He is 
the Redeemer of the world ; and 
they try to instill that faith into 
the hearts of the children of men. 
I bear witness that these seventies 
are of the same high class of men, 
men of faith, men of God, who have 
that same testimony in their hearts, 
ready to stand before all the world 
and testify that God, our Eternal 
Father, has revealed that Jesus is 
the Christ, that He has risen, that 
He lives and that He will come and 
reign upon the earth. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
this then is the great mission of 
"Mormonism" and herein is the 
great need of "Mormonism" in the 
world. It has its practical and tem- 
poral affairs, all of them good, as 
we heard from our president at the 
opening of the conference ; but with 
all that, with all its good work in 
practical matters, the greatest and 
highest need of all is this testimony 
of Jesus Christ, which must stand, 
and which we must not allow to 
perish from the earth. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

It has become something of a 
truism with the Latter-day Saints, 
that every conference is the best 
one. The last conference is always 
the best. I feel in my own heart 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



57 



that this is the best conference I 
ever attended. My spirit, in listen- 
ing to the brethren, has been lightei 
and my heart better satisfied when 
contemplating the truths to which 
our attention has been called. I 
do not know how well I shall suc- 
ceed in concentrating my thought 
and giving expression to some re- 
flections that have passed through 
my mind ; and certainly I never felt 
more dependent upon the Lord and 
the inspiration of His spirit than 1 
do at this moment. There is one 
thing that has occurred to my mind, 
several times, by reason of that 
which has been spoken to us. It is 
an historical incident. It is re- 
corded of the first Christian em- 
peror of Rome, that when leading 
his armies against those who were 
contesting with him the mastery of 
the Roman empire, that at mid-day 
he saw in the heavens a luminous 
cross, and written upon a scroll 
were these words, "By this con- 
ouer." This vision of the day 
was supplemented by a dream of the 
night, in which the Christ appeared 
to Constantine and instructed him 
to place this insignia of the cross 
and these words, "By this conquer," 
upon his banners, and success 
should crown his arms. It is a ques- 
tion with historians, whether this cir- 
cumstance really happened, or was 
only an invention of a man noted for 
his cunning, Constantine, and if we 
judge the circumstance by the char- 
acter of the man, we could at least 
readily believe that it was an in- 
vention. But whether an invention 
or not, it is certainly a wonderful 
legend, and it will introduce an idea 
that came to my mind in respect to 
the matters of our conference, and 
in relation to the Latter-day Saints 
and the great work of God com- 
mitted to their hands. If you view 
our people with reference to their 



numbers of course we are an insig- 
nificant people. If you regard them 
in relation to their influence in the • 
financial world, we are almost a 
negligible quantity. If we think 
upon ourselves as we are regard- 
ed by the great religions of the 
world, we are almost contemptible. 
If you regard us from the view- 
point of learning and philosophy, 
we cut no great figure. And so, 
viewing the matter, I asked myself 
the question, and submit it to you, 
wherein, then, lies our strength? 
From what source shall we draw 
confidence needful to our strength 
in the great conflict with the world, 
that confronts us. When I asked 
myself that question I can, at least 
in mental vision, see in the heavens 
a scroll, and upon it, these words — 
"Principles — by these conquer." 
The principles, of course, are those 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Therein lies our strength — not in 
numbers, not in wealth, certainly 
not in political influence, certainly 
not in renown for learning, but in 
the truth or principles we have re- 
ceived from God, we are strong; 
not so much, either, because of the 
little truth that has been revealed 
to us, the little knowledge to which 
we have attained, but more because 
of that great ocean of knowledge 
that we have access to, through one 
of the great principles we announce 
as a doctrine to the world, namely 
this : "We believe all that God has 
revealed, all that He does now re- 
veal, and we believe that He will 
yet reveal many great and impor- 
tant truths pertaining to the king- 
dom of God in these last days." 
Through the acceptance of that 
doctrine we have access to God's 
hidden treasures of knowledge ; 
which, in comparison of that which 
men in this world have received, is 
as some mighty ocean to a lakelet. 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We have only a part of that truth ; 
but we have in the foregoing arti- 
cle of our faith the principle 
through which more of that truth 
can be learned. Now, do not mis- 
understand me ; I do not for an in- 
stant belittle the truth we have al- 
ready received, because of this 
great ocean of truth that exists, at 
present, outside of our conscious- 
ness. In this new dispensation of 
the gospel, we indeed have received 
great truths, and precious withal. 
God has revealed himself unto His 
Witness of the new dispensation, 
Joseph Smith, in a most effective, 
splendid manner. We know some- 
thing of the character, and even 
something of the form and features 
of that mighty Intelligence that 
stands in the councils of the gods , 
and out of whose wisdom and pow- 
er creation and guidance comes as 
to the affairs of this universe. God 
has made known unto us, indeed, 
that Jesus Christ is the express 
image of the Father, and that as the 
Christ was, in form and feature, in 
intellectual and moral quality, in the 
attributes of soul, so indeed also is 
the Father. To know this and to 
know it well, to have it take pos- 
session of the consciousness, so that 
when God is spoken of, the image 
of the Christ, holding — as He an- 
nounced to His disciples that He 
did hold — all power in heaven and 
in earth ; to have such a conscious- 
ness of God, so that when His name 
or title is spoken this vision of God, 
revealed through the person and 
nature of the Christ arise, is a very 
great truth indeed. 

The efficacy and power of the 
atonement of the Christ has been 
revealed to us. The Church of the 
Christ with all its order of officers, 
and with the channels of communi- 
cation that it opens with God, has 
been established, which is great 



gain. To know the means through 
which we can appropriate the 
atonement by the Son of God for 
man — that indeed is great and pre- 
cious knowledge. These truths, 
spoken this morning, by Elder Pen- 
rose, in relation to the eternity of 
the relationships of men and wom- 
en in and after the resurrection of 
the dead; the renewed assurances 
of the resurrection from the dead — 
all these truths that God has made 
known to His Church, through the 
principle of revelation, that we ac- 
cept as true ; and as the medium 
through which God imparts truth 
unto His Church and unto the 
world — these, indeed, are great 
truths and should be held — and we 
do so hold them — in reverence in 
very deed. So that in my passing 
remark and imperfect way of put- 
ting the thing, as to the little we 
know in comparison of what there 
is yet to learn, it was not my inten- 
tion, for a moment, to discredit these 
splendid truths that we have re- 
ceived, merely because I called atten- 
tion to the fact that outside of these 
things are many, very many things, 
yet for us to learn and for God to 
reveal. The truths of the gospel, 
and God's method of teaching those 
truths to the world are such that 
they appeal to the humblest people. 
We may say, as one of the world's 
great poets once said: "Religion 
* * * is surely a simple busi- 
ness, as it equally concerns the ig- 
norant and the learned, the poor 
and the rich." One of the most 
beautiful things in the New Testa- 
ment is the declaration of the Son 
of God, in reference to the class of 
people to whom the gospel was 
preached in His day. You will re- 
member that His forerunner, John 
the Baptist, was thrown into 
prison, and while passing through 
that gloomy period of his life, he 



ELDER B H. ROBERTS. 



59 



sent messengers to the Christ, say- 
ing, "Art thou he that should come, 
or look we for another?" Jesus 
sent the disciples of John back to 
him with this message, "Say that 
the sick are healed, that the blind 
see, that the lame walk, and unto 
the poor is the gospel preached.'' 
So far in our experience, it has 
been with us as it was in the former 
dispensation of the gospel, namely, 
that it has been the common people 
who have heard our message gladly. 
But while that is true, it still re- 
mains true, also, that this faith ot 
ours, this system of truth so well 
adapted to comfort the heart of the 
common people, the lowly, the sim- 
ple-minded, the humble people who 
readily believe, while it is within 
their reach, and their souls can be 
filled with it, bringing joy and com- 
fort to them — yet this Mormonism, 
so long despised as a religion that 
can only thrive where ignorance is 
most pronounced; whose officers 
are reputed in the world to be anx- 
ious to keep their people in ignor- 
ance, that they may rule them to 
their advantage, and as with a rod 
of iron — this religion that has such 
a reputation in the world is never- 
theless essentially a religion for in- 
tellectual men. It is a religion the 
philosophy of which, it seems to me, 
must appeal to the highest intelli- 
gences of the earth, when they shall 
come to know it. I should be disap- 
pointed in it if this was not true; 
for while religion must appeal to 
and satisfy the emotional nature, 
it must also appeal to and satisfy 
the intellect. I find that satisfac- 
tion in the religion of Jesus Christ 
as made known in the new dispen- 
sation of that religion which we 
have received — the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. 

Of course, the subject that opens 
up before one by indulging in these 



reflections, is altogether too large 
for treatment in a few moments ; 
one thing only can I briefly refer to 
in this kind. It has been my pleas- 
ure and duty, during the past few 
months, to review and set in order 
for the study of our Seventies' 
quorums the doctrine of the atone- 
ment of Jesus Christ ; and this late 
inquiry into that subject has had a 
wonderful effect upon my own 
thought and state of mind. I have 
for many years believed in the 
atonement of Jesus Christ and have 
accepted its symbols in baptism and 
in confirmation ; and have repeated- 
ly renewed my acceptance of that 
atonement by accepting the sacra- 
ment of the Lord's supper. It has 
been a matter of faith with me and 
of knowledge, by the testimony of 
the Spirit of God to my soul ; but 
upon close inquiry, by deeper del- 
ving into the subject, my intellect 
also gives its full and complete as- 
sent to the soundness of the phil- 
osophy and the absolute necessity 
for the atonement of Jesus Christ. 
That this atonement, the method 
and manner of it is the only way by 
which there could be brought to 
pass an at-one-ment, a reuniting of 
soul of man with soul of God. 
I account it for myself a new 
conversion, an intellectual conver- 
sion, to the atonement of Jesus 
Christ; and I have been rejoicing in 
it of late, exceedingly. I am con- 
vinced that when men of intelli- 
gence 'can be brought to the point 
of being sufficiently humble to read 
again the Book of Mormon, and to 
take into account the high purposes 
for which it was written, viz., to 
testify to the truth of the Jewish 
scriptures, but more especially to 
testify of the Christ, to bear wit- 
ness of Him both to Jew and Gen- 
tile; testifying that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that there is no

other means of salvation provided 
but through His atonement. 
When they will consider the mes- 
sage it has to bear upon these im- 
portant questions, and will stop 
sneering at such human elements 
as may be in it, and will examine 
once more its teachings upon the 
great theme of salvation through 
the atonement of the Christ, they 
can indeed find wisdom and phil- 
osophy and truth in its doctrines. I 
proclaim to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that in the Book of Mor- 
mon, more than in any other book 
written in this world, and I do not 
except the New Testament — in the 
Book of Mormon more than in any 
other book, we have there the ne- 



cessity of, and the truth of the 
atonement of the Christ taught to 
the children of men as nowhere 
else. I rejoice in these truths ; may 
the Lord seal them upon our hearts 
and give us grace and strength to 
live in harmony with them, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Samuel O. Bennion. 

Conference adjourned until Sun- 
day morning, April 9th. 



THIRD DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, April 
9th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith, and he 
announced that overflow meetings 
will convene this morning, and af- 
ternoon, in the Assembly Hall, for 
the benefit of the many who can not 
be accommodated in the overcrowd- 
ed Tabernacle. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

awake ! my slumb'ring minstrel, 
Let my harp forget its spell; 

Say, O say, in sweetest accents, 
Zion prospers, all is well. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Mel- 
vin J. Ballard. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

1 know that my Redeemer lives ; 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives ! 
He lives, He lives, who once was dead; 
He lives, my ever-living head. 

ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Meaning of God's word should not be 
modified. — Science proves that alcohol, 
even in small quantity, is injurious. — 
Pathetic appeal of an Indian chief. — 
Prohibition a good business proposi- 
tion. — Evil effects of use of tobacco 
demonstrated. 

You who have been called upon 
to occupy the position of instructing 
the congregations of Israel will 
know what responsibility rests upon 
him who has the duty of edifying 
and instructing the soul ; and I 
would ask you, this morning, who 
realize this that you will offer the 
prayer for me that you have desired 



others to offer for you, for I assure 
you I sense the need of God's help 
and inspiration this morning. 

On the 27th of February, 1833, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith received 
the revelation recorded in the 89th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. Seventy-eight years have 
passed since God gave that revela- 
tion to His Church, throus;h His 
great latter-day prophet. I want to 
read a few paragraphs from that 
section : 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, in consequence of evils and de- 
signs which do and will exist in the 
hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and fore- 
warn you, by giving unto you this word 
of wisdom by revelation. 

"That inasmuch as any man drinketh 
wine or strong drink among you, behold 
it is not good, neither meet in the sight 
of your Father, only in assembling your- 
selves together to offer up your sacra- 
ments before him. 

"And, behold, this should be wine, 
yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, 
of your own make." 

It is recorded that the Lord said 
to His servants that in consequence 
of the adulteration in the wine pro- 
duced from the grape of the vine, 
pure water is acceptable to Him, 
even in the administration of the 
Lord's supper. 

The particular sentence that I 
wish to call attention to is this : "In- 
asmuch as any man drinketh wine 
or strong drink * * behold it is 
not good, neither meet in the sight 
of your Father." That is the word 
of God to the people of this gener- 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ation. It stands with just as much 
force as the words of the Savior, 
"If any man will do His will he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it be 
of God or whether I speak of my- 
self." Latter-dav Saints, you know 
this statement of the Savior's is 
true ; we testify that if any man will 
do the will of God he will get the 
testimony, in his heart and in his 
life, that the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is true. We accept the words of the 
Savior, "Except ye repent, ye shall 
all likewise perish." Those eternal 
truths, so tersely expressed, we ac- 
cept as true. We may not live up to 
them wholly, but as a people we ac- 
cept them, because they are the 
word of God. Just so strong, just 
so eternal stands this truth ex- 
pressed seventy-eight years ago, the 
27th day of last February, "Strong 
drink is not good for man." Yet 
those seventy-eight years have 
passed, and during that time this 
doctrine has been preached every 
week, if not every day, In some con- 
gregation of Israel, and still we 
find in our midst a few who say, 
by their acts, It is good for man. I 
am glad when I study tliis passage, 
to find that the Lord did not say, 
"Strong drink to excess is not 
good ;" nor "Drunkenness is not 
good." Suppose He had weakened 
that expression by modifying it and 
saying, "Strong drink in excess, or 
when taken in large quantities, is 
not good," how soon we should have 
justified ourselves that a little drink 
is good. But like other eternal 
truths it stands unqualified; strong 
drink is not good. I have met men, 
particularly during the agitation 
that is now manifested against the 
liquor evil, who have said: "I do 
not want to be deprived of the 
privilege of taking a little, if I want 
it. When I think it is going to do 



me good, I want to take it." Oth- 
ers, I rather think, would say that 
the Church is a little too strict in 
regard to the word of wisdom : "A 
little beer," they say, "does not hurt 
any one ; a little wine is not inju- 
rious." Well, it is sufficient for me 
to know that God has said, "Wine, 
strong drink, is not good for man ;" 
and I wish that all Israel would ac- 
cept that divine statement, and 
prove in their lives to the whole 
world that they accept this as a rev- 
elation from God. That is the best 
way to close your saloons in your 
towns. It is the most effective. 

But we have many in our towns 
who do not accept that as the word 
of God ; then I suggest that they ac- 
cept the confirmations of science of 
the truth of that statement of the 
Lord's. Recent investigations by 
scientific men prove conclusively the 
truthfulness of this revelation, of 
this doctrine. I have in mind one 
series of investigations carried on 
by a man who started his investi- 
gations with the avowed purpose of 
defending the virtue of a little wine 
and beer, that is, taken in small 
quantities. Professor Kreplin of the 
Heidelberg University, of Ger- 
many, a few years ago, carried on 
a series of experiments among his 
students. Professor Kreplin, of all 
men, we are told, was one particu- 
larly qualified to make such an in- 
vestigation, because he is accepted 
as authority throughout all the sci- 
entific world. Now, mind you, he 
accepted the truth that wine taken in 
large quatities was injurious, but he 
wanted to prove whether there was 
not a little virtue in these intoxi- 
cants when taken only in small 
quantities. So he took several stu- 
dents who were willing to make the 
experiment, and tested them on a 
series of problems in addition. For 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

six days, a half hour each day, these 
students worked the best they could 
at their problems. Then a little al- 
cohol was given them, about two 
and a half tablespoonfuls in the 
wine they drank. They continued 
their work until the thirteenth day, 
Professor Kreplin measuring accu- 
rately each day the result of their 
efforts. Every day during that 
time, up to the thirteenth day, after 
they began to take that alcohol, the 
students diminished in their ability 
to add. Then they were deprived of 
the drink, and they added until the 
nineteenth day, and each day they 
increased^ until they regained their 
former power or ability which they 
manifested when they were in their 
normal state. Then alcohol was 
again given them in small quantities 
and again the diminished power was 
manifest; and so the test continued 
until it was proved conclusively that 
alcohol diminishes the intellectual 
power, even when taken in small 
quantities. They tried it in that 
same city with the typesetters. Four 
experts were taken, and alcohol ad- 
ministered in small quantities, and 
then taken from them, and the same 
work performed. Four of these 
experts were tested, and the same 
result, the same testimony is given 
to the work by the typesetters that 
is given by the test of the students, 
that alcohol, even small quantities 
is not good for man. 

The Swedish government tried it 
among its soldiers. I think it was 
Lieutenant Boyl who was given that 
responsibility, and he chose his 
sharpshooters ; watched carefully 
the tests, and noted the rapidity of 
the shots when the men were not 
under the influence of alcohol. He 
counted the number of shots when 
in their normal state and compared 
the number when small quantities of 



alcohol had been administered, 
sometimes even twenty-four hours 
before the test ; and in all cases but 
one the test proved that the soldier 
in his normal state excelled himself 
when he was under the influence of 
the liquor, that is, when he had 
liquor in him, even to the extent of 
three tablespoonfuls, though taken 
hours before the test, or immedi- 
ately before, he could not come up 
to his record made when he was in 
his normal state. The government 
soldiers there proved the truth, by 
experiment, that alcohol, strong 
drink is not good. But here — The 
students thought they were adding 
more rapidly when they had the al- 
cohol in them ; the typesetters 
thought they were doing more rap- 
id work when they had the alcohol 
in them; the soldiers thought they 
were shooting more rapidly when 
drinking; but in each case they 
were deceived. The professors and 
those conducting the experiments 
proved beyond a doubt that the men 
upon whom the test was applied 
undermined their ability when they 
had taken the drink, though but lit- 
tle had been given to them ; and 
this was extended to quantities. 

I am glad that our government, 
the greatest on earth, has also de- 
clared that strong drink is not good 
for man. It came about this way: 
One hundred years ago or more, 
this government made a celebrated 
treaty with the Indians, the treaty 
of the five nations. Soon after that 
treaty was made, the chief was in- 
vited to a banquet at Baltimore, and 
he was asked to give a speech, and 
to ask for what he wanted. "Little 
Turtle" was his name, and the inter- 
pretation of that speech is in the 
archives of the Congressional library 
at Washington. The representa- 
tives of our government, no doubt, 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



expected him to say what material 
gifts his people would like from the 
government. This is what he said : 

_ "Brothers and friends,— It is this 
liquor that causes our young men to go 
without clothes, our women and chil- 
dren to go without anything to eat. Sor- 
ry am I to mention it to you, brothers, 
that the evil is increasing every day. 
Brothers, when our young men have 
been out hunting and return home load- 
ed with skins and furs, on their way, 
if they come along where some of this 
whiskey is deposited, the white man who 
sells it tells them to take a little of it 
and drink. Some will then say, 'No, I 
do not want it.' They go to the next ; 
it is there again offered. They refuse 
again, the second time ; and finally the 
fourth or fifth time one accepts it and 
takes a drink ; and getting one he wants 
another, then a third and fourth until 
his senses have left him. After his rea- 
son comes back again, he gets up and 
finds where he is. He asks for his pel- 
try. The answer is, 'You have drunk 
them.' 'Where is my gun?' 'It is gone.' 
'Where is my blanket?' 'It is gone.' 
'Where is my shirt?' 'You have sold it 
for whiskey.' Now, brotners, figure to 
yourselves what a condition this man 
must be in. He has a family at home, 
a wife, and children that stand in need 
of the profits of his hunting. This, 
brothers, I can assure you is a fact that 
often happens amongst us. As I have 
before observed, we have no means to 
prevent it. It is not an evil, brothers, 
of our own making. We have not placed 
it amongst ourselves." [Can you doubt 
that the blood of Israel was in that old 
chief's veins?] "It is an evil placed 
amongst us by the white people. We 
look up to them to remove it out of the 
country. Our repeated entreaties to 
those who brought this evil amongst us, 
we find, have not the desired effect. We 
tell them, brothers, to fetch us useful 
things ; bring goods that will clothe our 
women and children, and not this evil 
liquor that destroys our reason, that de- 
stroys our health, that destroys our 
lives ; but all we can say on this sub- 
ject is of no service, nor gives relief to 
your red brethren. Our young men say 
we had better be at war with the white 
people. This liquor which they brought 
into our country is more to be feared 
than the gun and the tomahawk. There 



are more of us dead since the treaty 
of Greenville than we lost by the six 
years' war; and it is all owing to the 
introduction of this liquor amongst us. 
Brothers and friends, since the intro- 
duction amongst us of what you call 
spirituous liquors, and what we think 
may justly be called poison, our num- 
bers have greatly diminished; it has de- 
stroyed a great number of your red 
brethren." 

I will not say that this speech was 
the only thing that influenced our 
government to make the treaty with 
the Indians, but it was one thing 
that influenced them, and whatever 
else entered into it, this fact re- 
mains, that the government has de- 
clared that, so far as the Intlians are 
concerned, strong drink is not good. 
Soon after that, Congress passed 
this law : 

"The United States agrees to 
maintain strict laws in the territory 
of said nation, against the introduc- 
tion, sale, barter, or giving away of 
liquors or intoxicants of any kind 
or quality." And when these na- 
tions were about to be admitted as 
a state, in the Union, the people 
were concerned deeply as to this 
question, whether saloons would 
then be established in their midst. 
You will recall the fight that was 
on there, for two years, and you 
know that it was finally settled by 
the uniting of the Indian territory 
and the State of Oklahoma, and the 
whole was called Oklahoma ; and in 
the constitution there today we find 
a repetition of this promise bv the 
government, that for the next twen- 
ty-one years, at least, there is a 
total prohibition of the sale, barter, 
or giving away of intoxicating li- 
quors in the new state of Oklahoma, 
and as long thereafter as the peo- 
ple maintain it, that is, until they, 
by vote, change that constitution. 
Our government, in its treaty with

these Indians, affirms the truth, 
strong drink is not good. 

You have confirmed it in your 
own experience. There is, perhaps, 
not one person in the sound of my 
voice who cannot now think of some 
dear relative, or some dear school- 
mate or friend whose life testifies 
that strong drink is not good; and 
you know that at one time that 
young man said : "I will take only 
a little. I can stop it. I have not 
the appetite." But It soon got hold 
of him, and diminished his power 
from the beginning until he lost 
wife — (I have in mind one man 
now, as I repeat these words), un- 
til he lost wife, children, position, 
honor, life itself. You, perhaps, 
have stood by the grave of just such 
a loved one, and you felt and knew 
that he was filling a drunkard's 
grave. 

Well, but we all accept that truth, 
you say, and the only question is 
upon the best means of ridding our- 
selves of the evil. On the twenty- 
seventh of June, this year, all Is- 
rael, at least in this state, shall have 
an opportunity to declare them- 
selves in favor of or against God's 
truth that alcohol, strong drink in 
any of its forms is not good for 
man. They will tell you, We want 
to get rid of the saloons all right, 
but we can't do it. Prohibition, they 
will say, will, not prohibit. I say, 
prohibition will prohibit as well as 
any other law will prohibit the 
transgression of it. Two things we 
ought to keep in mind, — First, we 
want the sentiment of the people 
back of it; and second, we want offi- 
cers elected in the communities 
who are in harmony with that 
public sentiment. Who make the 
public sentiment ? You people ; 
every man, by the expression of his 
thought, by his act, in his business 



circles, in his meetings, in his home 
everywhere ; every one contributes 
to that public opinion. Do not think 
that other men control it; and con- 
clude that just because another man 
says public opinion is not in favor 
of it, that you are justified in chang- 
ing your idea on it. You contribute 
to that public opinion. If you think 
strong drink is not good, then give 
expression to that thought, and you 
contribute in making the public sen- 
timent or opinion in your communi- 
ty in favor of the truth — Strong 
drink is not good for man. It is 
in your power to elect men who will 
enforce that law. I have in mind 
now the remark of one of our best 
chiefs of police who, when asked 
the question, "If this state go dry, 
can you with your force find out 
where they are selling liquor unlaw- 
fully?" "Yes," said he, "if the pub- 
lic sentiment is back of it, we can 
stop the illegal selling." The testi- 
mony of twenty-nine district judges 
of the thirty-eight in the state of 
Kansas is to the effect that prohi- 
bition prohibits ; that this law can 
be enforced just as well as the law 
against horse-stealing or any other 
crime. Governor Stubbs of that 
state testifies to the same fact. 

They will tell you that we will go 
dry if our neighboring town will go 
dry. For example : Fairview will 
vote dry, if Mount Pleasant will go 
dry. Ogden will go dry, if Salt 
Lake will go dry. That argument 
can be answered by showing that it 
is a poor business investment for 
any town to license saloons. They 
will say, also, that it will demoral- 
ize our business interests — we need 
the revenue. Oh, I wish that ob- 
jection might be answered as a Jap- 
anese lawmaker answered a similar 
objection, when that government 
was passing a prohibitory law 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



against the use of cigaretteis. A, 
man arose in the house of peers, M. 
Izawa, and said : "A few days ago 
some one sent us some printed mat- 
ter. What was written thereon? It 
was written that should this bill be- 
come a law of the nation, there 
would be a loss of yen 200,000 to 
the national treasury. Nonsense ! 
He is a traitor ! He is willing to 
sacrifice the character of our youths 
simply for yen 200,000. What wick- 
edness ! Such person would most 
surely try to urge the use of opium 
by and by. As there are such 
traitors, this bill must by all means 
be carried unanimously, and thus 
the honor and wisdom of this House 
will be vindicated before the pub- 
lic." 

The bill passed unanimously, and 
today, that prohibitory law is in 
force in the country of Japan. But 
that is not a sufficient answer to 
those who think of it in a business 
way. You know it is sometimes 
charged that it is a Utopian idea to 
seek for prohibition under present 
conditions ; but it is also a practical 
idea, for the largest business con- 
cerns in the United States today 
have adopted it ; the railroads con- 
trolling a business that excels all 
others unless it be the insurance 
companies, have adopted prohibitory 
measures among their employees. It 
was not so a few years ago. Now, 
they have not adopted it just for 
moral purposes ; they found out it 
was to their financial interest, to in- 
troduce prohibitory laws. I could 
read of railroad after railroad that 
has passed prohibitory law in regard 
to its employees, and today the rail- 
road men stand on a much higher 
elevation, and the million men en- 
gaged in that work, carrying in 
their power millions of people, oc- 
cupy a higher position, socially, 



morally, and financially, because of 
the adoption of these measures. The 
insurance companies the same. Here 
is another thing : a Mr. Boyce, who 
has studied this question, for years, 
in the United States, gives out the 
statement, that crime, in the United 
States costs this government $6.20 
for every man, woman, and child 
in the nation. He says further that 
the crimes due to alcohol cost out 
of that $6.20, $4.34. This average 
is obtained after careful study — 
the result of an investigation of 
years. What does it mean when 
applied? It means that in Ogden, 
where there are fifty saloons, ap- 
proximately, each one giving to the 
city council a license, that is a con- 
tribution or tax of $1,200 a year, 
givesi to the city council an income 
of $60,000 a year — quite an income ; 
it keeps down your taxes ; doesn't 
it ? So men say "we do not want to 
do away with that revenue. We do 
not want to do away with it because 
we need that revenue to pave side- 
walks, to build the sewer, to bring 
the water from the mountains into 
our homes." They did not stop to 
consider the cost of paving streets 
with the broken hearts of women, 
and the depraved souls of men. But 
$60,000, let us see, — if those figures 
of Mr. Boyce be correct, Ogden 
pays $4.34 for the 26,000 people in 
that town, making an expenditure 
of $112,000 to offset the $60,000! 
Salt Lake City has about 140 
saloons, each one paying $1,500 an- 
nually, making an income to this 
city of $210^000, approximately. 
Ninety thousand inhabitants here. 
According to the average of crime 
in the United States, Salt Lake pays 
out $390,000 when it receives only 
$210,000. Cut down that expense 
of $4.34 to $2.17 and then where is 
the gain? Where is the gain? 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY.

A few years ago, a slave in the 
United States was worth $1,000. Is 
not your boy worth as much, from 
a business standpoint? And the 
state is only a business. Is not that 
boy worth a thousand dollars to 
the state and to this nation ? Count 
the number of ruined boys at a 
thousand dollars ; add that to the 
expense of crime and then see 
whether it is good business to keep 
the open saloon. I think it is not. 
We are standing in our own light. 
Governor Stubbs, after twenty years 
experience, that is, after Kansas has 
had twenty years experience, gives 
this testimony regarding the finan- 
cial phase of it: "I assert," he 
says, "that the business of Kansas 
has made more progress since the 
banishment of the saloon and the 
adoption of prohibition." Wichita 
was the last town in Kansas to go 
dry. The great argument was that 
it would ruin business. This is the 
testimony : "Three years ago, open 
saloons were abolished in Wichita. 
Since then weekly clearances have 
increased from $1,400,000 to $3,- 
200,000," and so on, showing im- 
provement on all sides. 

There is another evil that is sec- 
ond only to the saloon evil, namely, 
the evil of cigarette smoking ; which 
is growing among the young. The 
Lord says, in the same revelation, 
"Tobacco is not for the body, and 
is not good for man." Let the quor- 
ums throughout the Church make a 
strenuous effort to free every man 
and boy who has contracted that 
habit, from the indulgence in it. Sci- 
ence proves, experiments prove in 
athletics, among soldiers, in the 
schools, the government, the rail- 
roads, the truthfulness of God's 
word in regard to tobacco. The 
waste in this government annually, 
from this source, is enormous. 



When we say it costs three million 
dollars, eight million dollars. 
whatever the total is, I can't rec^v,. 
it means nothing to us ; but the su- 
perintendent of the sanitariums in 
England, Australia, and America, 
has placed this so that we can un- 
derstand it : 

"The amount spent in the United 
States alone, for tobacco, each year, 
would enable me to provide 30,000, fam- 
ilies each year with all the necessities 
of life; in addition I could grant an al- 
lowance of $5,000 to each of 10,000 fam- 
ilies ; to each of 10,000 others I could 
give $10,000; to each of 1,000 other heads 
of families I could make a Christmas 
present of $50,000; to each of another 
1,000 I could give $100,000; and besides 
to each of 500 of my best friends I could 
make an annual allowance of $1,000,000. 
After doing all this I would still have 
left each year $20,000,000 to bestow on 
charitable institutions, and at least $10,- 
000,000 left to keep the wolf from the 
door. Four hundred years ago," he 
says, "the use of tobacco was unknown 
in civilized lands. Today it is used by 
men, women, and children. Degeneracy 
has been the result. What the coming 
generations will be, if this curse con- 
tinues to increase, as it has in the past, 
does not present a picture pleasant to 
contemplate." 

Brethren and sisters, the Lord has 
said to us, these things are not good. 
We know that He has spoken, and 
that He has given this and other 
truths to the world. Oh, I plead 
that we may, as a people, stand true 
from now on, as we never have be- 
fore, to this divine word, that we 
may set an example to the world, 
in temperance, and sobriety, and 
that our fair state and every city 
therein, Salt Lake and Ogden in- 
cluded, may declare on the 27th of 
June, against the vile, insidious, 
treacherous and damning influence 
of the open saloon. May we live 
up to the other principles of the 
Gospel of Christ, and show to the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



world that God has spoken to us, 
that Joseph Smith was a true proph- 
et, that his successors are inspired 
men and His prophets, that the 
president of this Church stands as 
His mouthpiece to the people, and 
that the Latter-day Saints — reviled 
and persecuted, however much they 
may be — stand today as the choicest 
and purest people in the world. 
This is my prayer, and I ask it, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The contralto solo, "Fear not ye, 
oh Israel," was rendered by Sister 
Florence Jeppersen. 

EIDEE J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

In a revelation given in the year 
1831, the Lord says: 

"Behold, thus saith the Lord unto 
the elders of his Church, who are to 
return speedily to the land from 
whence they came. Behold, it pleas- 
eth me, that you have come ud hither; 

"But with some I am not well 
pleased, for they will not open their 
mouths, but hide the talent which I 
have given them, because of the fear 
of man. Wo unto such, for mine an- 
ger is kindled against them. 

"And it shall come to pass, if they 
are not more faithful unto me, it shall 
be taken away, even that which they 
have; 

"For I, the Lord, rule in the heav- 
ens above, and among the armies of 
the earth; and in the day when I shall 
make up my jewels, all men shall 
know what it is that bespeaketh the 
power of God." 

In connection with the revelation 
I will say this : The day of the Lao- 
dicean is past, "because thou art 
lukewarm, and neither cold nor 
hot," saith the voice that spake on 
the Isle of Patmos, I will spue thee 
out of my mouth. "There are whole 
men whose mere bodies are in 



shameful service, but these half 
men, these Laodiceans, are the ser- 
vile souls ; they are not worth the 
trouble and expense of damnation." 
(Laughter.) 

I am very proud to say of my- 
self, as I am going to speak about 
myself, a few minutes, although it 
is a little personal, I am proud to 
testify to the Latter-day Saints that 
I feel in my heart that every ser- 
vant of the Lord who has spoken 
from this stand has felt perfectly 
free to say the things that they felt 
were proper to say, and which the)' 
were inspired of the Lord to say. I 
appreciate the difficulties ; I com- 
prehend that there are those, per- 
haps, in the Church and out of it, 
that cut, and cull, and criticize, and 
that is about all they do do; they 
are disposed to close the mouths of 
the prophets. I have not had very 
much experience in prophesying, 
but will ask the Latter-day Saints: 
If you prophesy do you stop to 
think about it, and wonder how the 
people will receive it? I take the 
position that there is no man living 
that was inspired of God, and 
prophesied in the name of the Lord, 
who took time to think about it ; in- 
spiration does not come that way. 

I remember something I said 
once; I tried to forget it, but it got 
in the Associated Press, and it went 
all over the land. It is the only 
time I ever did get any notoriety. 
(Laughter.) The grave question 
was, did he say it? I could not 
help but think of the young man 
who opened this meeting by prayer, 
of his own volition he got the signa- 
tures of eighteen men, intelligent 
men, business men, who signed a 
document to the effect that I did 
not say it. But the word had gone 
out that I did say it. Some of the 
brethren said, "Well, it sounded 
like him." Another good brother 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



69 



that wanted to help me out, said, 
"He did not say it, but he was not 
wise." That good brother killed 
me right there. (Laughter.) You 
let it go out only once, among the 
children of men, that you are not 
wise, and you might just as well go 
off and die. (Laughter.) 

We know what has transpired in 
this conference. The president of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints delivered his mes- 
sage, that a wayfaring man could 
read as he walked, or that a child 
could understand, and yet he was 
made an offender. Are we going 
to close our mouths? Are we going 
to be hushed to silence, and be timid 
about calling this people to repent- 
ance and teaching them the word 
of the Lord? Well, I guess not, 
I haven't enough at stake. "I do 
not know just where I am going, 
but I know mighty well I am on my 
way." (Laughter.) 

I will deliver a word to this gen- 
eration, and I have it written down 
— You reporters have got to give it 
right, because I am going to read 
it. I have thought it out, and I am 
fixed and fastened ; I have got both 
feet on the ground. 

It shall not be my intention to 
cut, and cull, and criticize, but 1 
assume that the Bible, Book of 
Mormon, and Doctrine and Cove- 
nants communicate to us a correct 
knowledge of God, and human duty 
and destiny, or that nothing what- 
ever is known of them. I have a 
fervent faith that God reveals His 
mind and will to the servants of the 
Lord. I believe in revelation ; I be- 
lieve that God can communicate to 
me all things that pertain to me and 
to my labor ; and I assert that in the 
degree in which these books have 
been received by the Latter-day 
Saints, as a rule of faith and duty, 



have those thus receiving them 
found rest, peace, fearlessness of 
the future and hope of everlasting 
happiness. 

I do not get down in print very 
often, but today I am going to get 
in print with my testimony of this 
work, after over twenty years' la- 
bor. I know that "this is life eter- 
nal, that they might know thee, the 
only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom thou hast sent." "All things 
are delivered unto me of my Fath- 
er; and no man knoweth the Son, 
but the Father; neither knoweth 
any man the Father, save the Son 
and he to whomsoever the Son will 
reveal Him." That is how we find 
it out. I am a son of a prophet, but 
I never got my knowledge and in- 
formation from my father. I ex- 
pect to get it from the same sources 
from which he received it; and if I 
live as close to God as he lived, 1 
will have the same knowledge of 
God as he had, and know that Jesus 
is the Christ. I have faith in God. 
These are some of my reasons, and 
that is why I love God. I think 
God, the Father, and Jesus Christ, 
the Son, are greater than >men, 
greater than any prophets who have 
ever lived on earth. The Doctrine 
and Covenants tells us that "God 
does not walk in crooked paths, 
neither does He turn to the right 
hand, or to the left, or vary from 
that which He has said; therefore 
His paths are straight, and His 
course is one eternal round." "He 
is the God of Truth, and cannot 
lie." "He is no respecter of per- 
sons." "He is the God of love, of 
knowledge, of power, of justice, of 
judgment, and of mercy." 

Now, why should we not have 
faith in God the Father and in Jesus 
Christ. You all have an equal 
chance ; He is no respecter of per- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sons; He is a God of truth. You 
never need be in doubt about those 
matters. I think some of us are 
mistaken ; I think we have gone off 
wrong; I think that we expect sal- 
vation without doing very much to 
get it. It is all in vain for men to 
think that they merely need to have 
faith, and repent, and be baptized, 
and receive the Holy Ghost by the 
laying on of hands, and then their 
salvation is made sure. There never 
was a greater mistake. "It is in 
vain for persons to fancy to them- 
selves that they are heirs with those 
or can be heirs with those who 
have offered their all in sacrifice, 
and by this means obtained faith 
in God, and favor with Him, so as 
to obtain eternal life, unless they, 
in like manner, offer unto Him the 
same sacrifice, and through that of- 
fering obtain the knowledge that 
they are accepted of Him." 

"For a man to lay down his all, 
his character and reputation, his 
honor, and applause, his good name 
among men, his houses, his lands, 
his brothers and sisters, his wife 
and children, and even his own life, 
counting all things but filth and 
dross for the excellency of the 
knowledge of Jesus Christ, requires 
more than mere belief that he is 
doing the will of God." It calls 
for an actual knowledge, does it 
not, Latter-day Saints ? A man who 
gets off on this is in a very sad con- 
dition. Some of us know how a 
man feels who hasn't that spirit — 
one who has become careless and 
indifferent. The Lord knows if 
there is any one I sympathize with 
it is a man who is not doing his 
duty and who is a member of this 
Church, because I know how he 
feels. I am going to tell you how 
he feels, because I know whereof I 
speak. I have been in that place, in 
the history of my life. 



"A man who considers his re- 
ligion a slavery has not begun to 
comprehend the real nature of re- 
ligion. To such men, religion is a 
life of crosses and mortifications. 
They find their duty unpleasant and 
onerous. It is to them a law of re- 
straint and constraint. They art 
constantly oppressed with what 
they denominate 'a sense of duty.' 
It torments them with a conscious- 
ness of their inefficiency and with a 
multiplied perplexing doubt of the 
genuineness of their religious ex- 
periences. They feel themselves en- 
chained within the bounds of a re- 
ligious system." That is the feeling 
of every man who is careless, and 
every man who is indifferent. Are 
they happy in that condition? I say 
no ; only those are happy who are 
doing their duty. I think it is 
about time some of us got "off the 
train." T t doesn't take much cour- 
age to get in the Church, but I want 
to tell you it takes a mighty brave 
man to get out of it. The question 
is, do we really love Christ? That 
is the whole question. I am made 
to feel more and more that the re- 
ligion of the Latter-day Saints is to 
be tested in this generation. "Our 
fathers died for the faith, and so 
with our mothers, and we are liv- 
ing on the faith of our fathers and 
mothers, a great many of us." We 
have never made the sacrifice, and 
we are unwilling to prepare our- 
selves for it. I remember, only a 
short time ago, that we had recom- 
mended to us in a certain district 
seven or eight elders to be ordained 
seventies. They were interviewed 
properly by one of the brethren, and 
after they got through interview- 
ing them, they asked me if I had 
anything to say, and I said, "Yes." 
I asked these seven men if they had 
ever been on a mission? "No, sir." 
"Have you ever been inquired af- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



71 



ter?" "No, sir." Some of them 
were pretty near as old as I am. 
"Have you any desire to go ; if you 
have, raise your right hand." There 
was not a hand that went up. Have 
any of you brethren made the ef- 
fort to prepare yourselves ?" Not a 
hand went up. Now, those breth- 
ren were good men. I will tell you 
seventies how you can tell that you 
really are seventies. After you 
have been ordained a seventy, 
by proper authority, if the time 
never comes in your life that you 
desire to go on a mission, and that 
you make no effort to go, it shall be 
evidence to you that you are not a 
witness for God, that the spirit of 
your calling has not yet come to 
you. Now, I take it ror granted it 
wont come very often to some of 
us, but it ought to come in every 
man's life in this Church — that he 
has that hunger, that desire, and 
makes the effort to be a witness for 
God and preach the gospel. 

Brethren, in conclusion: I am 
not satisfied with my labors. I want 
to make that confession before the 
Latter-day Saints. I feel that I 
have not done my full duty ; in that 
regard, there is no man in the 
Church more unhappy than I am; 
but it is a result of my condition, 
my physical condition. But, I have 
filled my niche, and I have filled it 
the best I could. I want to say to 
the Latter-day Saints, the brethren 
of the authorities have extended to 
me every kindness that can be ex- 
tended to mortal man. I want to 
express my appreciation of their 
kindness in relieving me of some 
responsibilities, and let me live a 
little bit longer. I have given you 
Latter-day Saints the best of my 
life, the best effort of my life. 

Now, brethren, I plead for fra- 
ternity; I plead for love of each 
other. If we can't find friends 



among the Latter-day Saints, and 
those who will speak a good word 
for us, even when we are "unwise," 
without putting in those infernal 
expressions, "Yes, he is a good 
man, but if — " I wish to the Lord 
you would leave those things out. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RTJLON s. WELLS. 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

I desire to indorse, with all my 
soul, the remarks of my brethren 
who have preceded me. I rejoice 
exceedingly in the spirit of " this 
meeting, for I recognize it as the 
Spirit of the Lord. 

While Elder McKay was address- 
ing this congregation, upon the sub- 
ject of the Word of Wisdom and 
the great cause of temperance, I 
thought, too, how long has this 
word been preached to the Latter- 
day Saints, and how often have I 
heard people express themselves 
that they thought there was alto- 
gether too much stress laid upon 
the Word of Wisdom, and why do 
we not speak upon the weightier 
matters -of the law? It is the cus- 
tomary thing, when this subject is 
being treated upon to refer to it as 
the great law of health. Statistics 
are presented whereby it is conclu- 
sively shown that our physical or- 
ganization, our mental faculties, our 
bodies, are impaired in their use- 
fulness and in their powers by the 
violation of this law of temperance. 
It is my purpose, while indorsing it 
as the great law of health, to refer 
to it now from another standpoint. 
I believe that it is not only a law 
of health unto the people, but that it 
is the basis of our moral life. What 
shall we call the weightier matters 
of the law, if it be not virtue, hon-

esty, sobriety, integrity? I believe 
that underlying this law of health 
we also find the basic principle of 
spirituality, of moral life. The 
man who yields to the bowl will 
yield to other temptations. The 
man who is able to say No to it 
can also say no to other temptations 
when they come to him. And is it 
not true that those who yield to the 
use of strong drink have little pow- 
er of resistance to say No when the 
tempter comes in their way to lead 
them into the' paths of evil in oth- 
er forms? The mind and the body, 
the spirit and the body, are closely 
associated, the one depending upon 
the other ; and a strong mind should 
have a strong body to sustain it. 
The development and the care we 
take of our bodies, the improving of 
our physical condition is felt upon 
our spirit as well. Whenever we 
cleanse and purify the body, by ab- 
staining from those things that are 
impure, unhealthful, and unwhole- 
some, we elevate the soul of man ; 
for the body and the spirit consti- 
tute the soul of man, the relation- 
ship between the two is very close, 
you cannot impair the one without 
impairing the other. The man who 
is able to resist the temptation of 
those things which appeal to his ap- 
petite, his physical appetite, obtains 
power to overcome and resist evil 
in all of its forms. How can we, 
then, lay too much stress upon the 
Word of Wisdom, and upon that 
which pertains to our physical de- 
velopment, or that which pertains 
to the health of the body, for it is 
an important part of the soul of 
man. The Word of Wisdom has al- 
ways appealed to me from this 
standpoint as well as from the other. 
I believe that every one who obeys 
it, and avoids those tilings that are 
harmful to the body, will obtain 



spiritual, as well as physical, power ; 
his intellect will improve, and his 
desire for good will be increased. 

It seems to me, although I under- 
stand it is merely accidental, that a 
more fitting time for this people to 
give expression to their views on 
the question of Temperance, could 
not have been chosen than the day 
selected, June 27. It was on this 
day, in 1844, when the martyr of 
this latter dispensation gave his life 
for the cause of right. He devoted 
his life, and finally gave it up, to 
establish truth in the earth. I hope 
that every Latter-day Saint will 
make it known what his or her sen- 
timents are. What difference does 
it make, in one sense, whether or 
not the cause of temperance shall 
succeed — let it at least be under- 
stood that this people are in earn- 
est, are sincere, and that they do be- 
lieve in that principle. To my mind, 
every man that votes for the open 
saloon is voting against principle ; 
and I do not believe that he can jus- 
tify himself in that attitude. Can 
we become a party to the evil? Is 
the saloon a good thing? If it is 
let us tolerate it, let us encourage it, 
and build it up; but if we are con- 
vinced that it is an evil, let us do 
our utmost to abolish the evil. If 
we consent that it shall exist in our 
midst, if we, the people, author- 
ize our representatives who shall sit 
in the councils of our government, 
to issue licenses permitting it to con- 
tinue, and receive money for it, we 
become a party, and the taint of 
impure money is upon our souls. 
That is the way I feel in regard to 
the saloon. I do not believe that 
Latter-day Saints can justify them- 
selves in voting for an evil and be- 
coming a partner with the evil 
doer. 

Let me call your attention to 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

paragraph four of section 89. 
(Word of Wisdom.) 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, in consequence of evils and 
designs which do and will exist in the 
hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and forewarn 
you, by giving unto you this word of 
wisdom by revelation, that inasmuch as 
any man drinketh wine or strong drink." 
etc. 

I have often read this passage and 
wondered what was meant by it. 
What connection is there between 
the evils and designs existing in the 
hearts of conspiring men and the 
indulgence in strong drink prohib- 
ited by this revelation? 

Let us see : All over this fair 
land we read of a conflict between 
the "wets" and the "drys." How 
vast sums of money are being raised 
to defeat the cause of Temperance. 
Irrespective of whether the saloon 
interests have a right to resist the 
efforts of the people to do away 
with their unholy traffic. I mention 
it here merely to show that they 
do resist — that they are organized — 
that they raise immense sums of 
money; and for what? To defeat 
temperance ; that they may contin- 
ue their business, of destroying 
manhood, undermining character, 
debauching both men and women, 
corrupting politics, and making 
criminals and all this without hav- 
ing to their credit one single re- 
deeming feature, not one. What 
good can be traced back to the sa- 
loon? Has anyone been made bet- 
ter or nobler through its influence? 
Has it been a public benefactor? 
Has it been a friend to the home? 
A promoter of happiness or pros- 
perity? No, but still they organ- 
ize and raise money. No noise 
about it but quietly, secretly they 
get together, concoct their schemes, 



lay their plans, conspire and plot 
to defeat the right. There is money 
in this business and they must save 
it at all hazards. What care they 
as to the effect of their business as 
long as they make money? What 
care they for the morals of the com- 
munity — for the virtue of the 
young? What care they for the 
misery, the poverty, the wretched- 
ness which they scatter abroad. 
How many votes are bought with 
Rum? They can afford to spend 
great sums of money for their suc- 
cess. I will not undertake to sug- 
gest the extent of their machina- 
tions nor the various uses to which 
money can be and is applied for de- 
feating the right, but leave it for 
you to consider. 

My brethren and sisters, it is in 
consequence of these evils and de- 
signs among others existing in the 
minds of conspiring whiskey men, 
that the Lord through His Prophet 
hath warned us and doth now fore- 
warn us against the evils of Intem- 
perance. 

May the Lord help us to do our 
duty, on June 27th, and every day 
intervening between now and then, 
in working up, at least among the 
Latter-day Saints, a sentiment that 
shall sustain the right, — I ask it, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith an- 
nounced that a meeting will be held 
outdoors, this afternoon, adjacent 
to the Bureau of Information build- 
ing, in addition to the Conference 
meetings in the Tabernacle and As-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, April 9th, 1911. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Joseph F. Smith, Junior. 

The Farmer's Ward choir, under 
direction of conductor Einor Chris- 
tofferson, rendered the musical ex- 
ercises. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 

Then shall we know, and taste, and feel 
The joys that cannot be expressed. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
George H. Brimhall. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Unuttered or expressed ; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

Speaking at the anniversary 
meeting of the organization of the 
Relief Societies, in Denver, about 
three weeks ago, I chanced to re- 
fer to the condition of the women in 
our Church, how we honored and 
respected them, as God expects us 
to honor them, and, at the conclu- 
sion of our meeting, some of the 
sisters, who have never had the 
opportunity of living in Zion, said 
to me that they were glad the sub- 
ject was brought before them in 
that light, because they had not, up 
to that time, heard any particular 
reference to the women by the other 
elders whom they had met. I said 
to them that had it been their good 
fortune to live in Zion, or at least 
in some of the stakes of Zion, that 



they might hear frequent reference 
made to the women of our Church, 
and the important positions they oc- 
cupy in our organizations, and as- 
sociated with the affairs of men. 
But their remarks led me to think, 
Is it possible that when our elders 
go abroad that they forget the mis- 
sion of women in our Church? Is 
it possible that they forget the im- 
portant work accomplished by their 
mothers, their wives or their sis- 
ters? Is it possible that they mini- 
mize in any way the wonderful part 
that woman plays in the great plan 
of life and salvation? It occurs to 
me now that there are many here 
who have been on missions, and 
many others who may go, to such I 
say, I hope that wherever you are, 
either at home or abroad, that you 
will always be found voicing the 
praises of the women of "Mormon- 
dom," and testifying in regard to 
the great sacrifices they have made 
in the interest of the work of God. 

A short time ago, in one of the 
magazine articles that are appear- 
ing at this time, I read some of the 
statements attributed to a man who 
is considered to be a prominent 
writer, and he said, among other 
things, that the women in Utah are 
degraded, that they are nothing 
more nor less than slaves to the 
work of the home; that they are 
ignorant, and that, with the excep- 
tion of bearing children to unscru- 
pulous men, they know little of the 
real mission of woman. I though' 
how I would like to hear the voices 
of the women of this Church, if 
their voices could be heard abroad 
in this land, proclaiming to the 
world what their actual condition 
is, in refutation of those false asser- 
tions. I have spoken to some men 
who are well acquainted with writ- 
ers of this country, and I asked 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



75 



them what the reputation of this 
man was, who had made such a 
slanderous statement about the 
women of Utah. "Why," said one 
of them to me, "that man's word 
cannot be taken on any subject. He 
does not state the truth. It does 
not matter what subject he writes, 
upon, he grossly exaggerates it." 
It is very surprising that one of the 
great magazines of this country has 
opened its pages to a writer of that 
kind, a man who came to Salt Lake 
City, last year, and sought from a 
cab driver, one of the many dis- 
pensers of fairy tales that can be 
found upon these streets, some of 
the information which he is now 
giving to the world. 

I read some lines of poetry some- 
time ago, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, 
who shows the real condition, in 
America at least, today, and I 
should like to repeat them to you, 
and possibly make comparison with 
our people : 

"When God had formed the universe, 

He thought 
Of all the marvels therein to be wrought, 
And, to His aid fair Motherhood He 
brought, 

" 'My lesser self, the feminine of me, 
She will go forth throughout all time,' 

quoth He, 
"And make my world what I would 

have it be. 

" 'For I am weary, having labored so, 
And for a cycle of repose would go 
Into that silence which but God may 
know. 

" 'Therefore I leave the rounding of 
my plan 

To Motherhood; and that which God 
began, 

Let woman finish in perfecting man. 

" 'She is the soil, the human mother 
earth; 

She is the sun, who calls the seed to 
_ birth; 

She is the gardener who knows its 
worth. 



" 'In me all seed of any kind must 
spring; 

Divine the growth such seed and soil 

will bring, 
For all is me and I am everything.' 

"Thus having spoken to himself aloud, 
His glorious face upon his breast he 
bowed, 

And sought repose behind a wall of 
cloud. 

"Come forth, O God, though great thy 

thought and good 
In shaping woman for true mother- 
hood — 

Lord, speak again, she has not under- 
stood. 

"The centuries pass, the cycles roll 
along, 

The earth is peopled with a might} 
throng, 

Yet men are fighting and the world 
goes wrong. 

Lord, speak again, ere yet it be too 
late; 

Unloved,unwanted souls come throusrh 

earth's gate; 
The unborn child is given a dower of 

hate. 

"Thv world progresses in all ways • 
save one, — 

In motherhood, for which it was be- 
gun. 

Lord, Lord behold how little has been 
done. 

"Children are spawned, like fishes in 
the sand; 

With ignorance and crime they fill the 
land. 

Lord, speak again, till mothers under- 
stand. 

It is not all of Motherhood to know 
Creations' pleasure and deliverance's 
woe. 

Who plants the seed should help the 
shoot to grow. 

"And 'tis not alone for Motherhood 
to breed 

The human race, but to know and 
heed 

Its holiest purpose and its highest 
need. 

"Lord, speak again, so woman shall be 
stirred 

With the full meaning of that might} 
word, 

'True Motherhood;' she has not right- 
ly heard." 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There can be no question, refer- 
ring to the first half of these lines, 
that this woman speaks the truth'as 
God would have it known to hu- 
manity. The greatest law that He 
has given to man and to woman is 
to multiply and replenish the earth. 
Motherhood is the greatest blessing 
that God confers on woman. Wom- 
an's lot is hardest in this life, I be- 
lieve ; and that is one reason that 
she, is better than the average man, 
— because of having to pass through 
so much tribulation. It is said that 
woman, every time she bears a child 
into this world, lays her life on the 
altar. It is indeed a wonderful sac- 
rifice. And. then this thought, that 

"Woman is the soil, the human mother 
earth ; 

She is the sun who calls the seed to 
birth ; 

She is the gardener who knows its 
worth." 

Had these words been spoken by 
an inspired man, either in ancient 
or in modern time, they could not 
have been more truly said. The lat- 
ter part of the poem brings this 
thought, that many women today do 
not know what that message is to 
them. If they do, they do not ap- 
preciate it, for they do not live in 
accordance with this greatest com- 
mandment of God, they are not 
bearing children, they are not rais- 
ing them properly ; but, on the oth- 
er hand, 

"Children are spawned like fishes in the 
sand, 

With ignorance and crime they fill the 
land." 

The imputation contained in this 
verse surely cannot be urged 
against the women of "Mormon- 
dom." The figures that were giv- 
en out by President Smith in his 
remarks at the opening of this con- 
ference, on Thursday last, will give 



the lie to any such thought. When 
we consider the birth-rate among 
the members of this Church, and 
compare the figures with those of 
the rest of this great country of 
ours, or with other countries of the 
world, I say to you that any one 
who declares that women of our 
Church are not keeping this great- 
est commandment of God says 
something that is untrue. 

The Savior said that "man is not 
without the woman, neither woman 
without the man in the Lord." My 
brethren and sisters, God expects us 
to care for and to love our wives 
and our children; He expects us to 
provide for them and love them all 
the days of our lives. I hope that 
all who are here today will see to 
it that no man or woman shall say 
in your presence, unrebuked, aught 
against the women of the Latter- 
day Saints. They have borne seri- 
ous hardships and trials when 
their husbands and fathers have 
gone on missions, hardships even 
exceeding those borne by those who 
have left their homes and gone into 
the world to preach the gospel. 
They are entitled to our love, to 
our consideration, and to our bless- 
ing. 

God bless us all in this work, and 
make us equal to every emergency 
that we may be called upon to pass 
through in life, is my humble de- 
sire in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 

(President of Beaver Stake.) 

I have been very much impressed 
with the proceedings of our confer- 
ence thus far. I have rejoiced un- 
der the inspiration and teachings of 
those who have addressed us. It 
seems to me that the principal 
theme of the teachings that have 



ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 



77 



been given unto the people, during 
the conference, has been that upon 
each member of the Church there is 
a responsibility resting that he, or 
she, must bear evidence unto the 
world, in conduct in life, of the pur- 
ity and sincerity of the teachings 
proclaimed by the Latter-day 
Saints. We stand as a light upon 
a hill before the world today. In 
other words, "Mormonism" is on 
trial ; the acts of the Latter-day 
Saints are being watched by the 
world, and we are being judged by 
that which we engage in and do as 
a people. I rejoice in .the spirit of 
this work, for I know it is the work 
of God. We who have embraced 
this Latter-day work have a great 
mission to perform in the world. 
That mission is to bear witness of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, to bear testi- 
mony of the truths of the gospel, as 
revealed in the day and age in 
which we live ; not so much in word 
as in deed ; not so much in endeav- 
oring, by conversation, to convert 
those who are in our midst, as by 
our daily lives. We are required 
to let our light so shine that all men 
beholding our good works may re- 
alize that this is indeed the work 
of our Father. "Mormonism" 
stands today for truth, and right- 
eousness. It stands for the liberty 
of men, from a religious and social 
point of view. We bear the mes- 
sage unto the world, that those who 
will accept "Mormonism" and live 
in the true spirit thereof, that it 
will bring joy into their lives. We 
truly testify that it brings happi- 
ness to our homes and families. It 
places mankind on a higher level, 
makes better citizens, better hus- 
bands and wives, and so we bear 
evidence of this to the world. 

There is a spirit manifest in the 
world of mankind today to belittle 
the work of our Redeemer, to place 



as a standard for men the precepts 
of their fellow men, directing our 
attention from that course in life 
that the Gospel has prescribed for 
us to follow, holding out for vener- 
ation the ideas and thoughts of 
men, in contradistinction to the great 
eternal plan of salvation that God 
has revealed. One of the tenets of 
our faith, or principles of our be- 
lief as enunciated in the Articles of 
Faith, given unto the world by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, is this : "We 
believe all that God has revealed, 
all that he does now reveal, and 
we believe that He will yet reveal 
many great and important truths 
pertaining unto the kingdom of 
God." There may be some matters 
in connection with the great plan of 
life and salvation that have not been 
entirely made clear to the Latter- 
day Saints; but if we will act upon 
that which God has revealed for the 
salvation of His children, if we will 
follow the teachings of the gospel 
as taught by the Latter-day Saints, 
and manifest those teachings in out 
lives, there is no need for us to go 
into channels of science, so called, 
and endeavor to demonstrate by 
that means some of the great and 
eternal truths. We are not in the 
line of safety when we depart from 
the revealed word of God and seek 
to ascertain, by scientific principles, 
which have not yet been proven en- 
tirely true, a means of salvation for 
the human family. 

God has revealed himself unto 
the children of men in this day and 
we have learned from the revelations 
of Jesus Christ unto the people in 
this age of the world, that we are in 
the express image of God, we are 
His children; that Jesus is the 
Savior of the world, that He came 
in the meridian of time and gave 
His life as an atoning sacrifice for 
the sin of our father Adam, thereby

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



removing from the human family 
that fetter with which they were 
bound, and opened, through His 
atonement, a means of salvation 
whereby we might come forth from 
the tomb and enjoy a fulness of 
eternal life in His presence. This 
applies to all mankind, thus strik- 
ing off the bands of death, bursting 
open the grave, and ushering in 
the resurrection. These are glor- 
ious results of the labors of our 
Lord and Redeemer. Why should 
we, knowing these things to be true, 
having a testimony and witness in 
our hearts that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Mediator between man and our 
Father in heaven, the Author of out 
salvation, and that His is the only 
name given under heaven by which 
man can be saved, as stated in the 
scriptures of divine truth, knowing 
these things, why should we seek 
elsewhere for the greatest of all di- 
vine blessings, or for a demonstra- 
tion of these eternal principles ? 

Our young men go into the world 
to bear witness of the truth, to 
preach Christ and Him crucified. 
There is a spirit in opposition to 
the Latter-day Saints, but when the 
light of truth has come, when that 
enters into the hearts of men and 
women, they can then see and un- 
derstand what the message of 
• "Mormonism" is unto the world. 
It means life eternal. All mankind 
will be judged by the tenets of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We may in a manner deceive our- 
selves, in this life, by following af- 
ter the teachings of men ; they may 
appeal to us and to the desires of 
our hearts, but there is nothing that 
is reliable except the word of God, 
for the word of God is "sure and 
certain." It is an anchor to our 
souls, it elevates man from the 
lower planes of life, gives us higher 
ideals to live for, and places before 



us the responsibility attending oui 
actions in this life. We are inter- 
ested, in the first place, in our indi- 
vidual salvation. We are interested 
also in the salvation of the sons 
and daughters that God has given 
unto us in this life, and in the sal- 
vation of our relatives and friends. 
We are also interested in the exten- 
sive plan of salvation, in bringing to 
a knowledge of the truth those who 
are honest in the world, who have 
not yet received the message of 
"Mormonism." 

I rejoice today, my brethren and 
sisters, in the opportunity of engag- 
ing in the work of the Lord. I bear 
testimony to you that this is the 
work of God. If the world, who 
do not believe in "Mormonism," 01 
the message that we have to bear, 
could witness the large attendance 
at this conference, and the interest 
that is manifested by the Latter-day- 
Saints, it would be to them, it seems 
to me, a testimony that they could 
not ignore, for there is evident sin- 
cerity in our form of worship, in 
our devotion, in our acceptance of 
the revealed will and word of God, 
If we live up to that testimony, 
manifest its'truth in our lives, show 
the fruits thereof, then we have ac- 
complished, in a measure, that for 
which we came upon the earth. I 
have heard it advanced, by honor- 
able men with whom I have spoken, 
that the great duty of our lives is 
to observe the Golden Rule, to "do 
to others as we would have them do 
unto us." But the Savior gave us, 
in His day, to understand that that 
was not sufficient, that there is 
something greater for us to live 
for than the mere observance of 
this golden rule. We are told that 
when a certain young man came 
unto Him and said, "Master, what 
must I do that I may have eternal 
life?" the Savior said unto him 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS.

that he should keep the command- 
ments, that he should love the Lord 
with all his might, mind and 
strength, and his neighbor as him- 
self ; that he was to honor his father 
and his mother, and commit none of 
the crimes that were forbidden in 
the Law of Moses, etc. But the 
young man said unto him : "Lord, 
all these things have I observed 
from my youth up ; what else must 
I do in order that I may obtain eter- 
nal life?" Then the Savior said 
unto him, "Sell all thou hast and 
give unto the poor, and take up thy 
cross and follow me." The procla- 
mation of Christ's gospel is our 
mission to the world, the mission of 
"Mormonism." We declare unto 
the world that we must love God, 
the eternal Father, honor our earth- 
ly parents, observe to do those 
things that are in harmony with the 
scripture, the revealed will of God, 
and, in addition, we are to practice 
charity, giving unto those who are 
in destitute circumstances, then take 
up our cross and follow God. 

I bear testimony unto you that 
the gospel of Jesus Christ has been 
revealed in this day and age of the 
world, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the living God. In so far 
as we are following in the footsteps 
of the prophet, Joseph Smith, ob- 
serving those things that the Lord 
revealed through him, we are the 
chosen people of God. Our mission 
is to convert the inhabitants of the 
world, and bring them to a knowl- 
edge of the truth. Our mission is 
to proclaim the truth unto all man- 
kind, calling upon them to accept 
the testimony of the Latter-day 
Saints, and repent. 

May the Lord bless us, inspire us 
with His Spirit, direct our footsteps 
in the paths of duty, that we may 
come nearer unto our Father in 



heaven, that our testimonies may be 
strengthened from day to day, I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The ladies' chorus, "lift up thine 
eyes," was rendered by members of 
the choir. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mis- 
sion. ) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel in 
my heart that we should be a very 
grateful people. One of the great 
poets said that the crime of ingrat- 
itude was among the basest of 
crimes, and I believe it. I am grate- 
ful unto God for the prophets and 
apostles that He has established in 
this Church. I am thankful unto 
Him that one of the apostles pre- 
sides in this meeting. They are giv- 
en us by the Lord "for the perfect- 
ing of the Saints, for the work of 
the ministry, for the edifying of the 
body of Christ, till we all come in 
the unity of the faith." 

The Apostle John said, that "if 
we walk in the light, as he [God] is 
in the light, we have fellowship one 
with another, and the blood of Jesus 
Christ His Son cleanseth us from 
all sin." What joy, what pleasure 
is there outside the pale of the fel- 
lowship of our brethren and sisters ? 
To have fellowship one with anoth- 
er, to have a membership in the 
Church of the first born, is worth 
more than all the joys of the world, 
or the gold and the silver that are 
hidden in the depths of the earth. If 
a brother dislike a brother, if he has 
a feeling in his heart against one of 
his brethren, that feeling engenders 
prejudice in him against other 
brethren. It colors his opinions, and 
it is apt to warp his judgment with

respect to all mankind. It is nec- 
essary that we walk in the light in 
order that we may have fellowship 
one with another, and we will not 
then depart from the path of virtue 
and rectitude, and make shipwreck 
of our faith. 

The Apostle Paul said : "For ye 
know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that though he was rich, yet 
for your sakes he became poor, that 
ye, through his poverty, might be- 
come rich." What have we gained 
by reason of the earthly poverty 
and sufferings endured by the Lord 
Jesus Christ? We have gained eter- 
nal life, or the means of obtaining 
eternal life, and God has said : "Be- 
hold, he that hath eternal life is 
rich." We can see this same prin- 
ciple exemplified in the lives of the 
Latter-day Saints who are sending 
their sons and daughters into the 
world to preach the Gospel. Many 
a mother in Israel, because of the 
strain upon her financial resources 
in keeping her son in the mission 
field, is wearing a last year's hat, 
dress and coat. As a servant of the 
Lord, I say unto you, that the sac- 
rifice you are making is sacred unto 
the Lord. By your faith and self- 
denial you are placing within the 
reach of men and women the means 
of securing the riches of eternity. 

We are walking in the path of 
humility, and God is making us a 
power for good in the world. Af- 
ter all, brethren and sisters, there is 
more strength in the humility that 
comes from trusting in the Lord 
Jesus than in the strength of world- 
ly power. "When I am weak," said 
Paul, "then am I strong." So long 
as the Latter-day Saints put their 
trust in God; so long as they walk 
in the light, they will be clothed 
with a power that is invincible. They 
are guided and led by men who 



are blessed with inspiration and rev- 
elation from God : they have been 
led out of the darkness of the world 
into the sunshine of political and 
religious liberty. If we continue to 
pray to the Father and work hard 
to have our prayers fulfilled or an- 
swered, God will give us a goodly 
portion of His Holy Spirit. No 
man or woman need ever be afraid 
that the Almighty will suffer His 
chosen people to be led astrav by 
any man or set of men. I care not 
for the theories men may frame as 
to our existence, or the beginning 
of our existence. I know that God 
has said, through His Holy Spirit, 
that we are His sons and daughters, 
and that is comforting to my soul. 
We stand upon a sure foundation, 
for our faith rests not in the wis- 
dom of men, but in the power of 
God. 

It is true that many of our young 
men who go into the world to 
preach the Gospel, are not learned, 
that is, so far as worldly wisdom is 
concerned ; but I believe, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that you and I, in a 
measure, at least, are responsible 
for this. God, in His wisdom, has 
caused Church schools to be estab- 
lished. He has placed at the head 
of these great institutions men of 
God, men of wisdom, men of char- 
acter like President Brimhall, whose 
whole souls are in the work of the 
Lord. They yearn for the redemn- 
tion and the advancement of our 
young men and young women. Are 
we giving them earnest support ? Are 
we giving them, not only the "tip- 
port of our faith and prayers, but 
are we sending our children to these 
schools, in order that they may be- 
come qualified to go forth as min- 
isters of the Lord Jesus Christ? I 
have noticed in the mission field 
that young men who have attended 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



81 



these Church schools, are ready and 
qualified to enter upon their mis- 
sionary labors at once. Thev are 
learned, to a certain extent at least, 
in proportion to the time that they 
have been under the instruction of 
teachers in .these institutions, in the 
principles of the Gospel. But, more 
than all that, they come to the mis- 
sion field with the Spirit of God 
in their hearts. They have the spir- 
it of the work, which, after all, is of 
infinitely more value than the letter 
of the law, for "the Spirit giveth 
life." And when these boys, if you 
please to call them boys, stand be- 
fore congregations, they speak, not 
in the wisdom of men, but by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. The Book 
of Mormon declares that when a 
man speaketh by the power of the 
Holy Ghost his words are carried 
unto the hearts of the children of 
men. In many of the pulpits 
throughout Christendom today 
men are preaching more to win the 
praise of men than the approval of 
God, and their words, therefore, are 
as "sounding brass and a tinkling 
cymbal." But the servants of God, 
blessed with the Holy Ghost, the 
power that comes from above, and 
which enlightens the understand- 
ing of the people, preacn under that 
influence, and their words go di- 
rect to the hearts of their hearers. 

A long time ago there were cer- 
tain men, alchemists, they were 
called, who sought to transmute the 
baser metals into gold, but they 
failed. By right use, we. mav con- 
vert our gold and silver into "treas- 
ures in heaven." Croesus, the rich 
king of antiquity, when he was dy- 
ing, said: "What I have kept I 
have lost; what I gave away I 
have." His worldly possessions 
were slipping from his grasp but 
the money he had given for good 



and holy purposes was treasure laid 
up in heaven awaiting him "where 
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, 
and where thieves do not break 
through nor steal." We shall not 
be blessed for the amount of money, 
nor for the number of acres we 
have left behind us, but we shall be 
blessed and rewarded for that which 
we have given for the upbuilding 
of God's kingdom, and the advance- 
ment of righteousness in the earth. 
Is tithing a sacrifice? No, not in 
one sense of the word. It is the 
best investment we can make, for it 
is a treasure laid up in heaven. The 
tithing that we pay will make us 
rich, but the means that we leave 
behind us will not be to our ad- 
vantage when we go to the spirit 
world to be judged according to the 
deeds done in the body. 

Let us bring up our children in 
the fear of the Lord. Let us edu- 
cate them properly; send them to 
institutions where they are taught 
the word of God, where the heart, 
as well as the intellect is edu- 
cated. God sets great store on the 
heart. Solomon said : "Keep thine 
heart with all diligence, for out of 
it are the issues of life." 

I am reminded of a story told by 
the late Count Tolstoi, which I 
think will illustrate the point I wish 
to impress upon your minds, viz : 
that there is something else that 
should be sought besides worldly 
wealth; and that, after all, the pur- 
suit of, and the acquisition of earth- 
ly riches do not bring lasting pleas- 
ure and joy. The Count relates the 
story of a man who was land hun- 
gry. You know lots of men, don't 
you, that are land hungry, they 
want to go into a strange country 
and get much land. This man was 
one of that class, his present pos- 
sessions were insufficient for hi<= dp-

sires. So he journeyed to a far- 
off country, where there was a large 
tract of land to be secured for a low 
figure. He came to a vast domain, 
and the owner of it said to him : 
"Leave your money here, and all the 
land you can encompass between 
now and sunset shall be yours, but 
if you fail to get back to this point 
by sunset, -you lose your money and 
the land, too." This was at sun- 
rise, the man laid down his money 
and started out on a line due east. 
He walked at first, but the greedi- 
ness of his soul quickened his pace 
into a run. He went in this direc- 
tion as far as he dared to, for the 
sun was mounting high in the heav- 
ens. Then he ran in a northerly 
direction until the sun was in the 
meridian. Weak, and well nigh ex- 
hausted he laboriously and painfully 
ran toward the west, and the sun 
was rapidly nearing the western 
hills. Mustering all of his remain- 
ing strength for the final effort, 
bordering on the verge of absolute 
exhaustion, he managed by painful 
exertion and agony of mind and 
body to reach the starting point just 
as the sun sank out of sight. He 
had won the land, but in doing so, 
sacrificed his life, for he fell down, 
beside his money, dead. His ser- 
vant dug a hole to bury his body, 
and the man was soon forgotten. 
Do we not find similar cases among 
people we know? They exhaust 
their lives, spiritually and physical- 
ly, to amass wealth. They disre- 
gard the welfare of their children. 
Their sole object in life is gather- 
ing money. They neglect their 
Church duties. They feel that they 
cannot afford to pay their tithing; 
and when life's race is ended, when 
they are nearing the end of their 
earthly existence, behold,, thev are 
so exhausted that they pass away 



and miss their reward in the eternal 
mansions of our Father. 

God grant, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that our souls may ever be at- 
tuned to the dictates of the Holy 
Spirit; that our lives may begin 
and end in the service of the Lord, 
in the spirit of sacrifice, that every 
one of us may always have a humble 
heart and a contrite spirit. God 
grant that we may never forget 
what hath been done for us by 
the Lord, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

EIDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 

(President of Millard Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I hope 
to be led by the influence of the 
Spirit of the Lord, to be perfectly 
in tune with His Holy Spirit, that 
He shall manifest through me some- 
thing, or some lesson, that He 
would wish taught. 

It is my privilege to preside over 
a stake of Zion that, from point of 
territory, is perhaps one of the larg- 
est stakes of Zion, but, from the 
point of population, it is one of the 
smallest. Our stake boundaries are 
exactly the same as the boundaries 
of Millard County. At this time 
there is hardly a county that is re- 
ceiving more attention, perhaps not 
a county receiving more advertising, 
from the point of available land and 
water, than is Millard County. All 
of the waters of the Sevier river 
have been filed upon, and title ob- 
tained and reservoirs prepared for 
the impounding of that water. We 
think that, within the next year or 
two, we will not have to report that 
Millard Stake is one of the small 
stakes of Zion in point of popula- 
tion. There is no county within 
the State of Utah that has as much 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 



83 



available land, and as much water 
that is available to apply upon this 
land, as the County of Millard. Un- 
der the wise direction of those who 
have charge of these projects, we 
hope, and believe, that our county 
will be well populated, that the 
broad acres, which President Ly- 
man is pleased to term desert, which 
lies between the eastern and west- 
ern part of the stake, will be large- 
ly cultivated, and be inhabited by 
good, thrifty citizens. 

I was thinking, while the breth- 
ren were talking here today, that 
we could preach a good gospel ser- 
mon by the lives of the Latter-day 
Saints of that stake. I believe that 
we have not, not to my knowledge, 
at least, in a population of five thou- 
sand souls, one case of immorality 
at this date. I believe that we are 
free from the bondage of debt. We 
are not given to speculation. We 
have no producing mines, and but 
few people that leave the farm; as 
a consequence, our people are of 
modest means. As a witness to 
their faithfulness in the payment of 
tithes, let me make this announce- 
ment, that while we have suffered 
from loss by dams being swept out 
of the Sevier river, and while we 
had the responsibility and expense 
of building an academy which cost 
about twenty-one thousand dollars, 
yet the tithes of Millard Stake have 
increased until the year 1910 is 
shown to be the best for the payment 
of tithes in the history of that stake. 
When we listened to the figures 
that were given by President Smith, 
regarding the birth rate among 
members of the Church, which we 
were pleased to hear was heavier 
than among the people of any other 
country upon the face of the earth, 
it was gratifying to us to know that 
Millard Stake really exceeded the 



splendid record that was made by 
the Church. 

As a people we live in peace and 
harmony. Only a small percentage 
of the population of Millard Coun- 
ty are not Latter-day Saints, and 
among the small percentage there 
is no enmity toward us that I know 
of. Those that are not of our faith 
are good citizens, and there are no 
poor in Millard Stake. The Latter- 
day Saints, I believe, are recognized 
by all as neighbors that are honest, 
true, just, virtuous and benevolent, 
and that they believe in doing good 
unto all men. One of the greatest 
testimonies that I have, that appeals 
to me, is the fact that we never have 
a Latter-day Saint who is true and 
faithful in the discharge of his duty 
but who is contented and satisfied, 
and lives in the enjoyment of peace, 
under the direction and influence of 
the Spirit of the Lord that gives 
joy and satisfaction. 

I thank the Lord that the rewards 
for faithfulness in the Church are 
not all postponed until after the res- 
urrection. I thank the Lord that 
while we live in hope and faith, 
and in a knowledge of the glorv and 
blessings that await us in the future, 
yet the Lord rewards us every day 
of our lives by the whispering of 
peace unto our souls, giving us a 
knowledge of divine approval when 
our lives are in harmony with the 
requirements of the gospel. I ap- 
preciate this. The Lord teaches us 
through the gospel that we should 
lend a helping hand unto the erring, 
reach out and reclaim them, and 
save them, if possible. In the beau- 
tiful lesson taught in the parable of 
the prodigal son, we learn that when 
he had gone off and had wasted his 
goods, until the day of repentance 
came, he then thought of that which 
he had left behind and longed to re- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



turn unto his father. We can ap- 
preciate the spirit of that father 
when he received the repentant son 
back, placed his splendid mantle up- 
on him, killed the fatted calf for 
him, and placed a ring upon his 
finger. I also appreciate the les- 
son that is taught in the case of the 
other son, who had remained at 
home and who had been faithful, but 
was somewhat jealous of the atten- 
tion that had been given to the way- 
ward son, the father said unto the 
faithful one, "All that I have is 
thine." So, we learn that it is never 
too late to repent. We can repent 
and we will be rewarded for true re- 
pentance for returning unto the 
Lord. But if we never do that which 
necessitates repentance and return- 
ing, all that the Lord has will be 
given to those who are thus faith- 
ful from beinning to end. 

I thank the Lord that I have a 
testimony of the divinity of this 
work, and I rejoice in the knowl- 
edge that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. I rejoice also in 
the knowledge that Brigham 
Young, and the other presidents of 
the Church who have died and 
gone, were prophets. In my faith, 
I sustain also Joseph F. Smith, the 
present living head of the Church, 
as a prophet, seer and revelator. 
When I lift up my hand to siistain 
the authorities of the Church, the 
apostles and the presiding patriarch, 
as prophets, seers and revelators, I 
mean, before the Lord and before 
my brethren, that I sustain them 
in very deed as such ; and when they 
speak, under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord, I accept it as the 
voice of the Lord unto me and unto 
His people. I thank the Lord for 
all that he has done for us, and pray 
that His Spirit shall abide with us 
and lead us in the path of duty. We 



should teach the gospel by our daily 
walk in life, for that is the most 
magnificent sermon that it is possi- 
ble for us to preach. My words 
would be of but little value to the 
Latter-day Saints if I should teach 
them that the Word of Wisdom is 
the mind and will of the Lord, if 
my daily walk in life did not con- 
form to my precepts. I think that 
the mother's word and influence are 
seriously affected if she, through 
any weakness, real or imaginary, 
feels justified in partaking of tea 
or coffee, while she admits before 
her family that such indulgence is 
contrary to the mind and will of 
the Lord. It breeds a spirit of dis- 
respect for the revelations of the 
Lord when we treat any of His re- 
quirements or commandments with 
indifference, or as of little conse- 
quence. The Lord desires that we 
shall prove ourselves the best peo- 
ple upon the face of the earth, hav- 
ing received the truth, that we shall 
exemplify the truth in our lives. 

I have this hope, and I speak now 
of Millard Stake of Zion, that if 
those who shall come among us and 
make their homes with us, shall go 
upon the irrigation ditches or upon 
our construction work, that they 
shall discover that the young men 
of Millard Stake of Zion, who do 
such work, do not indulge in pro- 
fanity, and that they keep the Word 
of Wisdom. I trust they shall dis- 
cover that the voice of prayer is 
heard among those who work daily 
upon those public works ; that a 
blessing is said upon the food before 
it is partaken of. If they go among 
the families of the people, I hope 
they shall discover that the father, 
the mother, the son and the daugh- 
ter prays. If they purchase from 
us our farm products, I trust they 
shall discover that we give two 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

thousand pounds for a ton ; and that 
we are not dissipated in any way, 
but that we teach and practice the 
gospel of Jesus Christ in our daily 
walk in life. We brand as infa- 
mous the lies and misrepresenta- 
tions that are made against our peo- 
ple. Those who are honest that 
come into the midst of our people 
shall see and undertsand that we 
have been accused falsely ; they 
shall discover, that our lives bear 
witness to our faith in the Lord 
and the saving power of the gospel ; 
that they may do so is my praver in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. SMITH, JR. 

Blessed are they who obey when they 
hear the truth. — Admonition to rev- 
erence the Sabbath day. 

I was asked the question, yester- 
day, why the Latter-day Saints 
meet in general conference twice a 
vear. There are many reasons that 
might be given why the Saints so 
assemble. The most important one, 
perhaps, is that the Lord has com- 
manded it. We meet together to 
hear inspiring words and to be built 
up in the faith. We meet to be in- 
structed in our duty as members of 
the Church that we may more hum- 
bly and perfectly walk in the way 
of the Lord, keeping His command- 
ments that faith might increase 
among the Saints, and our hearts 
be inclined towards our heavenly 
Father. For the same reason we 
meet from time to time in stake con- 
ference in the various stakes, and in 
ward conference in the several 
wards throughout the Church, that 
we might be taught the command- 
ments of the Lord. 

We have heard many things dur- 
ing this conference that will be for 
our profit, providing we reflect up- 



on them and remember them, put- 
ting into practice such things as 
have been presented to us for our 
consideration. What does it profit 
us in assembling together to hear 
the words of the Lord as they may 
be given unto us from His ser- 
vants, if we go back to our homes 
and forget all that we have heard ? 
What will it profit us when we are 
admonished to keep the command- 
ments of the Lord if we go home 
and forget those commandments, 
and return, if we have been in the 
habit of walking in the ways of men, 
back into those ways? The Lord 
will judge us according to our 
works; He will judge us according 
to our knowledge and our opportu- 
nities. We are His people, with 
whom He has made covenant. He 
has gathered us out from the na- 
tions of the earth through the 
preaching of the gospel of salvation 
that we may learn of His ways and 
walk in His paths and rejoice in 
His truth. 

It is eighty-one years since the 
Church was established; and dur- 
ing all that time the people have 
been admonished and instructed in 
the way they should walk. The 
parents have been taught almost 
daily the things that have been pre- 
sented to us this morning — that 
they should teach their children the 
principles of the gospel, that they 
might not depart from them when 
they grow up and reach the age of 
accountability. We have received 
the truth and we know the truth. If 
we live not in accordance with the 
truth, then we will be held respon- 
sible. We know that it is required 
of us to pay our tithing. Blessed is 
the man who keeps this command- 
ment. We know that the Lord has 
commanded us that we should ob- 
serve the Word of Wisdom. Blessed 
is the man and blessed is the woman 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who keeps this commandment, for 
the Lord will nor forget them. We 
know that we have been command- 
ed from the beginning that we 
should pray; that we should 
gather around us in our homes 
our children and teach them 
the spirit of prayer ; that they might 
offer up their thanksgivings to their 
heavenly Father for His mercies 
and blessings unto them. We have, 
been taught to observe the Sabbath 
day from the beginning, and to 
keep it holy. And many other com- 
mandments, which we hear reiter- 
ated from the stand and which we 
read in the Scriptures, God has 
given unto us, that we might grow 
nearer unto him and be built up in 
the faith and strengthened. No 
commandment, at any time, has He 
given us, that was not for our com- 
fort and blessing. They are not 
given merely to please the Lord, but 
to make us better men and women, 
and worthy of salvation and exal- 
tation in His kingdom. We know 
our duty ; we know what is required 
of us, and that the Lord will not 
hold him guiltless who, understand- 
ing these things, will go contrary to 
that which he has been commanded. 

The time has nearly expired, but 
I want to say just one word or two 
in relation to the Sabbath day. We 
have heard of many other things 
this morning, the word of wisdom, 
of prayer, of tithing, and other 
principles. I want to say a few 
words in regard to the observance 
of the Sabbath day and keeping it 
holy. This commandment was 
given in the beginning, and God 
commanded the Saints and all peo- 
ples of the earth that they should 
observe the Sabbath day and keep it 
holy — one day in seven. Upon that 
day we should rest from our labors, 
we should go unto the house of the 
Lord and offer up our sacraments 



upon His holy day. For this is a 
day appointed unto us on which we 
should rest from our labors and 
pay our devotions unto the Most 
High. On this day we should offer 
unto Him our thanks and honor 
Him in prayer, in fasting, in sing- 
ing, and in edifying and instructing 
each other. There was a time when 
the people throughout the world ob- 
served this commandment better 
than they do today. I can remem- 
ber the time in this city, not many 
years ago, when it was considered 
a sin for a baseball game to be 
played on the Sunday. It was an 
unknown thing for a theatre to be 
open on the Sabbath day ; but today 
things have changed, and such 
things are common among us. 
This very afternoon and evening in 
this city and in other parts of the 
great nation, theatres will be open 
and crowded to the doors. I fear, 
so far as the community in this city 
is concerned, that all who attend 
those places will not be from among 
those who have no membership in 
the Church. Some who call them- 
selves Latter-day Saints will be 
there, as will also those of other 
faiths who profess a belief in the 
Redeemer of the world. Yet the 
Lord has commanded that we 
should observe this law. During 
the greater part of the past week 
and extending into this week, out 
near the lake, there is what is 
called an aviation meet. Men with 
machines of marvelous construction 
are flying in the air. They will do 
so today. I trust no Latter-day 
Saint will be there on the Sabbath 
day, disregarding the divine law. I 
have heard that two of the men who 
have been flying out there, who are 
representing the Wright brothers of 
Ohio, have refused to take part in 
the program on the Sabbath day. I 
hope this is true ; it comes to me 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



£7 



merely as a rumor. I understand 
that these men, Orvil and Wilbur 
Wright, will not take part nor per- 
mit those who represent them to 
take part in any such exercise on 
the Sabbath day, thus setting an ex- 
ample to others ; setting an example 
of righteousness to the Latter-day 
Saints and to all the world, and 
showing that they are not afraid, 
even in the face of opposition and 
ridicule, perhaps, to keep this com- 
mandment which God has given 
them. 

I hope the time will come — I 
don't know that it will before the 
millennium — but I hope it will come 
in this State, when we can have 
men in our legislature who will 
have enough regard for the law of 
God to give unto the people a legiti- 
mate law for the proper observance 
of the Sabbath day. We have not 
been able to accomplish it yet ; and, 
I am sorry to say, some of the mem- 
bers of the Church sitting as legis- 
lators have been numbered among 
those who have not seen fit to give 
unto the people a law that would 
be suited to the proper observance 
of the Sabbath day. They have 
lacked in courage, I say it with 
shame, for it is a disgrace to them 
and a reproach unto the people. 

Now, brethren and sisters, when 
we go from this conference to oui 
homes, let us go filled with the 
Spirit of the Lord, with the deter- 
mination to live our religion, to 
keep His commandments faithfully 
that His Spirit might be with us. 
The time will come, just as sure as 
we live, that there will be a sep- 
aration between the righteous and 
the unrighteous. Those who will 
not keep the law of the Lord will 
deny the faith, for He will withdraw 
His Spirit from them if they do 
not repent, after laboring with them 



and doing all that is possible to 
keep them in the line of duty. He 
will withdraw His spirit from them 
and they will be left unto them- 
selves. They must take one side or 
the other, for this separation must 
surely come. Let us see to it that 
we are numbered with the children 
of the Lord. Like one of the proph- 
ets of old, let us say: "As for me 
and my house, we will serve the 
Lord." And may He bless us. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Ho- 
sannah." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Reuben G. Miller. 
Adjourned until 2 p. m. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Charles 
W. Penrose presided. 

The Farmers' Ward choir was 
again in attendance. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Come, thou glorious day of promise, 
Come and spread thy cheerful ray, 

When the scattered sheep of Israel 
Shall no longer go astray. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Fer- 
dinand F. Hintze. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Zion stands with hills surrounded — 

Zion, kept by power divine ; 
All her foes shall be confounded, 

■Though the world in arms combine.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Preliminary remarks. — Attacks upon 
the Church. — Necessity of sustain 
ing its authorities. 

Brethren and sisters, I congratu- 
late you on having a suitable place 
in which to assemble, seeing that 
the tabernacle is full to overflow- 
ing. 

I hope you will enjoy the meeting 
that is convened in this place. It 
does not matter much where it is so 
long as we have the right spirit. 
We shall enjoy our services and the 
remarks that will be made by our 
brethren who have been selected to 
address us. If you will give us your 
attention, and keep as quiet as pos- 
sible so that the voices of the breth- 
ren may be heard distinctly in every 
part of the building, I am sure that 
we will receive good instructions 
suitable in our present condition 
and circumstances. 

We have some selections, too, to 
be rendered by the Farmers ward 
choir, which has become somewhat 
famous for its good music. And I 
pray that the blessing of the Lord 
will be upon us, and that we shall 
have a time of rejoicing and in- 
struction. 

It will be necessary, first, before 
we introduce the speakers, to pre- 
sent the general authorities of the 
Church, that you may have the priv- 
ilege of lifting up your hand just as 
though you were in the big taber- 
nacle. For if there ever was a time 
in the history of the Church when 
the Latter-day Saints ought to have 
the opportunity of showing their 
faith and confidence in and devo- 
tion to the men who are called to 
guide us, it is at the present time, 
when floods of vituperation and cal- 
umny are poured forth, and when 
there is a special endeavor to black- 



en their character before this nation 
and before the world. This is one 
of those things that occur almost 
periodically, and when the flood- 
gates of the regions below seem to 
be open to pour forth venom 
against the servants of the living 
God; and as is usually the case, 
and has been from the beginning, 
their chief attacks are directed 
against the man who stands at the 
head, the Prophet, Seer and Reve- 
lator called to preside over the 
Church. 

Elder Charles W. Penrose pre- 
sented the names of the General 
Authorities of the Church, and they 
were severally sustained in the posi- 
tions named, by unanimous vote of 
the congregation. 

ELDER MELVLN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

It has been said that a few years 
ago a party of tourists returning 
from a trip on the continent of 
Europe met one evening in a hotel 
in the city of Paris, and among 
other things were discussing points 
of interest which they had seen on 
their trip. Each one of four 
among the party appeared to have 
visited a famous obelisk, and one 
of the number said that its color 
was white. This was disputed by a 
second visitor, who said that it was 
blue; and still a third person in- 
sisted that both of the previous 
speakers were mistaken, and that 
its color was green. Each was sure 
that he was right, when a fourth 
person spoke up and said that he too 
had visited the obelisk, and that 
each one of these gentlemen was 
rght and that each was wrong, for, 
said he, "it is white on one side, it is 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



89 



blue on another, and green on a 
third side. The trouble with you, 
gentlemen, is that you did not go 
all the way around it." As I read 
that story recently, I thought of the 
wonderful variation in testimony 
which has been borne recently with 
respect to "Mormonism." We have 
been listening the last few days to 
testimonies of those who are in 
sympathy with the work of the 
Lord, wherein they nave told of 
their strong faith in His cause, the 
truthfulness of the principles of the 
Gospel, the righteousness of the 
lives of the men who are associated 
with this Church as the leaders of 
the organization. 

There has preceded our confer- 
ence a series of attacks upon the 
character of the work, and individ- 
ual members of the organization, 
wherein, perhaps, some of the fail- 
ures that we have made (for we 
are not perfect, the net gathers of 
all kinds of fishes, and there are 
some among us who make their 
failures and mistakes;, and per- 
haps this has furnished the founda- 
tion and the basis, in a number of 
instances at least, for the attacks 
that have been made, and these have 
been enlarged and exploited to serve 
the purpose of those who have it in 
their hearts to hurt and to injure. 
As I study human nature, I find 
that notwithstanding we try to look 
at the same thing alike, there is such 
a difference in our individual make- 
up and temperament, also in the 
environments which surround us, 
that we cannot always look at the 
same thing and describe it alike. 
The attacks which have been made 
upon the sacred scriptures have 
aimed at the fact that the Apostles 
Peter, James, and John have not 
borne testimony in the same identi- 
cal manner with reference to the 



life of Christ. I call attention to the 
fact that these men all looked up- 
on the Master from the same point 
of view, believing Him to be the 
Son of God; and when these men 
described such scenes as Christ be- 
fore Pilate, though their descrip- 
tions are about the same, yet there 
are some slight variations in detail, 
but not sufficient to contradict their 
testimony of His mission and char- 
acter. Some of those who related 
the life of our Savior, because of 
previous training in a certain direc- 
tion were inclined to state that 
which appealed to them most 
strongly ; one, because of his tem- 
perament and training in mathe- 
matics and tax collecting, was at- 
tracted by certain phases of the life 
of Christ ; while John, the spiritually 
minded man, saw in that life the 
greatness and the spirituality of the 
Redeemer. 

If that is true of men who try to 
tell the truth, and are in sympathy 
with the object of which they speak, 
then, we shall find in like manner 
more diversified opinions as we shall 
find men more widely separated in 
their view-point. As instance the 
testimony of a bitter apostate, who 
has had his mind darkened against 
the word of God and the leaders of 
the Church, whose own wicked life 
has colored his vision, and he pours 
forth all the venom of his distorted 
mind upon the people he once loved, 
though they have not changed since 
he loved them. No one else can 
see things just as he sees them. 
Then you have the example of the 
man who writes only for the mone- 
tary value of the story to him, who 
is paid to exploit his theme, and 
who gives it color without venom, 
but maliciously distorted, neverthe- 
less. Then you have still other 
phases represented, until you reach 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the burning, strong testimony of 
men and women who know the 
whole truth, who have gone all the 
way round, who have seen it and 
know it in all its phases, whose 
minds are free from malice and hat- 
red, who have borne testimony of 
the truth and seen the majesty of it, 
as it has been divinely made known 
to them. You have their testimony 
as to the uprightness of the lives 
and characters of our leaders and 
the nobility and value of the organi- 
zation. So, my brethren and sis- 
ters, when you shall consider the 
possibility of human nature to err 
and get in the dark, and how it is 
influenced by its prejudices, you 
shall then perhaps more easily un- 
derstand the great diversity of opin- 
ion expressed and sent broadcast 
about us. 

But, whose opinion shall we re- 
ceive ? I was asked not so very 
long ago, by a very respectable man 
of the northwest, if it was possible 
that magazines of the character of 
those that have been attacking the 
Church could be mistaken, for they 
have a respectable standing in the 
community. I answered him that if 
these magazines are mistaken on 
their present attitude toward the 
Church, it is not the first time they, 
and other equally as respectable ca- 
pers, have been on the wrong side 
of great questions. The world's 
judgment against tne Latter-day 
Saints is no evidence that we are 
wrong by any manner of means. 
My researches into the history of 
the past reveal the fact that not 
only in religious matters, but in sci- 
entific matters, and in the matter of 
the coming forth of truth from 
various sources, there has been a 
disposition on the part of the world 
seriously to condemn and reject 
that which is true. I might call your 



attention to the fact that some three 
hundred years ago all the world be- 
lieved that the earth on which we 
now live was flat, & great expanse 
in the universe, and that the stars, 
the sun and the moon, each made 
their revolutions around the earth, 
and that it was the center of space 
and^ did not move in space. When 
Galileo, the great and inspired phil- 
osopher, first announced that ' the 
earth was only one spark or gem in 
God's great universe, that it moved 
.together with other worlds with 
which it was associated, that the 
sun was the center of the solar sys- 
tem, and that the conditions of night 
and clay were produced by motions 
of the earth, he was haled before 
the highest tribunal of his dav, and 
condemned for advancing a doc- 
trine which was false and in con- 
tradiction of the scriptures ; he was 
condemned to suffer a cruel death 
or recede from his position. In or- 
der to save himself for future strug- 
gles in maintaining the truth, and 
realizing a denial did not change the 
truth which he had discovered, he 
said that he would recant his state- 
ment; but, aside to his friends, he 
said, "The world moves just the 
same." In later years, when he 
again revived the doctrine and gave 
further evidences of its truthfulness, 
he was again haled before the high 
tribunal and condemned, and 
burned at the stake for having 
taught a doctrine which now every- 
body who is posted at all knows to 
be absolutely correct. So in numer- 
ous other things, we have discov- 
ered that the judgment of the world 
has been wrong. 

I content myself by calling your 
attention to the one gift. of God to 
man. Great and good as are the 
gifts of scientific, psychological, and 
philosophical researcn, and the gift 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



91 



of wisdom manifest in discovering 
the electric telegraph, telephone, and 
all the glorious things which min- 
ister to the want and comfort of 
man, mounting far above them all, 
greater than all combined is the 
precious gift of God to man, His 
Son Jesus Christ. Did the world 
receive Him? No; condemned, exe- 
cuted between two thieves, buried 
in the oblivion which they hoped 
would cover him so that future gen- 
erations would know nothing of 
him, nor the part they took in his 
execution, expecting to prove to the 
world that they had merely rid their 
nation and their people of a male- 
factor who was unworthy to live. 
Was the world right or wrong? 
They believed that they were doing 
right. The world erected monu- 
ments to the princes who extermi- 
nated Christians, in the hope that 
coming generations would pay rev- 
erence to those princes for having 
rid the world of the abomination 
know as Christianity. The world 
has returned, not to place its laurels 
upon the monuments erected, but to 
.honor the names of those who suf- 
fered, and condemn those who 
erected the monuments, as having 
raised their hands against the most 
precious of all doctrines, and the 
most glorious of all individuals who 
have ever visited the world, the 
thing that the world needed most 
of all. 

And so will the world be proven 
to be wrong in its present judgment 
of the "Mormon" people. As 
shown, it has not been the first 
time that it has been mistaken. The 
world will not be satisfied, perhaps, 
by our testimony so far as it is 
favorably expressed. There is one 
way, thank God, that we can an- 
swer all accusations and charges. 
The Master stated that way, and 



the manner by which our true char- 
acter may be determined, the con- 
clusive evidence is, "By their fruits 
ye shall know them." He thus an- 
nounced the way by which we or 
any other people may prove our 
claim, or rather may prove our- 
selves worthy of what we claim 
to be. And so to this let us direct 
our attention just a few moments. 

You have heard some statistics 
during this conference, vital statis- 
tics, and I refer to these again be- 
cause they show some of the re- 
markable fruits of the system. We 
are told that, in 1910, there were 
thirty-eight births to every one 
thousand members in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
an excess over the birth rate in the 
United States, by comparison of the 
latest statistics, of twenty-five per 
cent. That means that the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints shows a birth rate far in ex- 
cess of that in the United States ; 
and I presume I am not far from 
the truth when I say that the 
United States leads the world in 
this matter, consequently we have 
an excess in our birth rate over 
any nation, or country, or people. 
Is that desirable fruit, or undesir- 
able? Why, the greatest statesmen 
in the present age are exercising 
their persuasive powers to the ut- 
termost in endeavors to induce men 
and women in our country, and oth- 
er civilized nations, to honor the 
first great law of God, "Multiply 
and replenish the earth." Thank 
the Lord, men and women in our 
Church keep the ranks replenished, 
and give at least our quota to make 
our nation endure in greatness. 
Thank God that the doctrine of 
race suicide which exists in the 
world has not become popular 
among us and is not breaking down 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the high ideals that have been held 
before our eyes by the men and 
women who lived according to 
God's law. In the world, where 
do we find increase principally? 
Children are rare among the ex- 
ceeding wealthy or those living in 
affluence, luxury and ease ; neither 
do you find large families among 
those steeped in transgression and 
sin. Children are more numerous 
in that greater and better element 
of mankind called the middle class, 
the honest men and women who be- 
lieve in honoring the great com- 
mand that I have announced, which 
was given to man in the beginning 
of his habitation upon the earth. 

We were told that the death rate 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is nine and a 
fraction per thousand, while the 
general death rate in the United 
States is seventeen per thousand. 
The death rate, Brother Grant tells 
us, among individuals received in 
life insurance associations seldom 
comes as low as ten per thousand. 
Are these fruits desirable or unde- 
sirable? Do the people of the 
world know how to live properly 
and perpetuate life? The great 
medical philosophical and psycho- 
logical schools vainly strive to ad- 
vise the people to live according to 
natural ways and means by which 
life may be perpetuated. God gave 
to this Church the great key of 
health, about which so much has 
been said in this conference; and, 
thank the Lord, a great majority of 
the Latter-day Saints obey the 
Word of Wisdom, and thereby a 
foundation is laid in themselves and 
their children for strength of body 
and of mind. By reason of obedi- 
ence in these things, they receive 
the blessings of health and strength, 
and long life. 



We were told that the divorce 
rate in the Church is so low that 
it is only about one-fifth the gen- 
eral divorce rate in the United 
States. Are these fruits desirable? 
Most assuredly they are. There is a 
great cry for ways and means by 
which there may be a curtailment 
of this evil of divorce, loosing the 
bonds of matrimony. Does the rec- 
ord speak well for the Latter-day 
Saints ? Surely it does. The great 
cause of the divorce evil in the 
United States today is the unfaith- 
fulness and infidelity of men and 
women to each other and to their 
families. How have Latter-day 
Saints been trained? You know, 
when we were boys we were told 
to hold virtue so sacred that ,we 
would rather lose our lives than 
to ruin or despoil the virtue of any 
woman, that personal purity was 
more sacred fi> us than our lives. 
We do not have a double standard 
of morality. Thank God, we have 
listened to the advice of our fath- 
ers, and accepted the teachings of 
the gospel, and have produced, not- 
withstanding some mistakes and 
failures in other respects, a gener- 
ation of young men and women 
whose equal in these things cannot 
be found anywhere in the world. 
Are these fruits desirable? O, my 
brethren and sisters, I desire with 
all my heart that the young men 
and women of this Church shall 
show forth by their lives even 
stronger testimonies than these, and 
that they shall be a sufficient an- 
swer to all our accusers — not our 
words, but what we are. The world 
has many new systems of philoso- 
phy, new religions, and new the- 
ories of solving problems of life, 
such theories are very plentiful, but 
they have not yet succeeded in pro- 
ducing a race of men and women 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



93 



superior to the children of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. And so, my breth- 
ren and sisters, while we are grow- 
ing in numbers, I trust we shall be 
noted also for our growth in vir- 
tue and every good and desirable 
thing. 

By the way, it is complained just 
now that the reason why we ought 
to have immediate attention is that 
we are increasing so fast. We 
haven't any disposition to wrangle 
about that question, we acknowl- 
edge that we are growing. I no- 
ticed in statistics published by the 
Literary Digest, about six weeks 
ago, a statement concerning the lead- 
ing churches of the United States, 
showing their rank twenty years 
ago, their place today, and the in- 
crease in population in the twenty 
years. The Roman Catholic church 
was ranked as number one, twenty 
years ago, and is the same today, 
and shows an increase of ninety- 
five per cent in that period. So they 
go in their list until we reach 
church number fifteen, which the 
table shows has made the greatest 
growth in the United States in the 
last twenty years, and the statistics 
are not ours, that is the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Now, among the fifteen churches 
on the list here enumerated, until we 
reach this "Mormon" Church, there 
is not an increase in position of any 
one of them of more than two points. 
Whereas, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was rat- 
ed as church twenty-one, twenty 
years ago, and as church number 
fifteen this year, an increase of six 
points, a showing two hundred per 
cent better than the others. Then in 
point of membership, none of the 
fifteen have a greater increase than 
ninety-eight per cent except the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 



day Saints whose increase is two 
hundred and fifty per cent ! In this 
connection I will say that, four 
weeks ago, in the city of Portland, 
I heard an address given by the sec- 
retary of home missions of the Meth- 
odist church, who said that unless 
there was a change in their methods 
of proselyting they would soon be 
decreasing. Said he, $40,000 ex- 
pended in the city of Boston netted 
but twenty-one converts ; $50,000 
expended in the city of Chicago had 
netted but forty-four converts ; and 
he made the further remarkable 
statement that last year the great 
Methodist church, which stands as 
the second largest church in the 
United States, with a membership 
of 3,180,000 souls, showed an in- 
crease of but 40,000 last year. Com- 
pare that with the Church we rep- 
resent, with a membership of about 
500,000 souls, showing an increase 
of 16,000, and contrast it, in view 
also of another fact, that of the 
40,000 souls introduced into the 
Methodist church last year only five 
per cent were men and women over 
twenty-one years of age, ninety- 
five per cent were children. Its 
power to appeal to the matured 
judgment of men and women of 
this country must surely be waning, 
when it can claim only five per cent 
of its converts from the ranks of 
matured minds. Not so with the 
Latter-day Saints. Our increase 
has been very satisfactory, and has 
come largely from the mature, 
thinking men and women of the 
country. I know it is so in the 
Northwestern States mission, and I 
am sure that it is so elsewhere. 
Now, is this growth and increase 
desirable? I maintain that it is, 
and ought to continue, for the 
world's good. The best men and 
women are crying out in their souls 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for that which we have, though they 
know it not, and the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
has that which the world needs, and 
which the world must have to save 
itself. 

We need not be alarmed at the 
assaults which have been made. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints shall not falter, nor 
waver, nor shall it be harmed by 
the present attack. I bear you wit- 
ness, as I rrjingle among- people 
outside of Utah, and know what 
the sentiment is, that thinking 
minds of the present day have been 
stirred up by the recent articles to 
a spirit of enquiry such as they 
have never manifested before. • We 
have opportunities for gospel con- 
versations such as we have not had 
before. Recently we had an op- 
portunity to answer the enquiries 
of the president of one of the great- 
est colleges in the west. He rec- 
ognized that these stories did not 
contain the truth, and he wanted 
to know what the truth is. I can 
say that the commonwealth here, 
our glorious Utah, where so many 
of us were born, is being injured 
more seriously than is the "Mor- 
mon" Church. The Church thrives 
in spite of persecution, but the citi- 
zens of the State of Utah suffer 
from the indignities and vilifica- 
tions that are being published. 
Thirty thousand home seekers came 
into the northwest during last 
spring. It has been my privilege to 
meet thousands of them on the 
trains, and I have taken the oppor- 
tunity of making a canvass among 
them, and to ask them "why don't 
you go to Utah ?" 1 have exploited 
some of Utah's resources and her 
opportunities, and the answer has 
been, in many instances, that they 
were prejudiced against Utah be- 



cause of the recent agitation that 
has been going the rounds of the 
press. So, Utah is suffering more 
than the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. God bless Utah, 
the vales we love, the place of our 
birth and our homes. 

The Church shall stand, and 
thrive, and increase in its numbers, 
and shall never diminish. We are 
only just beginning; we are but 
forming the nucleus of a great and 
mighty organization that shall grow 
as fast as it can absorb new mem- 
bers, and it shall increase in its ab- 
sorbing, and shall yet be numbered 
by millions of the children of this 
generation. This is my testimony, 
and faith, and I may say, I speak it 
with knowledge. We missionaries 
go not to the world with a spirit of 
resentment, but in the spirit of love 
we approach their homes, and if 
they turn us away, we still feel that 
we have brought to them the most 
precious of all gifts, and that we 
have honored that household to 
which we have come with our mes- 
sage, offering the most precious 
boon that could be bestowed upon 
them, none greater has ever been 
offered to this world in all the years 
of its history. In all our labors we 
try to show that we love the whole 
world; in the spirit of kindness we 
work among them, not with a spirit 
of retaliation, but of forbearance, — 
showing by our lives and the exam- 
ples which we set that we are what 
we claim to be: members of God's 
Church ; not perfect men, but seek- 
ing according to the knowledge that 
we possess, and the Spirit of the 
Lord within us, to perfect our lives 
in harmony with the laws of God's 
truth, and inspire them to do like- 
wise, which may God grant us the 
opportunity to do, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON.

A sacred song, entitled "Face to 
face," was sung by Mrs. F. M. 
Bishop. 

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 

(President of Liberty Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, those 
who have attended the sessions of 
this conference can testify that the 
Lord has been with us. He has 
manifested Himself to us again this 
afternoon, and I am sure He will 
continue to do so during the re- 
maining part of this meeting. 

Several thousand faithful Latter- 
day Saints have come together, with 
prayerful hearts and with a desire 
to be fed with the word of life, to 
be built up in their faith and 
strengthened in their desire to serve 
the Lord ; where this is the case it 
is absolutely certain that thev will 
not go away hungry. Of course, 
the thought does come to an indi- 
vidual who may be called upon to 
speak, that because of some delin- 
quency on his part he may not have 
as much of the Spirit of the Lord 
as he would like, and consequently 
no man, at least no thoughtful man, 
ever attempts to address a congre- 
gation of the Latter-day Saints 
without a feeling of fear in his 
heart. I can think of nothing more 
appalling or terrifying to me than 
to attempt to address this people 
without the assistance of the Spirit 
of the Lord. It would be impos- 
sible for me, through any power 
which I have or any ability which 
may be mine, to instruct those who 
understand the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ quite as well, or in many 
cases very much better than I do. 

I believe the Lord designs that we 
should exercise our faith for those 
who are called upon to address us, 



because by its exercise it becomes 
stronger, and if there ever was a 
time in all the history of the Church 
when Latter-day Saints needed to 
have their faith strengthened it is 
at the present time. Surrounded 
as we are by the temptations and 
allurements of the world and with 
all the responsibilities of life which 
rest upon us ; it is of absolute im- 
portance that we grow in faith and 
in the knowledge of the Lord, and 
in the knowledge of His plan con- 
cerning us, because unless we do 
we simply cannot succeed. While 
the Church will of course go on to 
fulfill its grand destiny, those who 
do not cultivate faith, and do not 
have this principle in their hearts, 
will fall by the wayside and will 
not be able to keep pace with the 
Church itself. There are many ex- 
amples in the scriptures of how 
faith comes to those who ask for it 
and who endeavor to earn it by pur- 
suing an upright life. Christ said, 
"Whatsoever thing ye shall ask of 
the Father in my name, believing, 
ye shall receive." My prayer con- 
stantly to the Lord is to give me 
faith, to give me a knowledge of 
His plan and purposes, to help me 
to understand the part which I 
should perform in the carrying out 
of that plan. 

We have heard a good deal dur- 
ing this conference about the things 
that are being said of us. We could 
not endure those things, nor stand 
to be ridiculed and assailed, unless 
we understand the future to some 
extent, and have an assurance that 
the Lord will overrule all things for 
the good of His people. You all re- 
member the occasion when one of 
the rulers of the synagogue came to 
Jesus and asked Him to come to his 
house because his daughter was dy- 
ing. With His usual sympathy the 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Savior consented, and when they 
were on the way they met a mes- 
senger from the house of this man 
who said to the ruler, "Trouble not 
the Master, because your daughter 
is dead." The man no doubt was 
overwhelmed with grief. But what 
did the Savior say to him ? I think 
in all the scriptures we cannot find 
a more beautiful saying, no sentence 
more full of meaning than the four 
simple words of the Savior, "Fear 
not, only believe." And that is the 
statement of the Lord to us in this 
day. We can take it to ourselves. 
"Fear not, only believe." And if 
we have this assurance in our hearts 
it matters not what the world may 
say, we can stand aside and watch 
the Lord work this thing out. I do 
not mean that we should stand aside 
in idleness, for we must do our part. 
But we need not worry regarding 
what they say, because the Lord 
will take care of those who assail 
His work. That is my testimony. 
I know this is His work, and that 
those who make war upon it will be 
held responsible for what they do, 
even though the results of their ef- 
forts may be overruled for good. 

As has been testified by Brother 
Ballard, people enquire concerning 
our doctrines because of the as- 
sults which are made upon us, but 
even if the Lord does overturn these 
attacks to our good, it will not re- 
lieve those who make the attacks 
from responsibility. The Lord is 
with us, He is with this work, and 
He wants us to "believe and fear 
not." I presume there are few. if 
any here who have ever listened to 
the audible voice of the Almighty. 
We are not permitted to behold His 
person, but we do see Him in all His 
marvelous creations, see Him, if we 



have faith, as distinctly and with 
as much assurance as though He 
stood before our natural eyes ; and 
as though we were able to see His 
person, to behold His face and to 
touch His hand. To those who un- 
derstand the Gospel, and the whis- 
pering of the Spirit of the Lord, He 
is visible in all these things, and we 
are able through the influence 
which He gives us, through our 
prayers, to hear His voice, though 
it may not be audible to our na- 
tural ears. I bear testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that God 
does live, that He rules, and that 
He will overturn all things for the 
good of this people. 

Before I conclude, I want to say 
one thing in regard to what has 
been said by several of the speakers 
in this conference, and which was 
dwelt upon so splendidly by Broth- 
er McKay this morning. My heart 
rejoiced in listening to his remarks. 
I thank the Lord for what has been 
said regarding this question, the 
Word of Wisdom, and the evil of 
the saloons in our midst. For my 
part I have always been opposed to 
them with all my soul, and with all 
my strength, and my desire is to 
maintain that same position in the 
future. I realize that speaking on 
this subject will not accomplish the 
work. If we succeed we must do 
something more than speaking, we 
must be up and doing, we must 
get into this battle, and fight and 
fight, and organize and work, and 
if we do not do that, I feel very cer- 
tain we will not succeed. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to accomplish all that He designs 
us to do in this life, and finally save 
us in His presence, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 

(President of Fremont Stake.) 

I feel certain the Latter-day 
Saints will be a great, grand and a 
good people, when I realize the fact 
that we have so much valuable in- 
struction imparted to us from time 
to time by the servants of the Lord. 
One of the strongest evidences to 
me of the divinity of this great 
work, among many others, is the 
fact that the Lord has entrusted it 
not only to those who are skilled in 
education and in learning, but also 
to the unlearned. He has sent them 
out into the world to meet the 
mighty ones, and all classes that are 
to be found. We have been told in 
this conference that not one of those 
thus sent out has been converted to 
the teachings which are found in 
the world ; it may be that a few, a 
very few, have made, possibly, a 
partial failure of the work, because, 
no doubt, of their own weakness. 
The great majority of them have 
been strong and powerful, and have 
been able to deliver the gospel mes- 
sage that has found lodgment in the 
hearts of those that have desired 
the opportunity of becoming ac- 
quainted with that divine plan 
which would save the souls of men. 
These have been gathered into the 
fold, and they have taken up the 
work of God, regardless of what it 
cost them, and have rejoiced in 
this, the greatest thing in life. We 
can fully understand that, if we un- 
derstand "Mormonism," so called. 

I have rejoiced during this con- 
ference in listening to the mighty 
testimonies that have been borne by 
the servants of God under the influ- 
ence of His Spirit ; and I have very 
much rejoiced during this session 
in listening to the testimony of 
Elder Ballard and others of our 
brethren who have spoken, who 



have labored for the salvation of 
the souls of the children of men. 
What a mighty work ; what a splen- 
did good thing. If the world could 
understand the purpose we have in 
delivering this message, what a 
blessing it would bring to them. 
But it seems that these things are 
hard to understand. It takes a 
good deal to make the sacrifice, 
as the world understands it, because 
of the conditions under which they 
are living. They find it requires a 
great sacrifice to become members 
of this Church and defend it, and 
we cannot stand unless we do de- 
fend it. I am thoroughly convinced 
that we must be active. Inactivity is 
death. Therefore it is necessary 
that we actively live for and defend 
the truth, this will bring joy to our 
souls, and we will increase in the 
knowledge of this great Latter-day 
work. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us 
and help us to understand the part 
that we should take and to do it, 
and never be ashamed of His work, 
nor of His servants, whom He has 
called to minister among the chil- 
dren of men. I respect them for 
the sacrifices they make when they 
labor as they do unceasingly, that 
they may be faithful in their calling 
to the children of men. I pray that 
God will bless us and bless His 
work that it may cover the earth as 
the waters do the mighty deep ; I 
ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

A male quartette, "Savior, com- 
fort me," was rendered by members 
of the choir. 

ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 

(President of Salt Lake Stake.) 

We are approaching the close of 
one of the last sessions of a very 
enjoyable and profitable conference 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Church. I have had the 
pleasure of attending some of the 
sessions, and have read the proceed- 
ings of the others. I am very thank- 
ful that in my own heart I have 
feelings of harmony and approval 
of all that has been taught and done, 
with which I am acquainted. 

I rejoice in the prosperity of the 
work of the Lord. I thank and 
praise Him that I have been given 
a lot among this people, and that I 
am called to labor in His service. 
I enjoyed the remarks which were 
made this morning in the general 
assembly in the tabernacle, as well 
as those made this afternoon by the 
mission presidents. One of the 
greatest assets to our cause is our 
missionary system. We could not 
suffer greater loss than the discon- 
tinuance of that system of proselyt- 
ing which has been characteristic of 
the work of the Lord in this dispen- 
sation. The renewal of spiritual 
force and enthusiasm, which comes 
to all our communities and organiz- 
ations from these elders who re- 
turn from the nations of the earth, 
where they have been bearing glad 
tidings of great joy, rekindle in us 
at home the spirit of missionary 
work. How infallible is the key 
given us by President Kimball, this 
morning, with respect to the spirit 
of the Seventy. Said he, Have you 
ever felt a desire to go upon a mis- 
sion? if you have, you have enjoyed 
the spirit of a Seventy. If you have 
never had that desire, you have not 
received of the Lord the spirit of 
your calling, even though you have 
been ordained a Seventy. My own 
experience confirms that statement, 
for I know it to be true. A desire 
to convey to the world the message 
that the Lord has committed to us 
is an evidence that we have re- 
ceived the Spirit of the Lord. If 



I have any advice to give to the 
Latter-day Saints, it is this, to con- 
tinue to prepare the young men for 
missions in the world, and to help 
them to shape their affairs so that 
they may go upon missions when 
they are called, without delay, with- 
out begging for time, without any 
disposition to procrastinate or post- 
pone the day'of their departure, for 
there is no greater blessing that 
comes to the youth of Israel than 
this opportunity to preach the gos- 
pel to the nations of the earth. 

We have many demands upon us 
for missionaries. We have many 
young men who are not adequately 
prepared for this service. I have 
sometimes felt that those who hold 
positions of presidency should give 
them a few months, or a year, if 
necessary, to prepare themselves 
for a call. Let them know that the 
eye of the presiding officers is up- 
on them, expecting them to be able 
to respond at some future date. We 
have many young men whose hearts 
are turned in other directions, for 
the lack of proper teaching in their 
homes, and I hope the Latter-day 
Saints shall not overlook the great 
importance of preserving and main- 
taining in the home the spirit of the 
gospel by proper religious devotion 
and proper Christian examples. The 
home is the stronghold of the 
Church, as it is of the state, as it is 
of society; and if the home be not 
pure, maintained upon principles of 
virtue, faith and industry, the state, 
and society and the Church will cor- 
respondingly suffer. The mother 
and the father at home should try 
to preserve among us these princi- 
ples for which we stand as a people. 

I believe all that President Bal- 
lard has said of a complimentary 
character with respect to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I can readilv see 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 



99 



how he has become well supplied 
with these facts and figures, in 
speaking in defense of our people 
to the world! I don't know that I 
should be so much inclined to speak 
of these things to the Latter-day 
Saints themselves, for I fear some 
of us may be somewhat too much 
inclined to rest contented upon what 
we think we are and overlook the 
evils that are among us, and the sin 
— to use a common, plain term — 
of which some are guilty. I do not 
wish to be pessimistic. I would 
rather speak of the good things 
than the bad; but I do not believe 
that we as a people are living ex- 
actly as we should. I do not believe 
that we are living 1 up to the Word 
of Wisdom as faithfully as we 
should. Too many of the elders of 
Zion are not strictly observing that 
principle. Yet, in spite of this short- 
coming, the average standard of 
morality among our people, I be- 
lieve to be higher than that of the 
world or of any other people. 

Another thing of which I am 
convinced is one that brings a great 
deal of sorrow to my soul, and that 
is that the standard of morality is 
lower among some of our young 
people today than it has been. It 
would be a miracle if it were other- 
wise, because of the prevalance of 
evils in our midst, due to city life 
which has grown remarkably in the 
last few decades, and the destruc- 
tive influences which are aggres- 
sively at work in all cities, increas- 
ing as cities increase in population, 
for the destruction of virtue in boys 
and girls. You, perhaps, in the 
country, little dream of the insidu- 
ous efforts made by the powers of 
evil in this particular direction. The 
powers of evil are so great that it 
seems that some must fall, but there 
is altogether too much liberty given 



to our young people in going to 
places of amusement without re- 
striction and without chaperones. I 
repeat, too much liberty is given to 
our young people. And the use of 
liquor, in public and in private 
places, the use of cigarettes and 
other kindred vices are on the in- 
crease, and have brought about the 
results which I speak of , so lament- 
able in their nature, lowering the 
standard of virtue. I could give you 
facts which would be appalling if 
you knew them, disclosed in the 
Juvenile Court and in the public 
schools that prove conclusively, I 
believe, what I state here. I speak 
of these things in order that we as 
men and women who are called to 
look after the interests of the youth 
of Zion shall not be derelict in the 
discharge of our duties. The teach- 
ers visiting on the blocks, the Bish- 
ops, High Councilors and Stake 
Presidencies should be roused to 
look after the welfare of the Church 
through its members, so that if any 
guilt exists among the Saints of 
God, they can lend a helping hand 
for its eradication; and they need 
the co-operation of the fathers and 
mothers in their homes in order to 
work effectually for the salvation of 
the young. 

With President Cannon, I thank 
the Lord for the splendid discourse 
that Apostle McKay delivered- this 
morning. I thank and praise the 
Lord for the inspiration of His 
Spirit which was characteristic of 
that address. The Latter-day 
Saints have made high professions, 
as we are inclined to do always, with 
respect to temperance. But I doubt 
if we are making the headway we 
should in this regard. Two of the 
witnesses to the Book of Mormon 
were excommunicated from the 
Church. One of the charges r>re- 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ferred against them was that they 
failed to observe the Word of Wis- 
dom. If they did that fifty and 
sixty years ago, I imagine we have 
not made the progress we should, 
for I have heard of no man being 
cut off from the Church for not 
keeping the Word of Wisdom in 
modern times unless it became a 
most flagrant case. 

We as a people are approaching 
a great opportunity in our history. 
Our standards are higher than the 
standards of the world. We largely 
predominate in this State, and 
through an act of the legislature we 
are given an opportunity this vear to 
express ourselves by the ballot as 
to whether we will tolerate the 
saloon. For this reason, I think the 
remarks made by Elder McKay 
very fitting and proper, and I am 
satisfied they will bear fruit. Per- 
haps fifty per cent of the crime is 
traceable, directly or indirectly, to 
the use of liquor. We have been 
altogether too much afraid of what 
has been called the "business inter- 
est" upon this question. It is not 
a question of how much money is in- 
volved, to me. It is a question of 
what is right. I understand mv du- 
ty and my calling to be to work for 
the right ; and on the liquor question 
I expect to work until success shall 
eventually come, for truth shall tri- 
umph as sure as God lives. The 
right side of this question is plain 
to every Latter-day Saint and to 
every rightly inclined individual. 
No one can speak in defense of the 
saloon if he regards the welfare of 
mankind, for it does no good, and it 
does incalculable harm. There can 
be no doubt of this. Every year 
that this nation lives, there is a sac- 
rifice of its citizenship to the extent 
of 100,000 men upon the altar of 
intemperance — 100,000 men's lives 



lost every year by reason of over 
indulgence in intoxicating liquors. 
Talk about conservation ! The De- 
partment of Agriculture spends mil- 
lions annually to teach men how to 
produce and preserve the right kind 
of stock, such as hogs, horses, and 
sheep. It spends millions in the 
conservation of our streams and our 
forests, very wisely too. But scarce- 
ly anything has been done with re- 
spect to the conservation of the 
greatest resource of all, man him- 
self. And the greatest enemy which 
he has is intemperance. While per- 
haps the nation is not prepared to 
take hold of this question by federal 
law, it is only the principles which 
we are now pursuing which will 
eventually lead to the enactment of 
a measure which will effect the de- 
struction of this evil. Until we do 
this, we shall not have succeeded 
in our mission as a nation. The 
world has seen nation after nation 
sink into oblivion from all ■ their 
glory and achievement, despoiled 
and destroyed by intemperance, and 
immorality so closely allied that you 
cannot possily separate them. 

I urge the Latter-day Saints, 
wherever they live, to observe the 
law of God first, and let each one 
make himself one who does not 
need the enactment of a prohibitory 
law respecting liquor, or the adop- 
tion of a local option law to turn 
his city or his county dry. Make 
of yourself a temperate man, not 
only temperate, I will say — a total 
abstainer. That is the higher stand- 
ard. And then help your weaker 
brother who may not be so able to 
overcome the evil. It reminds me 
of Carlyle's philosophy, "Let him 
who would reform the world make 
himself an honest man, and he will 
be sure there is one rascal less in 
the world." It is a good thing to 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



101 



start with number one. I have 
heard of advocates of prohibition 
who, when they feared their county 
was going dry, would lay in a large 
store of liquor. Such men do not 
help the cause. Such hvoocritical 
examples are injurious to the case. 
Now we have an opportunity, next 
June, of deciding what we shall do 
with respect to this important ques- 
tion ; and I believe the position of 
the Latter-day Saints may be vin- 
dicated upon this question. It is 
strange how every age has its op- 
portunity to decide between good 
and evil. This may not be, in the 
minds of some, the great question 
which I believe it to be ; but I do not 
recall a more serious question com- 
ing before any nation than that 
which we have to combat today. 
You remember the opportunity 
came to ancient Israel to decide 
whether they should receive Him 
who was sent to them. They pushed 
Him aside with open palms, and 
said they would not have Him. Said 
that He admitted Himself to be 
king of the Jews. And when Pilate, 
sitting in the seat of justice asked 
and plead with the Jews, "Whom 
will you have released unto you ?" 
According to the law, one prisoner 
might be released unto them anual- 
ly. "Whom will you have released 
unto you, Barabbas or Jesus ?" The 
Jews, stiff-necked and hard of 
heart, said, you remember: "Re- 
lease unto us Barabbas. As for this 
man, crucify him, crucify him. Let 
his blood be upon us and upon our 
children after us. Release unto us 
Barabbas." It is not a question of 
as great moment, perhaps ; but it is 
a similar question, and we as a peo- 
ple have to decide this day whom 
we shall have in this year of grace, 
the year 1911, whether we shall 
have the Christ or Barabbas ; and 



God give us the wisdom and the 
courage, "God give to us the Christ 
whom we desire above all else in 
the world." 

May God's peace be upon the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and His choice bless- 
ings upon the servants of the Lord, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Closing exhortation. — Timely advice. 
Testimony of the Truth. 

I thank the choir of the Farmers 
ward for their presence with us this 
afternoon, and their excellent mu- 
sical services. 

I am glad to meet with so many 
of my friends of the Latter-day 
Saints in conference, and I hope 
they will take with them to their 
homes the spirit that has pervaded 
the conference, and particularly I 
commend to them the advice given 
this morning, and again this after- 
noon, in regard to the 27th day of 
June, 1911, the anniversary of the 
death of our martyred Prophet. On 
that occasion the people of Utah 
will have the privilege of showing 
by their votes whether they are in 
favor of the traffic in alcoholic 
stimulants which cause so much 
misery, or whether they desire good 
regulations, peace and order in their 
respective communities, and I en- 
dorse what has been said concern- 
ing this subject. It is a matter of 
religion with us, not a mere po- 
litical affair — one of party in any 
sense of the word ; people of all 
parties and sects and persuasions, 
and religions can manifest on that 
day what their sentiments are with 
respect to this great question af- 
fecting all humanity. 

Brethren and sisters, take with 
you to your respective fields of la- 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bor and to your homes, wherever 
you reside, the spirit of this con- 
ference. And when the time comes 
show by your acts and by your votes 
whether you are on the Lord's side 
or on the other. You cannot be on 
both sides at the same time. 

I bear testimony to this congre- 
gation, as I have had the privilege 
of doing many times in years that 
are past, that God, the Maker of 
the universe, is our Father, the 
Father of our spirits ; that Jesus of 
Nazareth, who was crucified on 
Mount Calvary, is His Son, in the 
body as well as in the Spirit, and 
that He is our Savior. I bear tes- 
timony that Joseph Smith, who was 
slain for the word of God and the 
testimony which he bore, was a 
Prophet of the Most High.raised up 
to usher in the last and greatest of 
dispensations. I bear testimony that 
the covenants that we have made 
with God to serve Him and keep 
His commandments are recorded on 
high, and we shall have to meet 
them on the great day of accounts. 
If we fail to keep them we can- 
not obtain the fulness of the bless- 
ing of the gospel of peace. If we 
live according to the principles that 
God has revealed through that great 
Prophet, this Church will overcome 
the world, the flesh and the devil 
and establish the kingdom of the 
Most High which will prevail over 
all the earth, and they who are 
faithful unto the Lord will obtain 
the great reward. Thrones, do- 
minions, principalities, and powers 
and exaltation in worlds without 
end shall be the portion of the true 
the faithful Saints of the living 
God. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful in all things and to overcome 
all things that we may inherit all 
things in His glorious presence. 
Amen. 



The choir sang the anthem, 
"Awake my soul." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph R. Morgan. 



OUTDOOR MEETINC. 

Thousands of people gathered on 
the Temple grounds, unable to ob- 
tain admission to the Tabernacle or 
Assembly Hall, and an outdoor 
meeting was held for their benefit, 
at 2 p. m., near the Bureau of In- 
formation building. The services 
were presided over by Elder Sey- 
mour B. Young. Music was fur- 
nished by Prof. Wm. C. Clive's or- 
chestra, and Prof. Andrew G. Bow- 
man led the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President Eastern States Mission) 

I feel quite at home in speaking 
in the open air. There are very few 
States in the Union in which I have 
not spoken in the open air. As a 
missionary that has spent some six- 
teen or seventeen years in the mis- 
sionary field, it has been my lot tu 
bear witness to the cause which we 
represent, many times ; and I think 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



103 



there is no place where an elder can 
speak where he enjoys more of the 
Spirit of God than when speaking 
in the open air. The cause that we 
represent should be very near and 
dear unto us, and if we thoroughly 
understand it, it seems to me as 
though nothing but going back into 
darkness will cause us to lose the 
faith. 

An impression was made upon 
my mind while we were singing the 
opening hymn. My mind reverted 
back to the history of this Church, 
and a panorama of the trials and 
the tribulations seemed to pass be- 
fore my gaze. I am reminded of 
the hardships passed through by 
i he Prophet Joseph, and the weap- 
ons which were used against him in 
trying to destroy him during the 
early history of this Church. I recall 
the trials in Manchester, the trials 
in Kirtland, the tribulations in Mis- 
souri, the hardships passed through 
by the Saints in all those places, 
which finally terminated, so far as 
the mortal days of the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith were concerned, in the 
tragedy at Carthage. I remember 
also the history of the trials of the 
Saints, our fathers and our moth- 
ers, in Nauvoo, and after that time, 
when they were driven from their 
homes there, and finally, with that 
unfaltering faith they had in the 
leader God gave to them to take the 
place of the Prophet Joseph, they 
set their faces toward the setting 
sun, to go into the unknown west. 
It was when they were ready for 
this journey that President Brig- 
ham Young called William Clayton 
to him, and said to him, "Brother 
Clayton, I want you to prepare a 
hymn that the Saints can sing while 
we are camped upon the prairies, 
and wherever God will lead us, 
something that will give them 
hope." And Brother Clayton went 



away, and, I think, in the course 
of a couple of hours, he had not 
only composed the hymn, but he 
had set it to music, and he sang it 
before that great leader, Brigham 
Young. Now, with this little piece 
of history, knowing how this hymn 
had its origin, so that you will ap- 
preciate it more, I am going to read 
the hymn that was sung at the 
opening of this meeting: 

"Come, come ye saints, no toil nor 

labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 

appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
"Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive. 
Do this, and joy your hearts will 

swell — 
All is well! all is well! 

"Why should we mourn, or think our 
lot is hard? 

'Tis not so; all is right! 
Why should we think to earn a great 
reward, 

If we now shun the fight. 
Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 
Our God will never us forsake; 
And soon we'll have this truth to tell — 
All is well! all is well! 

"We'll find the place which God for 

us prepared, 
Far away in the West, 
Where none shall come to hurt or 

make afraid; 
There the saints will be blessed. 
We'll make the air with music ring, 
Shout praises to our God and King; 
Above the rest these words we'll tell — 
All is well! all is well! 

"And should we die before our jour- 
ney's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 
We then are free from toil and sor- 
row too; 

With the just we shall dwell. 
But if our lives are spared again 
To see the saints their rest obtain, 
O how we'll make this chorus swell — 
All is well! all is well." 

What do you think, my brethren 
and sisters, of the faith of that band

of pioneers? This country was un- 
known to them. They believed that 
God had given to President Young 
a vision of the future home for the 
Latter-day Saints. They had faith 
in their leader, and they were will- 
ing to go into the unknown with 
him; and felt that if they died be- 
fore their journey was through, all 
was well with them. We are the 
children, the grand-children, we are 
the offspring of men and women 
to whom this gospel was carried in 
various parts of the world ; and 
what a debt of gratitude do we owe 
to their bravery, their faith, their 
integrity to the cause of God ! God 
is no respecter of persons, and He 
is as near to us as He was to them. 
The faith that God planted within 
their hearts. He is willing to plant 
within our hearts, if our works are 
like unto the works of our fathers. 
There is a price set upon every 
blessing from God, but it is not 
measured in dollars and cents, it is 
within the reach of all alike ; and 
the price consists in works, works 
of righteousness. There should be 
no one to whom the gospel has been 
brought, and whose condition has 
been bettered thereby, who should 
ever forget the faith, the integrity, 
the honesty, the bravery, of those 
who had such confidence in Brig- 
ham Young as to follow him into 
these valleys of the mountains. 

It is sung that "God moves in a 
mysterious wa)',His wonders to per- 
form," and perhaps if all had been 
peace with our fathers and our 
mothers, all of the purposes of God 
would not have been fulfilled so 
quickly, so minutely, as they have 
been fulfilled, notwithstanding the 
trials and tribulations that came up- 
on our people. "It needs be that of- 
fenses come, but woe be unto them 
by whom they come." The offenses 
that did come hastened the fulfill- 



ment of the revelations of God Al- 
mighty. 

There stood upon the earth a 
great and mighty Prophet of God 
seven hundred years before the 
birth of Christ, whose prophecies 
were translated into different lan- 
guages over three hundred years 
before His birth, in the city of Alex- 
andria. God gave to him a vision 
of the future, and a vision of that 
building yonder (the temple) show- 
ing him that the Mountain of the 
House of the Lord would be estab- 
lished in the tops of the mountains, 
and that people from almost every 
nation upon the earth would say, as 
they are now saying, "Come, and 
let us go up to the Mountain of the 
Lord, to the House of the God of 
Jacob, where we can learn of His 
ways, and walk in His paths." That 
great miracle, if you are minded to 
call it a miracle, the fulfilling of 
that prophecy, was brought about 
largely by our people being forced 
to come up into the tops of the 
mountains. 

When we speak of miracles, we 
call them miracles, but, when right- 
ly understood, there is no such 
thing as miracles. We call those 
things miracles simply because we 
do not now understand the law by 
which they are brought about. It 
is true, upon the rough seas, the 
Savior of mankind stretched forth 
His hand and said to the angry wa- 
ters, "Peace, be still," and the wa- 
ters were calmed, and the ship was 
safe, but the one who uttered these 
words was the King of heaven and 
earth, to whom all power had been 
given, and when He commanded 
the intelligence of the winds : lis- 
ten and obey ! and the waters be- 
came calmed, it was more the prin- 
ciple of obedience that brought 
about the calmness of the sea. We 
plant the grape vine, we pour water

upon the ground ; it goes into moth- 
er earth ; creeps up through the sap 
of the vine, it finds its way into the 
bud of the flower, and then into the 
berry, the grape ; it is then crushed, 
and other elements work upon it, 
and we have the wine. But, when 
they filled the pots with water at 
the" behest of Jesus of Nazareth, and 
He commanded, all the necessary 
elements went into the water, and 
turned the water into wine, the seem- 
ing miracle was done by Divine au- 
thority, by obedience to that Being 
to whom was given all power over 
the elements, and who could, if He 
had so desired, have summoned the 
armies of heaven to His defense. 
"The glory of God is intelligence." 
"No man can be saved in ignor- 
ance," and this faith that God has 
given to us is intended to exalt us 
in the presence of God, with intel- 
ligence, so that we can know, and 
control, even as our Elder Brother 
was able to control, while He was 
upon the earth. Faith will take 
immortal men into the presence of 
God; not only that, but will make 
them like unto God, exalt them as 
kings and priests in the celestial 
kingdom of our heavenly Father. 
The race is not given to the swift, 
but to him who endures to the end. 

I see before me many elders who 
have labored under my direction, 
both in the Southern States and in 
the Eastern States, during the pe- 
riod of th.rteen years that I have 
presided in these missionary fields, 
and 1 wonder if your enthusiasm 
is the same as it was when you were 
standing in the open air, preaching 
the gospel of life and salvation. Do 
not let it cool off. Do not be afraid. 
The work of God is true, and it is 
going to rule this universe some 
time. It has been decreed by the 
Almighty that sometime the earth 
and the fulness thereof "will be 



given to the Saints of the most high 
God, and they shall possess it for- 
ever and forever." 1 did not re- 
ceive my testimony from men; I 
know it with every fibre of my be- 
ing. Wl.en I go over on the othei 
side, I want to meet my parents 
who were among the pioneers of 
1847, and not be ashamed when I 
look them in the face. I want to 
keep the faith as they kept the faith. 
You keep it as your fathers and 
mothers kept it, and remember that 
God Almighty brought our fathers 
to this country, therefore we are in- 
debted to Him for every blessing 
that we enjoy today. 

May God bless you in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS. 

In looking about from this tem- 
porary stand over the heads of this 
large assembly, my soul rejoices in 
reflections that are started by lis- 
tening to what we have heard of the 
coming of the pioneers, of the faith 
that led them to these valleys of the 
mountains, and that has converted 
us, and brought us here from the 
various parts of the earth to wor- 
ship God, to participate in this con- 
ference, and to enjoy the spirit of 
it. 

In my youth, in my childhood, I 
played upon this temple block. I 
recall it before any buildings that 
we now see were erected upon it, 
although the house of the Lord, the 
temple of our God, was commenced 
before the time that my memory 
goes back to. The great tabernacle 
— I recall well when it was being 
built, and the old tabernacle in the 
corner, that stood before it, and ten 
or fifteen rods northwest from 
here, the old bowery, which stood 
before it. In it was held the near- 
est thing to an open air meeting that 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I was acquainted with in my child- 
hood. In the old bowery, I remem- 
ber listening to the words of Presi- 
dent Brigham Young and Heber C. 
Kimball, and other leaders of the 
Church. I have lived to see, since 
those days, which were in the be- 
ginning of things in this great city 
of Salt Lake, the wonderful devel- 
opment and progress that has tak- 
en place. I have lived to see the ful- 
fillment of the prophecies of God 
concerning the growth of this peo- 
ple ; to see the triumph of truth 
over error; to see the mercies and 
blessings and support of our Father 
in heaven, in preserving His people 
in possession of this land, and in 
control of its greater interests. 

I rejoice when I look upon these 
buildings and contemplate the spirit 
and feeling that led President 
Young to erect the tabernacle, that 
there might be room in which the 
Saints could assemble to worship 
God at our conferences. When I 
think of this glorious house of the 
Lord, in which the ordinances of 
everlasting life can be performed 
for the living and the dead ; when I 
look yonder and see one of the finest 
educational institutions that there is 
in the west, a creation of our faith 
and the labors of our hands ; when 
I see, in fulfillment of one of the 
earliest revelations given in the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, 
this splendid hostlery that has been 
reared, a monument to the good 
taste, the hospitality, and the good 
will of our people toward mankind ; 
because it was said we should have 
in Zion a house in which the stran- 
ger might be received and enter- 
tained within our gates, into which 
the noble, the great, and the learned 
of the world should come, and 
should receive of our hospitality. I 
am happy when I think of this great 
institution across the road, the larg- 



est and finest publishing and print- 
ing establishment in the west. Out 
from its presses go tens and hun- 
dreds of thousands of copies of sa- 
cred and glorious works, bearing 
testimony to mankind of the intel- 
ligence, the faith, and devotion of 
the people, whose lives were planted 
in these valleys of the mountains 
in the days when they were desert, 
and of their determination to be in 
the forefront of all things that 
make for the comfort, happiness, in- 
telligence, education, development, 
and progress and uplift of mankind. 
I am glad that we have upon the 
site of the old school house, where 
I first went to school, the Vermont 
building, the Deseret Museum, now 
being prepared so that you can go 
there and see an accumulation of 
some of the most wonderful things 
that have ever been discovered in 
these mountains. 

We have all about us the evidence 
of God's help, of His support, of 
His good will towards us. We have 
survived the onslaught of every in- 
fluence and power that could be 
raised against us, as a people, to 
prevent the achievement that you 
see here manifested in these struc- 
tures round about you. The very 
first thing that I remember in my 
life was standing by my mother's 
knee in an open air meeting at the 
head of Big Cottonwood Canyon, 
while my father read before the 
congregation assembled there, the 
announcement that an army, the 
army of the United States, was 
marching toward us to destroy the 
Mormon people. I remember, five 
years after that, scurrying cati- 
corner across this block, from the 
old school in Union Square, where 
Brother Rich and Judge Smith, and 
some others, I see here, used to go, 
because the guns of an army were 
being trained upon our homes and

the home of the President of the 
Church. I recall the efforts that 
have been made by legislation and 
by extra judicial procedure to hin- 
der the progress of this work, to 
embarrass and hurt, and if possible, 
destroy, those who are engaged in 
it ; and how futile all these efforts 
have been. Today, while we may 
not be the most numerous, and it is 
not our destiny ever to become so, 
we occupy a unique position before 
mankind. We are setting an exam- 
ple of the best that there is in the 
world, and right here in Salt Lake 
City, in spite of all opposition, in 
spite of the incoming of wealth 
from the outside, from wealth that 
our people have produced from 
within, we have thus far maintained 
the lead. We have, as I have stat- 
ed, the best churches, the best hos- 
pital, the best school-houses and 
gymnasium, the best hotel, the best 
printing establishment, and the best 
of everything that makes for re- 
ligion, for social progress and wel- 
fare, for education, and for the en- 
tertainment and happiness of the 
people. 

Now, if God will continue to be 
as good to us as He has been in the 
past, we should be able to maintain 
this position with respect to our fel- 
low men. It is my testimony, and 
my belief, that it is the destiny of 
the Latter-day Saints, to occupy 
that oosition in the lead, and that 
God has called us by His own voice 
to take the lead ; to teach mankind 
the truth, to declare that He is, and 
that He loves His children, and is 
concerned with respect to them ; and 
that He calls them from the length 
and breadth of the earth to come 
up to Zion, that they may learn of 
His ways and be taught the truth, 
the everlasting truth, that will save 
their, souls. 

May He grant to us, every one 



of us, the opportunity of bearing 
the testimony that is within us of 
the divinity of the work that we are 
engaged in. I know, as Brother 
Rich has said he knows, in every 
fibre of my being, that the truth has 
been taught by the leaders of Israel : 
that the Prophet Joseph was called 
of God; that Brigham Young was 
a man of God, a prophet, a seer, a 
revelator, to this people; a mighty 
leader, made great and powerful 
and influential, by the blessing and 
inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I 
know the men that have succeeded 
these in the leadership of this 
Church, have been men of God ; 
and that there never breathed a 
truer, more faithful, devoted, sin- 
cere, honest, servant of Almighty 
God than Joseph F. Smith, the pres- 
ent president of this Church. 

My brothers and sisters, my 
friends, the truth that has been 
given to us has made us free. We 
stand here, and before all men, de- 
livered from the shackles of tradi- 
tions that are false, made acquaint- 
ed with the mind and will of the 
Almighty, concerning us ; knowing 
that we may walk according to His 
will and live according to His de- 
sign and purpose in placing us up- 
on this earth ; and that we may as- 
sist in bringing to pass the redemp- 
tion of mankind and the establish- 
ment of truth and righteousness 
that is destined to prevail over the 
earth. 

May God grant that our testi- 
monies and our faith may ever in- 
crease within us, for Jesus' sake. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELEK. 

(President of Utah Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters and 
friends, this is a new experience to 
me, but I trust that I shall have

sufficient of the Spirit of the Lord 
that I may say a few things that 
will be of interest and comfort to 
those who are assembled here this 
afternoon. 

I was reminded, when listening 
to the brethren speak, of a word 
that is set forth in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, in the first revelation, 
wherein the Lord is giving the rea- 
son for His Church to be organized 
in these, the latter times. Speaking 
of the commandments, these com- 
mandments that are in this book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, and why 
they were given to His servant, Jo- 
seph Smith, he says, among other 
things, "That every man might 
speak in the name of God, the Lord, 
even the Savior of the world ; that 
faith might increase in the earth." 
Tnat is one of the reasons for this 
great latter-day work, that faith 
may be increased in the earth, be- 
cause, without faith it will be im- 
possible for men and women to be 
saved in His kingdom. The breth- 
ren have referred to the many and 
mighty works that have been per- 
formed by the Latter-day Saints, 
and to the words of prophecy, 
wherein they look forward to the 
budding up of a great common- 
wealth in this western country. 
They have referred to material 
works, wherein these great struc- 
tures that have been referred to. 
have been reared. Now, why all 
of these things, is more than we can 
tell upon this occasion — why all of 
these things? They have been ac- 
complished because of the faith that 
was generated in the hearts of men 
and women, our parents who came 
here, who started out, many of 
them, without knowing whither 
they were going or where their feet 
would find rest, and came here be- 
cause they had implicit faith in 
God — the very thing that God de- 



sired that men should have — that 
faith should increase in the earth. 
Now, what we behold today, what 
we see ?nd understand of this great 
work, is a result of the faith of 
those who have lived before us, and 
those who are living now. How 
shall we, the posterity of these pio- 
neers, how shall we, men and breth- 
ren, increase our faith, that we, like- 
wise, may accomplish something in 
•-he earth toward our present, our 
temporal and our spiritual salvation. 
We will get this faith by living the 
gospel as it has been revealed to us 
in these latter times. We will gen- 
erate faith sufficient that we will be 
enabled to accomplish that which 
God desires us to accomplish, we 
who are living in this day and 
generation. 

The mind of man is peculiar, it 
is wonderful. It is past finding out 
how it is that it can be wrought up- 
on by the Power from on high, that 
it can accomplish things that are 
wonderful in the sight of men. If 
men would live and women would 
live day by day, as best they know 
how, as they associate one with an- 
other, in their various walks, in 
their various businesses in life, if 
they, under the light of the Spirit 
of Truth, would seek to do, day by 
day, that which their hands find to 
do, and that which their hearts de- 
sire to do, they would generate this 
faith, they would build it up in their 
hearts, and they would become a 
mighty power. 

Brother Wells referred to the fact 
that this people are few. There is 
an old prophet in the Book of Mor- 
mon, who looked down to our time, 
before the coming of the Savior, and 
noted that the Church was small, its 
members were few, but there was a 
mighty power with the few. 

My brethren and sisters, we have 
one of the grandest opportunities 



ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIP MAN. 



that was ever presented to a people 
upon the face of the earth, to learn 
the things of God. The Lord has 
made Himself manifest to this peo- 
ple, and, although their numbers 
are few, they have the power, 
through God, within them, to ac- 
complish everything that has been 
promised that the people of God 
should accomplish in these latter 
times. This Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is broad enough, high 
enough, deep enough to compre- 
hend all things, and to save every 
man and every woman that has 
come upon the face of the earth ; 
not only those that have lived when 
the oracles of God have been upon 
the earth, but those who have died 
and passed away. This gospel will 
be preached to all, to every creature, 
everyone will have an opportunity 
to accept or reject the principles of 
the gospel. 

There stands before us a monu- 
ment of God's goodness, that won- 
derful temple, in which the ordin- 
ances for the dead may be accom- 
plished. There is only a little be- 
•ginning in that work. The dead are 
being redeemed, children are being 
united to parents, husbands and 
wives are being united in eternal re- 
lationship, and the great links of 
kinship from Adam down to the 
pi esent time are being welded. 
Those who have passed away at 
times when darkness has been upon 
the earth, and gross darkness 
found in the minds of the people, 
will have u chance to hear the ever- 
lasting gospel, the gladsome sound, 
and embrace the same ; and the 
work will be done for them here up- 
on the earth by their children whose 
hearts will be turned to them, and 
there will be great rejoicing in 
heaven and on earth. 

Now, there have been committed 
to the Latter-day Saints these pre- 



cious principles, principles of salva- 
tion, which are to make happy all 
of the duldren of men, and place 
them in z position to enjoy all that 
is possible for their souls to enjoy, 
and this all has come about by the 
goodness of our God. 

I bear testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters and f riends,that 
this is the work of Almighty God. 1 
know it ; no man has told me, I 
know it for myself, and not for 
another. I bear testimony that in- 
asmuch as we will be obedient to 
the principles of the gospel, as 
taught by the Latter-day Saints, we 
shall come to a knowledge of these 
things. We need not. depend upon 
any man for this knowledge, each 
will know it for himself, and know 
it better than anyone can tell him. 
I testify to you that the living ora- 
cles are upon the earth today, that 
President Joseph F. Smith is really 
and truly a prophet of God, and 
president of God's work here upon 
the earth. May this testimony be 
in the hearts of every one of you, 
my brethren and sisters and friends, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN. 

(President of Alpine Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I trust that during the few moments 
that I occupy, I may be impressed 
to say something that will be bene- 
ficial and of profit to those who may 
listen, as well as to myself. I have 
had many reflections while the 
brethren have been speaking to us. 
I have thought of the power of 
God that has been made manifest 
upon many occasions, that has been 
an evidence and a testimony to me 
of the divinity of this great latter- 
day work, in which we are engaged. 

I have listened with a great deal 
of interest to the remarks of our 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brethren. I have been acquainted 
with these men for many years, and 
I know them to be men of God, men 
of great worth in the community, 
in the labor of love that we have 
espoused, in preaching the gospel, 
in building up Zion and instilling 
into the hearts of the young and 
rising generation the principles of 
the gospel. The power that attends 
these principles in the growth and 
development of our young people is 
what we need in our midst. 

I was reflecting when President 
Rich spoke of the young men who 
had been on missions continuing at 
home in the same good missionary 
spirit that had predominated in 
their hearts and in 'their labors in 
the mission field. I have had the 
pleasure, and the privilege of 
preaching the gospel in some of the 
nations of the earth, and I can say 
that the spirit that is usually mani- 
fest among the elders, is a spirit of 
love, the spirit of charity, the spirit 
of forgiveness, the spirit of will- 
ingness to go and to come at the 
bidding of those who preside over 
them, in preaching and presenting 
the principles of the gospel to the 
inhabitants of the earth. 

We discover that some of our 
young men, on their return in our 
midst, become somewhat luke-warm 
and careless pertaining to their du- 
ties and labors in the stakes of Zion. 
It has been my prerogative and 
privilege to preside over a stake of 
Zion now for ten years, laboring 
with the young people, preparing 
them to go abroad and preach the 
gospel, and to labor at home in the 
various organizations of the Church, 
schooling them in the principles of 
the gospel, so that they would be 
more useful in the sphere in which 
they operate. We occasionally dis- 
cover among our young people, es- 



pecially among the young men, a 
spirit of indifference and careless- 
ness as they grow up in our midst. 
I think perhaps this is due to the 
fact that we, as fathers and moth- 
ers, do not follow up, as closely as 
we should, our young men and 
young girls in their amusements and 
in their work. We too freely allow 
them to go and come as they please, 
and they have acquired more or less 
a spirit of independence and free- 
dom in having their own way. 

This reminds me forcibly of a 
play put upon our stage at one time, 
where a young man, who had 
formed a habit of drinking and 
smoking, and possibly profaning 
and doing other things that some- 
times young men subject themselves 
to, he, singing upon the stage, made 
the statement, "I have had my own 
way. Don't I look it?" He cer- 
tainly did look it ; and I think this is 
the great trouble with some young 
men, they have had their own way, 
and they look it. 

Solomon said, "Train up a child 
in the way he should go, and when 
he is old he will not depart from it." 
Some of our people, I think, mis- 
take this reading. They think if 
they teach their children correct 
principles that they ought to grow 
up and be all right; but this is not 
always the case. Our children 
should be trained to make them- 
selves useful from their infancy up, 
they should be doers of the word aa 
well as hearers, and when they get 
old, they will not depart from it. 
It has been my experience and ob- 
servation that among the young 
men who go upon missions and re- 
ceive honorable releases, when they 
return home there are some who 
resume objectionable habits in 
which they had indulged before they 
went away. In most of such cases 



i

where they do fall away, it is be- 
cause they had not formed proper 
habits in their earlier lives. 

I was reading, a short time ago, a 
statement of one of the professors 
in a California university, where 
he said : "You permit young men 
to sow their wild oats, as you call 
it, and as a rule, they will continue 
to sow wild oats in their manhood." 
I believe there is regretable truth 
connected with this. 

I notice young men and young 
ladies who take active part in our 
Mutual Improvement Associations, 
our Sunday Schools, Primaries, and 
other organizations and quorums of 
the Church, if they work and labor 
diligently in these quorums, they 
grow and develop in the gospel. 
These are the young men and wom- 
en who remain stable as a rule, in 
the Church. These are the young 
men who fill honorable missions and 
then come home and remain faith- 
ful, who are obedient under the di- 
rection of those who preside over 
them. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
you, increase your faith, and 
strengthen your testimonies con- 
cerning this work. I testify to you 
that I know, as I know that I am 
standing here, that this is really and 
truly the work of God. It has not 
been instituted by men, it has been 
instituted by God, and it will stand 
forever. 

May God bless you, and may we 
hold on to the iron rod, which is the 
word of God, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Supt. of Bureau of Information.) 

I am glad to meet this large as- 
sembly here, and to join with you 
in the spirit of praise that goes out 



from every heart for that which God 
has accomplished for Israel. I re- 
alize that you have already ex- 
pressed your feelings in the song of 
praise, "We thank Thee, O God, for 
a Prophet." I believe that you 
meant every word that you sang, 
that you are grateful unto God for 
every revelation that He has given, 
for having sent unto us a Prophet 
in the person of Joseph Smith, and 
that unto that Prophet He gave 
sacred revelations and has given un- 
to us also light and wisdom, and 
made known unto us the will of 
God. 

I rejoice that God and His Son, 
Jesus Christ, vouchsafed to appear 
unto the youthful Prophet, and es- 
tablished in his young heart the 
truth that a mighty, a marvelous, 
a wonderful work, was about to 
come forth among the children of 
men. I rejoice with you that God 
fulfilled His promise, that Moroni, 
the prophet, appeared, giving unto 
Joseph the Prophet sacred records 
pertaining unto the ancient people 
who lived upon this continent; that 
subsequently other messengers ap- 
peared, and made clear unto the 
Prophet's mind every principle per- 
taining to the restoration of the gos- 
pel in the latter days. 

We thank God that He has 
blessed the efforts of our prophets, 
that He has blessed our elders, our 
"boys" who have gone forth in 
weakness unto the nations of the 
earth, and that He has made 
them mighty in gathering in scat- 
tered Israel. I rejoice in the op- 
portunities given to spread the truth 
upon this sacred block, and to cor- 
rect the many misrepresentations 
that are made concerning us. Some 
people delight in telling stories 
which mislead the visitors. 

Two weeks ago, a gentleman ac- 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



companied a few tourist friends up- 
on this block, and declared : Why, 
the "Mormons" believe that the 
statue Moroni, on the top of the 
temple, in a very short time will 
come down and minister unto the 
children of men — that the bronze 
image will come to life. Of course, 
it afforded us opportunity to declare 
the truth. We say that the statue 
represents Moroni, the angel of the 
last dispensation : and that Moroni 
lives. He lives now . He appeared, 
a resurrected being, unto the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith, and declared unto 
him that the time had already come 
when the records of the people who 
lived upon this continent should be 
brought forth. We are pleased 
when we have such an opportunity 
of declaring more forcibly the 
truth, that this is the work of God, 
that the angel, Moroni, actually 
lives now, and has ministered in 
our day. 

Other misrepresentations are 
made regarding our sacred temple, 
and we have opportunity of explain- 
ing the work associated with sal- 
vation of the dead; and that in ac- 
cordance with that which God has 
revealed, our people go there and 
are baptized for their dead, that they 
might live : for we are seeking to 
save souls, not to destroy them. We 
bear testimony to all, to every na- 
tion, kindred, tongue and people 
that our work is for the salvation 
of souls, and for the redemption of 
the living and the dead. It is the 
plan of salvation. God has revealed 
it, and as He gives us strength, we 
will declare it. "This gospel of the 
kingdom must be preached as a wit- 
ness unto all nations, and then shall 
the end come." 

May God help us to be true, unto 
that which God has given, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

What we have heard from the 
brethren today in regard to our 
faith, and the introduction of the 
gospel in these latter times, are testi- 
monies that have come from the 
hearts of these elders who have been 
faithful during long years of ex- 
perience in proclaiming these great 
principles pertaining to the Gospel 
of our Lord, Jesus. 

I had designed, in arising before 
you, to make some remarks in rela- 
tion to this building here, the Bu- 
reau of Information, which was 
found to be a necessity when vast 
numbers of tourists and visitors, 
from all the civilized nations of the 
earth, with their faces set toward 
Utah and the great west, began to 
come here by thousands and tens 
of thousands. At one of our gen- 
eral conferences in the year 1901, or 
just prior to that, one of the breth- 
ren said it would be a very good 
thing to establish a place where 
tourists and visitors could come and 
be informed concerning the history 
of the Latter-day Saints, and of 
their intentions for the future, and 
regarding the life of the people in 
their homes throughout this inter- 
mountain region. Accordingly, in 
1902, the Church erected a small, 
frame building, near where this 
beautiful structure now stands, and 
when that was finished, the people 
began to flock to it, visitors from 
the United States, and from the old 
world. 

Two years later it was found that 
a larger and a better building was 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 113 



needed, and so the frame one was 
removed and the present brick 
structure was erected. In the year 
last past, 1910, the eastern portion 
of the building was added, for the 
benefit of the numerous visitors to 
this temple block. Brother Benjam- 
in Goddard, the director of this in- 
stitution under the Presidency of 
the Church, with fifty or more help- 
ers, male and female, are daily en- 
gaged in receiving the visitors. I 
am proud to say to you that since 
the opening of this building, the es- 
tablishment of this bureau of in- 
formation, we have, in the ten years, 
had visitors to the number of about 
2,000,000 generally intelligent peo- 
ple, averaging about 200,000 each 
year, among whom are found the 
very best classes of people that the 
world contains today, and includ- 
ing some of the nobility of Europe. 

When I use the word nobility, I 
speak of the ranks established 
among the crowned heads and noble 
families of Europe, as they are rec- 
ognized there. But, I recognize 
this grand truth, my brethren and 
sisters, and friends, that there are 
no more noble people in the earth, 
nor ever will be any more noble 
people visit these grounds than I 
see before me today. I realize that, 
of the working men, manufacturers, 
and the many other classes of peo- 
ple who have come here as tourists 
and visitors, the farmers, tillers of 
the soil rank among the best on the 
earth. There are no more noble 
people than those who cultivate the 
soil God has given them, make it 
produce the necessaries of life, and 
provide comforts and blessings for 
themselves and their families. I re- 
fer not only to Latter-day Saints, 
but also to our friends that are gath- 
ered in the different states, neigh- 
bors to our people in these great 



western communities. I say again, 
they are among the noble people of 
the earth. We are trying to teach 
them the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, as we have learned it. We 
have learned that humility was nec- 
essary, and that faith in God was 
also a requisite. When we have 
attained humility and faith, we de- 
sire further to learn how to serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments. Hence, our elders teach that 
it is necessary to be so humble, so 
contrite in spirit, that we will de- 
sire, that we will not rest content- 
ed, until we have done as did our 
Savior, our Lord Jesus, when He 
came to John in the wilderness, and 
said : I seek baptism at your hands, 
John. He demanded, it is worded, 
and that demand was no doubt made 
in such gentle language that this 
prophet, (who was that prophet 
who had lifted his voice against 
Herod's sin and iniquity), this 
prophet from the wilderness, John, 
said to him : "I have need to be 
baptized of thee, and comest thou 
to me?" We know, my brethren, 
sisters, and friends, this fact that, 
if it was necessary for our Lord, 
our Redeemer, to receive baptism 
from the hands of one who was 
called and ordained to minister in 
that service, it is absolutely neces- 
sary that we follow His great and 
glorious example. We must go in- 
to the waters of baptism, for the re- 
mission of our sins, that we may 
stand spotless and clean before our 
Maker ; then receive the laying on 
of hands, by one called and appoint- 
ed to that authority, for the recep- 
tion of the Holy Ghost, which shall 
lead the minds of all who accept 
these glorious principles to greater 
light, greater knowledge, and great- 
er wisdom than could be possessed 
without it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



My brethren and sisters, speaking 
of that great temple which is in our 
view, I remember very well the days 
of the dedicatorial service therein, 
and I remember one fact I learned 
there that brought to my mind great 
comfort and joy; I heard a prophet 
of the Lord testify that he had re- 
ceived a vision from the eternal 
world. In that great Rouse Presi- 
dent Woodruff stood up and testi- 
fied : "About three years ago," said 
he, "I recived in vision a visit from 
President Brigham Young. Presi- 
dent Brigham Young came to me, 
and said, 'Brother Woodruff, take 
the keys of the temple, and unlock 
the doors and let the people in.' " 

Brother Woodruff said, "At that 
time I was president of the apostles, 
President John Taylor was then liv- 
ing, and was President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints ; and I marveled that 
Brigham Young had come to me 
and given me this commission ; but 
today," said he, "President Taylor 
has passed away, and I have been 
called to occupy this responsible po- 
sition, of president of the Church ; 
and now I no longer marvel, for I 
have done as I Was commanded, and 
I have taken the keys to this holy 
house, and I have opened the doors 
and I have bid the people enter." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, as 
has been testified to you today, that 
building stands as a monument of 
the faithful labors of the Latter-day 
Saints. When Brigham Young 
came here, a pioneer, with his faith- 
ful little band of one hundred, and 
forty-three persons, he placed the 
point of his cane in the ground, 
nearly at the southeast corner, it is 
believed, of where the building now 
stands, and he said, "Here we will 
build the house of the Lord, a tem- 
ple to our God." Forty years after 



its commencement it was finished; 
it was begun in 1853, and complet- 
ed in 1893. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, it 
was for no ulterior or wicked pur- 
pose or plan that that magnificent 
structure was erected. It was reared 
by the faithful labor and toil of the 
Latter-day Saints ; and, especially in 
the first few years of its progress, 
the building was continued by the 
help of the people while in extreme 
poverty, with very little means to 
push it forward. Hence its devel- 
opment was slow. But, at its com- 
pletion we were satisfied, because 
testimonies were borne in that sa- 
cred building, during the dedica- 
torial services, that God had indeed 
accepted it, even as He accepted 
those temples that had been builded 
before. This fact was verified by 
the inspiration of the Spirit of the 
Lord resting upon those brethren 
who testified that God had indeed 
accepted the labors of the Latter- 
day Saints, and sanctioned the plac- 
ing of His name upon that sacred 
building. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
thank you very much for your at- 
tention here this afternoon, and I 
thank our visitors also. I say to all 
those who have been here to view 
these temple grounds, and hear 
about the Latter-day Saints, you are 
welcomed, heartily welcomed by 
those who labor here in this bureau 
of information. I repeat, you are 
welcome here today, my brethren, 
sisters, and friends ; we greet you as 
friends, and we are glad to see you 
always. May God bless you wher- 
ever you go, in all your walks of 
life. If there are any here who have 
not had faith in the gospel, as we 
have faith in it, I trust that vour 
hearts mav be softened to that de- 
gree by what you have heard, and 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS.

what you may hear in the future, 
that you too will receive the spirit 
of repentance, and draw near unto 
God, and be enabled to work out 
your salvation and redemption; in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn ; 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that "Prophet and 
Seer"— 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Francis McDonald. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order, and stated 
that President John Henry Smith, 
who is rapidly recovering from re- 
cent serious illness, sends loving 
greeting to the Saints assembled in 
Conference. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"From afar, gracious Lord, Thou 
hast gathered Thy flock." 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. 
F. Middleton. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Awake, my soul;" Thomas Ash- 
worth and Margaret Summerhays 
rendered the tenor and soprano du- 
ets. 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

"By their fruits ye shall know them." 
— Law of investigation before judg- 
ment established at Runnimede. — 
The Church and its members invite 
righteous criticism. — Love of God 
and loyalty to country characteris- 
tic. — Degradation of "Mormon" 
women an outrageous calumny. 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. 
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or 
figs of thistles? 

"Even so every good tree bringeth 



forth good fruit : but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil 
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit." 

I am a believer, my brethren and 
sisters, in the infallibility of the law 
suggested in these words of the 
Savior of the world. By it all things 
must stand or fall. However much 
I might desire to avoid it, I know 
that inevitably a time must come 
when I shall be judged according 
to the deeds done in the body. I 
know, too, that I shall be judged 
righteously, not by the testimony of 
wicked men, men unfamiliar with 
my life and works, but that I shall 
have a fair and impartial hearing 
and a righteous judgment. For. 
this principle, this doctrine was set- 
tled more than six hundred years 
ago, upon the field of Runnimede, 
and it has continued to prevail until 
men, today, stand united in the doc- 
trine, that before conviction there 
must be evidence. Those stalwart 
men who stood there with arms in 
their hands before a tyrant king, de- 
clared that the assertion of wrong- 
doing was not sufficient to justify 
conviction, and that from that time 
forth men must be judged by their 
peers, dispassionately, fairly, hon- 
estly judged. Thank the Lord that 
doctrine has survived the centuries 
and has become so thoroughly es- 
tablished that I have confidence that 
eventually intelligent people will be 
brought to -reach conclusions by 
having applied it. It is not always 
easy in the beginning to distinguish 
right from wrong, truth from er- 
ror ; for vice, sometimes, comes 
clothed in the garb of virtue; and 
evil is, sometimes, presented in a 
manner so attractive that it appears 
to us to be good ; but always we 
know that in the end the truth 
must be manifest.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I am reminded that last season 
I visited the field of a neighbor of 
mine. He was a good farmer, and 
had prepared the ground admirably. 
He had sent up here into the north 
for seed, and had sown it with what 
he supposed to be alfalfa. It came 
out of the ground beautifully, and 
he was congratulated by his neigh- 
bors that his sowing had been suc- 
cessful. I drove down past the field, 
and as I looked at it in the distance 
I felt, also, impressed that he had 
accomplished a splendid work. 
When we got nearer, I said to my 
son, "Stop a minute, I want to ex- 
amine that field more critically." I 
went over and examined the leaves 
of the plants, and said, "It isn't al- 
falfa at all ; when it comes to ma- 
ture it will be a crop of sweet- 
clover ;" that plant with little value, 
almost a nuisance in some in- 
stances ; and my conclusions proved 
to be correct. The seed itself had 
been so similar — perhaps an expert 
might have detected the difference, 
but the farmer himself had never 
suspected the imposition, and it re- 
quired time until the crop had de- 
veloped, that he might know that he 
had been imposed upon. Some years 
ago, while I lived in Mexico, I sent 
to a nurseryman in the State of 
Ohio for a collection of roses. They 
came, and I planted them. They 
were just little slips,all looking very 
much alike. In fact, I gave partic- 
ular attention to some shoots which 
looked more vigorous than others, I 
cultivated them, and they grew. 
Finally, the second year, they pro- 
duced blossoms and I was surprised 
to discover that they were wild 
roses, just the little roses that grow 
upon the creek bottoms, that could 
be found anywhere ; but their com- 
panions, all around them, were pro- 
ducing the most beautiful flowers. 
The bud which had been grafted in- 



to the wild root or stem had been 
broken off — I do not suppose it was 
intentional upon the part of the 
nurseryman — and the wild buds 
had come out, and produced wild 
fruit. I said, there is no avoiding 
that fundamental truth, "As the 
fountain is, so will the water be;" 
as the seed is so will that be which 
it produces. You cannot gather figs 
from thistles. A good tree does not 
produce bad fruit; neither does a 
bad tree produce good fruit. The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints stands upon this ground. 

I think I voice the sentiment of 
every man and woman who have 
identified themselves with the 
Church, when I say they are willing 
to be judged by their works, by the 
fruit which has been produced ; but 
they ask that they be judged right- 
eously. They have never been 
averse to righteous criticism; they 
invite it; they seek it; but they do 
object and are opposed to judgment 
pronounced by those who are unac 
quainted with the truth, by those 
who, perhaps for personal reasons, 
are opposed to the truth and ene- 
mies to it, and so must all things 
stand. The great Catholic church, 
professing as it does, to be the legal 
successor of the Church of Christ, 
as He established it, must show by 
its fruits that the claim is just and 
true, or else the time must come 
when it will be repudiated. Pro- 
testantism must stand upon the 
same ground ; for if Protestants 
produce the fruits of the gospel of 
Christ, if they show by their works 
that they are in reality reformers, 
who have improved upon conditions 
as they existed in the primitive 
Church, and that they are doing the 
will of the Father, as exemplified in 
the life and teachings of the Savior 
of the world, they may stand ; but 
if it shall be shown, eventually, that 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



117 



they lack the power of God, that the 
fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ 
have not been produced, they must 
be rejected. 

The day was when it was popular 
to attack the doctrinal principles of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The articles of faith 
of the Church, contained upon this 
little card which I hold in my hand, 
a card printed in a foreign lan- 
guage, which I used in my youth as 
I preached the doctrines of the 
Church, have been before the world 
for eighty years. In the beginning 
it was not unusual that these doc- 
trines were attacked ; but you do 
not hear so much of that in these 
days ; men have learned by experi- 
ence that it is useless to attack those 
principles, if they profess faith at 
all, if they accept the Bible as their 
guide in religious life; they have 
long since discovered that those 
doctrines are invincible, and have 
ceased to assail them. They at- 
tack us now in another way, pub- 
lishing to the world that while the 
doctrines of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints appear 
to be good, while they appear to be 
scriptural, while the things we pro- 
claim to the world and teach pub- 
licly at home appear to be good, 
that there is underlying it all a sin- 
ister motive. They say the Church 
is not sincere, that it is not a Chris- 
tian organization at all, but that it 
has behind it all some sinister mo- 
tive by which it is hoped that men 
and women may be deluded and led 
into error until a great establish- 
ment may be builded up antagonis- 
tic to the spirit of Christianity, an- 
tagonistic to the institutions of our 
country, by which the government 
may be overthrown, or some other 
awful thing, I do not know just 
what it is that they apprehend, ac- 
complished. Now, I want to ask in 



all candor, you Latter-day Saints 
who have been identified with the 
Church from the beginning, have 
you ever, any one of you, discov- 
ered in the published utterances of 
the representatives of the Church, 
or secret counsels anything which 
would suggest, in the faintest de- 
gree, that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is a 
treasonable organization, that it has 
in it anything which is antagonis- 
tic to the principles of civil govern- 
ment as they exist in this repub- 
lic, or in any of the other govern- 
ments of the world? I know what 
you will say ; every one of you 
would rise up to say, No ; there is 
nothing of that kind in it. Then I 
would like to ask the world to re- 
view the history of the Church, dur- 
ing the past eighty years, and let us 
see if we can find some single act of 
the Church itself, or any individual, 
which suggests treason ; for treason 
and sedition, if it were true that 
they existed in the Church, would 
make it unworthy a place in this 
government or any other; because 
treason, or sedition, that which 
seeks to destroy, that which seeks 
by improper means to establish it- 
self and overturn existing condi- 
tions, is unworthy in any state, un- 
worthy any community, unworthy 
of any Church. 

I do not expect, this afternoon, 
to go into detail in establishing the 
truth of what I say, but I want to 
make this appeal to the American 
people. I feel as though "Mor- 
monism" is on trial today; it has 
been on trial, in fact, from the very 
beginning. Two thousand repre- 
sentatives of the Church are out in 
the world; they are preaching the 
doctrine of repentance; they are 
preaching the doctrine of good 
works ; they are emphasizing the 
doctrine contained in this scripture. 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



which I have read, that without 
works it is impossible to please God, 
and that men and communities and 
nations must, eventually, be judged 
by the deeds done in the body. They 
are admonishing men and women to 
lives of righteousness, and virtue, 
and truth, and goodness, and are 
lifting up their voices in opposition 
to the very appearance of evil. On 
the other hand, millions of people 
are reading today the declaration 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is a treasonable 
organization ; that it does not stand 
for truth ; that it does not stand for 
righteousness ; that it does not 
stand for morality; that it does not 
stand for the institutions of this 
country of ours. I simply want to 
ask the American people — and I 
have faith in their integrity and the 
justice of their conclusions — that 
before deciding this great question, 
you take the trouble to investigate, 
that you take the trouble to deter- 
mine what have been the fruits of 
"Mormonism" during these past 
eighty years, and then be ye the 
judges as to whether the fruit is 
good or bad, and be slow to listen 
to men who have been cast from 
the Church because of their un- 
righteousness. Be slow to listen to 
men who, because of their own dis- 
appointment, would seek to make it 
appear that the Church is doing the 
very things which it has positively 
refused to do in their behalf. I ask 
you to suspend judgment until you 
shall have thoroughly investigated 
the truth. The Church has no fear 
of the ultimate result. We are not 
a people who blow trumpets before 
us as we go. 

We believe that good citizenship 
consists in obeying the law, in de- 
fending the government in which 
we live. We do not hasten into 
war, because . we do not believe in 



it; we believe it to be unnecessary; 
but, nevertheless, if it shall come, 
we believe it to be our duty to defend 
those principles of liberty and right 
and equality which were estab- 
lished by the Father ; and as an 
earnest of our belief, circumstances 
considered, we have performed our 
full duty. We went into the war 
with Mexico, under conditions that 
no other people in the world have 
furnished an army. We did our 
part, small though it were, in the 
Civil War. We have done our pari 
in the Spanish-American war. We 
stand ready, distasteful though the 
duty might be, to perform our part 
wherever necessity may require. It 
stands to the credit of this people, 
so far as I am aware, that not one 
of the members of the Church has 
ever been found in armed opposi- 
tion to organized government. 
Some one, perhaps, says : "Why, 
were you not in armed resistance 
to the government of the United 
States?" No; we never were. It 
is very true that in 1857 an army 
came to Utah — and why? Be- 
cause, as I said in the beginning, 
vice clothed in the garb of virtue 
had made it appear to the presi- 
dent of the United States that out 
here in the Salt Lake Valley a peo- 
ple were in rebellion ; that they had 
destroyed the records of the courts ; 
that they had expelled the repre- 
sentatives of the United States ; 
that they refused to recognize the 
properly appointed governor of 
the territory. So the president of 
the United States, believing these 
things, sent a new governor, with 
an escort to establish him in the 
place to which he had been appoint- 
ed. What did the Latter-day Saints 
say? They said, "We want an im- 
partial hearing; these things are 
not true ;" and they did take up 
arms that they might delay the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 



119 



coming of that army, and the 
dreadful results which might have 
followed its arrival, until the truth 
might be known. What was the 
result when it was known? When 
an impartial man came, he found 
the records intact; he found the 
people ready to welcome that new 
governor, and to install and pro- 
tect him. There was not one scin- 
tilla of truth in the charges which 
had been made. The end had come, 
so far as that question was con- 
cerned, and deception was no 
longer possible ; and it was proven, 
just as it always has been and al- 
ways will be proven that the Church 
was true to the government, true 
to their professions of righteous- 
ness. Now, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I bear witness to you that just 
as this question to which I refer 
was shown to be an effort upon the 
part of those who were opposed to 
that which was right, to bring trou- 
ble to an innocent people, so has 
every other question which has 
arisen and which has appeared to 
place the Latter-day Saints in op- 
position to the government of this 
country, upon close examination 
proven to be wrong. It always 
must be so ; it can be no other way. 

They say that "Mormonism" 
goes out into the world and gath- 
ers up women; that it brings them 
here to degrade them; that it is a 
menace to the sanctity of the Amer- 
ican home. Who says that? Any 
woman who has ever been con- 
verted to the truth, any woman who 
has repented and lived the life 
which ought to characterize a fol- 
lower of Christ? No, not one. It 
may be that some man or woman 
has fallen away; it may be that 
some man or woman who has come 
from abroad and been gathered up 
here with the Church, has gone 
back to the world and again be- 



come addicted to sin ; but if that is 
the case in a single instance, it is 
because they have gone away from 
the truths of the gospel and the 
covenant which they made, and 
have lost the faith. Now, do you 
suppose that it would be possible 
for the Church to dominate one or 
two hundred thousand women, and 
keep them here against their wills, 
to be degraded? It is a ridicu- 
lous argument upon the face of it ; 
it is not true. If it were true, the 
Church would be unworthy, and 
the opposition shown today would 
be just; but it is not true. You 
who have come from abroad ; you 
who have identified yourselves with 
this Church; you who have been 
brought out from the sweat-houses 
of the old world and established in 
your own homes, and have been 
made independent, you who have 
reared families in the fear of the 
Lord and have become patriotic, 
law-loving and law-abiding citizens 
of this republic, every one of you 
knows that I am speaking the truth. 
You know that, rather than degra- 
dation, there comes to every one 
through the gospel of our Lord 
Jesus, an uplifting that can not be 
found in any other philosophy in 
the world. We want the world to 
know that; we want them to un- 
derstand it. 

Another thought has come to 
my mind — one that I had not in- 
tended to mention. The world 
says, "You people marry more than 
one wife, and in this you degrade 
woman and drag her down." I 
only want to say that the doctrine 
of plural marriage, as it existed in 
the Church, in the beginning, is no 
more understood by the world than 
are others of the simple doctrines 
of the gospel which it teaches. The 
conception has been entirely wrong. 
We only ask that the world shall 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



become acquainted with these 
women, that they may be witnesses 
in their own behalf. Why, the gov- 
ernment, you know, thought, years 
ago, that our women were being 
degraded, and that they would lib- 
erate these enslaved women in 
Utah. They appropriated a large 
amount of money and came here 
and built a great home, and said, 
"Come, now, all of you women, 
you oppressed women, you de- 
graded women ; come up here ; the 
government will give you protec- 
tion ; its strong arm is around you, 
and its hand over you." I believe 
there was one woman who availed 
herself of that opportunity; (Pres- 
ident Smith: "And she was not a 
member of this Church") and some 
one says she was not a member of 
the Church. (Laughter.) 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
and my friends, I refer to these 
things because they are true, and 
we want you to know the truth; 
we want you to believe in us ; we 
want you to believe that the virtue 
of the Latter-day Saints, as a peo- 
ple, stands today pre-eminently 
above the virtue of any other peo- 
ple. I will not say equal to it ; 1 
know that I speak the truth in the 
statement I have made. Yet, men 
would have you believe that some- 
where in the Church, back of it all, 
there is a system by which men 
may gratify their carnal desires and 
by which women are debauched. A 
more abominable misrepresentation 
of truth could not be presented to 
the world. No man can stand in 
this Church who violates his vir- 
tue ; I do not care who he is ; and 
it is a fundamental law of the 
Church, that men cannot and must 
not consort with women, except 
they be their wives ; neither young 
men, nor old men, nor middle aged 
men ; and if they do that they are 



cast out from the Church. That is 
one thing that is the matter with 
some of them who are villifying 
the Church. When they get out, 
their wicked work begins. The very 
first effort that was ever made to 
discredit the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
so far as I am aware, and to dis- 
credit the Book of Mormon, was 
by a man who had been cast out of 
the Church because of his wick- 
edness, because of his adulterous 
practices. So it has been from the 
very beginning. 

They say we have a great religio- 
political organization here which 
has in it a design to dominate the 
politics of this nation ; and there is 
great danger that this little hand- 
ful of people, in the very near fu- 
ture, may become • so powerful in 
the United States that they will 
control its destinies, or a part of 
them, at least. Suppose a thing 
of that kind were possible — what 
would be the result? Would it be 
a menace to this nation, that there 
should be dominant here a commu- 
nity of men and women who believe 
in God the eternal Father and in 
His Son, Jesus Christ; who believe 
that this government was founded 
of God, by inspired men? Would 
it be a menace that there should be 
industrious, God-fearing, religious 
men and women in greater number 
in these United States? Would it 
be a menace to this government, let 
me ask, if there were a few more 
men in the Congress of the United 
States who stand above the con- 
temptible things of this world, men 
of faith? Are you going to dis- 
franchise a whole people because 
they believe in God and His des- 
tiny, and His power? Are you go- 
ing to prevent a man from exer- 
cising the rights of American citi- 
zenship, because he is a religious 
man? We ask you to judge those 



ELDER ANTHONY W. 1V1NS. 



121 



men who have gone up from among 
the Latter-day Saints to the Con- 
. gress of the United States in the 
past, those men who are there to- 
day. All we ask of you is to judge 
them righteously, to judge them by 
their fruits, to judge them by com- 
parison with their co-laborers. 
Then we ask you, would it be a 
menace to this government or to 
this people if there were more such 
men there? I think you will con- 
clude, with me, that it would not be 
a menace, but on the contrary, that 
it would redound to the credit, the 
honor, and the blessing of this 
people, could such conditions be es- 
tablished. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
must conclude. By their fruits ye 
shall know them. We stand ready 
to be judged by it, and we are not 
going to be driven away from the 
truth ; we are not going to be driven 
away from our loyalty to this gov- 
ernment; we are not going to be 
driven away from our great mission 
which requires us to preach re- 
pentance in all the world and es- 
tablish righteousness; we are not 
going to be driven away from these 
duties by any man or set of men 
who shall seek by ralsehood and 
misrepresentation to drive us away 
from the position that we occupy. 
I know, and you know that deep 
down in the heart of every Latter- 
day Saint, every boy and girl, every 
man and woman in the Church, 
there is that profound faith that 
no other flag on earth shall wave 
over this nation. You know that 
deep down in the heart of every 
Latter-day Saint there is a senti- 
ment that justice and right must 
ever be maintained in this nation ; 
and you know, just as well, that 
down in the heart of every Latter- 
day Saint is that determined faith 
that no sect nor creed, be it "Mor- 



mon," or Catholic, or Protestant, 
shall ever dominate this nation to 
the exclusion of any of the rights 
of citizenship which are guaranteed 
to people under just laws. You 
know it is there, and wicked men 
will never be able to drive the Lat- 
ter-day Saints away from that posi- 
tion, however much they may try. 
We may have to pass through the 
narrows ; we may surfer, for some- 
times the truth does suffer. I am 
reminded that they said the same 
thing of the Savior of the world 
that they have said of us ; they 
said that His doctrines were treas- 
onable, that He was not Caesar's 
friend, that He pretended to be a 
king; and He answered, "Yes, I 
am a king, but my kingdom is not 
of this world." The kingdom of 
God which we preach is the king- 
dom' of righteousness, that should 
be in our hearts and in our lives, 
and that kingdom teaches us obedi- 
ence to the laws of the land, the 
civil laws, and we shall sustain and 
uphold them ; that we are going to 
do. 

My brethren and sisters, be obe- 
dient. The Lord will take care of 
this work; it is His, and He will 
vindicate it. The time will come, 
and it is not very far distant either, 
when its calumniators will be 
known ; and just like that wild 
rose, away down there in Mexico, 
they will be dug up and cast into 
the fire and burned, because they 
will have been proven worthless. 
But the good will remain ; truth will 
prevail, and righteousness cover the 
entire earth. When that time comes 
we are not a bit afraid to meet 
the issue, because we know that we 
can make a good showing, and 
that our conscience, before God 
and man, will be found to be void 
of offense. 

May the Lord bless you ; may He 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bless His work ; and may we al- 
ways be able to properly defend it, 
at home and abroad, wherever we 
are, I pray, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

choir sang the anthem, "The na- 
tions bow to Satan's thrall." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MUBRIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

In standing up in the presence of 
this great congregation this after- 
noon, my brethren and sisters, I cer- 
tainly feel, as others of the brethren 
have expressed themselves, a great 
need for the help of the Lord, and 
for the inspiration of His Holy 
Spirit. It is not my intention to 
occupy much of the time, as it is 
very valuable, and there are others 
of the brethren to address the peo- 
ple who are assembled together in 
this sacred building. I feel, how- 
ever, that I desire to say a few 
words regarding the many misrep- 
resentations that are made rela- 
tive to the doings of the rep- 
resentatives of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ref- 
erence has been made, in our meet- 
ing this afternoon, to the stories 
that are in circulation against the 
people of the Latter-day Saints, and 
in relation to the motives of the 
missionaries who are sent into the 
world to preach the gospel. It has 
fallen to my lot, my brethren and 
sisters, upon various occasions, to 
go abroad as a missionary. I rec- 
ollect very distinctly, at the present 
moment, when I was called upon 
my first mission, about thirty years 
ago. In a meeting with other elders, 
who had received a similar call, in- 
rtructions were given by the presid- 



ing authorities of the Church, as is 
the custom prior to missionaries go- 
ing out to various fields of labor. I 
do not think I can forget the stress 
that was laid upon one feature of 
the work, by those brethren, in giv- 
ing the instructions to the mission- 
aries who were at that time going 
abroad in the world, and that was 
in relation to their deportment with 
the opposite sex, and also in rela- 
tion to respect for authority in 
the home, more especially for the 
authority of the head of the home. 
We were instructed that we were 
not, under any circumstances, to 
baptize any woman, who was a mar- 
ried woman, without having ob- 
tained the consent of her husband ; 
and we were also instructed that we 
were not to baptize children who 
were under age, unless we had ob- 
tained the consent of their parents 
or guardians. It was the instruction 
that we should teach women to hold 
sacred the obligations that they had 
taken upon themselves at the altar 
of marriage, that they were to have 
respect to the feelings and wishes 
of their husbands, and that we were 
not to be instrumental, in any way 
whatever, in breaking up homes. I 
have been abroad in the missionary 
field, since that period and have 
had the privilege of laboring as one 
of the presidency of one of the 
great missions of the Church ; and 
in that position have received many 
elders who arrived in the country 
where I was laboring. As one of 
the presidency I joined with my as- 
sociates in giving the elders instruc- 
tions along the lines I have named ; 
and I wish to bear witness that just 
such instructions have been impart- 
ed to the missionaries, according to 
my own knowledge, during the past 
thirty vears at least. The instruc- 
tions that I have received mvself, 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



123 



and the instructions that I have im- 
parted to other missionaries who 
have been going abroad or, who 
have been appointed to labor under 
my direction have always been in 
conformity with the words that I 
have spoken. Missionaries have al- 
ways been careful, in the world, not 
to induce either men or women to 
forsake their homes, but more es- 
pecially have they been particularly 
careful not to interfere with the 
gentler sex. No men in all the 
world are as free from improper 
conduct with women. I thought 
that I would like to bear this record 
and this testimony in the midst of 
this great congregation of peoople. 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
know whether we appreciate the 
blessings that have come to us as 
members of the Church of Christ, 
whether we have been able to rec- 
ognize the wonderful power that is 
in this work. I once heard a very 
noted infidel bear a remarkable testi- 
mony in regard to the strength of 
"Mormonism," Mr. Charles H. 
Bradlaugh, the great English apos- 
tle of infidelity. On one occasion, 
while laboring in the British mis- 
sion, I attended a lecture delivered 
by him. The subject was: "Is 
Christianity a persecuting relig- 
ion?" He told a very startling and 
remarkable story in relation to the 
evil that had been wrought among 
men in the name of religion. A 
young man who attended the lec- 
ture asked some questions of that 
noted infidel ; he wanted to know 
how it was that the early Christians 
had survived the persecutions of 
the mighty empire of Rome? and 
why it was that their determination 
to destroy the Christians and break 
them up had failed? — if that 
failure was not an evidence of the 
superior power of God, and that 



there was some supernatural influ- 
ence over those early Christians? 
otherwise, they would have been de- 
stroyed, as the weak power usually 
succumbs to the greater or stronger 
power. In answer to the questions 
that were propounded on that occa- 
sion, which I do not give in detail, 
the noted infidel said : "Young man, 
away off in the western part of 
America, there is a people who have 
had a like experience, who have 
been opposed by a mighty nation, 
and who have come in conflict with 
the religious prejudices of all the 
peoples of the earth, and in spite of 
that opposition, and that religious 
prejudice, and the bitter persecu- 
tions that have followed them they 
still survive ; and their survival, and 
the success to which they have at- 
tained is more remarkable than the 
history of the early Christian 
church. Are you prepared to say 
that because of their remarkable 
story they have had the special fa- 
vor of God resting upon them ?" 
My brethren and sisters, I felt to 
thank God for that testimony. When 
one of the great intellectual men of 
the age sought for a parallel for the 
community that was established by 
the Lord Jesus Christ in the meridi- 
an of time, afar off in this western 
land, in these mountains that we in- 
habit, he found that people. I could 
not help but feel that like causes 
produce like effects ; and because of 
the call of God and the authority 
that has been bestowed upon men 
in this dispensation, like unto the 
former dispensation, we have met 
with this opposition. 

Thank God for the truth, and 
power, and strength of "Mormon- 
ism." I bear my testimony that it 
is the religion of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, that it is the power of God 
unto salvation, and that it will re 



124

main and accomplish that which has 
been spoken concerning it by the 
mouths of inspired men. God help 
us to remain with it, and be true to 
it forever, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

The greatest event in the modem 
world. — The gathering a fulfillment 
of predictions of ancient prophets. — 
Rejection of the Gospel of Peace 
will bring God's displeasure. 

"And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that the Lord shall set his hand 
again the second time to recover the 
remnant of his people, which shall be 
left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, 
and from Pathros, and from Cush, and 
from Elam, and from Shinar, and 
from Hammath, and from the islands 
of the sea. 

"And he shall set up an ensign for 
the nations, and shall assemble the 
outcasts of Israel, and gather together 
the dispersed of Judah from the four 
corners of the earth." 

Eighty-one years ago, in the lit- 
tle town of Fayette, Seneca county, 
New York, the Lord set up an en- 
sign to the nations. It was in ful- 
fillment of the prediction made by 
the prophet Isaiah, which I have 
read. That ensign was the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which was established for the last 
time, never again to be destroyed 
or given to other people. It was 
the greatest event the world has 
seen since the day that the Redeem- 
er of the world was lifted upon the 
cross, and meant more to mankind 
than anything else that has occurred 
since that day. No event should 
have been heralded among the peo- 
ple with greater effectiveness, and 
received with greater evidences of 
joy and satisfaction. The nations 
should have rejoiced and welcomed 



it with gladness of heart, for with 
it came the establishment of divine 
truth in the earth, — the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which is the power of 
God unto salvation unto all who be- 
lieve. The world had been with- 
out this gospel for many hundreds 
of years ; ever since the great apos- 
tasy and turning away from the 
truth which had been established by 
the primitive Church. 

Following the raising of this en- 
sign, the Lord sent forth His elders 
clothed with the priesthood and with 
power and authority, among the na- 
tions of the earth, bearing witness 
unto all peoples of the restoration 
of His Church, and calling upon the 
children of men to repent and re- 
ceive the gospel ; for now it was be- 
ing preached in all the world as a 
witness before the end should 
come, — that is, the end of the reign 
of wickedness and the establish- 
ment of the millennial reign of 
peace. The elders went forth as 
they were commanded, and are still 
preaching the gospel and gathering 
out from the nations the seed of 
Israel unto whom the promise was 
made. Thus our fathers were gath- 
ered and brought into the true fold 
in fulfillment of the prophecies made 
in ancient times by men inspired of 
the Lord, that He would recover a 
remnant of His people from the 
four corners of the earth. Scat- 
tered Israel is being gathered into 
the fold. Some have rejected the 
testimony of the elders through ig- 
norance and prejudice, not under- 
standing the significance of the 
message delivered unto them. Oth- 
ers have rejected the truth wilful- 
ly because of the evil in their hearts 
and their subjection to unrighteous- 
ness. 

From time to time, some one, 
filled with hatred of the truth, in 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



125 



the blind desire to destroy the work 
of the Lord, appeals to the nations 
to cast out the elders of Israel who 
are carrying this message of salva- 
tion unto all who will believe, and 
warning others that they may be 
left without excuse. It would be a 
sorry clay for any nation, where the 
gospel is being preached, should it 
conclude to drive the elders of the 
Church from its borders and deny 
them the right to preach the gospel 
among the people. The elders in- 
sure peace unto the nations, so long 
as they will hear the message of sal- 
vation and will protect and defend 
the truth. When the time comes 
that the nations will cast the elders 
out, and no longer receive their tes- 
timony, but "bow to Satan's thrall," 
as we heard in the anthem this af- 
ternoon, woe be unto them. We 
read in the word of the Lord that 
after the testimony of the elders 
will come wrath and indignation up- 
on the people. For after their testi- 
mony will come the testimony of 
earthquakes, that shall cause suffer- 
ing and sorrow and men shall fall 
upon the ground for fear. There 
shall come also the testimony of 
thunderings, and the voice of light- 
nings, and the voice of tempests, 
and the voice of the waves of the 
sea heaving themselves beyond their 
bounds. All things shall be in com- 
motion and men's hearts shall fail 
them because of fear that shall come 
upon the people. These things shall 
follow the testimony of the elders 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, when the people 
of the world reject them and drive 
them from their borders. We go 
unto them with a message of peace, 
of truth, of eternal salvation, call- 
ing upon them to repent of their 
sins and enter into the true fold, 
where they may receive rest. When 



they will not do this, but to the con- 
trary, will listen to the unrighteous 
and condemn the truth, then God 
will withdraw the Gospel from 
among them. In that day the time 
of the Gentiles will be fulfilled, and 
the gospel will be carried to the 
Jews. For this gospel must be 
preached to them as well as to the 
Gentile nations, and a remnant of 
the Jews will gather — as they are 
gathering since the dedication of 
their land for their return — in Pal- 
estine, and as a remnant of Ephraim 
and his fellows are now gathering 
to the land of Zion. The Jews, in 
due time will be established in their 
own land, and the Lord will come, 
according to His promise, unto His 
people in the hour of their distress, 
and will deliver them from their 
enemies. Then will they look upon 
Him and discover His wounds and 
shall say : "What at e these wounds 
in Thine hands." And He- shall an- 
swer them : "Those with which I 
was wounded in the house of my 
friends." Then will they fall down 
and worship Him as their Redeemer 
— the Son of God. After that they 
will be cleansed of their sins and 
shall receive the gospel. And the 
nations that seek to destroy Jeru- 
salem in that day will the Lord de- 
stroy, for he shall be King over all 
the earth and righteousness shall 
prevail among the people. Zion 
shall be established on this conti- 
nent; Jerusalem will be re-estab- 
lished on the old continent, and 
wickedness Will depart from the 
earth; for when Christ comes and 
the righteous with Him, the wicked 
will be as stubble and will be con- 
sumed. 

Therefore, I desire to bear my 
testimony unto all people and say 
unto those who raise their hands 
against this work, see that you do it 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not, for this is the work of God. 
He has established it, and when you 
reject it, you reject Him, and after 
the testimony of the elders will 
come the testimony of trouble and 
distress as the prophets have pre- 
dicted. 

May the Lord bless all the Latter- 
day Saints and all the honest and 
upright everywhere, and help us to 
be faithful and true, that we may 
keep His commandments and es- 
cape from the destruction that in 
due time will come upon the wicked, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

AUDITORS' REPORT. 

Elder Heber J. Grant read the re- 
port of the auditing committee of 
the Church, which was as follows : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 5, 
1911. President Joseph F. Smith 
and Counselors : 

Dear Brethren — The undersigned 
committee appointed to audit the 
books and accounts of the Church, 
have completed their labors, and 
have to report that they have exam- 
ined and audited the books of the 
various departments and offices to 
whom are entrusted the collection, 
care and distribution of the income 
of the Church, and, commencing 
with the accounts of the Trustee-in- 
Trust, which as you are aware, cov- 
er the bulk of the concentrated in- 
come and disbursement of the in- 
come of the Church, we are pleased 
to report were found in excellent 
shape from an accounting stand- 
point, and that all receipts and dis- 
bursements appear accurately en- 
tered on the books. We also found 
the books and accounts of the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office as heretofore, 
in an excellent and accurate condi- 
tion. When you bear in mind that 
this office has to deal with some 62 



stakes, 700 wards, and 21 missions, 
not to mention the great number of 
accounts of the various auxiliary 
organizations of the Church, you 
can well understand the great vol- 
ume of business transacted in the 
Presiding Bishop's department ; and 
it is a pleasure to say that this great 
complex and voluminous amount of 
business is economically, carefully 
and correctly entered in the books 
of this office, and that we found 
everything in a satisfactory condi- 
tion. This office also collects and 
enters on proper books and records 
a large amount of statistical matter, 
not having to do with financial mat- 
ters, but pertaining to Church ac- 
tivities, which we found very valu- 
able and interesting, and we com- 
mend these to your consideration. 

Very respectfully, submitted, 
your brethren, 

W. W. Riter, 
August W. Carlson, 
John C. Cutler, 
Heber Scowcroft. 
General Auditing Committee 

of the Church. 
On motion, the report of the Au- 
diting Committee was accepted, and 
approved, by unanimous vote of the 
congregation. 

STATEMENT BY THE FIRST 
PRESIDENCY. 

Elder Grant also read the fol- 
lowing, self-explanatory statement 
by the First Presidency of the 
Church : 

To the officers and members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in general confer- 
ence assembled :

of Latter-day Saints has been bit- 
terly assailed, the chief darts of 
slander being aimed at its leaders. 
Its first president, Joseph Smith, 
was the target for the shafts of 
abuse even before that date, as he 
was attacked by professing" Chris- 
tian ministers when he first an- 
nounced, in 1820, that he had re- 
ceived a heavenly manifestation of 
vital importance. Misrepresenta- 
tions followed him until the day of 
his martyrdom, in 1844, when he 
was cruelly and lawlessly slain at 
Carthage, Illinois. His successor, the 
great pioneer and colonizer and pa- 
triot, Brigham Young, came in for 
his full share of calumny and abuse, 
during all the years of his success- 
ful career as the founder of a splen- 
did commonwealth in the midst of 
the Rocky Mountains. Each head 
of the Church, in his turn, has been 
libelled, lampooned, caricatured and 
vilified, and, until they closed their 
eyes in death, their names were 
associated with everything that is 
evil, although they were men of the 
highest type of honor, integrity and 
sincerity. 

It is not strange, therefore, that 
the present incumbent of the office 
they held so worthily, should be sub- 
ject to similar treatment. And vet, 
in view of the fact that the various 
falsehoods uttered against the 
Church and its presiding officers 
have been repeatedly refuted and 
exploded, it is somewhat surprising 
that the old, stale and shattered fab- 
rications are raked up and used 
anew in the opening years of the 
enlightened twentieth century. But 
they have been for some time newly 
exploited through respectable mag- 
azines (mostly from pens that can- 
not be regarded as worthy of such 
recognition), with the same purpose 
as that which animated anti-"Mor- 



mon" writers and speakers from 
the beginning. 

It is a question whether silence 
should be maintained, as a sign of 
that contempt that is felt for those 
attacks and their authors by the ob- 
jects of their spleen, but there are so 
many requests for replies, or at least 
explanations, for the benefit of in- 
quiring minds, that perhaps it is 
proper that something should be 
officially stated for the good of the 
reading public. 

The investigation by the commit- 
tee on privileges and elections of the 
United States senate on the right of 
the senator from Utah, Reed Smoot, 
to the seat to which he was duly 
elected, that was prolonged for 
nearly four years, disposed of most 
of the old stories now revamped and 
patched up for current use. But 
several large volumes have to be 
waded through to obtain that defi- 
nite information, while the mingled 
nonsense and venom poured forth 
from month to month is in present 
view and in popular form. Yet, 
after all, there is so much of frothy 
verbiage and proofless assertion 
that it' is difficult to grasp anything 
definite enough, in the adroitly 
framed sentences, to hold up to 
view and expose its fallacy. How- 
ever, there are some charges that 
are more or less direct, which it may 
be well enough to briefly answer. 

The Church is accused of violat- 
ing certain pledges to the national 
government. It is also asserted that 
the president of the Church receives 
several millions of dollars annually 
by enforced levies upon the mem- 
bers, this revenue being in his ab- 
solute control, unaccounted for and 
nt his personal service. It is fur- 
ther alleged that he, with a few 
other ecclesiasts, dictates the polit- 
ical affairs of the state, sending sen-

ators and representatives to Con- 
gress, and ruling the community 
with an iron hand, to the subversion 
of individual liberty and the de- 
struction of American citizenship. 
In support of these charges there is 
nothing presented except vitupera- 
tion and the repetition of fictitious 
narratives, really grotesque in their 
palpable absurdity. We hereby de- 
nounce them as utterly false and 
without foundation. 

First, as to pledges or compacts 
by the Church to the United States 
government : This charge, on its 
face, is ridiculous no matter how 
often or forcibly it is repeated. The 
compacts or agreements between 
Utah and the government on which 
statehood was achieved, were not 
made, and indeed could not be 
made, by the Church or its author- 
ities. They were required by the 
enabling act framed by Congress 
and were fully compiled with by 
the state in its constitution, and this 
was officially announced in the pres- 
ident's proclamation. The only 
pledge made by the authorities of 
the Church that could be construed 
as a compact, was that contained in 
a petition for amnesty for certain 
persons who were in legal jeopardy, 
or imprisonment, upon charges 
growing out of the anti-polygamy 
laws of Congress. This was framed 
in December, 1891, and signed by 
the then presidency and apostles of 
the Church, and the promise made 
was in these words : 

"As shepherds of a patient and 
suffering people we ask amnesty for 
them, and pledge our faith and hon- 
or for their future." 

This may be coupled with the so- 
called manifesto of President Wil- 
ford Woodruff, adopted by the 
Church in conference assembled, 
Oct. 6, 1890, in which he announced 



his intention to live according to the 
laws of the United States, and de- 
clared : "My advice to the Latter- 
day Saints is that they contract no 
marriage contrary to the laws of the 
land." Since that time the Church 
has not performed any plural mar- 
riages or authorized any violation of 
the law thus forbidden. But there 
were some persons who construed 
the language of that manifesto to sig- 
nify plural marriages within the 
boundaries of the United States, that 
being "the land" wherein the laws 
spoken of extended. They therefore 
went or removed to Mexico and 
thus acted on that which they be- 
lieved to be right without violating 
the manifesto. They looked on 
plural marriage within the United 
States as malum prohibitum and not 
malum in se. 

When this condition was discov- 
ered a further declaration was made 
by President Lorenzo Snow, who 
succeeded President Woodruff, in 
which he announced that the mani- 
festo extended to every place, and 
that "the Church has positively 
abandoned the practice of polygamy 
or the solemnization of plural mar- 
riages in this and every other state, 
and that no member or officer there- 
of has any authority whatever to 
perform a plural marriage or enter 
into such a relation." This was pub- 
lished in the Deseret News at Salt 
Lake City, Jan. 8, 1900. 

Rumors of surreptitious unions 
contrary to these official announce- 
ments being circulated, the present 
president of the Church, on April 6, 
1904, reiterated the universality of 
the inhibition, and proclaimed that 
any person entering into or per- 
forming a plural marriage would be 
liable to be dealt with according to 
the rules of the Church and excom- 
municated therefrom. 



STATEMENT BY PRESIDENCY. 



129 



Such violation of these positive 
declarations as have been reported, 
wherever proven by sufficient evi- 
dence, have been dealt with by 
Church tribunals, and the offenders 
have been disciplined or excommu- 
nicated. This course will be main- 
tained, with due regard to the rights 
of individuals and the laws of 
the Church, common rumor or gos- 
sip without evidence being insuffi- 
cient in a trial either civil or eccle- 
siastical. We protest against the 
charge that the Churcn or its lead- 
ing officers encourage the resump- 
tion of plural marriages, and here- 
by declare the same to be absolutely 
false. 

As to the insinuation that the 
Church has broken a compact not to 
dominate again in political matters, 
we challenge the production of any 
such pledge. There is no such 
agreement to be found. The au- 
thorities of the Church never as- 
sumed to dictate to members polit- 
ically. The Church never attempt- 
ed to dominate the State, and has 
not done so since the Constitution 
was framed. There are political 
aspirants who have attempted to 
dominate the Church, and who, fail- 
ing in their endeavors, have be- 
come so rancorous in their disap- 
pointment that they waste time, 
money and reputation in fighting the 
Church and those officers thereof 
who have refused to employ the in- 
fluence thus desired. In Utah every 
citizen is perfectly free to vote as 
he or she elects by an absolutely 
secret ballot. Primaries, conven- 
tions and the political machinery 
used by the several political 
parties are in vogue, and senators 
are chosen by the legislature, and 
representatives by popular vote as 
elsewhere. One striking fact for 
the consideration of fair minds is, 



that with all the stories of Church 
dictation not a solitary instance can 
be cited in which any Church mem- 
ber has been disciplined for voting 
for or against any candidate or 
proposition. Advocates of each 
party take the platform and freely 
ventilate their views and feelings as 
to their opponents, and if there is 
anything really objectionable, it is 
the excess of that liberty in the in- 
dulging in personalities and other 
extremes of partisanship which are 
greatly to be regretted and ought to 
be condemned. But the Church does 
not interfere with or attempt to cur- 
tail the freedom of its members. The 
principal accusers of the Church as 
dominating in politics are persons 
who have sought for that influence 
in their own behalf and are en- 
raged because they could not obtain 
it. There are politicians who exer- 
cise their personal influence to ef- 
fect their own ends, and yet deny 
to a Church-man the right to ex- 
press an opinion even when asked 
for it. We claim for Church officers 
as well as Church members all the 
rights and privileges of American 
citizens, no less and no more ; and 
do not claim, or exercise, power to 
compel, or coerce, or infringe upon 
the liberties of any person, and all 
assertions to the contrary are in- 
famously untrue. 

Charges of disloyalty, treason, 
and kindred absurdities that appear 
from time to time, to disturb the 
public mind, are sufficiently an- 
swered by the responses which have 
been made invariably when our 
country has called for aid in times 
of war or seasons of peace. There 
is no instance referred to by our 
detractors of anything we have done 
or attempted, to give color to their 
monstrous untruths. But history 
affords striking incidents of the fur- 



130

nishing of men on the plains to pro- 
tect the mails from Indian depreda- 
tions, of service during the Civil 
War, and of devoted warriors in 
the Spanish war, and in the Philip- 
pines, who were scions of leading 
"Mormon" families. 

The subject of Church revenues 
may be touched upon perhaps with 
profit. The Latter-day Saints be- 
lieve in tithing. It is a principle of 
their faith. It is an ancient observ- 
ance reaching back to patriarchal 
times, as related in the Bible. It 
was established in the Church in the 
year 1838. The manner of its pay- 
ment and disbursement is revealed 
by Divine authority and has ap- 
peared .in the Church books ever 
since that date. It is complied with 
religiously by the Church author- 
ities themsleves. It is not the prop- 
erty of the president. He does not 
claim it or collect it. Tithing is re- 
ceived and receipted for by the local 
bishops in the respective wards, who 
are under the supervision of the 
local presidents of stakes. The whole 
income is accounted for to the pre- 
siding bishopric of the Church and 
is under their direction. Their of- 
fice contains complete records of all 
the tithings paid during each year. 
Each tithepayer will firid in that of- 
fice his record. The entire receipts 
and disbursements are there ac- 
counted for in the most complete de- 
tail. An auditing committee com- 
posed of men well known in the 
community for their independence 
of character and business integrity, 
not of the leading authorities of the 
Church, chosen by the general con- 
ference, thoroughly inspect and re- 
port annually upon them. The 
funds thus received are not the 
property of the president of the 
Church or his associates, nor of 
the Presiding Bishopric, nor of the 



local bishops. They belong to the 
Church and are used for Church 
purposes, including the building and 
maintenance of temples, meeting- 
houses, schools, colleges, universi- 
ties and other structures, the aid of 
the poor and afflicted, the extension 
of missions abroad and the help of 
new colonies at home, and sundry 
other objects, and but a small 
amount is used for the support of 
persons devoting their whole time 
to the service of the Church, and 
that not out of the tithing, but from 
the proceeds of investments made 
with profit. This includes the pres- 
idency and other Church leaders. 
All the monstrous tales told of the 
wealth at the command of the heads 
of the Church are distorted emana- 
tions from disordered brains, or wil- 
ful untruths manufactured in order 
to deceive the public. 

It is impossible to take up all the 
misrepresentations given to the 
world by anti-"Mormon" preachers 
and writers. They have one merit. 
They stir up interest in what is 
called the "Mormon" question. Peo- 
ple are led thus to investigate and 
many of them find out the truth, and 
unite with the people who are so 
greatly maligned. Our doctrines are 
open to the world. They are not 
secret or clothed in mystery. We 
proclaim the pure gospel of Christ 
as revealed from heaven in these 
last days through the great proph- 
et of the nineteenth century, Joseph 
Smith. We invite all mankind to 
look into our teachings and prom- 
ise all who obey them a witness of 
their truth by the power of the Holy 
Ghost which makes men free in- 
deed. 

We love our country, and pray 
for the perpetuity of its government, 
we support its institutions, we ven- 
erate the Constitution. We are

proud of our state, and no one on 
the face of God's footstool need 
fear the growth and spread of 
"Mormonism," for it is the truth 
revealed anew from heaven, and it 
promotes freedom, peace, industry, 
temperance, faith, hope and charity, 
and stands for human rights, the 
salvation of mankind, and the glory 
of the most high God.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

I regret that we haven't a little 
more time, but we will try to make 
the best we can of the little remain- 
ing. 

I have a resolution, forwarded to 
me by the Ogden tabernacle choir, 
which I desire to read, because I 
think it shows a very excellent 
spirit : 



"At the regular rehearsal of the 
Ogden tabernacle choir, Thursday 
evening, last, the following motion 
was made and carried unanimous- 
ly : 'That we extend to the director 
and members of the Salt Lake tab- 
ernacle choir the sincere hope that 
they may be truly successful in 
holding up high ideals while on 
their trip to New York. They will 
represent the entire state of Utah, 
and as such representatives we de- 
sire to uphold and sustain them in 
every way possible. Bon voyage to 
the Salt Lake tabernacle choir.' " 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"There's a sound from the vale." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 



Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof. 
John J. McClellan played the ac- 
companiments, interludes, etc., on 
the great organ, assisted by Ed- 
ward P. Kimball and Tracy Y. Can- 
non. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker. 

Duncan M. McAllister, 
Clerk of Conference.

by the congregation singing the 
hymn : 

Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way: 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
'Tis better far for us to strive. 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this and joy your hearts will swell — 
All is well ! all is well ! 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Edward J. Wood. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight. 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 
PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Tt is with a degree of weakness, 
of timidity and a sense of depen- 
dence upon the Lord that I stand 
before you this morning at the open- 
ing of the Eighty-third anniversary 
of the April Conference of the 
Church. I feel entirely dependent, 
and without forethought, upon the 
pn miptings of the Spirit of the Lord 
for what I may be led to say to 
you. T cannot pass without ex- 
pressing my gratitude to the Lord 
for the preservation of our lives and 
for the many temporal as well as 
spiritual blessings that we all enjoy 
this morning on assembling here, 
in this tabernacle, on this very in- 
t cresting and important occasion. I 
feel very grateful, myself, for the 
blessings that T enjoy personally, 
for the measure of health and 
strength I possess, and for the spirit- 
ual life that T feel in the work in 
which we are engaged. I feel grate- 
ful, too. that our beloved brother 
Anthon H. Lund, who has been un- 
well for a season, is so far recovered 
as to be able to attend with us here 
this morning enjoving an increased 
measure of health. Tt is also a 
source of great pleasure and grati- 
tude to me that we have with us. in 
the vigor of youth, our beloved 
bm«-i->.- Charles W. Penrose, now 
past his eighty-first year, and yet 
looking very much younger tjjan 
manv of us youneer men, that is, 
younger in vears. not vounger ment- 
allv nor phvsicallv. but merely in 
years. Tt is also a source of con- 
gratulation and of thankfulness that 
we have with us the brethren of the 
twelve, with the exception of Elder 
Smoot. ( who i<? engaged in a good 
c utse and i^ doing much in the way 



of the moral uplift of mankind as 
well as in the service of the people 
of his state, for his influence, his 
personal habits, his manner of life, 
his spirit are sermons for good 
among all his associates, and his ex- 
ample is always praiseworthy ; and 
Rudger Clawson, who is presiding 
over the European Mission, and is 
in the discharge of his duty as 
faithfully as it is possible for any 
man to be, and is doing a good work 
in his mission field. The brethren 
of tb<= Seventies are with us, all of 
them I believe, in possession of vig- 
or and health and the spirit of their 
calling, and mission ; and we have 
also with us the Presiding Bishop- 
ric, enjoying the same blessings, to- 
gether with the Presiding Patriarch 
a youth who is developing commen- 
dablv in the performance of his 
duties, and bids fair of being a light 
that shall shine in his pathway, to 
rboc-^ --b are seeking after the 
truth. Then it is a source of grati- 
tude to me that I can look upon so 
many of the presidents of the stakes 
of Zion as are assembled here this 
morning at this opening session of 
our Conference. We have now, 
organized, sixty-four stakes of Zion, 
and a very large proportion of the 
nresidencies of those stakes are 
present with us this morning, many 
of whom are becoming, like some 
of the rest of us. aged in the service 
in which they have been engaged 
for many years, and it is gratifying 
to have the nrivilege of meet- 
ing with them and of offering a 
greeting of welcome into this house 
of the Lord this morning ; and I 
sincerely invoke the blessings of our 
heavenly Father upon these men, 
upon whom rests so «reat respon- 
sibilitv in exercising the rights of 
presidency over the stakes over 
which they preside. Then I look

out over this great congregation and 
see a large number of the bishops 
of the Church, assembled here to 
represent the people of their wards, 
many of whom, of course, have not 
the privilege of attending this con- 
ference on account of the distance 
from their homes. I congratulate 
you presidents of stakes and your 
counselors, members of the high 
councils of the various stakes of 
Zion, on your presence here, and I 
trust that in your participations in 
the conference you may be filled 
with joy and satisfaction, and that 
it may be a time of refreshing to 
you as well as to all the saints. In 
connection with these also we have 
with us the various organizations 
in the priesthood from the high 
priests down to the elders in the 
Church representing the high priests 
and the seventies and the elders and 
the patriarchs, many of whom I sup- 
pose are here today to add to the 
number of those who have come to 
attend the conference and to take 
part in the duties thereof, together 
with the bishoprics and the lesser 
priesthood, many of whom are here. 
The strength of Israel I apprehend 
is here today, representing the 
whole Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-dav Saints, not only in the 
organized stakes of Zion, but in 
manv of the missions in the world. 

I need not say to my brethren 
engaged in the ministry that it is ex- 
pected of them that one and all will 
attend to the labors and be true to 
the responsibilities that rest upon 
them in the discharge of their duties 
as officers in the Church. We ex- 
pect that the presidencies of the 
stakes of Zion will be exemplars 
to the people. We expect them 
of a truth to be fathers unto those 
over whom they preside, men of 
wisdom, of sound judgment, impar- 



tial and just, men who will indeed 
qualify themselves, or who are in- 
deed qualified by their natural en- 
dowments and by the inspiration 
from God which it is their privilege 
to enjoy, to preside in righteousness 
and to sit in righteous judgment 
over all matters brought to their 
attention or that may legitmately 
belong to their office and calling. 
We anticipate the same fidelity, the 
same faithfulness, the same intel- 
ligent administration of their duties 
from the bishops and their counsel- 
ors, and indeed upon these rests 
perhaps the greatest possible re- 
sponsibility, for the reason that they 
are expected by their presidencies 
to attend to the various interests 
and needs of their people. It is ex- 
pected of a bishop to know all the 
people that reside in his ward, not 
only those that are faithful members 
of the Church, diligent in the per- 
formance of their duties and promi- 
nent by their good acts, but to know 
those who are cold and indifferent, 
those who are lukewarm, those 
who are inclined to err and to make 
mistakes, and not only these, but it 
is expected that the bishops through 
their aides in their wards, will be- 
come acquainted, not only with their 
members, male and female, but that 
they will know also the stranger 
that is within their gates and be pre- 
pared to minister solace, comfort, 
good counsel, wisdom and every 
other aid possible to be rendered to 
those that are in need, whether they 
are of the household of faith or are 
strangers to the truth. So that 
there is a great deal expected of 
the bishops and their counselors 
and the elders and lesser priesthood 
in their wards whom they call to 
their aid in administering to the 
people both spiritually and tempor- 
ally, and I want to remark in this 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



connection that it is the duty of 
these bishops and of the presidencies 
of the stakes of Zion, together with 
their high councils, to administer 
justice and right judgment to every 
member of their wards and of their 
stakes. Included in this are the 
high priests and the seventies and 
the elders and the apostles and the 
patriarchs and the presidency of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. No man who is a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints or who has 
a standing in the Church' as a mem- 
ber, is exempt from his responsibil- 
ities as a member and his allegiance 
to the bishop of the ward in which 
he dwells. I am as much bound 
to acknowledge my bishop as a 
member of the ward in which I 
dwell, as the humblest and latest 
member of the Church. No man 
who claims to be a member of the 
Church in good standing, can ride 
above or become independent of the 
authority that the Lord Almighty 
has established in His Church. 
This watch-care of the people, of 
their right living, of their fidelity to 
their covenants and to the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, belongs to the presi- 
dents of stakes and their counselors 
and the high councils, or members 
of the high council, to the bishop 
and his counselors and the teachers 
of his ward. Then we have the 
organizations of the holy priesthood. 
We have the council of the first 
presidency consisting of three pre- 
siding high priests who are called of 
God and appointed to preside over 
the Church and over the priesthood 
of God, and I want to say here that 
it does not follow and never has fol- 
lowed that the members of the first 
presidency of the Church are nec- 
essarily to be ordained apostles. 
They hold by virtue of their rights 



as presidents of the Church all the 
keys and all the authority that per- 
tains to the Melchisedek priesthood, 
which comprehends and comprises 
all of the appendages to that priest- 
hood, the lesser priesthood and all 
the offices in the priesthood from 
first to last and from least to great- 
est ; and I would to the Lord that 
some of our would-be wise men 
would learn this truth and establish 
the same in their minds that they 
might not everlastingly be at sea in 
regard to it and always asking ques- 
tions of the most nonsensical kind 
with reference to the rights of the 
priesthood. All you have to do is 
to read the revelations through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, giving to the 
Church the authorities of the priest- 
hood that God has restored in the 
latter dav. It is as perfect, as plain 
as the A. B. C's of our language 
and only needs to be read with the 
spirit of understanding to be per- 
fectly comprehended. 

The duty of the twelve apostles 
of the Church is to preach the gos- 
pel to the world, to send it to the 
inhabitants of the earth and to bear 
testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of God, as living witnesses of His 
divine mission. That is their spe- 
cial calling and they are always un- 
der the direction of the presidencv 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-dav Saints when that presi- 
dency is intact, and there is never 
at the same time two equal heads 
in the Church — never. The Lord 
never ordained any such thing, nor 
designed it. There is always a head 
in the Church, and if the presidency 
of the Church are removed by death 
or other cause, then the next head 
of Church is the twelve apostles 
until a presidencv is again organ- 
ized of three presiding high priests 
who have the right to hold the office

of first presidency over the Church ; 
and, according" to the doctrine laid 
down by President Wilford Wood- 
ruff, who saw the necessity for it, 
and that of President Lorenzo 
Snow, if the president should die, 
his counselors are then released 
from that presidency, and it is the 
duty of the twelve apostles to pro- 
ceed at once, in the manner that has 
been pointed out, to see that the 
First presidency is reorganized, so 
that there may be no deficiency in 
the working and order of the priest- 
hood in the Church. Now again, 
the bishoprics, and the presidents of 
stakes, have exclusive jurisdiction 
over the membership or the standing 
of men and women in their wards 
and in their stakes. I want to 
state that pretty plain — that is to 
say, it is not my duty, it is not the 
duty of the seven presidents of sev- 
enties, nor of the council of the 
twelve apostles, to go into a stake 
of Zion and try for membership or 
for standing in the Church, any 
member of a stake or ward. We 
have no business to do it ; it belongs 
to the local authorities and they 
have ample authority to deal with 
the membership in their wards and 
in their stakes. The bishops may try 
an elder for misconduct, for un- 
Christianlike conduct, for apostasy, 
or for wickedness of any kind that 
would disqualify him for member- 
ship in the Church, and they may 
pass upon him their judgment that 
he is unworthy of fellowship in the 
Church, and they may withdraw 
from him their fellowship. Then 
they may refer his case to the Presi- 
dency and High Council, and it will 
be the duty of the Presidency and 
High Council of the stake to deal 
with him, even to the extent of ex- 
communication from the Church; 
and there is no remedy for this, 



only the right of appeal to the 
Presidency of the Church. If there 
may be perchance any injustice, 
and partiality, lack of information 
or understanding on the part of the 
bishopric, which may not be cor- 
rected and therefore might be per- 
petuated by the decision of the High 
Council, and the party aggrieved 
does not feel that he has had justice 
dealt out to him, he then has a right, 
under the laws of the Church, to 
appeal to the Presidency of the 
Church, but not otherwise. We 
want it distinctly understood that 
we cannot hear the complaints of 
members of the Church against 
their bishops, nor against their 
presidents, nor against their fellow 
members in the Church. If we were 
to yield to a thing of this kind we 
would usurp and do away with the 
authority of the Bishops and with 
the Presidencies of the stakes, and 
we would have the responsibility of 
trying any or all the members of 
the Church, who might have 
troubles to adjust, and that would 
be a practical impossibility; we 
could not do it ; and then, it would 
not be right tb do it, because God 
has designed it the other way. The 
Lord has given us a more perfect 
organization than that. Therefore, 
we want the cranks and the crazy 
folks, the insane, if there are any, 
who wish to step over their Bishops 
and their Presidents to the Presi- 
dency of the Church, or to the 
Twelve, to distinctly understand 
that if they do so, we will refer 
their case to their local authorities 
to be dealt with on the ground, 
where the evidence can be had pro 
and con and where justice can be 
meted out to them. We have enough 
to do, goodness knows, without lis- 
tening to the complaints and cries, 
mournings and bickerings of indi-

viduals everywhere, however few, 
comparatively. The limits of the 
Church are now spread out and ex- 
tended to the islands of the sea and 
to distant continents and countries, 
for the gospel is being preached to 
the nations of the world, and we 
cannot hear all the complaints of 
individuals. The Lord has organ- 
ized these councils in the Church, 
such as the bishops' councils and the 
high councils, with the presidencies 
in the Church, to take care of the 
people to see that no injustice is 
done by one to another in the 
Church, to see that no unrighteous- 
ness exists that can be averted or 
that can be corrected and to see that 
justice and judgment and righteous- 
ness shall reign in the organizations 
of the Church and no wickedness 
or vileness be permitted to linger 
and corrode the body of the Church 
by neglect of being dealt with in 
the proper way. Not that we should 
injure, or hurt, or oppress — the 
furtherest thought in the world 
from my heart is oppression. No 
man should be oppressed. No au- 
thority of the Priesthood can be ad- 
ministered or exerted in any degree 
of unrighteousness, without offend- 
ing God. Therefore, when we deal 
with men we should not deal with 
them in anger. We should not deal 
with them with prejudice in our 
minds against them. We should 
dismiss prejudice, dispel anger from 
our hearts, and when we try our 
brethren for membership or fellow- 
ship in the Church we should do it 
dispassionately, charitably, lovingly, 
kindly, with a view to save and not 
to destroy. That is our business ; 
our business is to save the world, to 
save mankind, to bring them into 
harmony with the laws of God and 
with principles of righteousness and 
of justice and truth, that they may 



be saved in the kingdom of our God 
and become, eventually, through 
obedience to the ordinances of the 
gospel, heirs of God and joint heirs 
with Jesus Christ. That is our mis- 
sion. Now then we have our high- 
priests' quorums or councils, and we 
have our Seventies' Councils and 
our elders, and then we have the 
councils of the priests, teachers and 
deacons in the Lesser Priesthood. 
These councils each and all in their 
organized capacity have jurisdiction 
over the fellowship of the members 
of these councils — if the member 
is an elder, or if a man has a stand- 
ing in the Seventies' quroum, or is 
a member of the High Council, or 
the High Priests' quorum, and he 
is misbehaving himself, shows a 
lack of faith, a lack of reverence for 
the position he holds in his Council, 
or quorum, his fellowship in that 
quorum to which he belongs, or his 
standing should be looked after or 
enquired into, for he is amenable to 
his quorum for his good standing 
and fellowship in it. So that we 
have the check that the Lord has 
placed upon members of the Church, 
and when I say members of the 
Church I mean me, I mean the 
apostles, I mean the high priests, 
and the seventies, and elders. I 
mean everybody that is a member 
of the Church; and I say that when 
these members of the Church are 
in error or doing wrong we have 
the check on them in the first place 
in the wards, bishops look after 
them, then their quorums to which 
they belong have jurisdiction and 
they are required to look after them 
too, and then after the quorums look 
after them the Presidencies of the 
stakes look after .them and see that 
they are helped, that they are 
strengthened, that they are admon- 
ished, that they are warned and that

they are applauded when they do 
their duties and keep the command- 
ments of the Lord. So the Lord 
has placed a great many checks 
upon the members of the Church 
with a view to teaching them right 
principles, to help them to do right, 
to live right and to be pure, and 
clean from the sins of the world, 
that the body of the Church may be 
perfected, that it may be free from 
disease, from all contagious evils, 
just as the body of the man Christ 
Jesus is free from all taint, evil, and 
sin. So God has placed these safe- 
guards in the Church from the dea- 
cons to the apostles, and to the 
Presidency of the Church, with a 
view of persuading men and women 
to keep themselves pure and un- 
spotted from the world and to help 
them to be faithful to their cove- 
nants entered into with one another 
and with their God. 

What a wonderful organization it 
is ! Whoever has thought of it ex- 
cept he whom the Lord revealed 
it to ? When did it ever exist in its 
perfection before as it exists today? 
And to whom are we indebted for 
the intelligence, wisdom and knowl- 
edge that has perfected this organi- 
zation and established it for the 
government and the upbuilding of 
Zion and for purification of man- 
kind — to whom are we indebted? 
To the Lord, God Almighty, to the 
Son of God who spoke to Joseph, 
the prophet, by his own voice and 
by the voice of messengers sent to 
him, by whom Joseph was instruct- 
ed and enlightened and empowered 
to effect an organization such as 
the world never knew before, unless 
it was in the days of Enoch. Even 
the principles that were taught to 
Enoch have been revealed through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith ; but the 
people are not prepared for them 



and so they are postponed, delayed,, 
or shelved for the time being, and 
we are trying to work ourselves up 
to the standard before God. or to 
the point in which we will be worthy 
to engage in the order of Enoch, in 
which we may become more per- 
fect than we can possibly be under 
the present system that we are gov- 
erned by. 

Now, much more might be sai T . 
I have in mind our auxiliary or- 
ganizations, what are they? Helps 
to the standard organizations of the 
Church. They are not independent. 
I want to say to the Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, and to the 
Relief Society, and to the Primaries, 
and to the Sunday Schools, and Re- 
ligion Classes, and all the rest of the 
organizations in the Church, that 
not one of them is independent of 
the Priesthood of the Son of God, 
not one of them can exist a moment 
in the acceptance of the Lord when 
they withdraw from the voice and 
from the counsel of those who hold 
the Priesthood and preside over 
them. They are subject to the 
powers and authority of the Church, 
and they are not independent of 
them ; nor can they exercise any 
rights in their organization^ inde- 
pendently of the Priesthood and of' 
the Church ; and I want you to take 
it home to you now — every one of 
you. You may hear something 
stronger than that from me if yon 
don't. I have had a good deal of 
patience about some things, but 
there is a point at which patience 
ceases to be a virtue, and then it 
will become necessary to act, or 
advise at least. 

Now let every man do his duty ; 
let every president of a stake, and 
every counselor to him. and every 
bishop and his counselors and every

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



member of the high council; let 
every presidency of the high priests 
and seventies, and elders and all the 
general authorities of the Church 
do their duty, be faithful, humble 
and diligent in the performance of 
the labor that is required of them, 
be watchmen indeed upon the tow- 
ers of Zion, watching for virtues, 
v. atching for uprightness, watching 
fox justice, watching for truth. 
Change the focus of your view, and 
of your eyes, from watching for 
evU to watching for that which is 
good, that which is pure, and lead- 
ing and prompting those who err 
into that path which has no error 
in it, and that will not admit of mis- 
takes. Look for good in men, and 
where they fail to possess it try 
to build it up in them; try to in- 
crease the good in them; look for 
the good; build up the good; sus- 
tain the good : and speak as little 
about the evil as you possibly can. 
It does not do any good to magnify 
evil, to publish evil or to promul- 
gate it by tongue or pen. There is 
i L^ood to be obtained by it. It 
is better to bury the evil and mag- 
nify the good, and prompt all men 
t :• forsake evil and learn to do good ; 
and let our mission be to save man- 
kind and to teach in and guide to 
the paths of righteousness, and not 
to sit as judges and pass judgment 
upon evil doers, but rather be sav- 
i >rs of men. 

I did not expect to talk long to 
you this morning, when I got up. 
T only expected to say a few words 
and sit down : but I feel it in my 
heart ; my soul is in it, and I know 
the truth, and I want to live it. If 
there are any of my friends who 
can show me where I fail, oh come 
t me like a brother, not fault-find- 
ing;, but come to me as a savior upon 
Mount Zion and show me my error 



and give me a chance by the aid 
of your counsel and advice to me 
to overcome the evil you see in me, 
whether you see it literally or 
whether you simply imagine it. Let 
me learn to do right by your help. 
Don't crush me down. Don't dis- 
card me. Don't throw me over 
into -the scrap pile because you 
think I am not as perfect as I ought 
to be. Rather be patient with my 
imperfections, and try to help me 
to overcome them and to live nearer 
unto the Lord than ever before. 
That is the part of a savior upon 
Mount Zion. I am talking to the 
priesthood and to the Latter-day 
Saints, and to those that preside in 
the Church, and to those that exer- 
cise authority in the midst of the 
people. Go and do the will of the 
Father, that you may know the 
truth and that the truth may make 
you free, and also that you may 
walk in the light as Christ is in the 
light, that you may have fellowship 
with each other and that you may 
also have fellowship with God and 
Christ, and that the blood of the 
Son of God may cleanse you from 
all sin. This is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

"Consider, and hear me," a bari- 
tone solo, was rendered by Elder 
Charles Kent. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Details of Church organization and 
government, given in the beginning, 
still unchanged. — Officers established 
and appointments made as need for 
them developed. — Magnitude of latter- 
day work foreseen and provided foi 
at inception. — Importance of keeping 
historical records. — need for implant- 
ing in the children, faith in the Gospel. 

I have been much pleased and edi- 
fied this morning in listening to 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND.

the President's remarks to us, and 
I feel happy to have the privilege 
of meeting with the Latter-day 
Saints in their general conference. 
For some time I have not been well 
enough to attend to my duties in the 
office of the First Presidency, but 
I feel thankful that I am so far 
recovered as to be able to go on 
and attend to my duties. 

When the President was explain- 
ing to us where the authority lies 
in dealing with matters in the 
Church, I thought how perfect is 
the organization of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and how perfect it came to us in 
the very beginning. On Sunday, 
next, it will be eighty-three years 
since a few met in the house of Mr. 
Whitmer in Fayette, New York, 
and organized the Church. The^ 
Lord had commanded them to do 
this, and the Church was organized 
in such a way that it has not been 
necessary to change the organiza- 
tion since then. When we read the 
revelation on government, which 
was given about that time, we feel 
that it is just as suitable today as 
it was then, and that the authority 
given to the different quorums, and 
the duties imposed upon the various 
members of the priesthood are the 
same today and they will ever re- 
main the same. We will not at any 
time feel to discard the Church gov- 
ernment given in the twentieth sec- 
tion of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. As they were then in- 
structed in regard to their duties 
so the members of the different 
quorums are instructed today. The 
deacons, the teachers and the priests 
have the same duties laid on them 
and the same power and authority 
rests upon the elders, the seventies, 
the high priests now as then. 
Though the higher quorums were 



not yet organized, the Lord had re- 
vealed before the organization of 
the Church that there should be 
Apostles in the Church, and had 
even appointed those who should 
call them, so that if they were not 
introduced at the very start the 
revelations were given as to how 
the Church should be organized. 
Joseph had informed the little 
flock that gathered there of what the 
Lord had commanded, and it was 
proposed to them that Joseph Smith 
be the first elder of the Church, and 
Oliver Cowdery the second. Then 
Joseph ordained Oliver and Oliver 
ordained Joseph to the office of an 
elder. This was not bestowing the 
Melchisedek Priesthood on either of 
them. They held that before. It 
had been conferred • upon them by 
Peter, James and John. It was not 
given to them by the authority of 
those present. The Lord had re- 
vealed to them, through His ser- 
vant, and had conferred upon them 
the Melchisedek Priesthood, but 
there was no Church organized as 
yet, and hence there were no officers 
needed in the Church, but when 
the Church was organized on April 
the 6th, 1830, then it was necessary 
that men should fill official positions 
in the Church, and do this by the 
consent of those over whom they 
were to exercise authority. As yet, 
the office of a high priest had not 
been given, but elders had been 
voted for, and had been ordained, 
and they took charge of the meet- 
ing. What a glorious time they 
had together that day! They par- 
took of the sacrament for the first 
time in this dispensation ; the em- 
blems of the body and blood of the 
Savior were administered, and those 
few who were together rejoiced in 
having this privilege, and in hear- 
ing the testimonies that were borne 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and the prophecies that were made. 
Several who were present went 
away believeing, and were after- 
wards baptized. On that day when 
the Church was organized, a revela- 
tion was given in which the Lord 
told Joseph further about the re- 
sponsible positions he was to fill and 
the glorious destiny of the church. 
He says : 

Section 21. 

1. Behold there shall be a record 
kept among you, and in it thou shalt 
he called a Seer, a Translator, a 
Prophet, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, 
an Elder of the Church through the 
will of God the Father, and the grace 
of your Lord Jesus Christ. 

2. Being inspired of the Holy Ghost 
to lay the foundation thereof, and to 
build it up unto the most holy faith. 

3. Which chureh was organized and 
established in the year of our Lord 
eighteen hundred and thirty in the 
fourth month, and on the sixth day 
of the month, which is called April. 

4. Wherefore, meaning the Church, 
thou shall give heed unto all his words 
and commandments which he shall 
give unto you as he receiveth them, 
walking in all holiness before me; 

5. For his word ye shall receive, as 
if from mine own mouth, in all 
patience and faith; 

6. For by doing these things the 
gates of hell shall not prevail against 
you; yea, and the Lord God will dis- 
perse the powers of darkness from be- 
fore you and cause the heavens to 
shake for your good, and His name's 
glory. 

7. For thus saith the Lord God. 
Him have I inspired to move the 
cause of Zion in mighty power for 
good, and his diligence I know, and 
his prayers I have heard. 

8. Yea, his weeping for Zion I have 
seen, and I will cause that he shall 
mourn for her no longer, for his days 
of rejoicing are come unto the remis- 
sion of his sins, and the manifesta- 
tions of my blessings upon his works." 

There are a few more verses be- 
longing to the revelation which I 
will not take the time to read. This 



comforting revelation was given on 
the 6th of April 1830. The Lord 
was refering to the Prophet. We 
can understand Joseph's feelings. 
He knew that a great and marvel- 
ous work was going to be ushered 
in. He felt how weak he was — a 
young man, little more than twenty 
four years old — to have placed upon 
him the responsibility of introduc- 
ing this last dispensation and es- 
tablishing again the Church of 
Christ upon the earth. No doubt he 
felt much anxiety, for the Lord said 
that he had seen his weeping" for 
Zion, but promised that he should 
be comforted. Joseph did see the 
work begun, the Church organ- 
ized, the members sustaining him 
as their leader, and the offices being- 
filled in the Church. He knew it 
was the Lord's work, and he re- 
joiced to see its beginning-. The 
I ord had opened unto him in visions 
the future of His kindgom, and 
hence in his talk about the Lord's 
purposes and the destiny of the 
Church he spoke the convictions of 
his soul in which there was not a 
shade of doubt. It must have seemed 
wonderful to the people to hear 
about Zion going to be established, 
about the gathering, about this be- 
ing the little stone that should roll 
down from the mountain and fill 
the whole earth but with the eve of 
prophecy he saw it ; he knew it 
would be fulfilled. The Lord in 
comforting the Saints told them 
that if they would listen to his coun- 
sel, the gates of 'hell should not 
have power over them, and this 
promise is the same to you and to 
me in as much as we listen to the 
counsels of inspired men. As I 
understand that expression "the 
gates of hell," it means those things 
which lead to hell in fact are the 
entrances to it. How many things 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



11 



there are that lead to those gates. 
How many things we have to be 
warned against and which we have 
to watch out for, because if we 
yield to them, they will lead us to 
the gates of hell ! Let us each and 
every one examine ourselves and 
know well the path in which we 
are walking and avoid everything 
that we know is wrong and for- 
bidden by the Lord, well knowing 
that if we yield to such we have 
not the promise that the gates of 
hell shall not have power over us ; 
on the other hand if we perform 
our duty, live according to the testi- 
mony which God has given us, we 
need not fear, for He will lead us 
in the paths of righteousness that 
lead to eternal life. 

At the beginning of this revela- 
tion we were told that there should 
be a recorder in the Church, that 
records should be kept among the 
people. This important work in 
the Church, of keeping records, was 
commanded : and if we read farther 
on we will find that John Whitmer 
was appointed to be Church Re- 
corder, to write the events of the 
Church. I mention this to show 
you how important this part of our 
Church government is, to keep his- 
tory, to keep a record of what takes 
place. I am pleased to say that 
our activity in this direction has 
produced good fruits. We have in 
the Historian's office a great mass 
of useful data. Many precious 
things are there, and I am pleased 
to tell you that before long we hope 
to erect a new historian's office — 
one that shall be fire-proof and 
where we can feel safe in regard 
to the thing's that have been treas- 
ured up for so many years. 

I want to call attention here to 
a series of articles published in the 
"American" magazine, from the 



pen of Brother B. H. Roberts, 
which gives the Church history, and 
I believe it would be a splendid 
thing for the Latter-day Saints to 
take that magazine, read it and post 
themselves on Church history. It 
would especially be a good thing 
if they had it from the beginning, 
but I suppose it will some time 
come out in a history by itself. Even 
if you have not taken it before, I 
would advise you to subscribe for 
it now as Church history can be 
taken up in any part of it, and still 
you will find it interesting and well 
worth reading. I honor those men 
who have been brave enough to 
publish these articles, and I am 
pleased to hear that they are read 
with interest in the world, but they 
ought to be read by the Saints at 
home. 

I desire to say to the recorders 
in the different stakes and in the 
different wards that your calling- 
is a very important one. In vears 
to come what you write will be 
looked for and treasured up. We 
are trying to connect events of 
Church history in the early days, 
and when we find in a private day 
book or record something that con- 
nects missing links, why we feel 
like we have found a treasure. Now, 
if you children of our pioneers and 
of the early members of the Church 
have some of their records or day 
books, we would like that you would 
give us an opportunity to read them, 
and to copy from them such things 
as may help to corroborate data 
which we already have, or perhaps 
give us data that we are not in pos- 
session of. We do not ask you to 
give them to us, but to let us have 
the use of them till we can make 
copies of such parts that might be 
useful to ns. Be sure that you keep 
p record of what takes place in the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wards, and in the stakes ; the chang- 
es in priesthood, and such events 
that are closely connected with the 
Church in order that they he not 
forgotten ; and where papers are 
printed in any of the towns in Zion, 
we would like you to send a copy 
of them to the Historian's Office. 
We will keep them on file. By our 
having" them we may be able to see 
what is taking place out in the dif- 
ferent stakes and wards, that may 
not reach our larger papers pub- 
lished here. We are seeking to 
make Church history as perfect as 
possible, so that when it is referred 
to reliance can be placed upon what 
is recorded. 

There is another matter I would 
like to lay before the conference, 
and that is the necessity of teaching 
our young. We have splendid Sun- 
day Schols and they are doing a 
good work We have auxiliary 
organizations that take up the im- 
provement of the young, and we 
have religion classes in which we 
want our children taught faith in 
the religion of their fathers. In 
some of the stakes they are doing 
a splendid work. In others it seems 
like our brethren who have charge 
think it an extra burden upon them 
and do not care to have these clas- 
ses organized. Let me beg of you, 
plead with you, to have them es- 
tablished for the good of the chil- 
dren. Let them be taught as the 
Lord commands us to teach them 
to walk uprightly before Him. Let 
us try to give them all the chance 
in the world to be built up in the 
faith that is so dear to our hearts. 
You parents, how much have you 
not done for the gospel's sake, left 
everything dear to you and suffered 
the mockings and scorn of the 
world? You knew it was God's 
revealed truth to you, you received 



it, and you bore these things with- 
out murmur and you have gathered 
with the Saints. Can it be possible 
that after you have done so much 
for your God-given faith that you 
are willing" that your children shall 
be neglected and grow up without 
having the advantages that you can 
give them? As you know religion 
cannot be taught in the state schools 
we do not want to interfere with 
the children of our friends of other 
denominations, but we do want to 
do all we can for our children and 
give them an opportunity to learn 
how precious is the truth which 
the Lord has given unto us. En- 
courage the Religion Classes, en- 
courage the children to attend them, 
encourage the teachers that are will- 
ing to go and teach your children, 
and let us see this auxiliary organ- 
ization prosper as well as all the 
others. 

Well, I don't think it would be 
wise for me to continue talking. I 
am so happy to be with you. I 
pray the Lord to bless the Latter- 
day Saints, to bless them with the 
testimony of the truth, and I bear 
my testimony to you that this is 
the work of the Lord, and that it 
will triumph in the earth. God bless 
you all. Amen. 

A notice was read bv President 
Smth concerning the correspond- 
ence school conducted by the 
Church, after which he remarked: 

We would admonish and advise 
our young men who have not an 
opportunity to attend the missionary 
classes at our Chruch schoools, on 
account of their distance from them 
and the cost, that if they will cor- 
respond with Brother Edwin S. 
Sheets at the Bishops' Building 
here, at No. 40 North Main Street 
and get into communication with 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



13 



him, they will have much benefit, I 
think, from it, and it will aid them 
in preparing themselves for mis- 
sionary work abroad. 

President Smith then read a 
statement concerning - the concert to 
be given by Professor Stephens, 
Professor McClellan and the choir, 
and commented as follows : 

I hope our good people will show 
their respect and loyalty to the choir 
— one of the best of our many most 
excellent choirs. We must not for- 
get those who sing for us, like the 
Tabernacle Choir here, of course 
most of them are employed in their 
daily avocations and are unable to 
be present during week days, but 
they give much of their time for 
practice and they are always willing 
and are if possible present on the 
Sabbath to render their portion of 
service to the Lord, and we ought 
always to be loyal to our choirs. 
Wp have many of them, this one 
and the one at Odsren and at other 
places, they are worthy of all com- 
mendation and of all praise by the 
Latter-day Saints, and Ave hope you 
will not forget them. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Andrew Kimball. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m.. President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer — 



Blessed to open the last dispensation ; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph R. Shepherd. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

O, say what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of truth will be 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, my soul 
was rejoiced and instructed this 
morning by the remarks of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith and President 
Anthon H. Lund. They indicated 
to us our bearings, as it were, and 
called us back to first principles. I 
believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that it is well to return to first prin- 
ciples, and to learn our duty so 
that we may be more effective as 
preachers of the Word. 

The Lord said unto His servants, 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
' 'And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of 
my disciples whom I have chosen 
in these last days, and they shall go 
forth," the Lord said, "and none 
shall stay them." There has been 
no power that has been able to re- 
sist or even impede the onward 
march of truth. The Prophet Isa- 
iah says, in the 55th chapter and 
11th verse of his book, "So shall 
my word be that goeth forth out of 
my mouth ; it shall not return unto 
me void, but it shall accomplish 
that which I please, and it shall 
prosper in the thing whereto I sent 
it." It is a remarkable fact that 
however humble the elder is, when 



1 1 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he speaks by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, his words go to the hearts 
of the children of men, and it is a 
mighty encouragement to the young 
elder to know that God is behind 
him, and that there is a power be- 
hind his words which the power of- 
man cannot resist. 

The Savior declared that before 
His coming there should be fearful 
sights in the earth, that there should 
be wars and rumors of wars, that 
there should be earthquakes and 
commotion, and that men's hearts 
should fail them for fear, and in 
this clay the Lord has said, "For 
after your testimony cometh the 
testimony of earthquakes. * * * 
And also cometh the testimony of 
the voice of thunderings, and the 
voice of lightnings, and the voice 
of tempests, and all things shall be 
in commotion," and surely men's 
hearts shall fail them. We are liv- 
ing, my brethren and sisters, in this 
day when these prophecies are be- 
ing fulfilled. The voice of the tem- 
pest, the voice of the earthquake, 
the voice of the thunderings and 
the lightnings is following the tes- 
timony of the elders of Israel. We 
do not sit in judgment upon our fel- 
low citizens. We do not boast of 
great judgments, for the Lord has 
commanded us not to do that, but 
we do know that the Lord declared 
that these things should precede 
His glorious second coming. We 
do know that He has said that it 
is our duty to warn the people, to 
preach the Gospel, to cry repentance 
unto this generation, and to say 
with the prophets of old, "Repent, 
for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand." 

It is well to remember, mv breth- 
ren and sisters, that it is by the 
preaching of the Gospel that men 
are saved, and that men are warned. 



We believe that the souls of men 
are precious in the sight of God. I 
believe that the words of the Pres- 
ident of the Church this morning, 
when he exhorted the Priesthood of 
God to assume the full responsibil- 
ity of their office, are timely, they 
are inspired, they apply to us. Think 
of the sad case of Absalom. He sat 
at the gate of the city, and when 
people went up to judgment to the 
king this false counselor said, "If I 
were the king I would do this, or 
I would do the other." He knew 
in his heart that he could not have 
done those things in righteousness, 
and I wonder sometimes of we, 
instead of bearing responsibility as 
we should do, do not encourage 
people to ask foolish questions by re- 
ferring them to somebody Just to re- 
lieve ourselves of the burden of bear- 
ing that responsibility which God 
expects us to bear humbly and hon- 
estly in His sight. When the tragic 
end came, when Absalom's disobe- 
dience ended in rebellion and he 
was slain, King David sat at the 
gate, waiting for the news from the 
battle field, and from afar, as the 
runner came. King David said, "Is 
the young man Absalom safe?" His 
thoughts were not with the result 
of the battle upon which the future 
of his kingdom rested, but his 
thoughts were with the young man, 
and when the melancholy news was 
bioken to him that Absalom had 
perished, David's great heart almost 
broke, and he said, "O my son Ab- 
salom, my son, my son Absalom, 
would God I had died for thee." 
What did David's kingdom weigh 
in the balance of the loss of his son ? 
His son was dearer to him than all 
the kingdoms of the world, and so 
are our children dearer to us than 
all the wealth of the world. Their 
souls are precious, and let us, my 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



15 



brethren and sisters, stand up like 
men and women in Israel and as- 
sume the responsibilities of our call- 
ings, let us 

"Dare to be a Daniel, 

And dare to stand alone. 
Let us dare to have a purpose firm. 

And let us dare to make it known," 

and when people want counsel, if 
we are able to give it, let us give it 
in the spirit of humility and of 
righteousness. 

The scenes now in Ohio and in 
the south are harrowing in the ex- 
treme. In Tennessee a terrible tor- 
nado or cyclone went over part of 
that state and eighty lives were lost 
as a result of the destructiveness of 
the storm. In Ohio, in Louisville, 
in Memphis, the floods are spread- 
ing and many lives are being lost 
and millions of property are being 
destroyed. I say unto you, my 
brethren and sisters, in the face of 
these warnings, in the face of these 
terrible things, how can we sit in 
idleness? A man that fears God is 
afraid to be idle. The man that 
loves God will seek to save his fel- 
low creatures. Now, when the 
world oppose us, in what manner 
shall we retaliate? Not in the kind 
of opposition they level against us, 
but when they oppose us we will 
preach the gospel of love, for our 
souls go out to the children of men. 
We will preach the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus unto them. We will 
preach faith, repentance and bap- 
tism by immersion for the remission 
of sins, and the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Ah, it is well to remember that 
when Nicodemus came to the Lord 
Jesus Christ and asked Him what he 
should do to be saved, it was not 
man that said, "Except a man be 
born of the water and of the Spirit, 



he cannot enter the kingdom of 
God." It was the Lord Jesus 
Christ, the Redeemer, the Savior of 
the world, the Author of eternal 
salvation unto all those that obey 
Him. This was the being who gave 
that command; this is the Being 
that gives His commandments to 
His disciples in this the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times, and 
when men elect to disobey that com- 
mand they incur a responsibility 
for which they will have to answer 
unto the Lord our God. We are 
promised the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
Do you know what that means? I 
think you do. God be praised, this 
Spirit has given me a testimony of 
the Gospel. It has revealed to me 
and to you that, as the Prophet Jo- 
seph said, in order to gain an eter- 
nal exaltation in the kingdom of 
God Ave must obey the fulness of 
the Gospel ; not one principle, not 
two principles, but the fulness of 
the everlasting Gospel ; for Jesus 
said: "Man shall not live by bread 
alone, but by every word that pro- 
ceedeth forth from the mouth of 
God." The gift of the Holy Ghost 
teaches me that not only is baptism 
and repentance and faith essential 
to salvation — and true — but it 
teaches me that the pre-existence of 
spirits, the resurrection from the 
dead, the doctrines of eternal judg- 
ment and the other glorious princi- 
ples, including the doctrine of eter- 
nal progression, are true. They 
are of God and essential to the up- 
building and exaltation of the 
saints of God. Now this is our 
duty. I know the Latter-day Saints 
will prove true. I believe, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that our mission 
and our destiny is as high or higher 
perhaps than that of any other peo- 
ple that has ever existed on the 
face of the earth. 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In the south of Georgia a short 
time ago at a Presbyterian conven- 
tion one minister declared that the 
church that controls America will be 
the dominating factor in the evan- 
gelization of the world. Well, if 
he means by that that America will 
be controlled by the church having 
the fulness of the Gospel, I then 
will agree with him that that church 
will be the dominating factor in the 
evangelization of the earth. It is 
good to behold that men in other 
churches are beginning to realize 
that America has a destiny and that 
from this land was to go the fulness 
of the Gospel, and that from this 
land was to be fought the battle 
which would end in a complete vic- 
tory for Jesus Christ, the eternal 
Son of God. The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints today, 
as it ever has done, is teaching the 
fulness of the Gospel. In Chatta- 
nooga a few weeks ago the great 
Baptist church of the south met in 
convention, and before thev ad- 
journed they passed a resolution 
that the doctrine of tithing was of 
God, that it was a proper means of 
raising revenue, instead of the man- 
ner of collecting that now obtains, 
and each and every delegate 
pledged himself when he returned 
home to pay an honest tithing. That 
great church in the south, instead of 
depending upon its paid ministers 
to preach the gospel, is enlisting the 
aid of its laymen — the masons, the 
brick-layers, the carpenters, the 
miners, the clerks, the lawyers, the 
doctors — all these laymen are being 
pressed into the ministry, and yet a 
few years ago they laughed at the 
ministry of the "Mormon" Church, 
and declared that its ministry was 
an uneducated one and therefore 
would not be of much force in the 
promulgation of the Gospel. Thus 



is the world beginning to see that 
the doctrines of the "Mormon" 
Church are true. It bears testimony 
to this mighty fact, that Joseph 
Smith preached the Gospel, gave ut- 
terance to the thoughts that the 
souls of men were longing to speak. 
So if this then is to be the rule as 
to which church controls America, 
not by force, but along principles 
of righteousness, it follows then 
that this Church, preaching the ful- 
ness of the Gospel, is to be the dom- 
inating factor in the evangelization 
of the world, and I am proud to be 
a member of that Church to which 
that high and holy calling has been 
committed. Brethren and sisters, 
let us stand erect in our faith, let 
us be firm and constant and stead- 
fast, let us determine to do our 
duty, and then with that spirit, with 
the help of the Lord, we will strug- 
gle on through danger, through 
storm and through sunshine, until 
danger's troubled night is o'er. We 
will preach the Gospel until the 
nations have been warned. We will 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
until He comes in glory and in 
power to reign on the earth as King 
of kings and Lord of lords. Even 
so, blessed Lord Jesus, come quick- 
ly. Amen.

Perhaps the most important event 
that is before the Latter-day Saints 
and the world is the coming of the 
Son of God to live among men in 
the flesh. The signs He said should 
precede His coming are appearing 
upon the right hand and the left. 
Those who have eyes to see, and 
hearts to understand, can easily dis-

cern the preparation that is going 
on in the world, and we can also 
discern that the Lord is working' in 
the midst of the Latter-day Saints 
for the fulfillment of that glorious 
event. I desire to call attention of 
my brethren and sisters to that par- 
ticular phase of the work which is 
devolving upon us. The Lord is 
working among the nations accord- 
ing to His good pleasure, but He 
has given special commission and 
labor to the Latter-day Saints to 
prepare a people, a place and a con- 
dition for His coming. I am ask- 
ing myself am I preparing, and I 
ask, are the Latter-day Saints with 
whom I am associated preparing 
themselves to meet the emergency, 
or shall we disappoint the Lord and 
ourselves when He comes? 

It is a most pretentious claim the 
Latter-day Saints make. They say 
they are fulfilling the vision of the 
prophet who forsaw the stone cut 
out of the mountain without hands 
rolling forth and filling the whole 
earth. The Latter-day Saints claim 
that they are now fulfilling that 
prediction of the past, that while 
this is but the work in embryo, vet 
it is rollnig forth to the accomplish- 
ment of that mighty purpose. It 
is growing at a pace, perhaps, that 
we should be entirely satisfied with, 
since this work is increasing in num- 
bers, in influence and power in the 
world. I believe that last year 
showed the largest increase in his- 
tory of the church. I do not know- 
how it has been in other sections, 
but in our district we had the largest 
number of baptisms in any year in 
the history of that mis- 
sion, although we had fewer elders 
than heretofore. Generally I be- 
lieve that the Church is ^increasing 
in number of baptisms from year to 
vear, and that is a gratifying thing. 



We have obtained such growth that, 
grouping all large churches, such 
as the Methodist, Presbyterian and 
so forth, we are rated as the eighth 
in number of members, in the Unit- 
ed States. That is some distinction, 
and yet, when I look at it from 
another point of view, I wonder 
why this Church does not grow fast- 
er than it does when I know within 
my soul that it is the true Church 
of Jesus Christ, that it stands the 
test of reason, of argument, of 
scripture, or any other kind of test 
tb"* be applied to it. 

I marvel why, just as our fathers 
and grandfathers did when they 
were converted, why the world does 
not receive it gladly, and why hun- 
dreds of thousands do not ioin with 
us, instead of thousands only. I have 
wondered why the Lord does not 
cause it to grow faster, but in my 
contemplation of this question I 
have found a good deal of comfort 
from my observation of the facts of 
history and science. I discover that 
the physical organism which is cal- 
culated to live through a lengthy 
period of days, or years, seldom 
comes to maturity quickly, it grows 
slowly ; and that form of life, wheth- 
er it be vegetable or animal, which is 
calculated to last but a short period, 
as a rule, comes to its majority 
quickly, and soon passes away- The 
oak does not reach its height in 
the first year while the sunflower, 
for example, may lift its head above 
the oak in the first season, but, when 
the test of winter frosts is applied 
to it, it falls, while the oak twig 
remains, and each succeeding sea- 
son becomes stronger and greater, 
and remains through ages to be- 
come the monarch of the forest. 
Those governments that have been 
destined to endure through long 
periods of time were, as a rule, very 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



slow in their growth : Those that 
grew rapidly ordinarily passed away 
quickly. And so, I believe that God's 
hand is manifest in preventing a too 
rapid growth of His Church. That 
may seem a strange way to look at 
it, and yet I believe it is evident that 
the Lord is staying the too rapid 
growth of this work. 

There have been many difficulties 
in the way of men and women re- 
ceiving the gospel ; one being the 
gathering to Zion. If the members 
of the Church had remained in Eng- 
land, Scotland, Ireland and other 
places where they received the mes- 
sage of the gospel in early days, 
and would have built churches there, 
it is probable that there would have 
been hundreds join the church that 
never did come into it, because of 
the prestige that a local strong 
membership would have exerted. 
The fact that men had to gather 
from their native land to America, 
and go through the hardships of a 
long pilgrimage, an ocean voyage 
in the olden style sailing vessel, 
and then a long journey across the 
plains, was such a discouragment 
that it is likely there would have 
been thousands more join this 
Church if that sacrifice had not been 
required of them. It is doubtless 
true that if the Latter-day Saints 
could have remained in Missouri or 
Illinois, without molestation, there 
w ould have been a great many more 
belonging to the Church than there 
are today. Many of those who un- 
dertook the ocean voyage, stood 
that hardship but could go no fur- 
ther. Others faltered in the wilder- 
ness, "put their hands to the plow 
then turned back," and remained in 
various sections of the United 
States, they, and their descendants, 
hundreds who could not muster 
courage enough to go all the way. 



These were difficulties in -the way 
of the growth of this work. 

It is doubtless true also, that if it 
had not been, and if today it were 
not required of those who receive 
the gospel, that they should observe 
the Word of Wisdom, and abstain 
from the use of tea and coffee, to- 
bacco and liquor, hundreds who are 
not now united with us would have 
been. I know some who are out- 
side of the Church because they 
cannot make the sacrifice to give up 
the coffee, tea, or tobacco that they 
have been used to for years. In- 
deed, if this test were applied, this 
one simple thing in the requirements 
the Lord has made, were required of 
any other religious denomination 
outside of the Latter-day Saints, if 
men had to accede to that one law 
among us known as the Word of 
Wisdom, it is doubtful whether they 
would maintain one-half of their 
membership. It is probable there 
are thousands who would have 
joined the Church had it not been 
for the requirement of the Lord in 
the law of tithing, they are stand- 
ing aloof because they have not cour- 
age enough to join us since the Lord 
has asked us to donate a tenth of 
our income for the intrests of this 
Church. It is true that there would 
be many come in if it were not for 
the fact that they are afraid they 
would have to go upon a mission. 

I could enumerate other things 
connected with the growth of mem- 
bership in this Church which seem 
to be a hinderance, and yet when I 
look at this whole question from an- 
other point of view — and I would 
like to see it from the Lord's point 
of view, for He is able to remove 
all these difficulties if necessary. — 
when I look at it from what I think 
is His point of view, I confess that 
the Lord has done it just right, and

I would not want to change or 
alter it at all. Of what value and 
worth, after all, would a large 
membership of the Church be, if the 
men and women would or could not 
meet its requirements? The Lord 
is building the most splendid insti- 
tution the world has ever seen, in 
this work of the Church preparatory 
for the coming of the Son of God. 
The kindgom that is to be built up 
and established from this work is 
to be the grandest thing the world 
has ever seen, and the Lord cannot 
make it out of material that is not 
full weight, full measure, full capac- 
ity ; and so these tests are applied to 
eliminate that material which is un- 
worthy to be used in the building of 
this structure. The man or woman 
who cannot leave father and mother, 
house and land, for Christ's sake 
and the gospel, is not worthy of His 
favor : and so the gathering from 
the nations of the earth is a test 
and those who stand the test, they 
and their children, can be used in 
the accomplishment of this work. 
Those were rejected who faltered 
bv the wayside, who could not en- 
dure tests of Missouri and Il- 
linois, tests essential in God's pro- 
gram for the building of the Church 
in this country. I believe that the 
troubles, sorrows, and diffieulities 
experienced by the Saints in Mis- 
souri and Illinois were necessary, 
and that the men and the women 
who came to this country would 
perhaps, not have remained true if 
they hadn't passed through those 
troublesome days. There were even 
greater troubles after they left that 
land, and the Lord was only pre- 
paring them for these. That was 
onlv as a schoolmaster to prepare 
them for greater sacrifices that they 
were destined to make. 

The Lord intends to make this 



people not only a people intellectual, 
but a people the physical superiors 
of any men who have lived upon the 
earth. In making the sacrifices that 
our parents did, they were laying 
the foundation for physical health 
of manhood and womanhood that 
shall ultimately produce a perfect 
race. In my heart I thank God that 
three generations ago my grand- 
parents left off using tobacco, liq- 
uor, and tea, left those objectionable 
things in the old world, and haven't 
transmitted the taint or desire of 
them into my blood. I want to 
preserve that blessing, and pass it 
on to my generations after me, that 
this may produce a perfect race of 
men and women. Woe to me if 
I lose two generations of struggle 
and effort, and we turn back to the 
use of the harmful things that my 
parents and grandparents left. , 

We have not finished the work, 
my young brethren and sisters. God 
laid the foundation through the la- 
bor of our fathers and mothers, 
and the superstructure is just be- 
ginning to rise. If we shall be 
counted worthy to be used as ma- 
terial in the building of that which 
God intends and contemplates, we 
shall have to maintain all that our 
fathers maintained, of faith, and 
virtue, and all the qualities of hon- 
esty and integrity that were so 
abundant in them, and we must 
add unto it or we cannot be ac- 
cepted of the Lord. Israel Zang- 
will, the Jew, spoke of glorious 
America as the melting pot in which 
he saw the various nations of the 
earth absorbed, through the genius 
and spirit of American institutions ; 
and he contended that, after a man 
has become an American citizen, 
he should no longer be called a Jew, 
or an Irishman, but an American. 
The great question is, can America 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



absorb the hordes that come to her 
shores and transmit to them the 
ideals of the fathers who founded 
this government? Zangwill is hope- 
ful this shall he the case; I trust it 
may. It is wonderful what America 
has accomplished through mixing 
the blood of various nations, she 
has produced a new type of men 
and women, a physical type of man- 
hood that excels in most interna- 
tional athletic events, a type of 
physical beauty that excels the rest 
of the world. Oh, in that I can see 
another of God's purposes in gath- 
ering men and women from the na- 
tions of the earth. 

In our gathering places we have 
not been receiving hordes promis- 
cuously, like the country at large 
has. but we have been selecting the 
stock, "one of a city and two of a 
family." They have not been from 
the ranks of the lowest society, nor 
the highest, but they have been, as 
a rule, from the choicest of the 
nations of the earth, the blood that 
is purest and best. These have 
been selected and brought here to 
a "melting pot" where men and wo- 
men are being purified as gold seven 
times tried, the most perfect race of 
men and women the world has ever 
seen. That "melting pot" is the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
dnv faints, wherein the best blood 
of the various nations can mingle 
and oroduce not only the best race 
physically, but a race that shall 
continue to uphold standards of 
purity and qualities of life that 
shall ultimately make the cleanest 
and best people in all the world. 
Now T can see the wisdom of the 
Lord in bringing these people from 
Scandinavia, and Germanv, and 
other nations, who have a like faith 
and belief, that their children may 
intermarry with each other and 



thereby maintain the ' advantage of 
such union, add unto it and carry 
it into future generations. 

The Latter-day Saint boys and 
girls who do not intermarry with 
those of their own faith and belief, 
counteract to a large extent, the ben- 
efit of the sacrifices made by their 
progenitors and nullify, to some de- 
gree, the purposes and object for 
which God has gathered us here. 
Latter-day Saint boys should marry 
Latter-day Saint girls, and Latter- 
day Saint girls, ought to marry 
Latter-day Saint boys. I regret to 
say I have met scores of' heart- 
broken, disappointed "Mormon" 
girls scatttered over the northwest, 
who fully agree with me that they 
have made a failure, and a serious 
mistake in undertaking to live their 
ideals associated with men without 
these ideals, and without faith at 
all. 

God is building here an institu- 
tion that is going to be, as T have 
observed, the most excellent of all 
the world, and we are not going to 
be discouraged if, after two gen- 
erations, we have not accomplished 
it. If it shall take three, four, five, 
or six generations we won't be dis- 
couraged. We shall seize the ad- 
vantages that our fathers have giv- 
en unto us, we will hold it up be- 
fore the eyes of our children as an 
unfinished work that God has called 
us to do, that may take ten or twen- 
ty, generations, but it will be com- 
pleted through God's help, if we 
only do our part. Our eyes may not 
see the consummation, but we are 
expected to do our duty and leave 
the result with our posterity who, 
may the Lord grant, shall follow 
our example as we should follow 
the example of those who have pre- 
ceded us. That the Son of God 
may come soon, and live among

men in the earth, is my prayer and 
desire in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH E. EOBINSON. 

( President of California Mission.) 

While I stand before yon, my 
brethren and sisters, I sincerely de- 
sire the inspiration of the spirit of 
truth to direct my utterance. With 
me, I know your souls have been 
fed with the bread of life this day, 
and in the testimony of my brethren 
of the mission fields you have felt 
it like a call to battle for the right. 
If there has been dubiety in the 
minds of any as to the. right of au- 
thority to preside over the things 
pertaining to righteousness, and the 
kingdom of our God in the earth, 
your minds were disabused of that 
in this morning's service, when 
President Smith made known unto 
us the mind and will of the Lord 
relative to the order of the Priest- 
hood, and the order of the Church, 
and to the necessity of the Priest- 
hood setting their houses and them- 
selves in order. 

With Elder Ballard, I sincerely 
rejoice in the fact that I, too,- have 
been born of "believing blood." 
Sometimes, in the mission field, I 
have been confronted with the 
thought, and with the statement 
that, "this alone accounts for your 
position as a member of the 'Mor- 
mon' faith, or Church, the fact that 
you were born a 'Mormon.' " At 
first blush, to some it may appear 
that there is no particular virtue in 
one's birth, yet through all time I 
have learned to have respect to that 
•'believing blood" spoken of in the 



scriptures, and recognized by the 
Master Himself when He said, "My 
sheep know my voice and the 
stranger they will not follow." I 
have learned too, from observing 
not only men of different nationali- 
ties, and their predisposition to do 
certain things because of prenatal 
influences and training, and differ- 
ent traits of thoughts and living, 
that in the animal world about us, 
those who were born to a certain 
end achieved it more readily than 
any can be trained to do so ; that 
the bloodhound will follow with un- 
erring scent the trail that is lost to 
the pampered and petted pet of 
some lady of high degree. And so 
I rejoice in the fact that I, too, have 
been born of believing parents, of 
the third generation, and it has been 
my prayer that there shall be no un- 
toward act performed by me that 
shall turn back the tide of progress 
set by my ancestors toward the goal 
of truth and righteousness. 

I rejoice in the privileges of the 
gospel. I rejoice in the fact that 
all the principles thereof appeal both 
to the emotions and the reason of 
men ; that there is no good thing, 
that there is nothing legitimate, 
praiseworthy or of good report to 
be found outside of the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, as revealed 
anew to us in these last days. Men 
say and have said unto me that 
"You don't know it all," and indi- 
vidually I am perfectly willing to 
confess that. They have said, "You 
don't have all within your church 
that is true." This I have not ac- 
cepted, and I am not prepared to 
accept, on the contrary, I do 
know that there is in the genius of 
this gospel, which we live and keep, 
that which is for the salvation of the 
souls of men now. The gospel 
does not deal alone with what we 



'12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



may call an uncertain future, which 
however is certain to those who will 
keep the faith ; it does not deal alone 
with the past, but is alive, is virile, 
and enters into every avenue of art, 
science and trade, into the social 
fabric, in everything that is praise- 
worthy and for the uplift of men. 
If in the writings of Israel Zangwill, 
in some of the statements he has 
made in his play. "The Melting 
Pot," he has felt the pulse of the 
future, and can see in this blessed 
land of America a nation not of 
many nations but one, with intent 
and purpose to render that which is 
just and true unto God and unto 
their fellows, it will be because of 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus and not 
because of the theories and ideals of 
men. Those dreamers who dream 
of a Utopian time when inequality 
shall cease, when the hireling shall 
be no longer oppressed in his wage, 
when men shall meet a brother and 
a friend in every land and clime, 
when righteousness shall obtain in 
the courts of justice, and men shall 
have been weaned away from sel- 
fishness and hate, should understand 
that it shall be realized only through 
the fruits of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus, for that alone will strip man 
of innate selfishness, which is the 
bane of humanity today. The gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus alone will 
cause men to prefer their neighbors 
to themselves, and wean them of 
selfishness and jealousy, and their 
hunger after pomp and power, fame 
and government. The gospel of the 
Lord Jesus alone will grant unto the 
hireling that which is his just due, 
and care for the widow and the 
fatherless. The gospel of the Lord 
Jesus alone will make of the proud 
man a humble man, will abase him 
and bring him on to the same level 
and footing with his brother who 



seeks after truth and after equality 
in all things. 

Upon our western seaboard we 
find a great many of those so-called 
dreamers. It seems a rich land for 
every creed, every idea and theory 
to fructify in. Frequently we have 
new faiths arise, and new churches 
are established ; new methods of be- 
lief and unbelief put forth, with 
their various followers ; more or less 
of the spirit of the Orient as well 
as of the Occident. It is surprising 
that so many fads and fancies find 
following among so-called stable 
minded men, and the liberally edu- 
cated people of America. Recently, 
in Los Angeles, there was one set 
up and named the Church of the 
Living God, the tabernacle of David 
again in the wilderness." Some of 
their elders came to our headquart- 
ers to instruct us in the fact that 
there had been a falling away of the 
faith ; that there has been innova- 
tions made in the gospel ordinances 
of the church founded by the Mas- 
ter ; that men drew near to God with 
their mouths and with their lips did 
honor Him, but their hearts were 
far removed from Him, and they 
taught for fear the doctrines of men, 
and for hire made themselves spec- 
ious teachers to tickle the ears of 
those who would not stand reproach 
or chatisement. T t^ld them there 
would be no difficult)- in teaching 
us the gospel which they had in 
•mind, the "everlasting gospel"as 
they called it, if they could but prove 
to us the line of their authority and 
the right to teach. They entered 
into a dissertation of how one Josn- 
ua Sykes had been called of the 
Master, angels had visited him, and 
possibly he himself was one of the 
evangels of olden time, come again 
to the earth for the last dispensa- 
tion. Then I asked them for a 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



23 



proof of it in the fact that God had 
said, as they had quoted, "that every 
word should be established in the 
mouth of two or more witnesses." 
Then they were confounded, for 
they had only the witness of one 
man in every step in the building up 
of their church. I cited them not 
only to the witness of men, so far 
as the building of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
was concerned, but that God, the 
Father Himself, was a witness, and 
had come with the Son, and intro- 
duced Himself to the boy prophet to 
open up this last dispensation. Also, 
John the Baptist, who was the fore- 
runner of Christ anciently, of whom 
the Christ said "He is the Esaias 
who is to come" who, if we may 
accept some of the writings of the 
early fathers, Nicodemus said went 
into hell itself and introduced him- 
self in hades, to the spirits who were 
kept in prison from Adam unto that 
day, as John the Baptist, the fore- 
runner of Christ on the earth, who 
now had come down to the very 
depths of hell to make known unto 
them the fact of their emancipation ; 
that the Christ should visit them 
there and come with healing in His 
wings and set the captives free, to 
open the prison doors ; and lead the 
prisoners out of darkness into light. 
I stated that John came to men in 
the flesh, to Oliver and Joseph, and 
bestowed upon them the keys of his 
ministry; that Peter, James and 
John came to Joseph and Oliver and 
gave them the keys of the Melchise- 
dek Priesthood ; that the Lord Jes- 
us, and Moses, and Elias and Eli- 
jah and many great and wonderous 
angels, Gabriel and Raphael, as well 
as these prophets of the Lord Jesus, 
came each in his turn with the keys 
of his ministry and dispensation, 
and in the presence of two or more 



witnesses bestowed them upon the 
prophet and his immediate associ- 
ates. That line of authority has 
never been broken and given to an- 
other people, but has continued 
with the church, with all the charac- 
teristic gifts, signs, offices and or- 
dinances that were ear-marks of 
Christ's church in the day when He 
lived and prayed for the time when 
God should set up His kingdom in 
the earth, nevermore to be thrown 
down or given to another people. 

If it does not make a man right- 
eously proud to know that he be- 
longs to this church and kingdom, 
that he participates in these gifts 
and blessings, I know not what can 
come unto the soul of man to make 
him so. Therefore today, with you, 
my brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
in the fact that we live, that we have 
being, through the grace of our 
Father ; that Ave are redeemed from 
death and hell through the ministry 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the 
atonement which He wrought out, 
and that with Him and our Father, 
in the world which is to come, we 
shall have opportunity and time 
to realize all that our fond souls 
have yearned for and builded for in 
this life ; that we shall be followed 
by objects of corresponding great- 
ness to our ideals. There we shall 
come into our own, and shall be rec- 
ognized throughout all eternity as 
the very children of our Father, into 
whose hands He committed the min- 
istry of the last days for the setting 
up of His kingdom, and for the rec- 
lamation of the souls of men. 

Let us glorify Him and do our 
full part to bring men to a knowl- 
edge of the truth, that every man 
shall hear the gospel, that every soul 
shall know God for himself and 
have no need to ask his neighbor;

this i> my prayer in the name of the 
Lord Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.). 

Several years ago one of the 
greatest thinkers of the world, the 
great Russian scholar, Tolstoi, saw 
a speck in the far distance which 
he recognized as "Mormonism," 
and he wrote to one of the leading 
educators of America and asked the 
question whether "Mormonism" was 
to become a world power. The 
leader of a great institution in 
America, to whom the question was 
propounded, answered, "We will 
have to wait until we see the third 
and fourth generation of what is 
now known as 'Mormonism.' before 
we can answer." This flashed 
through my mind a short time ago 
when one of the apostles was vis- 
iting the Eastern States Mission, at 
a time when we had the conference 
presidents of all the conferences of 
that mission in council together ; I 
thought to myself, I will take a vote 
and see how many among the lead- 
ers of this mission — the thirteen 
different young men who had been 
chosen for their worthiness to pre- 
side over conferences — belonged to 
the second, third or fourth genera- 
tion of "Mormonism;" and in tak- 
ing the vote I discovered that every 
one of them belonged to the third 
and fourth generations. I could 
have wished that that leader of the 
university had been present and 
could have remembered the ques- 
tion propounded to him by that 
great scholar of Europe, and could 
also have remembered that only 
eighty-one or two years ago the 
Church had been organized with 
six members, and that at the pres- 



ent time there was probably not a 
civilized nation upon the earth 
where Joseph Smith's name was 
not remembered as being one of 
the greatest prophets that had ever 
lived upon the face of this earth — 
in fact, the greatest save it be Jesus 
Christ. If the work continues to 
grow in the next eighty years as it 
has in the past eighty, it will cer- 
tainly be the power of the earth. 

I rejoice this afternoon that I 
have a standing within the Church ; 
that I was born of goodly parents ; 
that I can point, with a great deal 
of pride, to the fact that my father 
was a trusted associate of the 
Prophet Joseph, and all the other 
leaders of the Church up to the 
time of his death, also that Lorenzo 
Snow, at my mother's funeral, 
pointed to the corpse and said, 
"There lies the body of a woman 
who has never been antagonistic to 
any law that God has revealed for 
the redemption of mankind." I sin- 
cerely trust that when my time 
comes to lay this body down that 
it can be said of me that I have 
been true to the men whom God 
has placed from time to time at the 
head of the Church. I remember 
each one of the presidents from 
President Young to President Jo- 
seph F. Smith. I have looked up- 
on all of them as men of God, as 
the mouthpieces of God, and I am 
satisfied beyond the question of a 
doubt that they are and have been 
such, giving to the people wise and 
safe counsel, and I have never seen 
a person prosper or be happy in re- 
fusing to take the counsel that has 
come from the lips of the authori- 
ties of the Church. 

Jesus considered it a wise judg- 
ment to judge a tree from its fruits. 
The world claim that they believe 
in Jesus Christ's judgment and in

His counsel, and all we ask is for 
the world to judge "Mormonism" 
from what "Mormons" have ac- 
complished. We are looked upon as 
being the black spot upon the ec- 
clesiastical part of the world, and 
yet I doubt very much if any other 
church that has ever existed upon 
the face of the earth could have 
done so much to bless the earth, 
so far as they have had an opportu- 
nity, as this Church has done. In 
looking over the faces before me I 
doubt very much if there is a mem- 
ber of the Church in the enjoyment 
of a happy home who does not owe 
it directly or indirectly to the work 
and the influence of this Church, if 
not individually to themselves, to 
their parents' before them in bring- 
ing them together and giving them 
an existence upon the earth, in lead- 
ing their parents here to the Rocky 
Mountains, planting their feet here 
in the safest part of the world, and 
giving them opportunities that they 
never would have had had it not 
been for the work of some "Mor- 
mon" missionary. To my mind in 
this connection alone is revealed 
some of the greatest miracles ; 
greater, far greater than is record- 
ed in the Bible. If we had read 
them in the Bible we would have 
classed them among the greatest of 
miracles to be found within the lids 
of that sacred book. I want to re- 
late one especially that seems to 
have drifted away from our minds. 
There are those here before me 
who remember when President Jo- 
seph F. Smith, President Francis 
M. Lyman, President Heber J. 
Grant, and President Lund were all 
who are now living, 'of the general 
authorities of the Church, at the 
time when our brethren were off on 
what we were pleased to term the 
"underground," when pretty near 



all the presidents of the stakes were 
away from their flocks, when al- 
most every ward had lost its father, 
the bishop, and when some of the 
darkest clouds that ever hovered 
around our people completely cov- 
ered them up, when we did not 
have the privilege at our general 
conference to see the general au- 
thorities of the Church upon the 
stand; when only occasionally we 
received a written message from 
the presidency of the Church, when 
trouble surrounded us upon all 
sides, when the government seemed 
bitterly against us, and when even 
the authorities of the Church could 
see no light ahead, it was then they 
issued an address to the Saints 
pointing out all of these conditions, 
and making a request upon them to 
observe a special fast day named by 
the authorities for the people to 
come together, fasting, with prayer- 
ful hearts, to lift up their prayers 
to God the eternal Father, and ask 
Him to lift the clouds. At that 
time there was not a soul able to 
find a solution to the problem, or 
would even attempt to suggest one. 
The Latter-day Saints obeyed the 
counsel of the authorities of the 
Church. They came to the various 
meeting places with prayerful 
hearts ; they came fasting ; they lift- 
ed up their voices to God the eter- 
nal Father, and offered up their 
prayers to Him, begging Him to 
permit their prayers to ascend unto 
His throne, even as did the prayers 
of Cornelius of old. Do you re- 
member in what a short period of 
time some four hundred of our 
brethren who were cast into prison 
cells came home ; how the presi- 
dents of stakes came back to their 
posts of duty ; how the members of 
the wards greeted the fathers of 
the wards, and how God listened 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to their prayers? If a simple rela- 
tion of a matter of that kind, which 
the older brethren, the middle-aged 
brethren remember distinctly, if we 
could read of such a thing in the 
Bible we would look upon it as one 
of the greatest miracles recorded in 
that book. But we lived in that day 
and it came about gradually. We 
could see the hand of God in it. 
We could see that God works upon 
natural principles, that He uses men 
to bring about His purposes; that 
He so arranged it that the cause of 
His people was soon shifted from 
the hands of bigots and from the 
hands of men whose minds were 
filled with hatred, that they were 
placed in the hands of diplomats 
and statesmen, and in His own na- 
tural way He freed His people. I 
say, to my mind, it is one of the 
great miracles in this Church, and 
demonstrated to me beyond a ques- 
tion of a doubt that God will hear 
our prayers when we place our- 
selves in a condition to be heard. 
When a man places himself in a 
position to receive a testimony that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, he is in a position to demand 
recognition from our Father in 
heaven, and our Father in heaven 
will listen to him. 

The testimony that God has 
given to me of the work of the 
great latter-day prophet is the key 
that opened to me the door, giving 
to me light upon the testimony of 
Jesus Christ, and sometimes I won- 
der, I shudder at what my Condi- 
tion in the religious world would 
have been had it not been for the 
testimony I received concerning the 
divine calling of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I know that he was a 
prophet of God, and a study of his 
life gave me an undying testimony 
that Jesus was the Christ, and yet 



those who judge us wrongfully say 
that a Bible is not to be found in a 
"Mormon" pulpit, that the little 
children of "Mormon" people hear 
nothing about Jesus, and it is a 
common thing in the east for our 
enemies to use it as an argument 
whereby churches raise money for 
the purpose of buying little Christ- 
mas presents for "Mormon" chil- 
dren (which they never get), to 
teach them something about Jesus. 

We know that the testimony God 
has given to us concerning the mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith gives us an 
undying testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ, a stronger testimony than is 
possessed by any other religious 
body in the world, a testimony that 
He died for the sins of the world ; 
that He was resurrected — not a 
mythical resurrection, but a tangi- 
ble, literal resurrection from the 
grave, and that we are almost the 
only people who do believe in the 
actual resurrection, the literal res- 
urrection of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ. The rest of them 
have made Him a being that is not 
a being, something without form, 
saying that God is a spirit and that 
a spirit has not flesh and bones, 
that you see Him in the leaves of 
the trees, and in the flowers that 
grow, you feel Him in the atmos- 
phere ; or, in other words that He 
is merely nature, and then they will 
send to hell, and brand as an infidel, 
the person who says the only God is 
Nature, while they only call it by 
another name. Our Savior ap- 
peared to His apostles, and to the 
doubting Thomas He said, "Here, 
Thomas, see the marks of the nails 
in my hands;' here is the mark of 
the spear in my side ; reach hither 
thy hand and thrust it in and see 
that it is I ; a spirit hath not flesh 
and bone as ye see me have." They

do not love to dwell upon that doc- 
trine, but they cover it up with the 
words of John, supposed words of 
John, that God is a Spirit. I do 
not believe that John ever said or 
ever wrote those words. Those 
who know anything about the 
scripture know that when it was 
translated by that great and grand 
congregation that was brought to- 
gether under the influence of King 
James of England, that they did 
their work honestly. The manu- 
scripts they had access to were 
blurred, unreadable in places, and 
where they found that condition 
they decided for themselves what 
words to put in to make it readable, 
and when they came to this manu- 
script that they have translated 
"God is a spirit," the word "God" 
was there, the word "Spirit" was 
there, but the word "IS" was not 
there, and they ordained that every 
word of their own creation placed 
within the lids of that Bible should 
be so marked — because they were 
honest men — should be so marked 
that future generations should have 
the privilege of knowing what they 
did themselves. The words they 
supplied, and those words have 
come down to us marked now in 
italics, to know that they were the 
words of men, that it was a guess, 
and in most instances a good guess. 
Then, when we read John, and 
there we see the little word "is" in 
italics, making it read "God is a. 



spirit, we know it to be man-made. 
The reason John did not, in my es- 
timation, put it that way is because 
he was there when Christ appeared 
before him, when he heard the 
Savior say, "See, it is I ; see the 
marks in my hands, and see the 
mark of the Roman spear in my 
side ; it is I, with flesh and bones ; a 
spirit has not flesh and bones as 
you see me have." God bless you. 
Amen. 

PKESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I do not think that President 
Rich will take any exception to a 
remark that I would like to make in 
connection with John's reference to 
the Lord, or to God being a spirit. 
I think the fact is that even a man 
and, a very ordinary man, is a 
spirit ; and if you want any evi- 
dence of it, just remove his spirit 
and look at what remains. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Daniel G. Miller. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Saturday, April 5th, 1913. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, 
April 5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come let us anew our journey pursue, 
Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master 
appear. 

Pis adorable will let us gladly fulfil, 
And our talents improve, 
By the patience of hope and the labor 
of love. 

Prayer was offered by Elder John 
W. Hart. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
How I*ve longed to vour bosom to 

flee. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Satisfying comparison of "Mormonism" 
with all other religious bodies. — Saints 
should manifest appreciation of the 
Gospel by living according to its prin- 
ciples. — The righteous will veritably 
inherit the earth. — Profitable lessons 
may be derived from calamities. 

I esteem it a privilege, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to be here on this 
occasion when much of the strength 
of Israel is assembled in general 
conference. For several days I have 
been looking forward to this gath- 
ering. I have thought of the class 
of people who would be present 
upon this occasion, and have com- 
pared the lives of the members of 



the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints with those of our 
friends who are not of our faith, 
many of whom I have had the pleas- 
ure of meeting in the last few 
months, and the comparison is fav- 
orable to us from almost every view- 
point. The conclusion is irresisti- 
ble that "Mormonism" has done 
much for us in four generations. 
The gospel, with the blessings of 
the Priesthood, is priceless, and for 
it we ought to be a grateful people. 
The teachings that come with au- 
thority, which plant in our hearts 
faith in God that cause us to feel 
that we know of a surety that He 
lives, are beyond price. 

We meet very many good men 
and women in the world, who have 
high ideals and are striving from 
their viewpoint to do good, and oc- 
casionally we find them with an un- 
derstanding of religion similar to 
what we have ; but there are few 
who have a satisfactory assurance 
that this life is a part of our Heav- 
enly Father's plan for the develop- 
ment of His children, and that the 
truths we acquire here will remain 
with us in eternity. Surely we ought 
to appreciate the knowledge that the 
gospel brings, and we should evi- 
dence our gratitude by living up to 
the light of truth and teaching it to 
others. "Mormonism," so-called, is 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, conse- 
quently it is the power of God unto 
salvation to all those who believe 
and obey its teachings. It is not 
those who say "Lord, Lord," who 
enjoy the companionship of His

spirit but those who do His will. If 
we are not more perfect in our lives, 
if we are not more righteous than 
those who are not of our faith we 
will be behind them in receiving the 
blessings of our Heavenly Father ; 
but if we obey His commandments, 
if we keep ourselves clean, pure and 
unspotted from the sins of the 
world, His power will rest upon us, 
and the vitrues of the third and 
fourth generations of the Church 
will be builded upon by following 
generations, and the purity of their 
lives will establish a race that will 
people the earth. 

It is this that impresses me. We 
should not feel anxious about our 
political power ; nor should we feel 
concerned about our worldly posses- 
sions, but remember this admoni- 
tion, "Seek ye first the kingdom of 
God and His righteousness and all 
other things will be added." It is 
to this point that I direct your at- 
tention today. If the Latter-day 
Saints will keep the commandments 
of God, they will be happy, if they 
will keep themselves pure and un- 
spotted from the sins of the world, 
"Mormonism," so-called, will re- 
deem the earth by right of its supe- 
riority, and by reason of the perfec- 
tion of its manhood and woman- 
hood. While those who are selfishly 
.devoting themselves to the ammass- 
ing of wealth and the seeking of 
high positions, ignoring or violating 
the natural laws of God in their 
pursuit of pleasure, sowing the 
seeds of dissolution by allowing 
their baser passions to rule them, 
will not only be unhappy but will 
wither and pass away, and a race 
more worthy will inhabit God's 
footstool. 

My brethren and sisters, it is not 
a matter of concern to me what will 
be the outcome of this work, but it 



is this : keep yourselves clean and 
pure and you shall inherit the earth, 
for your Heavenly Father has or- 
dained that it will be so. Let your 
light so shine that the purity of 
your lives will evidence your faith 
in the gospel of our Lord. Let us 
bear witness in our daily acts, as 
well as in our conversation, that we 
believe this is the Father's work and 
joy inexpressible will come to us, 
and the children that grow up in our 
• homes will increase in faith and hu- 
mility. They will be added upon, 
and be given power to turn aside 
the shafts of the adversary that are 
directed towards them, and in place 
of the distress that has afflicted 
the children of men, because of sin- 
fulness, there will be comfort, peace 
and happiness, and a race of men 
and women will inhabit this earth 
who will have strength of character 
to put aside the evils of life, by rea- 
son of their birthright. 

God grant that we may be worthy 
of our birthright ; grant that we 
may be worthy of the blessings that 
He places within our reach ; grant 
that day by day we may say within 
our souls, "Father, show me Thy 
will, and I will perform the labor." 
If this be our desire, if this is what 
we live for, then will our children 
be lifted up to higher ground upon 
which they may build, and from 
generation to generation there will 
develop a stronger race of people — 
a people who can draw ever nearer 
to our Father in Heaven. These 
things appeal to me, my brethren 
and sisters ; it is a natural condition 
and I am grateful for the hope that 
they inspire in my bosom. I am 
grateful for the purity of the lives 
of the men and women who belong 
to the Church of our Lord, and I 
am thankful that throughout the 
world there are those who, seeing

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the effect of a sinful life, are striv- 
ing in earnestness to avoid its ter- 
rors, and who encourage others to 
do likewise. They are indeed pre- 
paring for Eternal life. 

Now may the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters ; may His peace 
be in your hearts and may His light 
illumine your pathway, that day by 
day you may know the way He 
would have you go. May each of 
us, in our prayers and in our lives, 
sustain the men whom God has 
chosen to preside over and direct us, 
thereby serving Him who was the 
Redeemer of the world. May His 
Spirit and blessings be upon all 
Israel and may the prayers of the 
Latter-day Saints ascend on high 
that the hearts of men may turn 
from the evils of this life ; that they 
may desire to turn unto God and 
keep His commandments. May the 
lessons that we learn by reason of 
the havoc that is wrought by the 
elements in commotion in this 
world, from time to time, be lessons 
that shall turn our hearts heaven- 
ward, and that will make us kinder 
and more charitable toward our fel- 
low men. 

I pray that the man who stands 
at our head may have his strength 
continued unto him ; that he may 
live in the future, as he has in the 
past, in the favor of our Father in 
Heaven. I pray that he and his 
counselors may be inspired of the 
Lord, and physical strength and 
power given to them to perform 
their great and arduous labors, and 
discharge their duties in the cause 
of the children of men. God bless 
them forever is the prayer of my 
heart ; and God bless all Israel, and 
all men and women everywhere 
who strive to do right and do good 
to their fellows, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I have been very much pleased, 
my brethren and sisters, in the ses- 
sions of this conference that have 
foeen held, in listening to the re- 
marks of my brethren. I was es- 
pecially pleased with the remarks 
made by President Smith yesterday 
morning, for the reason that, to me, 
it was the same as any command- 
ment or section in the book of Cov- 
enants ; I regard is as the voice of 
the Lord unto the people. It covered 
a point that has been of vital im- 
portance to me, in the short period 
of time that I have labored in the 
ministry, for without that principle 
of loyalty and fidelity to the cause 
here upon the earth, there would be 
absolute failure. 

The missionary in the field who 
does not put his heart into the work, 
and who does not sustain his mis- 
sionary companions, by his faith 
and prayers and actions, and his 
conference and mission presidents, 
does not make a success of his work, 
and does not carry with him that 
power and spirit of stability that 
goes with the man who has in his 
heart an unyielding determination 
to serve God, and labor earnestly 
for the children of men. In my 
mind the principle of loyalty is one 
of the greatest that the Lord has 
implanted in the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men. In any capacity where 
men may be called to labor, the man 
who works with unyielding deter- 
mination to succeed will surely do 
so and if he manifests that charac- 
teristic in the work of the Lord, as 
he probably will, success is sure to 
follow. 

We pray and labor for the suc- 
cess of this work, and we pray for 
our fellow men. We pray for the 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION.

leaders of nations and for men of in- 
fluence, that their hearts may be 
softened towards this work, that 
they may kindly receive the elders 
who are sent to them, and that they 
may understand the reason why the 
Lord has sent His messengers to 
the earth again. I believe that the 
Lord' loves His children with a 
greater love than it is possible for 
any father to love his earthly chil- 
dren. No matter where thev mav 
be, in any land or clime in this 
earth, all are the children of God, 
and His love embraces them, even 
as the sun shines alike on all. As 
the Lord said, while in the earth, 
that His mission was not to the 
whole but to those who needed the 
physician: "I am not come to call 
the righteous but sinners to repent- 
ance." For that reason He has 
again visited the earth and revealed 
the true gospel of salvation to Jos- 
eph Smith, and placed the people of 
this world upon a' new basis. 

In times past, the mention of Jos- 
eph Smith's name has almost been, 
in some places at any rate, sufficient 
to arouse a mob, to day it is safe to 
stand upon any corner in any city 
in the United States and preach the 
gospel the Lord has revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Joseph Smith's name is now held 
among the children of men in great- 
er reverence than ever before, be- 
cause of the unyielding truth, spirit 
of loyalty that has characterized the 
Latter-day Saints from the very 
beginning. Through the men who 
devoted their lives to the testimony 
of Jesus, who labored deligently and 
established churches and branches 
throughout the countrty, where 
ever they were sent, there has been 
erected in this land of ours, in the 
valleys of the mountains, a monu- 
ment" of faith. Here we are in 



large numbers, in strength and 
power, having many of the gifts 
and blessings of heaven that the 
world does not realize or know of. 
We ought to be willing at all times 
to respond to any call that is made 
upon us to assist in the establish- 
ment of God's purposes in the earth. 
Take away from a Latter-day Saint 
the gospel, if you could, and nothing 
of real worth remains. 

No man ever apostatized from 
this church and gospel, who had a 
knowledge of it, who could ever 
truthfully deny that it was the 
church of God. Whenever I have 
listened to them, I have noticed they 
shield that part of it all they pos- 
sibly can, and they work along lines 
of persecution and try to destroy 
what the Lord builds up. Brigham 
Young once said — so I am informed 
— that you cannot hurt Mormonism 
it is like a rubber ball ; every time 
you kick it the farther it goes. It 
is my experience, and is history, 
that where men persecute the 
church, or the principles of it, and 
those who preside in Israel, they 
often make friends for the Latter- 
day Saints ; I tell you, honest men 
are looking for the truth every- 
where. Men and women throughout 
this land will yield obedience unto 
the gospel of the Redeemer of the 
world in their day and time, and that 
time comes to them when they seek 
for light of our Father in heaven 
and as a result of their faithfulness. 
The Spirit of the Lord is in the 
earth among thousands of men and 
women who are good and true, ac- 
cording to the light that is within 
them, and when they become so well 
acquainted with the principles of 
truth that they are able to discern 
truth from error, they will yield 
obedience unto the gospel of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

G E N E RA L CON FE K 11 A CIl 



- People are not looking', not many 
of them at any rate for the gospel 
to come through the "Mormon" 
church ; they think that it will come 
from some other source. Those 
people who were looking- for the 
Christ in His day expected Him to 
come in pomp and display. They 
never looked for Him to come in 
the manner that He did. They were 
not prepared for Him. and so they 
were easily led astray by that evil 
power which was opposed to Him 
from the beginning, and their faith 
and confidence was destroyed in the 
hearts of the children of men. 

We pray for the success of this 
work, and unless we also work to 
that end, my brethren and sisters, 
we shall not have success. The man 
that comes into the mission field 
such as that wherein I am more 
closely assocated at the present time 
with the work of the Lord, and who 
in his heart firfhly resolves to carry 
the gospel message into the homes 
of the people, receives power from 
God that is not enjoyed by the sons 
of men outside of that work. He 
appears among his fellows and is 
kindly received by the honest among 
them for the truths that he teaches, 
and which the Lord is the author 
of. God gives unto us all, the power 
and blessing that we have ever re- 
ceived in this life. 

Here at home, in this land of ours 
that has been prepared by the Al- 
mighty to sustain this great people, 
here are men and women who are 
qualified to preach the gospel to 
those who are in darkness. Our 
fathers and mothers laid the foun- 
dation for this great commonwealth. 
They gave their lives for the testi- 
mony of Jesus, and for the perman- 
ant establishment of this com- 
munity. Thejjr wished 'for 'peace 
and prosperity, and worked early 



and late for it. They had to work 
hard in order to secure a livelihood, 
but today it is a much different pro- 
position. It may be said that the 
youth of Zion have never seen a day, 
or have never had a dream that 
would give unto them an idea of the 
sufferings of our fathers and moth- 
ers that paid the price for the 
pleasure we now enjoy here. 

We young men and women ought 
to yield absolute obedience to the 
gospel of the Redeemer of the 
world. A man in his ward ought 
to hold up the hands of his bishop, 
and faithfully perform his church 
duties, that his bishop and stake 
president may know that he is re- 
liable and true. In all my experi- 
ence, I have never learned to love 
men like I have those who have 
proven themselves loyal and true, 
men you could rely upon to perform 
the work they were called to do, that 
would go from you alone hundreds 
of miles and do their duty, men who 
would stand for right and truth, 
for liberty and justice. Such men 
would stand for the gospel, and for 
those who preside over them, and 
when others criticise the leaders of 
the church they were ever ready to 
defend them. They would never 
sit down and listen to any man, de- 
fame or say things that were un- 
true concerning the Church of Jesus 
Christ, or the Latter-day Saints. 

This people are greatly blessed 
in having men at the head of the 
church to-day who have been with 
the church practically from its in- 
ception, who know the ins and oute 
of the past, who can correct error, 
and who can say from their own 
experience, I know thus and so. 
There will come a time when men 
who have known the prophets Jos- 
eph and Hyrum personally shall no 
longer be among us. We shall only 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

have the testimonies of men who 
have known those who were ac- 
quainted with those prophets, but 
who did not have the privilege of 
seeing themselves. So I feel that 
I am blessed in the fact that our 
Father in heaven has permitted me 
to know men and women who can 
speak to me in the flesh and say, "I 
knew Joseph Smith ; I have seen 
him, and I give you my testimony 
that he lived, and that he told 'me 
that he received a visitation from 
the Father and the Son, that he re- 
ceived messages from angels, and 
that he associated with other 
heavenly beings." I tell you, my 
brethren and sisters, these facts 
shall be matters of history in just 
a few short years. When we realize 
and know what it means to talk face 
to face with a man, and then merely 
have the testimony from one who 
has seen that man, there is no com- 
parison. 

I feel to praise the Lord, and to 
love the Lord's work here upon the 
earth, and to labor, whether at home 
or abroad, for the purposes of the 
Lord, as well as I can. To a man 
who thinks that it is an easy thing 
to go in the mission field and stay for 
a number of years, and leave home 
and friends and all behind you, let 
him who thinks that it is an easy 
thing try it. Let him who believes 
that it is easy to take the part of one 
of these brethren of the general au- 
thorities, who I know labor earn- 
estly proclaiming their testimony of 
the truth, for no earthly reward, 
but because they have been called 
to that labor through a servant of 
the Lord, let them try it. The men 
who have the privilege of laboring 
at home and of acquiring the things 
of this earth that give pleasure, 
who think they are not in a posi- 
tion to go into the world on ac- 



count of their occupation, let them 
leave their affairs and go on a mis- 
sion, and I tell you, they will soon 
cheerfully (hold up the hands of 
these men and women who preside 
in Israel, from President Smith 
down to the least of these author- 
ities, they will sustain them in any 
position in the church, abroad or 
at home. 

That is the principle that makes 
us strong. This is the word of the 
Lord unto me as it came from the 
President yesterday morning, and 
I rejoice in it, and I shall rejoice in 
reading it, for it is true doctrine, 
and it is worthy the consideration 
of all Israel as a guide unto us in 
this day in which we live. The Lord 
bless you. Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, you who 
are before me were not converted 
through the wisdom nor learning 
of men, and it would be impossible 
for me to foist upon you any of the 
vain philosophy of men ; if I should 
attempt it, you who have been in 
the Church for years would easily 
discover that it is of man, for you 
have been founded upon the rock 
of revelation. Our Father has giv- 
en you a testimony for yourselves, 
and you know. In standing before 
you I do so with fear and trembling, 
least I may not be an instrument in 
the hands of God to impart unto 
you the bread of life. 

I rejoice in the testimony that 
our Father has given me concern- 
ing this great work, the work that 
has been established in the earth for 
the salvation of mankind. It is mv 
experience, in traveling in the 
world, that this work has grown

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in importance a thousand times 
more than is represented by the 
number that have been baptized into 
the Church. The principles of 
truth that were revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, have 
influenced the people of the whole 
earth, they are "leavening the whole 
lump," and the members of the re- 
ligious world today are beginning" 
to inquire concerning this greater 
light that has been restored to the 
earth. Not long since, Dr. Henry 
Sloan Coffin, one of the prominent 
Presbyterians of New England, de- 
clared in one of his sermons that 
they did not consider any of the 
churches of the world as divine, 
or their organizations divinely ap- 
pointed, he said Presbyterians were 
doing, as a church, more than any 
other Christian denomination to 
bring about a church union, and 
if that could be brought about, or if 
thev could have the organization 
that they desired, it would be more 
efficient and do away with much of 
the overlapping of their work, and 
would bring about a greater mis- 
sionary force in the earth, a mis- 
sionary work that would bring 
all the members of the churches 
under the influence of the Spirit 
of God. He said that they were 
ready to serve under any or- 
ganization that worked better 
than their own. Now. while they 
have not discovered th^t organiza- 
tion, it is in the earth to day. God 
our Father has placed it here, and 
they will some day discover 
that its influence and power have 
been felt even in their own organi- 
zations. 

The Lord Jesus said to » His dis- 
ciples on one occasion, after tell- 
ing them that He was the vine and 
thev were the branches, and that 
thev should abide in Him in order 



to bring forth fruit to the glory 
of the Father: "Ye have not 
chosen me but I have chosen 
you and ordained you and sent you 
forth that you might bring forth 
fruit." Following that He told 
them to love one another as He had 
loved them, and as He had loved 
the Father. In talking to a Sec- 
tarian minister the other day, on 
the train, who has been in Utah a 
long time, I said, "My brother, the 
reason you have not been success- 
ful in the state of Utah, even 
among the wayward of the chil- 
dren of the Latter-day Saints, is 
because you have not sufficiently 
followed the admonition of the 
Lord Jesus to love the souls of men. 
The majority of the ministers who 
come here to convert the Mormon 
people, and lead them to acknowl- 
edge the God that they worship, 
have never had love for us in 
their hearts. They have sought for 
thorns and briers, and information 
to be taken back into the world and 
used for the collecting of mon- 
ey to Christianize the 'Mormons.' " 
He replied, "I tell you, Mr. 
Ellsworth, that is too true, some 
ministers have not had sufficient 
love in their hearts for the souls 
of the people who dwell in these 
valleys." 

It is the experience of the elders 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, w 7 ho have gone 
to the world, that they must have a 
love for the souls of men in their 
hearts before they can do real mis- 
sionary work ; they must forget in 
part, or rather learn that they have' 
not left in their mountain homes all 
that is near and. dear to them, but 
that the honest in heart everywhere 
should also be near and dear to the 
soul of the true missionary. We 
must love them, and show that we 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



35 



are truly interested in them, and 
that we have their welfare at heart, 
before we can really do successful 
missionary work. Where this feel- 
ing exists, the spirit and the power 
of God rests upon the elders, and 
the honest soul discovers in them 
the divinely appointed shepherd. 

This is my testimony, that Jesus 
gathered together His disciples and 
organized His Church, and that men 
were divinely appointed to preach 
the gospel and represent the Lord 
Jesus. That organization contin- 
ued until, through the wickedness 
of men it was done away with. 
Since then, only tradition has been 
handed clown to guide the Christian 
world. But, in this age. the Lord 
Jesus, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, has again sent the Priest- 
hood with a divine appointment, and 
commission to the world. A divinelv 
appointed organization has been 
re-established in the earth, it is in 
perfect working order, and the 
men and women who receive 
the truth have a mission to 
proclaim Christ and Him cruci- 
fied, and to show to the world, 
through their righteousness, and by 
the sweet influence they have, that 
they are indeed born of God, and 
have the light that will lead men 
back into the kingdom of our Fath- 
er. The Latter-day Saints have re- 
ceived this divine authority and or- 
ganization. Upon their shoulders 
rests the mission to preach Christ 
and Him crucified. The doctor, the 
lawyer, the farmer, the carpenter, 
the blacksmith, and men of every 
other vocation in life among the 
Latter-dav Saints are missionaries. 
It is our duty to teach the people of 
the world that the organization that 
thev are seeking after today is in the 
earth, an organization that bringsin 
touch every one of its members with 



God and Christ. There is no over- 
lapping nor crowding for place but 
a place for every man in the divinely 
appointed organization. 

I am thankful that it has been my 
lot to be a Latter-day Saint from 
my birth, that my father and my 
grandfather were members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ. They were 
converted, not by the wisdom of 
men, neither "by the learning of the 
world, but by a revelation from God 
My feet have been plant- 
ed upon that rock, and I know 
for my self that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that the 
Church of God has been established 
among men. It has been established 
with apostles and prophets, seven- 
ties and elders, priests, teachers and 
deacons. They have a divinely ap- 
pointed mission in the earth. Every 
man throughout the world who will 
hear their testimony, and receive 
it in their hearts, may have a part 
of that ministry, and feel God's 
spirit in them, from the crown 
of their heads to the soles 
of their feet, and learn to know 
God, and' feel His influence by 
working for the salvation of their 
fellow men. The man-made minis- 
ters preach for monev. and divine 
for It ire ; there are but few of them 
working unselfishly for the uplift of 
mankind. Their organizations have 
not the power to bring men and wo- 
men in touch with God. Jesus has 
not chosen them, neither ordained 
them. They cannot bring forth fruit 
because they have not followed the 
doctrine of Christ. In the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
dav Saints every man, from the 
greatest to the least, has a right to 
the revelations of God for his guid- 
ance. God can bless the hon- 
est in heart through the ministry 
of His humblest servant even

though his language may be falt- 
ering, and his logic poor. If, from 
the time the light of God has come 
into the life of a man, he will mag- 
nify the priesthood, and honor the 
priesthood in others, the Lord will 
magnify him before the world, and 
honest hearted men and women will 
raise up and bless his name, and 
praise God that he came jwithin 
their circle. 

May God bless us, my brethren 
and sisters, and help the Latter-day 
Saints to honor the divinely ap- 
pointed men that our Father has 
placed in the earth. Let us re- 
joice that we are associated with 
the divine organization that gives 
every man and woman a chance 
to receive an experience under the 
influence and power of God. May 
we honor the priesthood, and all 
men who bear it, and in the end be 
prepared, by the experience that we 
have received in the Church, to as- 
sociate with God and Christ, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I have pleasure in saying that the 
brethren who addressed us yester- 
day afternoon and this morning so 
far, are the presidents of the various 
missions, the Eastern and Southern 
States, the Northwestern States, the 
Northern States, and the Central 
States missions. Brother Herrick, 
who is the president of the Western 
States Mission, is absent today at- 
tending the funeral of one of his 
brothers. Brother Rev Pratt, the 
president of the Spanish Mission, is 
not present. 

"I will go where you want me to 
go," a tenor solo, was rendered by 
Elder Melvin J. Ballard. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 

(President of Summit Stake.) 

How do you do? I am glad to 
meet you. You all look good to 
me. 

I am going to tell you the part 
of President Smith's talk yesterday 
that made a great impression on me. 
It was that we should talk about 
the good things, and not all the 
time be talking about evil things. 
You know some people think it is 
a virtue to be sick. I met President 
Duckworth yesterday with a big 
rag around his neck and told him 
to take it off, it was a sign he was 
weak, and we want people to look 
beautiful and strong. I believe in 
people looking beautiful, and fixing 
themselves up. I often think of my 
father. You know he filled many 
missions in the world, and met 
many great men and many rich 
men, among others he met Baron 
Rothschild. One time Rothschild 
was traveling around the world and 
he came to Salt Lake City. Father 
was just about as poor at that time 
as he ever was in his life, but he 
had an old carriage and he got the 
boys out and we had to polish it 
and fix it up just as good as we 
could. He bought thirty cents 
worth of oil to black the harness, 
and we blacked the harness and 
worked at the old carriage and har- 
ness for about a day. Finally Baron 
Rothschild called on him. Father 
had a big black cloak and a silk hat 
that he had got in France. He had 
them cleaned and fixed up, and 
when he and the Baron walked out 
of the house to the carriage father 
looked better to me than Baron 
Rothschild. (Laughter.) 

Now, I believe in appreciating 
what you have got. I believe in 
seeing the good in all men. Out in 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 



37 



the stake where I live they say that 
everybody looks good to me, and 
they do. We have got the finest lot 
of Saints out there you ever saw. I 
like such songs as "Count Your 
Many Blessings," and I want to re- 
late this on myself. I went home 
from here one day, got up early in 
the morning, and thought, Now I 
am going to count my blessings, and 
began to count them, and began to 
think : I have about fifty chickens 
at home and every one of them is 
trying to lay an egg today; I have 
got some pigs, and "it seems like I 
can't get rid of them, they increase 
so fast ; I have some cows and they 
are increasing in number, and 
horses, and everything that I pos- 
sess the Lord is blessing, including 
a large family of children. Then I 
began to think of how I have been 
blessed in the Church, that I had 
been called upon to preside over one 
of the best stakes in all the Church, 
and live among the best people, and 
I began thinking of one blessing 
after another, and the first thing I 
knew I was home walking in the 
house, and when I entered, one of 
the children, (one of the blessings), 
had done something that displeased 
Sister Taylor, and she told me about 
it, and I started to laugh and said, 
"From the sublime to the ridiculous, 
I have been counting my blessings." 
Then she laughed, we both laughed, 
and we began to count our blessings 
together. 

Now, I believe absolutely in sus- 
taining the authorities of the 
Church. I believe in doing what the 
Priesthood tells me, whether I like 
it or not. I never set my judgment 
up against the authorities of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
dav Saints. It is good enough for 
me and by following their counsel 
I have never failed. I believe in 



saving men. Don't believe in going 
around from house to house speak- 
ing of the ills of my neighbor. I 
had an experience recently. I had 
to go out and visit a large ranch 
with a man. When he went into the 
band of horses that we were looking 
at, "Why," he said, "just look at 
that beautiful stallion. I never saw 
a finer stallion in my life." Then he 
went over and looked at a beautiful 
mare ,and then another one, all the 
time seeing the beautiful. The ranch 
owner who was selling the horses 
and his men were perfectly happy, 
and the man himself who was seeing 
the beautiful things was happy. I 
went out a few days later with an- 
other man into the same band of 
horses. He did not see that stallion, 
he did not see those beautiful ani- 
mals, ' but went around and found 
one horse with a crooked foot, and 
another one with a spavin. There 
were one hundred fifty head of the 
most beautiful horses I have seen 
in my life, but those two were all 
that he had seen and all he talked 
about, and everybody on. the ranch 
was unhappy till he got off it. 
Everybody loved the first man, but 
the other man went away without 
anybody loving him. 

The missionaries were talking 
about the man that speaks the good 
all the time. He is the successful 
missionary. The missionary that 
goes out into the world and begins 
to tear down the beliefs of others, 
trying to destroy everything, does 
not convert anybody. You have got 
to make friends before you can con- 
vert people, and it is a very great 
blessing, my brethren and sisters, to 
see the good and to count the things 
that you have got as blessings from 
the Lord. Now may the peace and 
blessing of heaven be with us, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOSEPH R. MTJRDOCK. 

(President of Wasatch Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is rath- 
er a surprise to me to be called to 
address you this morning. I think 
that I am probably not quite so ex- 
perienced in talking to so many 
of my brethren and sisters as 
Brother Moses Taylor. I have felt 
perfectly satisfied in the past in 
listening to the testimonies of my 
brethren, and my heart certainly 
felt in tune with the remarks that 
were made by them during this con- 
ference, when they referred to the 
fact that their parents and grand- 
parents were members of the 
Church. I felt to say in my heart, 
thank God I can make the . same 
statement. 

I have taken pride, many times, 
in referring to the fact that my 
mother walked across the plains to 
these valleys of the mountains, and 
I feel that I shall never forget her 
faith and endurance; and that my 
father, when thirteen years of age. 
drove a wagon and some cows and 
horses across the plains. I am proud 
of that, and of the fact that their 
fathers and mothers, my grand- 
parents, had received the gospel in 
the eastern states, and I rejoice in 
it. I have rejoiced in the gospel 
from the time that I first began to 
understand it, at eight years of age, 
and I have had testimony repeat- 
edly, from that time till the present, 
that the Lord hears and answers my 
prayers and the prayers of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I have had no oc- 
casion to find fault with the auth- 
orities. They always placed so 
much good before me and never 
any evil that I know of, that I have 
felt perfectly satisfied with their 
teachings. When things have come 



up that I did not understand I have 
said in my heart, I will wait till I 
learn all about what I have been 
told before I begin to take exceep- 
tions to things I have not yet 
learned. It has only required a little 
time to make me fully understand, 
and appreciate, that all that has been 
advanced by those whom the Lord 
has placed in charge of His great 
work, in this dispensation, was for 
the interests of Zion, and for the up- 
lifting of the work of our Father 
in this dispensation. 

I rejoiced in hearing the testi- 
mony of Brother Taylor about his 
good stake of Zion. I don't doubt 
it, it joins ours, therefore it could 
not be otherwise than good. My 
stake is about 5500 feet above sea 
level ,and his is only 400 or 500 feet 
lower elevation. That accounts for 
it, perhaps, the higher you get the 
better it is. (laughter.) The Lat- 
ter-day Saints of the Wasatch 
Stake of Zion are striving to serve 
the Lord, and mind their own busi- 
ness. I want to say, for the credit 
of those who do not belong to the 
Church, who live in that stake of 
Zion, they are perfectly willing we 
should do so, and they are not nor 
have not been putting any obstacles 
in our way, nor trying to inter- 
fere with us from serving the Lord 
as we understand : t, and there is 
harmony existing between us. Those 
who are members of the Church and 
those who are not. We are attend- 
ing to Religion Class work in that 
stake of Zion, and no one is trying 
to prevent us. Our Religion Class- 
es are as well attended as our Sun- 
day Schools, and we are accomp- 
lishing a good work. We do not 
think there was any mistake made 
when the Religion Class work was 
started. Some of our schools are 
holding more than one session a 



ELDER JOSEPH R.MURDOCK. 



39 



week. I have heard class teachers 
testify, in metings of the Religion 
Class workers, that they would not 
want to teach school unless they 
could do so in some place where 
they would be allowed to teach Re- 
ligion Classes after school hours. 
Well, we are willing they should do 
so, and there is no one up there that 
is objecting to it, and we hope they 
won't. 

We are striving to serve the 
Lord, and to obey the teachings of 
His servants, and keep in harmony 
with the instruction that we receive 
from time to time. While we are 
pretty wejl elevated as before stat- 
ed, we are not trying to take advan- 
tage of the situation and dictate af- 
fairs to our brethren and sisters. We 
are willing to let all of the other 
stakes alone, and follow their own 
inclinations, and the counsels which 
they receive. It takes us all our time 
to attend to the work that we have, 
and follow out the teachings that 
are imparted unto us from time to 
time in our conferences, and in the 
general conferences of the Church. 
Zion is growing in the Wasatch 
Stake of Zion, and the work of the 
Lord is increasing, and faith in the 
hearts of the people, and harmony 
between the people and those who 
preside. We feel that the Lord is 
with us as He is with His Saints 
throughout the length of the earth. 

My earnest prayer is that Zion 
will continue to prosper, for I know 
the gospel is true; I know that it 
will "bring peace, happiness and con- 
tentment unto the children of men 
everywhere throughout the land if 
they will only accept it. I pray that 
truth may spread abroad from city 
to city, from state to state, and from 
nation to nation. 7 fully appreciate 
the fact that this nation has an im- 



portant work to perform in the 
world. It has accomplished a great 
amount of good already, and I be- 
lieve it is only the beginning of 
what this great nation will do. It 
is the greatest nation and the best 
country on earth, and the best men 
have ruled the nation. We do not 
want any better than those who 
have - occupied those positions from 
time to time. The Lord gives us 
the best as occasion requires, and 
He will continue to do so and will 
inspire the great men of the nation 
with the love of freedom and the 
rights of humanity throughout the 
earth, and this nation will seek to 
protect the rights of other nations 
and influence them in the lines of 
liberty, and open up the way that 
the gospel may eventually go forth 
throughout all the world, as it has 
spread in this nation, without hin- 
drance, with no one to prevent it. 
This people have a great work to d5 
in connection with this nation, be- 
cause we have the truth. We have 
the gospel which God has revealed, 
and, though it may be crushed for a 
time, it will arise and Zion will 
shine, and thousands in the nations 
of the earth will understand the fact 
that the once despised handful of 
people in the Rock}' Mountains 
have the truth, and they are teach- 
ing the truth, and they have pure 
minded men and women who are 
defending it, whose example is wor- 
thy of the imitation of any people 
upon earth. 

I pray that God will bless this 
people, that their course and ex- 
ample in life may continue to be 
exemplary, and that their children 
may be well taken care of and 
brought up under the teachings of 
the gospel, and possess the spirit of 
our fathers and mothers who ac- 



40 



G EX URAL CONFERENCE. 



ccpted the truth and went through 
many trials and hardships for the 
gospel's sake, that we may carry 
it on from generation to generation, 
spreading the gospel abroad until 
the people of the earth will enjoy 
the blessings that the Latter-day 
Saints enjoy. I feel in my heart 
that there is no other people, no 
other place on earth where there is 
more of the spirit of freedom in 
the hearts of the people, and con- 
tentment and satisfaction that the 
Lord is on their side. The Lord is 
with them and the Lord hears and 
answers their prayers and they en- 
joy it with thanksgiving. It is the 
blessing which we would like to 
have all people partake of. We are 
not selfish. We send our elders out 
by the thousands and invite all of 
those who will come to come and 
partake of the waters of life and re- 
ceive a testimony of the gospel, that 
God lives, that we are the children 
of our Father in heaven, in very 
deed, that we are not a mishap or a 
mischance, and something that they 
know not what, but we are literally 
the offspring of God the Eternal 
Father and we are worth saving and 
worth loking after, as are all of the 
children of men. 

We are the friends of humanity, 
but they do not seem to understand 
it. We would do them good, we 
would inspire them with faith in 
God and with the truth, and to 
teach the truth. We would inspire 
every one on earth with the prin- 
ciples of morality and sobriety and 
honesty, if they would only let us. 
Well, let us continue faithful, my 
brethren and sisters. The Lord has 
this matter in hand, and eventually 
will bring Zion off triumphant, as 
He will all truth, which is my earn-

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

You see we even have gray head- 
ed third generation men — men of 
the third generation who have gone 
gray in the service. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 

(President of Deseret Stake.) 

I sincerely hope, my brethren and 
sisters, that I may be able to par- 
tially calm my fluttering heart, and 
be led for a few moments by the in- 
spiration of the Lord. I have en- 
joyed every moment of the confer- 
ence from the very beginning, and 
I have been able to heartily say 
"Amen" at the conclusion of each 
address in this conference. While 
my brethren were talking of their 
respective stakes, a passage of 
scripture came to my mind : "He 
that exalteth himself shall be 
abased, and he that humbleth him- 
self shall be exalted." The Deseret 
Stake of Zion is down along the 
lowlands of the Sevier River, the 
youngest child in the family of 
stakes, I believe, but she is growing, 
and we expect, after having taken 
that humble position, to have them 
say: Come hither and occupy this 
honorable place. 

I too am glad to be able to bear 
testimony of my father and of my 
mother, of my ancestry, of their 
faithfulness in the kindgom of God, 
and I cherish the hope that I can 
follow faithfully 'the example of 
my parents. I give them first credit 
for having taught me the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and taught it to me so 
faithfully and earnestly that I have 
never been beset with doubts. I 
thank them for. the teaching they 
gave me in reverence, and in rever- 
encing the authorities of the

Church. It was the spirit of my 
father, somewhat like John the 
Baptist when he beheld the Sav- 
ior aproaching, when he said. "Be- 
hold the Lamb of God that taketh 
away the sins of the world." In my 
father's home, when the authorities 
of the Church visited us, we rever- 
ently looked upon them as men of 
God. I thank the Lord that that 
spirit has remained with me unto 
this day ; that I reverence my breth- 
ren as men of God, for I never have 
yet received in all my life any teach- 
ing from any of the authorities of 
this Church that has not been for 
my good. 

I thank the Lord for a gospel 
which puts restraint upon me, which 
demands of me that I keep my- 
self free from the sins of the world ; 
which demands of me that I take 
care of my tabernacle, that it shall 
not be defiled with liquor nor with 
tobacco, nor with tea nor with cof- 
fee ; which demands of me that I 
shall not blaspheme, that I cannot 
excuse myself if I become angry 
and take the name of God in vain, 
that I shall reverence the name of 
the Lord, and never speak it only 
in devotion and in the deepest rev- 
erence. I thank the Lord that the 
gospel demands of me that I shall 
not wrap myself up in selfishness, 
but that I shall give, that I shall 
give in tithes and in donations, that 
I shall impart unto my fellow men, 
and for the work of the Lord. I 
thank the Lord that the gospel de- 
mands of me that I shall not be so 
selfish that when I have a truth I 
shall keep that truth to myself, but 
that it is my privilege and my duty 
to bear testimony of this to those 
who know not of this restored gos- 
pel. I thank the Lord that I am 
associated as I am with the people 
who serve the Lord. I hope and 



believe that our people do so live 
that the stranger who comes among 
us — and strangers are multiplying 
in our midst — that they discover, as 
they associate with us, that it is no 
idle statement when we say that we 
believe in being honest, chaste, vir- 
tuous, benevolent, and in doing good 
unto all men. 

I thank the Lord that this spirit 
that has come down to me from mv 
father has also made itself mani- 
fest in our children, and I hope that 
I will not be charged with speaking 
in any personal way but only as all 
fathers feel, I believe. When we 
came out of a priesthood meeting 
the other day, where a call had been 
made for missionaries, my son a 
young man but eighteen years of 
age, when I came home said, "Papa 
do you think I am old enough to 
go abroad and proclaim the gospel ? 
I would like to accept that mission." 
My heart was melted with joy when 
that boy made that voluntary offer. 
"I will go abroad and proclaim the 
gospel of Jesus Christ." I said to 
his mother, "Is he old enough, Ma- 
ma? Can we spare him, or will he 
not be more efficient in a year or 
two?" I don't know, right now, 
what I ought to do, but yet I thank 
the Lord for the spirit that promp- 
ted the boy to proffer to go abroad 
and proclaim the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, to feel in his youth that it is 
the truth. I believe that the gospel 
demands of you and me not that we 
wait till our age is advanced and 
then give our service, but that we 
give the strength of our youth, the 
strength of our manhood, the best 
that we possess, all that we have and 
all that we are for the Church and 
kingdom of God. If this gospel 
is anything it is everything to us, 
for the Spirit of God hath borne 
witness to our spirit until we know ; 



G E X E /?> / L CONFERENCE. 



we know we speak the truth when 
we say that God has spoken again 
in this day and age of the world, 
and revealed His everlasting gospel 
for the redemption of the world. 

I thank the Lord that we do not 
have to wait entirely for our re- 
ward in the life to come, but that 
every honest Latter-day Saint who 
serves God and keeps his com- 
mandments receives his reward day 
by day in the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty which comes unto him, and 
in the satisfaction that he receives 
in his soul. Xo man serves God 
that does not feel the influence of 
the Spirit of God, the Spirit testi- 
fying unto his soul that his course 
in life is approved of the Lord. I 
bear testimony that I know that the 
gospel is true. The Lord has re- 
vealed it to me, and I hope and pray 
that I shall live so humbly that this 
testimony shall never leave me. 

I believe that I have discovered, 
and that I know that no man ever 
loses the faith so long as his life 
is in harmony with the requirements 
of the gospel. In our stake of 
Zion, whenever you hear a man 
complain, or a man who has doubts, 
you only have to look around and 
make a little inquiry and you will 
discover that that man has grown 
lax in his duty, or has done that 
which has bereft him of the Spirit 
of the Lord, and then he is affected 
with doubt and fault-finding. I 
said to one of my missionary com- 
panions, one of my associates, after 
a lapse of a few years, "I want to 
speak. to you, my brother. Where 
is the faith, where is the testimony 
that you bore when you first came 
home?" "Oh, Brother Hinckley," 
he said, "it is different with me now. 
I do not have that testimony, I do 
not feel as I did." I said, "Why 
not?" and he answered, "I am 



broader." I said, "Are you broader ? 
'Did you not feel good when you 
bore that testimony?" "Yes." "Was 
it not an honest testimony?" "Yes." 
"Then tell me, brother, answer mc 
a few questions honestly. Are you 
living as you should? Do you re- 
member your prayers? Are you 
observing the Word of Wisdom? 
Do you pay your tithing? Do you 
go to the house of the Lord on the 
Sabbath day and keep it holy, and 
do you worship Him?" "No," he 
replied, "I do not. I do not pray. 
Once in a while I take a cigar. Once 
in a while I drink a little beer," an 1 
he added "You have got too nar- 
row." My brethren and sisters, I 
am pleased to bear this testimony 
to you that, after saying this, per- 
haps three years, that same man 
narrowed in from this, as he called 
it, broad view, he repented, he 
ceased to smoke, ceased to partake 
of the glass of beer, he again sought 
the Lord in prayer, and today he 
bears the testimony which he bore 
when he first came home from his 
mission. 

Our safety is in a life of ser- 
vice, and the danger that comes to 
us is in the first neglect of a small 
duty, which leads to greater neglect 
and finally to the loss of the Spirit 
of God. The Lord bless us, and 
help us to be true and faithful from 
now and henceforth, I pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Mark Austin. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m.

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. 
T. Jack. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning ! 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

ELDER MILTON H. WELLING. 

(President of Bear River Stake.) 

I believe, my brethren and sis- 
ters, some great men have said that 
one-third of an individual's charac- 
ter is formed before he comes into 
the world; that the prenatal influ- 
ences which have gone into the 
building up of his personality have 
predisposed him to certain lines of 
thought and activity, after he has 
been born among the children of 
men. It is said, also, that one-third 
of one's character is due to his own 
self-effort; the things that he ac- 
complishes, or strives to accom- 
plish, go into the making of his 
character ; and that one-third of his 
being is made up from the environ- 
ment with which he is associated 
during his sojourn here upon the 
earth; that men with whom he asso- 
ciates and whom he meets from day 
to day, have some influence in the 



shaping of his character. If that 
doctrine is true, I ought to be at 
least one-third good, because I have 
grown up under the teachings, the 
testimony and the influence of men 
and women of God. As I have lis- 
tened to the testimony and the 
teachings of the servants of God, 
during this conference, I felt that 
every young man in Israel ought to 
feel as I did, that we ought to be 
partly good at any rate, by reason 
of the testimony and teachings that 
come to us from the servants of the 
living God. 

I can never remember the time in 
my life when there was not taught 
to me, at my mother's knee, and 
later on in all of the organiza- 
tions of this Church, to reverence 
and revere the priesthood of the liv- 
ing God. I am glad that I can say 
to you that my parents were mem- 
bers of this Church ; that my grand- 
parents were associate with the or- 
ganization of this Church in the 
very beginning ; that they walked 
and talked and labored with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and with his 
associates, in the beginning of the 
organization of this Church. I can- 
not remember the day when I have 
ever heard one of these progenitors 
of mine speak a disrespectful word 
of one of the leaders of Israel : and 
so I want to say that my training 
predisposes me to accept the testi- 
mony and the teachings of my 
brethren who teach us the word of 
the Lord from day to day, the gen- 
eral authorities of the Church who 
come into our stakes occasionallv 
to give us the word of the Lord, 
and those who preach to us from 
this pulpit during the general con- 
ference of the Church. 

I have heard it said many times, 
by men who are older than I am, 
that we young men of Israel today 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



are living in an especially favored 
dispensation; that we have been 
blessed above our fathers and moth- 
ers who came here, who sought out 
this land and who established this 
empire in the Rocky Mountains. I 
sometimes have doubts in my own 
mind whether or not we are so 
especially favored as they would 
have us believe that we are. My 
father, my grandfather, and my 
grand-mother walked and talked 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith; 
they received his testimony and his 
teachings ; and I don't believe that 
there, was any power in the world 
that could have persuaded them to 
turn against the truths of the gos- 
pel. It is true that we have more 
of book learning, and have greater 
opportunities to study the sciences 
and the arts. It is quite true that 
young men in Israel today are sur- 
rounded by opportunities for intel- 
lectual growth and advancement 
which our parents did not receive ; 
but I want to call attention to the 
fact, this afternoon, that the Proph- 
et of the Lord, seventy and eighty 
years ago was teaching to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, some of the great- 
est truths that have ever been re- 
vealed to the world, before they had 
ever been dreamed of by the men 
who are writing the books of sci- 
ence of the present day. I am not 
so certain but that those men and 
women who received those divine 
truths direct from the testimony 
and teachings of Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet, were in a much better po- 
sition intellectually, as well as in all 
other ways, than are the boys and 
girls who seek to learn those same 
truths today from books that have 
been written. I know of one thing, 
that the testimony of the truth was 
just as strongly in the hearts of our 
parents as we can hope to have it 



in our hearts today. I hope and 
pray that the lives of Latter-day 
Saints today, the lives of young 
men in the Church today, could as 
nearly conform to the teachings of 
the servants of God as did the life 
and character and testimony and 
teaching of our fathers and moth- 
ers, who have preceded us. 

I find that there is a spirit, occa- 
sionally, in the hearts of young peo- 
ple in the Church today, to treat 
lightly some of the things that 
ought to be held very sacred by 
them. I find, occasionally, not fre- 
quently, because I believe I come 
from a section of this Church where', 
men are living their religion quite 
as faithfully and quite as well as the 
average Latter-day Saints ; but I 
find a disposition among some of 
our boys and girls to speak lightly 
of some of the doctrines of the 
Church, to speak lightly of an ap- 
pointment to perform a special mis- 
sion or a special duty in the Church. 
I find in their hearts occasionally, 
as I minister among them, a dispo- 
sition to treat lightly a call to per- 
form a special service for the 
Church among the Latter-day 
Saints today. Now, as I recall the 
history of this Church in the past, 
it was not so when the Prophet of 
the Lord spoke. I remember an 
instance in the history of the 
Church where the Prophet declared 
that the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles should depart for foreign 
lands to open up missions and to 
preach the gospel, and where it ap- 
peared to be a physical impossibil- 
ity, on account of the sickness of 
those men, to accomplish that which 
the Prophet had declared should be 
accomplished; and the enemies of 
this people were gloating over the 
fact that the time had come to prove 
that Joseph Smith was not a proph- 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING .

et of the living God. But the time 
arrived, and when it did arrive, 
these men of God of a former gen- 
eration had gotten up from their 
beds, had left their wives and fam- 
ilies, some of them in very great 
distress, had assembled themselves 
together upon the site of the temple, 
had prayed to the Lord and had 
gone forth in the accomplishment 
of that which the Lord had required 
of them. I wonder some times if 
there is the same spirit of determi- 
nation, the same desire to serve our 
Father in heaven, the same desire 
to go forth in the accomplishment 
of those things which He has for 
men to accomplish today, in the 
hearts of our boys and girls, as 
there was in that day. I very sin- 
cerely hope that it is true. I very 
sincerely believe also that when the 
young men of this Church are put 
to the test, that they will prove 
faithful and true. 

I know that God has established 
this work in the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men. I know that it is true, 
and I know that that same testi- 
mony is lying, sometimes a little 
dormant, but always in the hearts 
of the men and women and young 
people in this Church who are 
striving to live their religion. I be- 
lieve that this Church is a Church 
of service ; that no men can hope to 
succeed, that no woman can hope 
to succeed, that no individual in 
the world will be happy or con- 
tented in the Church unless they 
are devoting themselves to the 
building up and strengthening of 
the Church. That is the way it is 
in our stake of Zion. Those indi- 
viduals that are busy, those who 
are attending to their duties, are 
the individuals who are happy, who 
are contented, who have no fault to 
find with their bishop, who haven't 



any fault to find with the presi- 
dency of the stake, or the general 
authorities of the Church who 
come into our midst to instruct us. 
They have no fault to find with 
their ward teachers ; and I am very 
grateful for the fact that I be- 
lieve there is a revival of the feel- 
ing that there is a necessity for the 
work of teaching among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We find that it is 
so in our stake ; and those wards of 
our stake of Zion where one hun- 
dred per cent of the people are vis- 
ited each month are the wards that 
have no trouble in them, where the 
people are united, and where the 
Latter-day Saints are working to- 
gether unitedly, helpfully, and suc- 
cessfully for the accomplishment of 
the work of God as I believe they 
ever did in the history of this 
Church. But if I find an individual 
who is indifferent, an individual 
who is lukewarm, I soon discover 
that he is not attending his sacra- 
ment meetings, and not attending 
to the duty that the Bishop has 
asked him to perform in the Church. 

Now, I very greatly rejoice in a 
testimony of the truth of this gos- 
pel. It is more priceless to me than 
all the wealth of the world possibly 
could be, and I pray that it may be 
so in the hearts of my brethren and 
sisters ; that we may, during the 
sessions of this conference, receive 
the testimony of these men of God 
who have been called here to act 
as prophets and apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. When we go to 
our homes in the different stakes in 
Zion, I trust we may take home 
their teachings, and let us talk 
about it around the firesides, as our 
parents used to talk about it in the 
generation that is past. I very 
well remember in my boyhood days 
that there was not a subject of 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



more engrossing interest, not a 
subject that would bring together 
the family of my father any more 
interestedly than one in which we 
met together to discuss and talk 
over the teachings of the servants 
of the living God. 

May God help us to be faithful 
and true, as young men in Israel, 
and to accomplish the full purpose 
and destiny of our mission here 
upon the earth, is my prayer for 
each one in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM A- HYDE- 

(President of Pocatello Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
whether or not I shall be able to rise 
to the height of this occasion. I feel 
that the people of my stake are hon- 
ored in the opportunity that is of- 
fered me this afternoon of repre- 
senting them. I have had great 
pleasure in the proceedings of the 
conference thus far. and feel that I 
have had distinct benefit personally; 
that in the remarks that have been 
made there has come to me strength 
and satisfaction that I have needed, 
and I would feel well repaid even 
if at this moment the conference 
were discontinued. T am looking 
now into the faces of several thou- 
sand people with intellects diversi- 
fied, no two individuals perhaps 
thinking along the same lines upon 
ordinary themes, but assembled 
with the one purpose in heart, 
united in one desire to serve the 
Lord and to keep His command- 
ments, and representing, as I be- 
lieve, the strength, purpose, and 
power of latter-day Israel. 

I think that if there is any one 
thing needed to be remembered by 
the Latter-day Saints it is the in- 



junction contained in a passage that 
is to be found in the revelations of 
the Lord, that contains, I believe, 
more than any other statement of 
its length, a key to the lives of the 
Latter-day Saints : "Seek diligent- 
ly, pray always, and be believing, 
and all things shall work together 
for your good, if ye walk uprightly 
and remember the covenant where- 
with ye have covenanted one with 
another." In my opinion that con- 
tains an epitome of wise instruction 
to the Latter-day Saints. We know 
with full assurance that it is our 
duty to seek diligently ; that the 
Lord does not give to him who does 
not seek ; that to every man who 
seeks, the way shall be open ; to him 
who knocks there will come a ready 
answer. The lives of Latter-day 
Saints, the philosophy that they 
have acquired, or have received, has 
made them feel that everything they 
receive is a result of efforts that 
they put forth. It is important that 
irien should pray always, that hearts 
should be constantly uplifting to 
God for His guidance and direction, 
and that in all we do, we should 
seek for the inspiration of His Holy 
Spirit. But, of the three injunc- 
tions, I think this to be not the least, 
that we should be believing. 
Throughout all the generations of 
men. as far as my observation goes, 
I have noticed that one of the great 
stumbling blocks or faults in the 
way of mankind, is lack of ability to 
believe. I am daily in the midst of 
men who come in constant contact 
with the same truths that appeal to 
me, who have had laid before them 
the truths that have convinced me. 
I meet men who are honest, as far 
as I am able to judge, in all their 
dealings and acts with mankind, yet 
they do not always see as I see, or 
think as I think, or believe as I be- 



ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE.

lieve. Nevertheless, I know in my 
' soul that the things I look upon as 
being- the ideals of life, are things 
that will lead me to salvation, and 
that if others would believe them 
they also would be led unto salva- 
tion ; but it seems impossible for 
them to understand them or to es- 
teem them as I do. 

I wonder if among the Latter-day 
Saints there are those who, possi- 
bly, receive and accept, unthinking- 
ly, the principles that are laid down 
before us, and the precepts that are 
given for our guidance day by day. 
That passive reception of these 
things is not evidence of full and 
entire belief. There should be no 
"doubting Thomases" among us. It 
is better to believe without seeing ; 
better to believe by the evidences of 
the word that come to us from time 
to time in the pages of history. In 
histories that have been given of the 
lives of prophets and patriarchs of 
old there have been great events 
recorded that are not believed by 
many of the advanced minds of the 
present time. Robert G. Ingersoll 
wrote a book upon the mistakes of 
Moses ; and the doings of Moses 
have been made a by-word in the 
mouths of scientific men. Great 
things that are recorded of the mir- 
acles performed during the early 
history of the world are looked upon 
as being mere figments of the im- 
aginations of men, attempts to play 
upon the credulity of their fellow- 
men. We read of the miraculous 
journey of the children of Israel 
across the wilderness, their path- 
way preceded by a pillar of fire by 
night and a cloud by day. We read 
of the striking of the rock, and the 
emerging therefrom of the hidden 
waters. We read of Joshua com- 
manding the sun to stand still. All 
these things are accepted in the 



minds of some as true, and in the 
minds of others as being unbeliev- 
able. Today, in the history of the 
world, and of the Church, with 
which we are directly or indirectly 
associated, there have been -miracles 
quite as great. There have been 
marvelous happenings in the lives 
of the Latter-day Saints that should 
elevate our minds to a knowledge 
of the fact that God is as near today 
as He has ever been in the history 
of the world. It is His purpose, day 
by day, to speak to us in one way 
or another, either by history or by 
the things that are now being ful- 
filled, of past prophecy or some 
other evidence that calls to us from 
the great Author of our being, with 
the endeavor to lead us into the way 
of righteousness. ' Those who be- 
lieve, whose minds are open to re- 
ceive the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit, are the ones who are in the 
line of safety ; while those whose 
minds are inclined to skepticism, 
who think that it is necessary to 
prove by actual demonstration, as 
one would prove the principles of 
geometry, are the ones who will not . 
receive the reward of the believer. 

There are many problems con- 
fronting the Latter-day Saints at 
the present time. Never in the his- 
tory of the Church, in modern times 
or in ancient days, have there been 
greater problems. The discoveries 
of the day, the inventions of man- 
kind, the political problems, all unite 
to form complications so great, so 
difficult of understanding ; that they 
operate upon the minds of individ- 
uals and turn them from a contem- 
plation of the most important things 
in life. In the midst of all these 
things we become distracted, our 
thoughts are drawn from the ideals 
of our religion, not centered upon 
the promises of God to us. There 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is yet to be revealed things that will 
test the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints, and require that their belief 
be given readily and as cheerfully 
as if accompanied by tangible evi- 
dence. Therefore, in my opinion, 
the key that was given by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith is a very val- 
uable one ; the Latter-day Saints 
ought to study, with all due purpose 
of heart, the progress of the work, 
and endeavor to comprehend, under 
the influence of the Holy Spirit, the 
ground upon which they stand. Our 
minds ought to be open to the influ- 
ences derived from such meetings 
as these. When inspired men speak 
to us we should accept the truth or 
divinity of the word that we hear, 
not lay it aside . as being of no 
further use, but make it a part of 
our mental and spiritual posses- 
sions. In this way these confer- 
ences become of great value to us, 
uniting the many individuals who 
come together from the far borders 
of the Church, with their varied 
problems ; fusing us, as it were, into 
a perfect body, making of us the 
strong and powerful organization 
which it is necessary for us to be in 
order to fulfil the purposes of God. 

I bear my testimony to the truth 
of this work. I feel that if the spirit 
of my father were so he could see 
me now he would be proud that I 
have been honored with this posi- 
tion. I am glad to honor his name. 
It was said of him, by one of the 
Church authorities, who is present 
upon this stand today, that, like 
Nathaniel of old, he was a man 
without guile. His son may not 
reach that distinction, but I en- 
deavor to follow in his footsteps, 
and heed the injunctions of those 
who have been the Church leaders 
in this day and dispensation in 
which God has restored His gospel 



to the earth. May the Lord add 
His blessing to us and continue with 
an increased portion of His Spirit 
during the remainder of this con- 
ference, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 

(President of Granite Stake.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that the same good spirit that has 
accompanied the former speakers 
may abide with me this afternoon 
in the few remarks that I shall make 
unto you. I rejoiced in the testi- 
monies that have been borne. Par- 
ticularly was I well pleased yester- 
day morning, in the splendid testi- 
mony and word of counsel pertain- 
ing to the callings of the priesthood 
and the organizations in the 
Church, that was presented to us by 
our President. I have also enjoyed 
the thoughts that many of the presi- 
dents of stakes have given unto us. 
relative to their thankfulness in be- 
longing to this Church, and for the 
parenthood that has given them 
birth. I also am grateful for the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe in 
it, and if I have any virtue in me I 
think I owe it to my faith in this 
great and glorious work. It is part 
of my being; and I have faith and 
hope that, if I can only be true to 
the end, I will be acceptable in my 
Heavenly Father's sight. 

I am very grateful for my splen- 
did parents. When I look back 
upon the truth, the dignity, the 
grace, and the grandeur of my 
father, I feel that I would at least 
be very recreant if I did not amount 
to something, and attempt in my 
feeble way to carry on the splendid 
work that he devoted his life to. I 
feel that I owe it to him that I shall 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR

try to magnify righteousness in the 
earth and do that which is good. 
When I think of my splendid 
mother her devotion to the work, 
to the cause, and her solicitude in 
my behalf, I feel that I could not 
hold up my head and look woman- 
kind in the face unless I led a pure 
and righteous life. I am grateful 
that I have had this care over me 
in my youth and that I have had a 
good example and good teachings 
to guide and direct me in the ways 
of righteousness and truth. I feel 
that I owe them a great debt of 
gratitude. 

Like one of the other speakers 
who addressed us this morning, I 
admire and have respect for and 
love the authorities in this Church. 
I have known them all, from Presi- 
dent Brigham Young down ; and I 
have never listened to teachings 
from their lips but what were ele- 
vating and would bless me, and tend 
to make me a better man, if I would 
only follow their admonitions. Their 
lives, so far as I have known them, 
have been an inspiration to me, and 
have been a guide post to me during 
my life to lead me in the way of 
that which is good and virtuous. I 
hope that I will be able to conduct 
my life in that kind of a way that I 
also shall be an example to future 
generations ; that I also shall have 
that power and influence by which 
I can control my children, and that 
they shall be a credit and an honor 
to this Church, and bring no re- 
proach upon it or upon the work of 
the Lord. 

I want to say, in connection with 
this thought, that I believe that we 
parents owe something to this 
Church, that we may carry on the 
splendid work that our fathers and 
our mothers have set out so well, 
and laid such a splendid foundation 



for us to build upon. I think we 
owe it to this Church, we owe it to 
our boys and girls, to give evidence 
by our lives that the man who holds 
any position in the priesthood of 
Almighty God is a worthy example 
to future generations, that he con- 
ducts his life in a manner that is 
sweet, clean and wholesome, and 
that every boy and every girl who 
sees anyone who holds the priest- 
hood walking along the streets of 
our cities or through our valleys, 
may look upon that man and behold 
a righteous person in whose foot- 
steps they will delight to follow. I 
think we should order our homes in 
that manner by which our example 
will teach our boys and girls the 
right way of living. 

I wish that we as Latter-day 
Saints, especially we fathers, would 
devote more attention to our own, 
to our children. Never mind quite 
so much about having barns that 
are filled, and flocks upon a thou- 
sand hills, and a credit that cannot 
be impeached. These things are all 
good in their place ; but I want to 
tell you, that which will bring credit, 
pleasure and happiness to you, all 
the days of your life, is a righteous 
son and a virtuous and beautiful 
daughter ; it is through them that 
we are going to be exalted and 
blest, and have pleasure in our 
Heavenly Father's kingdom. It 
seems to me that they should have 
our best thought, our best atten- 
tion, and our best time — the loved 
ones that the Lord our God has 
given us. Whenever I saw my 
father walk anywhere, I recognized 
his righteousness, his example, his 
truth and devotion to this work, I 
rejoiced all over, and I had pleas- 
ure in witnessing that which he did. 
All the days of my life I have tried, 
with all the strength and power that 



4 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have had, to tread in his footsteps, 
and I want my children to try to 
emulate that kind of an example. I 
helieve that we should start at home 
in the teaching of our boys and 
girls. We have splendid auxiliary 
organizations. Who can estimate 
the good that our Sabbath Schools 
are doing, which take hold of our 
children when they are little ones, 
and nurture them, and guide them 
along until they become strong and 
vigorous in the work of the Lord? 
Who can estimate the value of the 
Primaries, and the Religion Class 
organization, and our Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement organizations that are 
working for the building up of our 
people ? But, I sometimes think that 
many of our parents leave entirely 
too much to these organizations to 
educate their boys and girls in the 
fear of the Lord, and it does not 
seem that it is right. I don't feel 
that the responsibility of my boys' 
and girls' education depends upon 
these organizations, as much good 
as they are doing. I recognize that 
when I go back to my Heavenly 
Father's presence He will inquire of 
me — not the Sunday School super- 
intendent — what I have been doing 
for my boys and girls. I believe we 
should gather our children around 
us. more often, around the fireside ; 
that we should be a better com- 
panion with our boy, get up close 
to him, know him, become ac- 
quainted with him, and have him 
know us ; and get so close to our 
girls that there is never a secret be- 
tween them and us so that they can- 
not come to us. I believe that we 
would have greater rejoicing, and 
that there would be less sorrow 
among people, less of our children 
go wrong, if we would only spend 



just a little more time with them 
ourselves ; get up close to them, 
look them in the eye, be a com- 
panion with the loved ones that the 
Lord our God has given us. I be- 
lieve, generally speaking, that if the 
people in the Church would follow 
that example a splendid result 
would accrue therefrom. 

I remember, a few days ago, in 
listening to the testimony of some 
brethren in a high-priests' meeting, 
and they were generally speaking 
of the blessings of the Lord to them 
in a temporal way. Many of the 
brethren stated they had received 
some wonderful blessings from our 
Heavenly Father along temporal 
lines. Some of them told of this 
prominent position that their boy 
occupied, and how their girls shone 
socially in some place, and so forth, 
and how the Lord had blest them 
with the good things of the earth, 
so that they were rich and had no 
need to want. Then another man, 
a splendid character, that I know 
well, got up and bore his testimony, 
he said: "I haven't a big bank ac- 
count ; I am a poor man. I haven't 
a son that occupies a prominent po- 
sition in the world, as far as the 
world goes, and I haven't a girl 
that shines much socially in the 
world ; but I have a little cottage, 
and I have a large family that I am 
proud of. Every night I know 
where every one of my boys and 
girls are, and there is perfect har- 
mony. We love one another ; we 
are united ; there are no secrets 
apart from one another ; and we are 
bound together by the fellowship of 
love. Every one of my boys has a 
good education, so have my girls ; 
every one of them has a testimony 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ ; and 
every one of them are clean, sweet 



ELDER LOUIS IV. SHURTLfFF. 



51 



and honorable, and they are a credit 
to the Church of Christ." I thought 
in my soul how rich is that man 
who can put his hand upon his boys 
and girls at all times of the day and 
night, and know that they are safe 
and that they love the work of the 
Lord. I feel, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that we owe to this Church, 
as far as it is possible, that we see 
to it that our boys and girls do that 
which is just right, and wherever 
they go, let us not loose our hold 
on them, but, if need be, let us go 
after them, if they be in the desert 
or in the mountains, or wherever 
they may be ; the Lord our God ex- 
pects us, as fathers and mothers, 
that we take care and nurture and 
love our own, and bring them into 
the fold of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

May the Lord bless us. May His 
spirit abide with us ; and may the 
youth of Zion, that are growing up 
today, be just as faithful and true 
to the work of the Lord as their 
fathers and mothers have been. I 
believe they will be; I don't think 
that we need to fear the second, 
third, fourth, or fifth generation, 
because the spirit of truth is in the 
hearts of the Latter-day Saints. I 
believe our boys and girls are going 
to keep themselves clean, pure and 
unspotted from the sins and wick- 
edness of the world, to the end that 
the light and Spirit of the Lord our 
God will rest down upon them, and 
the revelations of the Lord will be 
with them to lead them in the way 
of truth; that Zion shall glory in 
their righteousness and truth, which 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

solo, was rendered by Elder Robert 
Siddoway. 



ELDER LOUIS W. SHURTLIFF. 

(President of Weber Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters : 
The President said that he wanted 
me to bear my testimony for a few 
moments. 

I rejoice exceedingly in the truths 
of the gospel. I have enjoyed my- 
self in all of the sessions of this 
conference. I am pleased to have 
the privilege of meeting with the 
Saints of God. and I am thankful 
that my life has been associated 
with this Church. I am of the third 
generation of my family in the 
Church ; my grandfather and my 
father before me, Newman A. 
Shurtliff, having joined the Church 
and gathered in Kirtland and fol- 
lowed the destinies of the Church 
from then until he came here to 
Utah, settling in Weber County, re- 
maining there until his death. I am 
thankful for the associations of my 
brethren who preside over ns. I 
have endeavored to be benefited by 
their instructions and counsels, and 
to carry them out in my life. I 
have been honored to know, to be 
acquainted with, and to labor with 
and under the direction of all of 
the presidents from President Brig- 
ham Young. I remember full well 
the first foreign mission on which I 
was sent, when a number of us were 
selected, over in the old assembly 
hall or tabernacle, that stood in the 
corner in sixty-seven, to go to Eu- 
rope. Previous to that it was my 
good fortune to be called to the 
Salmon River mission, during my 
early manhood, or boyhood almost. 
I can say that the inspiration of 
heaven has followed the counsel of 
the servants of God, in all the his- 
tory of this Church as far as I am 
aware. I know that these men are 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men of God. I know that the prin- 
ciples of the everlasting gospel, as 
revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, are true and will 
save men and women. I feel grate- 
ful that my eyes beheld the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Although I was but 
a child I had opportunities of seeing 
him, and playing around his house 
with some of the sons of the 
prophet and patriarch, and other 
prominent brethren, early members 
of the Church. 

I have the honor to preside over 
the Weber Stake of Zion. It is only 
a short time ago that the Weber 
Stake included all of Weber Coun- 
ty, but it has been divided into three 
stakes, and we have all that we can 
do now. The stake that I preside 
over has eight thousand people in 
it, or thereabouts, and the other 
stakes nearly as many. The union, 
love and fellowship that exist 
among the Saints is a joy to not 
only myself but to those associated 
with me in the ministry. 

I pray God to bless these our 
leaders, and fill them with the Holy 
Ghost and with power to proclaim 
His word;. and give us who are la- 
boring in the cause, an earnest de- 
sire to carry out every counsel and 
advice given, I pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The brethren and sisters will be- 
gin to realize that the third genera- 
tion is considerably in evidence 
during this conference ; for those to 
whom we have listened, so far, have 
generally been of the third and 
fourth generations. I claim to be, 
one of the fourth generation myselt, 
and I can produce in the neighbor- 
hood of a dozen of the fifth genera- 
tion who are as good as any others. 



ELDER HEP EE, C- AUSTIN- 

(President of Bingham Stake.) 

I feel that it will not be possible 
for me to profitably occupy this po- 
sition, even for a few moments, un- 
less I am aided and assisted by the 
faith and prayers of the Latter-day 
Saints. It goes without saying that 
I am very much surprised to be 
called upon to speak to you. I de- 
light in the testimonies of the speak- 
ers, and in the spirit of this confer- 
ence, like the other brethren who 
have spoken to us this afternoon, 
and in the different sessions of this 
conference. I have been edified and 
instructed in the counsels and in the 
testimonies of my brethren who 
have spoken to us, and I have 
learned more concerning my duties 
by listening to the instructions that 
have been given to us. I was espe- 
cially impressed with the words of 
President Smith, in the opening 
session of this conference. I was 
delighted to hear him instruct the 
brethren as to their duties, and their 
authority in the callings of the 
priesthood. There has been, and is 
now perhaps, a lack of perfect un- 
derstanding concerning those 
things ; but I think those of us who 
listened to his remarks will find 
ourselves set right on these things. 

I hail from a stake in the north, 
and I have wondered why we had 
such splendid good people up in 
that part, until I heard President 
Murdock, this morning, tell us that 
the goodness of his people was 
measured by the altitude that they 
live in. We, too, have a splendid 
people, no better I suppose any- 
where in the Church ; but we have 
not yet reached perfection. We 
have those among us who are some- 
what indifferent. We have those 
among us who, perhaps, do not 
fully appreciate the responsibilities 



ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL. 



53 



that are resting upon them as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and as men holding 
the priesthood who have been called 
to labor in the Lord's vineyard, and 
who have been given authority to 
officiate in His name, but I feel jus- 
tified in saying that we have a good 
lot of people in the north, and I be- 
lieve the same thing is true of all 
the stakes of Zion in that section. 

You know we have the brethren 
of the general authorities visit us 
from time to time. Every three 
months we are blessed by having 
some of the quorum of the twelve, 
and the council of seventies, and 
other brethren come to instruct us 
in our duties ; and we profit by their 
visits and by their instruction. We 
are laboring unitedly together. 
There is no contention in the part 
where I live. We are an indus- 
trious people. We are tilling the 
soil, producing the thine^ that are 
necessary to sustain lhc, and the 
Lord is blessing us in our efforts, 
and we acknowledge the hand of 
the Lord in all of these things. We 
are united in our support of the au- 
thorities of the Church. I have 
never heard a man or woman in the 
Bingham stake of Zion who have 
found it in their hearts to criticize 
or find fault with our brethren who 
preside over us ; and for this I am 
grateful. For this I thank the Lord 
because I know that these men have 
been called by the inspiration of the 
Lord, that they are clothed with au- 
thority to officiate in His name, and 
that they are mouth-pieces of the 
Lord to us. We are ready and 
pleased to accept their counsel as 
they come and bring it to us. We 
rejoice in mingling together in these 
conferences. I am of the opinion 
that it would be impossible for men, 
no matter if they were wicked, to 
mingle with a body of men and 



women like we find in these gather- 
ings of the general conferences, 
without being strengthened. Our 
leaders are determined to serve the 
Lord, let come what will. 

Well, my brethren and sisters, 
you have now learned that I am not 
a public speaker; I am an ordinary 
farmer, I am laboring in the tilling 
of the soil ; but I rejoice in the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, I know that it 
is true. I know that these brethren 
whom we are associated with have 
been called of the Lord, and I sus- 
tain them with all my heart, with 
all my power, and influence; and 
so do the people whom I have the 
honor to preside over. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us 
and be with us to the end of our 
days, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL. 

(President of Box Elder Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters : I 
am very thankful that I am among 
the number who have been born of 
goodly parents, who have taught us 
the gospel of Jesus Christ in our 
youth, and that I can say I belong 
to the third generation. I haven't 
any fear of the outcome of the third 
generation, or the other genera- 
tions, if the parents in the Church 
will be true and faithful to the gos- 
pel and teach it to their children. 
Neither my parents nor grand- 
parents were acquainted with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith ; they did not 
embrace the gospel until some years 
after his death, but I am glad that 
they had a burning testimony in 
their souls that he indeed was a 
prophet of the living God, and they 
have taught that to their children. 

I am thankful it is not necessary 
that one should have seen the 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prophet Joseph Smith in order to 
enjoy this testimony. While I real- 
ize it was a pleasure and satisfac- 
tion, to those who were acquainted 
with him, to have seen and mingled 
with him, and thus learn of his 
greatness, his goodness and his 
prophetic powers, I am thankful 
that the Spirit of God gives to us 
the testimony that he was indeed a 
prophet of the Lord. I was im- 
pressed this afternoon while the 
brethren were speaking of the ex- 
perience of Thomas, who would not 
believe that the Savior had risen 
from the grave until he could see 
Him. When Thomas beheld Him 
and exclaimed that it was his Lord, 
Jesus said, "Thomas, thou hast seen 
and thou believest. Blessed are 
those who have not seen and yet be- 
lieve." 

The spirit, the power of God, is 
in this work ; it has been in it from 
the very beginning. It is in it to- 
day; and the same spirit, the same 
power is directing it and influenc- 
ing those who preside over the 
Church today as it has done since 
its first organization. I was im- 
pressed with this thought at the 
close of President Smith's remarks 
yesterday morning. I remember the 
final passages in that great revela- 
tion on priesthood in the Book of 
Covenants. After the duties of the 
priesthood are severally made 
known, clearly and explicitly, the 
Lord says through the prophet : 
"Now let every man learn his duty 
and act in the office to which he is 
appointed, in all diligence;" and I 
thought that this very beautifully 
summed up, in connection with that 
revelation, the remarks of President 
Smith to us. If we could only 
carry out that admonition and every 
man and woman learn his or her 
(lutY, and act in the office to which 



they are appointed, in all diligence, 
then God would bless them and 
they would be successful in their 
labors. What a wonderful improve- 
ment we could make in our work 
and in the Church if we would do 
this. 

Oh how thankful we should be 
for the gospel. When I read the 
revelations that were given to the 
Prophet Joseph, I marvel how well 
they apply to the Church even in 
this day, seventy and eighty years 
and more after they were given. If 
we could only carry out the sugges- 
tions made in the revelations in re- 
lation to the training of our chil- 
dren, as were made known to him 
away back in eighteen thirty-three, 
we would have the condition exist- 
ing among us that President Frank 
Y. Taylor referred to here this aft- 
ernoon. Our gospel is complete. 
The instructions, revelations and 
counsel that have been given to us 
are perfect. There is sufficient for 
us to do if we will only strive with 
all our power and might to carry 
it out. 

I am glad for the testimony that 
I have of the divinity of this work. 
I know that the signs follow the be- 
liever in the Church, that they are 
following the believers today ; and 
that our Father is pouring out His 
blessings upon His children, in 
keeping with their faithfulness and 
obedience to the gospel, as much to- 
day as He ever did before. This 
is my testimony. I know that those 
who preside over the Church today 
are our Father's servants, acknowl- 
edged of Him to be our leaders, and 
that they are His mouth-pieces unto 
us children in this work. Now I 
pray the blessings of the Lord 
upon us. 

We have all rejoiced in the spirit 
of this conference thus far. We 



ELDER OLEEN X. STOHL. 



55 



shall continue to rejoice in it, and I 
know that the power and the bless- 
ings of the Lord will continue with 
us and bless us, and that we shall 
go on and accomplish the work that 
is required of us as His children. 
May our Father bless us to this end, 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 
AUDITOR 

At the general meeting of the 
Priesthood, on Saturday evening, 
April 5th, 1913, in the Tabernacle, 
the following report was read : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, April, 1913. 
Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, 
Charles W. Penrose, Presidency 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints: 

Dear Brethren : We, the un- 
dersigned, Committee of Auditors, 
as sustained at the last General Con- 
ference, beg leave to report : That 
we have completed the annual Audit 
of the books of the Trustee-in- 
Trust, and also those of the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office, which are 
auxiliary thereto, and beg leave to 
say : that we found the books and 
accounts in both of these depart- 
ments in excellent condition. The 
accounts are accurately, concisely 
and intelligently kept, and from a 
bookkeeper's standpoint, they leave 
but little, if anything, to be desired. 
When your committee was first ap- 
pointed, some years ago, we then 
found the books of these depart- 
ments in good shape, but from year 
to year we note improvements which 
add to their conciseness and make 
them more easy of audit. We think 
it proper to also state that the sta- 
tistical department of the Presiding 
Bishop's Office is also kept in a very 
intelligent manner. These statis- 



There is beauty all around, 

When there's love at home. 
There is joy in every sound, 
When there's love at home, 
Peace and plenty there abide, 
Smiling sweet on every side, 
Time doth softly, sweetly glide, 
When there's love at home. 

Bendiction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Sunday, April 6th, 1913. 

S REPORT. 

tics are voluminous and yet the fu- 
ture will demonstrate they are of 
great value, for they demonstrate 
by comparison of one year with an- 
other, the growth and prosperity of 
the Church. 

After careful and thorough ex- 
amination of all the books of the 
Trustee-in-Trust and Presiding 
Bishop's Offices, showing all re- 
ceipts and disbursements of the 
funds of the Church, your commit- 
tee unhesitatingly report that all ex- 
penditures of the Church funds 
have been made for legitimate 
Church purposes. 

We beg to acknowledge the very 
efficient services rendered us by 
Brother Arthur Winter, of the 
Trustee-in-Trust's Office, and of the 
brethren in the Presiding Bishop's 
Office, in throwing open to us every 
avenue for onr inspection, which 
enabled us to get a clear and com- 
prehensive view of all the matters 
that came within our purview. 
We are, very respectfully. 
Your brethren, 
W. W. Riter. 
John C. Cutler, 
Joseph S. Wells, 
Heber Scowcroft, 
H. H. Rolapp. 
On motion, the foregoing report 
was received and approved, by 
unanimous vote of the Priesthood 
assembled. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Sunday, 
April 6th; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

President Smith announced that,

of people unable to obtain admis- 
sion to the Tabernacle, overflow 
meetings will be held in the adjoin- 
ing Assembly Hall this morning, 
and afternoon, and in the Barratt 
Hall at 2 p. m. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang the 
hymn : 

Hark ! listen to the trumpeters ! 

They sound for volunteers, 
On Zion's bright and flowery mount 

Behold the officers. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Gus- 
tave A. Iverson. 

The choir sang the hymn : 
Though deep'ning trials throng your 
way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God ! 
Ere long the resurrection day 
Will shed its life and light abroad.

Perpetuity of the Church. — Its final 
triumph. 

I feel that I am greatly privileged 
in having the opportunity of assem- 



bling with the Saints this morning 
in General Conference, and have 
been blessed from the beginning of 
our services through all the sessions 
that have been held. We have had 
a glorious time ; that is, I have, and 
everybody to whom I have spoken 
concerning our meetings, expressed 
the same feeling. The Spirit of the 
Lord has been with us, and our 
brethren who have addressed the 
congregations have been inspired by 
that one Spirit which the Lord has 
given to his people who have obeyed 
the laws of the Gospel. Our breth- 
ren who have addressed us have 
been, chiefly, so they have informed 
us, men belonging to the third and 
fourth generation of those who have 
received the gospel in the latter 
days. This has impressed me very 
much. You doubtless have heard 
the prediction of some of our scien- 
tific men in the nation that the test 
of "Mormonism" would come with 
the third or fourth generation of 
its followers. They seem to have 
the idea that as time rolls on, the 
Latter-day Saints, or "Mormons" 
as they call us, will begin to depart 
from the Faith of their forefathers, 
and be led away into different 
paths, just as the world has been, 
and as one noted man hoped we 
would become, "like the rest of us." 
But our brethren who have spoken 
to us during the conference, occu- 
pying prominent and responsible 
places in the Church, have shown 
to us that they are true Latter-day 
Saints. The spirit that they bear 
with them, and that accompanies 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 57 



their fervent testimonies, shows us 
that they are fully and entirely in 
the work of the Lord in the latter 
days ; and this has gladdened my 
heart. I am proud also of the gen- 
erations that are coming, and I be- 
lieve that they will improve as the 
years go on, because there is always 
room for improvement with indi- 
viduals and with the generations 
that come, when the fathers obey 
the commandments of God and 
teach the Truth to their children. 
Now, I don't happen to be in this 
grand and noble class of men, — I 
say that advisedly, about their char- 
acter, for I remember reading in 
the Bible, in the Psalms, a predic- 
tion like this : "It shall be said of 
this and that man that he was born 
in Zion, and the Highest himself 
shall establish her;" so that it is 
really a privilege and a blessing to 
be born in Zion, of goodly parents, 
of men and women who have been 
obedient to the gospel, and who had 
the Spirit of the Lord upon them, 
even before the birth of these good 
men who have spoken to us. 

The science of eugenics is taking 
a great hold upon some minds in 
the United States, and is being fol- 
lowed, I hope not too far, among 
the people called Latter-day Saints. 
It is a good thing to learn how a 
righteous and stalwart generation 
can be brought forth, strong spirit- 
ually as well as physically; strong 
mentally, endowed with all the 
powers that should belong to the 
sons and daughters of God in hu- 
manity. And I hail with pleasure 
the efforts that are being put forth 
in this direction ; for prenatal influ- 
ences are very powerful, and when 
the time comes that people under- 
stand the laws that pertain to the 
production of the human species, 
and are at least as particular in re- 



gard to these matters as in regard 
to the raising of fine stock of dif- 
ferent kinds, I believe a new and 
better generation will be brought 
forth, so that the predictions of the 
prophets may be fulfilled, and that 
children will not be cut down by 
disease in their infancy or childhood, 
but, to use the words of the prophet, 
that "a man shall live to the age of 
a tree ;" (if it means a grand old oak 
tree, that is a pretty good length of 
time) ; and that the time will come 
when the children that will be born 
and grow up to that great age, shall 
not have to be buried in the ground, 
but shall be quickened by the power 
of God and changed so as to pass 
from mortality to immortality, as 
some very few of the earth's inhabi- 
tants have been translated by spe- 
cial dispensation of Divine Provi- 
dence. 

I said I did not happen to belong 
to the class of those that have been 
born in Zion, or who were, born of 
parents who received the gospel. I 
am the only one of the family to 
which I belong who has come out 
of the world into the Church of 
Christ. I have done my best to try 
and bring my relatives to a full un- 
derstanding of the gospel, but have 
not been successful. I recognize the 
hand of Providence in this, as far 
as I am individually concerned. 
Perhaps if I had had the way 
smoothed before me to receive the 
gospel I might not have developed 
some talents that the Lord has 
brought forth in me. I might not 
have had force and power devel- 
oped in me to resist evil, and to lay 
hold of the good, but, by the very 
struggles that I have had to make 
alone from my boyhood upward, I 
feel that God has blessed me and 
strengthened me, so that when times 
of testing came in various condi- 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions and capacities, I was able to 
exercise my individuality and to 
choose the good and refuse the evil, 
and when many of my companions 
in the Priesthood in early days 
turned away and were led into by 
and forbidden paths, God strength- 
ened my feet, planted them upon 
the Rock of Truth and gave me 
power to resist every inducement to 
turn away from the right. 

Now, I do not speak of that in 
any way of boasting; the Lord for- 
bid, for I feel that everything I have 
and everything that I am I owe to 
the Church and Kingdom that He 
has established on the earth ; to the 
truths that He has revealed ; to the 
power and authority that He has 
sent from heaven to guide people 
on the earth ; to the Divine Spirit 
which I know has rested upon me 
from On High, and quickened all 
my powers and enabled me to con- 
tinue to labor for the cause of truth 
and righteousness, and the building 
up of the Kingdom of our God ; and 
this morning I reioice in these 
blessings, and acknowledge the 
hand of the Lord in the midst of this 
great congregation. 

President Smith, in his opening 
address to the conference, gave us 
a very clear expose of the order of 
the Church, in the Priesthood par- 
ticularly, and T am sure that every 
soid that heard the sound of his 
voice rejoiced in what was laid be- 
fore us so plainly and so forciblv. 
and so strictly in accordance with 
the revelations that have been re- 
ceived and printed. President Lund 
also alluded to one of the funda- 
mental doctrines of the Church, re- 
vealed when it was organized, 
which was that the Lord appointed 
Joseph Smith, at that time the head 
of the Church, to be a prophet, a 
seer and a revelator. and admon- 



ished the Church to follow his coun- 
sel, to be obedient to the things he 
gave to them as he received them 
from the Lord. Now, notwith- 
standing this revelation that w&S 
given on the very day of the organi- 
zation of the Church, and the people 
were commanded to look to the 
head for guidance, for revelations, 
for commandments to govern and 
guide the Church, it was not very 
long, so we learn from the history 
of the Church, before false spirits 
came among the' people, and they 
were led, some to the right and 
some to the left, but out of "the 
strait and narrow way." Jesus de- 
clared that "Strait is the way and 
narrow is the path which leadeth 
unto life, and few there be that 
find it." So it has been during the 
whole history of the world ; and it 
is also a matter of history that 
always there were some who de- 
parted from the narrow way, the 
straight path into the presence of 
the Lord, and were led away by 
delusive influences and spirits. Now 
the Lord made it very clear, and 
pronounced it very emphatically 
right from the beginning, that there 
should be but one man, and he the 
head of the Church, who should re- 
ceive revelations and command- 
ments for the Church, and the 
Church has been warned, time and 
again, not to be turned aside from 
this plain and simple way that the 
Lord marked out. 

I will read a passage or two from 
the Doctrine and Covenants on this 
point, because I consider it of very 
great importance, and always have 
so viewed it from the beginning of 
my membership in the Church. 
Those of you who are familiar with 
the history of the Church in its be- 
ginning will remember that Oliver 
Cowdery, who received the Aaronic 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 



59 



Priesthood under the hands of John 
the Baptist, in company with the 
Prophet Joseph, and also with him 
the higher or jVIelchizedek Priest- 
hood from Peter, James and John, 
became rather rebellious in his 
spirit. He actually commanded the 
Prophet Joseph to change one of 
the revelations that he had received ; 
but the Lord gave words to Oliver 
which should be a guide to all who 
belong to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I read 
from Doctrine and Covenants, sec- 
tion 28, verses 1-4: 

"Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that 
it shall be given unto thee, that thou 
shalt be heard by the Church in all 
things whatsoever thou shalt teach them 
by the Comforter, concerning the reve- 
lations and commandments which I have 
given. 

"But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto 
thee, no one shall be appointed to re- 
ceive commandments and revelations in 
this Church, excepting my servant 
Joseph Smith, Junior, for he receiveth 
them even as Moses." 

"And thou shall be obedient unto the 
things which I shall give unto him, even 
as Aaron, to declare faithfully the com- 
mandments and the revelations, with 
power and authority unto the Church." 

I will not read the whole section, 
but there are two or three verses 
further that I would like to read to 
vou this morning, commencing at 
the 11th verse in this section. 

"And again, thou shalt take thy 
brother, Hiram Page, between him 
and thee alone, and tell him that those 
things which he has written from that 
stone, are not of Me, and that Satan 
deceiveth him. 

"For behold, these things have not 
been appointed unto him, neither shall 
anvthing be appointed unto any of this 
Church contrary to the Church cove- 
nants." 

From time to time there have 
been persons who have arisen and 



claimed to be especially called of 
God to give something new, as 
they considered, to the Church, and 
they have assumed power and auth- 
ority which did not belong to them, 
because the Lord had said in the 
beginning that this authority should 
be given to but one man at a time, 
and he the head of the Church. 
Yet some people were foolish 
enough to be led away by deceivers 
into by and forbidden paths. Now, 
they did not always manifest any- 
thing that was corrupt or wicked or 
evil, but were deceived themselves, 
just as Christ predicted it would be 
before His second advent, that there 
would be false teachers among the 
people, "deceiving and being de- 
cieved." Influences that were not 
of God operated on their minds, 
and they were led away, in their 
own pride sometimes, and vain con- 
ceit, and they assumed authority 
which was not given to them, be- 
cause of the manifestations that they 
had received and which they sup- 
posed to be Divine. They were de- 
ceived themselves and they deceived 
others. So the Lord appointed this 
rule in the Church and I think that 
any one who will look into it will 
see that it was a very wise provis- 
ion—that in this Church, people 
who believe in visions and dreams, 
and tongues and interpretations of 
tongues, and prophecy and all the 
gifts and blessings that pertain to 
membership in the Church of Christ 
ought not to be permitted to present 
their notions and ideas (arising per- 
haps from some manifestation that 
they had received) as divinely giv- 
en for' the guidance and direction of 
the Saints, but that such authori- 
tative communications should come 
only through the head of the 
Church. 

From time to time through the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



whole history of the Church every 
now and then somebody has started 
Up with a dream or a vision or a 
revelation of some kind, and en- 
deavored to lead other people away 
from the straight path, and yet the 
Lord has told the Church in the 
very beginning that He would not 
give revelations and commandments 
for the Church to any one but the 
man placed at the head. While in- 
dividuals in this Church may seek 
to the Lord, as I know by personal 
experience, and receive His Spirit 
in power, and direction from the 
Lord in the performance of duty, 
and be led and guided by the spirit 
of God, for "they who are led by 
the spirit of God are the sons of 
God," yet, while this blessing is 
promised to individuals in the 
Church for their own special good, 
they are not intended for the 
Church or for other people besides 
themselves. Notwithstanding this, 
these diversions have occurred from 
time to time from the very beginn- 
ing of the Church, and one of these 
was the kind spoken of here in re- 
gard to Hiram Page. 

In the 50th section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants the same sub- 
ject is referred to in this way, be- 
ginning at the first paragraph : 

"Hearken, O, ye elders of my 
Church, and give ear to the voice of 
the living God, and attend to the 
words of wisdom which shall be given 
unto you, according as ye have asked 
and are agreed as touching the Church, 
and the spirits which have gone 
abroad in the earth. 

"Behold, verily I say unto you, that 
there are many spirits which are false 
spirits, which have gone forth in the 
earth, deceiving the world ; 

"And also Satan hath sought to de- 
ceive you, that he might overthrow 
you." 

The same might be said at the 



present time ; there are various false 
influences abroad, and they seek to 
enter into the Church of Christ, 
and to lead people astray, and some- 
times individuals will be so imbued 
with the importance of that which 
they have received — as they be- 
lieve by revelation from God — that 
they begin to assume authority over 
others, and endeavor to lead them 
away, to follow them into the ways 
of darkness, into superstition, into 
folly and into neglect to observe the 
commandment that God gave in the 
beginning of the Church. 

I will read another verse or two 
from the Doctrine and Covenants 
section 43, beginning at the first 
paragraph ; 

"O, hearken, ye elders of my Church, 
and give an ear to the words which I 
shall speak unto you; 

"For, behold, verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that ye have received a 
commandment for a law unto my 
Church, through him whom I have 
apointed unto you, to receive from 
my hand. 

"And this ye shall know assuredly, 
that there is none other appointed 
unto you to receive commandments 
and revelations until he be taken, if 
he abide in Me. 

"But verily, verily, I say unto you, 
that none else shall be appointed unto 
this gift except it be through him, for 
if it be taken from him, he shall not 
have power except to appoint another 
in his stead. 

"And this shall be a law unto you, 
that ye receive not the teachings of 
any that shall come before you as 
revelations or commandments; 

"And this I shall give unto you that 
you may know they are not of Me." 

It seems to me that this ought to 
be sufficient for Latter-day Saints, 
and particularly for the elders of 
the Church, to whom this revelation 
was especially addressed. Elders of 
this Church, men holding the auth- 
ority of the priesthood that God 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



61 



has revealed, ought certainly to un- 
derstand this one simple principle 
and law of the Church for the 
guidance of the people, and to pre- 
serve them from being deceived. 
From time to time, as I have said, 
persons have arisen claiming to 
have received revelations from the 
Lord for the guidance of the people, 
and members have followed them. 
In every instance, without excep- 
tion, trouble, sorrow, anguish and 
destruction have come from follow- 
ing these false spirits. I do not say 
that in every case the individuals 
who led the people astray were will- 
ful deceivers ; they were deceived 
themselves, and they had power to 
deceive others, for these false 
spirits that come in unawares, when 
they can get hold of people, will 
pour out, so to speak, an influence 
upon them which blinds their eyes, 
benumbs their understanding, and 
leaves them so that they do not re- 
ceive the true Light, that which 
comes from above, the Light which 
comes from Christ, from God the 
Eternal Father, and from the Holy 
Ghost, which is one spirit, the spirit 
of light, the spirit of life and the 
spirit of power by which God or- 
ganizes and regulates all things that 
he brings about for his Divine pur- 
poses. That spirit is one spirit, 
and these false influences that come 
to deceive dazzle the eyes of weak 
people, and they are led away. In 
the old country, in England partic- 
ularly, sometimes in marshy places, 
on a dark evening there will arise 
a light, bobbing about from place to 
place called the "will-of-the-wisp." 
and in some places a "jack-o'-lan- 
tern," and when in the dark trav- 
elers have missed their way, they 
will follow this jack-o'-lantern or 
will-o'-the-wisp, fancying it is some 
house where they can find refuge, 



or learn the path they should fol- 
low, and it generally leads them into 
a bog, and they sink down up to 
their necks. That illustrates, I 
think to some degree, how it has 
been spiritually with a number of 
the people who have thus been 
led astray. 

Now the light that God gives is 
clear and plain to the understand- 
ing, and above all we should re- 
member that when the Lord has 
anything to reveal to this Church by 
way of commandment or doctrine 
or principle, in addition to that 
which has been given, which may 
appear perhaps to be new — perhaps 
only the old things revived — when- 
ever God has anything to make 
known to this Church, it will come 
through the channel that He has 
appointed, and there is but one, 
and that is the head of the Church. 
This will save people from a great 
deal of trouble, if they will give 
heed to it, and I have believed in 
that doctrine from the beginning. 
I have had people come to me on 
several occasions, from time to time 
as the years have rolled on, and tell 
me some wonderful things that the 
Lord has revealed, and I have al- 
ways taken my refuge in the pas- 
sages that I have read to you. From 
the first the Lord appointed one 
man at a time on the earth, and that 
man is the head of the Church, to 
receive revelations for the Church, 
to receive commandments for the 
Church, not shutting out people 
from obtaining light for themselves 
individually; not interfering in the 
least degree with that agency which 
God has given to us ; not depriv- 
ing us of the privilege of going to 
the Lord ourselves and seeking for 
truth and light, to expand our souls, 
to enlarge our understandings, to 
strengthen us for the work we have 



62 



GEA URAL CONFERENCE. 



to perform, to qualify for the duties 
that lie hefore us, to develop our 
souls that we may grow up unto 
Him who is our living Head, even 
Christ Jesus, our Lord, — not at all, 
but that we may not be led astray, 
that we may be able to keep in the 
strait and narrow path that leadeth 
unto eternal life. 

In later years the Lord had to tell 
a little more about this on the same 
line, and I will refer you to section 
132 of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
one of the latest of the revelations 
through the prophet Joseph Smith. 
I will commence at the eighth verse : 

"Behold! Mine house is a house of 
order ,saith the Lord God, and not a 
house of confusion. 

"Will I accept an offering, saith the 
Lord God, that is not made in My 
name ! 

"Or, will I receive at your hands that 
which I have not appointed ! 

"And will I appoint unto you, saith 
the Lord, except it he by law, even as 
I and my Father ordained before the 
world was ! 

"I am the Lord, Thy God, and I give 
unto you this commandment, that no 
man shall come unto the Father but by 
me, or by My word, which is my law, 
saith the Lord; 

"And everything that is in the world, 
whether it be ordained of men, by 
thrones, or principalities, or powers, or 
things of name, whatsoever they may be, 
that are not by me, or by my word, saith 
the Lord, shall be thrown down, and 
shall not remain after men are dead, 
neither in nor after the Resurrection, 
saith the Lord, your God; 

"For, whatsoever things remain, are 
by me; and whatsoever things are not 
by Me shall be taken and destroyed." 

Now my brethren and sisters, I 
direct your attention to this partic- 
ular point in addition to those things 
that were presented by President 
Smith and President Lund, all in 
the same line and in harmony 
therewith, so that we may all have 
something to go by, that we may be 



able to hold onto it like the iron 
rod that we read of in the Book of 
Mormon, no matter who may come, 
to us pretending to have the word 
of the Lord, pretending to have 
received revelations or visions or 
dreams to guide us in anything, 
whether it be temporal or spiritual. 
You may know assuredly, the Lord 
says, that it is not of Him, because it 
does not come through the channel 
that He has appointed. This pre- 
serves order in the Church. "My 
house is a house of order," saith the 
Lord, "and not a house of confu- 
sion." We see this in all the glor- 
ious works of our Heavenly Fath- 
er ; in the physical universe, in 
things pertaining to salvation, in 
the Church of Christ, law and order 
are established in the midst of the 
people, and if we will observe the 
law and keep within the order that 
God has established, we shall not be 
led astray, nor come into the sor- 
rows and troubles and pains that 
have fallen upon some of our breth- 
ren and sisters who have been led 
astray. Yet, every now and then 
somebody starts up and claims to 
be the man "mighty and strong," 
who is to set the house of the Lord 
in order, and perform a number of 
works spoken of in the revelations 
of God, which we understand have 
really been fulfilled ; and that he is 
appointed, and you are to follow 
him, for he proclaims revelations by 
way of commandment to the 
Church. 

Now, the simple way is to say 
it cannot be true because the Lord 
says He will not do that kind of 
thing, and if any man is really ap- 
pointed of the Lord, He says, "he 
shall come in at the gate and be or- 
dained as the Lord has provided." 
So that in this Church there is no 
need for any of us to be led off in 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



63 



wrong directions. Sometimes men 
have come to the president of the 
Church and claimed to be the per- 
son to be raised up "like unto Mos- 
es," and demanded the keys of the 
Church. There was one man came, 
poor fellow, a decrepit kind of be- 
ing who hung around for several 
days. He could not get any "keys" 
and finally he came and begged for 
enough money to take him back 
to the place he came from in the 
strong." Now I don't say that to 
ridicule the man, poor fellow, but it 
illustrates what I am trying to tell 
you this morning. The Lord has 
established His Church on the earth, 
as He has told us, "in the last days 
and "for the last time/' 

There will be no reorganization 
of the Church, because the Church 
will not become disorganized. The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, organized on the 6th 
day of April, in the year 1830, the 
anniversary of which we are cele- 
East, and he hobbled out on his 
wooden leg, — the man "mighty and 
brating today, has continued with- 
out hindrance, or rather without 
obstruction, has persisted and pre- 
vailed, right down, unbroken, to the 
time in which we live, and today 
we have the Church organized af- 
ter the pattern that God revealed ; 
not in a moment, nor in a day, it 
was a growth like all the works of 
God which started with "that which 
is small," as the Book of Mormon 
says, and "proceedeth forth to that 
which is great," but, as the Church 
grew and developed, so did it come 
to its completeness- and it has con- 
tinued. Section 107 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants gives the full order 
of the priesthood of God up to that 
date. Read it. Elders of Israel; 
read it, High Priests and Seventies, 
and priests and teachers and dea- 



cons and members, and become ac- 
quainted with the order of the 
Church, showing, as President 
Smith told us in the first session of 
this Conference, that the Church is 
presided over by "three presiding 
high priests chosen by the body, up- 
held and sustained by the faith and 
fellowship of the Church," and they 
stand at the head, and after them 
come the Twelve, holding equal 
authority when the First Presidency 
is removed by death or any other 
cause. The next quorum is that 
of the twelve apostles, and they 
form the presiding power in the 
Church when the first presidency 
has been dissolved by any means. 
When the Prophet Joseph died, the 
Church was not disorganized ; the 
First Presidency became extinct so 
to speak, but the Twelve Apostles 
came up in its place, as provided 
in the revelation, and took charge 
of the Church, and in due time three 
presiding high priests were chosen 
by and from the body, and became 
the Presidency of the Church, and 
the quorum of the twelve was filled 
up. And so it will be from time to 
time as changes come. If the First 
Presidency is dissolved from any 
cause, the Twelve will take their 
place, and when the First Presi- 
dency is reorganized the quorum of 
the Twelve will be filled up and the 
work will go on. The Lord has 
provided this for the perpetuity of 
the Church, that it may continue, 
that it may stand and abide and not 
be like the organizations that have 
been set up in times past. 

We can take up the Bible, the 
Old and the New Testaments, and 
read there predictions of men that 
were in power and authority in the 
Church in olden times, that the time 
would come "when darkness would 
cover the earth, and gross darkness

the people," and when many should 
"depart from the faith, giving heed 
to seducing spirits and doctrines of 
devils," when they would "turn away 
their ears from the truth, and turn 
unto fables." Paul declared after 
he had preached the Gospel in many 
places in the vicinity of Jerusalem, 
that the day of the coming of the 
Redeemer, which they had been 
looking for to occur very soon, 
would not come except a great "fall- 
ing away" would take place. But in 
the last days the Lord said he would 
establish his Church and Kingdom 
on the earth, and that it should 
stand forever. That it should not 
depart. That the Truth which 
would be revealed should not de- 
part from his people, "nor from 
their seed, nor from their seed's 
seed, henceforth even forever." . So 
we have the generations coming 
along, and stalwart, good, fine no- 
ble men and women proceed there- 
from, who are firm in the faith, 
who have the Truth in their hearts, 
who can bear testimony by the 
power of God, and their words go 
to the hearts of the people. And 
this will continue, and this Church 
shall never perish from the earth, 
nor become disorganized, for the 
Lord established it in such a way 
that it should continue and abide, no 
matter who might depart from it. 

If you or I, or any of us, should 
leave the Church, the Church would 
still go on. Do not let us think, 
any of us, that the Church owes us 
anything. We owe a great deal to 
the Church, for light and truth and 
every principle and ordinance and 
authority and organization of the 
priesthood, and of the helps and 
gifts that are in the Church for our 
comfort, our blessing, our union, 
and the continuation of power in 
the Church. They have come to us 



from God through the appointed 
authorities of the Church, and they 
will abide, no matter what we may 
do. We are indebted to the Lord 
through his servants for these 
things that we enjoy, and we owe 
all we are, and all we have, to this 
Church in a spiritual sense, and a 
great many of us in a temporal 
sense. I rejoice in this; I rejoice in 
the knowledge that God has set up 
his Church and Kingdom on the 
earth in the last days for the last 
time, and has so organized it that 
it shall continue and abide and shall 
not be overcome. The Lord says, 
"It is my good pleasure, little flock, 
to give unto you the Kingdom;" 
and the Kingdom is ours if we will 
obey these precepts and these com- 
mandments and counsels, and walk 
in the way of life, and be guided 
by those who are appointed. Let 
those who are appointed to labor 
in this ministry labor with all dili- 
gence, and give this Church all 
their powers and strength. 

I have endeavored, — I don't say it 
boastingly at all, — I have endeav- 
ored from the very start in this 
Church, over sixty-two years ago 
(when I received the priesthood of 
God, and was ordained an Elder, 
to go out and preach the Gospel, 
without pure or scrip), I have en- 
deavored to give this Church the 
full strength of my body and mind 
and spirit, which are the Lord's, and 
in that I have had joy and the tes- 
timony of Jesus, and God has 
blessed me and opened the eyes of 
my understanding, and given me 
to comprehend truths that have 
rejoiced my soul, and I feel I am 
baptized into them. All there is of 
me is the Lord's, and I want to de- 
vote it still to the building up of his 
Kingdom to my latest breath. And 
when I depart from this tabernacle

and enter into the world beyond the 
veil, I hope and believe that I shall 
have still to labor for the great 
cause of human redemption, for 
this work has to go on until the re- 
demption of man is completed, until 
"every knee shall bow and every 
tongue shall confess that Jesus is 
the Lord, to the glory of God the 
Father." 

When we depart, brethren, El- 
ders in Israel, and mingle with the 
spirits behind the veil, we will find 
an immense work there for us to do, 
and I am thankful in the knowledge 
that a great deal of the work has 
been prepared for us. We have been 
out in the world and preached the 
gospel to many thousands of people, 
and only a few comparatively have 
come into the Church and received 
its ordinances and its blessings and 
the testimony of Christ ; but thou- 
sands upon thousands have heard it, 
and it has touched their souls. They 
have steeled their hearts against 
it ; they have closed their eyes 
against the light ; and they have 
gone away from this stage of being 
into the ' world beyond, and every- 
thing they have learned and have 
heard, and understood while in the 
flesh, will come back to them when 
they "shuffle off this mortal coil," 
and their immortal spirits will be 
able to remember that which has oc- 
curred while they dwelt in the flesh, 
and we will find thousands upon 
thousands of people in the spirit 
world who are prepared for the 
ministration of the servants of God 
when they come among them. And 
so the work will go on, and the 
Gospel will be preached to the liv- 
ing, and it will be preached to the 
dead, and the work of the Lord 
will be triumphant, and the time 
will come when Satan shall not 
reign any more at all, but Christ 



shall reign, and the assembled mil- 
lions in the flesh and in the spirit 
will bow the knee to King Emman- 
uel and be willing to receive him, 
for he is the Life and the Light of 
this world, and he is the head to 
whom we must all grow up. 

Each man placed at the head of 
the Church on the earth is grow- 
ing up to Him. Every one who is 
called to the ministry is growing up 
to Him, and we are building up the 
Church and Kingdom of our God 
unto Christ, our Redeemer, and He 
will be the King and Lord of all. 
Blessed and honored be His glori- 
ous name, who died for us, that we 
might live, and who will bring us 
into His presence, and into the 
presence of the Father, for no man 
can come unto the Father except 
by Him. So, while we dwell on 
the earth, brethren and sisters, let 
us devote ourselves to the building 
up of this Kingdom, unto Him, and 
when He comes we will receive our 
share of the reward. "Behold, I 
come" he declares. "My reward 
is with Me, but My work is before 
me." Now let us perform our work 
and do our part, no matter what it 
may be, great or small, and unite 
together in one spirit, and be led 
by the light and give heed to the 
counsels and guidance of the man 
that is set at the head, and all will 
be well with the Church of Christ, 
and all will be well with our in- 
dividual standing. God bless us 
all and help us all to be faithful, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

There is no necessity for me to 
bear my testimony to every word and 
sentiment that has been expressed 
this morning by President Charles 



5 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



W. Penrose, for the simple reason 
that every Latter-day Saint in this 
audience knows, by the testimony 
of the Spirit of God, that he has 
taught us the Truth as the Lord 
has revealed it, and the standard 
doctrine of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, from 
which there can be no variation in 
righteousness. And I simply wanted 
to give expression to this fact, for 
it is true. I thank the Lord for 
such men as President Penrose and 
others we have, who have made a 
life study of the principles and or- 
dinances of the gospel, the order of 
the priesthood, the rights of the 
members of the Church, and the 
order of government therein, and 
who are enabled by the blessings of 
the Lord, to express themselves 
freely and to convey these princi- 
ples in such unmistakable clearness 
to the understanding of the people. 
I feel very grateful this morning 
for all that we have heard, and 
again, although there is no necessity 
for it, I bear my testimony without 
reserve to the truths that have been 
uttered here today. Not only so, 
but I also endorse and bear testi- 
mony to the sincerity and earnest- 
ness of those who have spoken, and 
to the most excellent spirit that has 
been manifested during our entire 
conference ; by the presidents of the 
missions, and by a few of the presi- 
dents of the stakes of Zion who 
have spoken to us. I would be glad 
if we had time to listen to those of 
the sixty-four presidents of the 
stakes of Zion, who are present in 
this conference. I would be de- 
lighted to have all the people hear 
the testimony of these men, to 
whom is entrusted by the Church 
and by the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, the responsibility of presid- 
ing in the household of faith. They 



are men of truth, of honor, of vir- 
tue, and of uprightness ; men who 
enjoy inspiration from God, men 
who exercise the privileges that be- 
long to their office and calling", and 
can speak, as the Lord inspires them 
to speak, the truth to the people, 
and we pray that the people will 
give heed to their teachings and up- 
hold and sustain them in their call- 
ings. The Lord bless the presiding 
officers of the Church throughout 
all the organized stakes of Zion, 
and throughout all the missions of 
the world, is my humble prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

Holy Temple," was sung by Sister 
Delia Daynes Hills ; words by Sister

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Unity of understanding prevailing among 
Church leaders.— Duty of all Saints to 
assist in reforming others. — Order of 
the Church provides for care of each 
individual. — The Church fortunate in 
having so many devoted servants. — 
Teachers benefit themselves by their 
instructions to others. 

We have all very greatly rejoiced 
in the experiences of this confer- 
ence, in the "feast of fat things" 
that has been set before us in such 
variety, and especially in the coun- 
sels of the President. I may say that 
the presidents of the stakes and mis- 
sions to whom we have listened, 
have the same testimony that has 
been borne by President Smith in 
our hearing. Every Latter-day 
Saint recognizes the voice of the 
Lord. We have been most thor- 
oughly instructed, and have wit- 
nessed the fact that the brethren 
who preside over the various de- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



67 



partments of the Church in the 
stakes and missions, so far as we 
have had time to hear them, have 
the same spirit, the same under- 
standing and clear comprehension 
of the revelations of the Lord in 
these last days. The brethren are 
here in great numbers, representa- 
tive brethren of the Church, from 
the missions, stakes, and wards of 
Zion, choice men, men who have 
had extensive experience, and if we 
had the time to hear from all these 
brethren, we would be astonished 
to discover what there is in their 
hearts, how thoroughly they are es- 
tablished in the truth. 

I was particularly impressed with 
the opening remarks of the Presi- 
dent. I believe we recognize the 
fact that it was an occasion of re- 
newing to the understanding of 
Latter-day Saints, in an impressive 
manner, the order, the law and dis- 
cipline of the Lord in His Church, 
and the responsibilities that abide 
with the quorums of the Priesthood 
and with the officials in all the as- 
sociations and organizations of the 
Church at home and abroad. We 
have been reminded not only of the 
order and records so important to 
be kept in the Church, and in the 
various departments thereof, not 
only the strict and careful prepara- 
tion that the Lord has made in the 
organization of His Church for the 
official care of His work in the 
earth, but there is brought to our 
attention, also the individual re- 
sponsibilities that rest upon every 
member of the Church, that rest 
upon every father and mother, and 
the requirements that are made of 
children to honor their parents, and 
thus honor the Lord. Our chief 
parent is our Father who is in 
Heaven, and in honoring our 
parents on the earth we honor our 



Heavenly Father. I know of no 
better way for us to honor God than 
by honoring those who have 
brought us into this world, to love 
our fathers and our mothers, to love 
the Lord, and to be found perform- 
ing perfectly, as far as possible, the 
requirements that are made of us. 
I believe that the time is opportune 
for the Church to take an advanced 
step or position in the ministry, and 
in taking care of the various depart- 
ments of the Church of Christ in 
the earth in advance of anything 
that we have experienced in the 
past. 

I desire to impress upon the 
minds of my brethren who are en- 
trusted with responsible positions, 
whether in stakes or wards, or quo- 
rums or other organizations, at 
home and in missions abroad, the 
necessity of our performing most 
faithfully and zealously the duties 
that devolve upon us, and that we 
do not wait upon somebody else, 
and trust to somebody else to do 
what is required of us individually. 
Parents should thoroughly instruct 
their children, that our posterity 
may look back to us as having done 
our duty by them; also that our 
neighbors may discover that we 
have been good to them, and as- 
sisted them upon the principles 
demonstrated so nicely here by the 
president of a stake, referring to a 
brother that he had found delin- 
quent, a man who had been true, 
trusty and faithful in the ministry, 
but nad grown cold and become 
something of a back-slider. His 
brother discovered his trouble, and 
wisely undertook the labor to im- 
prove him, reform him, and restore 
him to his former desirable condi- 
tion. Now that is not only the duty 
of that president of the stake, but 
every other president, and not only 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



presidents of stakes, but bishops of 
wards and counselors and high 
counselors, high priests and seven- 
ties, and it is the duty of parents 
with their children. It is the duty 
of brethren with their brothers, 
until the full purpose of God is per- 
formed in giving attention to his 
people. 

It is a marvelous work, a mar- 
velous organization that is estab- 
lished by the Lord to accomplish 
the salvation of the children of men, 
and it is all necessary. There has 
been nothing required by the Lord 
through his servants that was not 
necessary, and that was not indis- 
pensible, — everything that is neces- 
sary for our salvation is indispen- 
sible. We must not forsake the way 
of life and salvation that is marked 
out for us. Hence, I desire to im- 
press upon my brethren and sisters 
present today, as has been so beau- 
tifully done by our file leaders, and 
by the other brethren whose voices 
we have listened to, that we shall 
do better in the future, in fact, that 
we shall do right in the future, and 
that we shall not do any wrong; 
that we shall not neglect our duties, 
but remember them and perform 
them to the satisfaction of the Lord, 
and His Spirit will guide us, for 
every man in every place and po- 
sition in this Church is entitled to 
the inspiration of the Lord in the 
responsibilities that rest upon him. 

The responsibility rests upon 
those who preside over us to care 
for, instruct, prompt, assist and di- 
rect us in our labors and ministry. 
The bishops of wards, and presi- 
dents of stakes, should take care of 
the responsibility that rests upon 
each of them, so that every person 
that needs their attention may re- 
ceive it. It is the sick that need 
the physician, and these brethren 



are our spiritual physicians. I have 
a physician of that kind in the ward 
where I live, a bishop, and he al- 
ways keeps a careful eye on me, he 
knows pretty well where I am and 
what I am doing. Every man in 
the Church is entitled to the care 
and supervision of a bishop, and 
to the care and supervision of a 
high council and presidency of a 
stake, or president of the mission, 
wherever he may be located. It is 
those who preside over us that are 
to direct, and counsel and instruct 
us. There is no one in this Church 
but what has some one to care for 
him and assist him in his ministry, 
from the President of the Church to 
the least in the fold. It is the Lord's 
business to regulate and take care 
of the Presidency of the Church, 
and it is the business of the Presi- 
dency of the Church to take care 
of the Church, to preside over the 
Church, and direct the labors and 
efforts of those who bear the priest- 
hood. It is not the duty of the 
members to regulate and set in or- 
der those who preside over them. It 
is not the duty of the twelve apos- 
tles to regulate the Presidency of 
the Church, but the Presidency 
always directs the labors of the 
twelve ; and the Presidency and the 
twelve regulate and set in order the 
affairs of the Church throughout 
the world, assisted by those who 
bear the priesthood and have their 
particular positions and places of 
labor assigned them ; so that there 
is order and discipline. The Spirit 
of the Lord guides the affairs of the 
Church, and the Lord watches over 
and preserves it. 

When President Penrose was re- 
ferring to his experiences in this 
Church, I did not think that I had 
been so long in the Church as he, 
but I find we have about the same 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



GO 



length of time. I joined this Church 
sixty-five years ago. Of course, I 
was born of Latter-day Saint 
parents eight years before that, and 
have been acquainted with all the 
leaders of the Church from the be- 
ginning, in my boyhood and in my 
manhood, I have known them. I 
have known the leaders, not only 
of the Church, but the leaders of 
stakes and other departments of the 
Kingdom. It has been my lot to be 
with these presidents of stakes, 
bishops of wards, and leading 
brethren, and I can say they are all 
inspired with the same spirit. I 
want to bear that testimony be- 
cause I am well acquainted with so 
many of the brethren of the Church, 
they have the same spirit that was 
manifested by the brethren who 
have spoken in this conference ; that 
spirit dwells in the hearts of all 
presidents and counselors to presi- 
dents, in all high councilors, in all 
bishops and counselors to bishops, 
and presidents of quorums. That 
same spirit dwells in the hearts of 
all these brethren who assemble 
here from year to year to take 
counsel from those who preside 
over us, and they are seasoned and 
tried material, reliable and trusty. 
This body of men sitting on the 
stand here, the Presidency, the 
twelve, the presiding seventy, pre- 
siding bishopric, and presiding pa- 
triarch, you know that we are labor- 
ing with you all the time. We are 
occupied from the beginning of the 
year until its close, on all occasions 
when we are needed in the midst of 
the people, we are with the brethren 
and counsel with them. When men 
are needed for official positions, we 
look for the very choicest and best 
brethren that we can find ; we coun- 
sel with the priesthood. The breth- 
ren are always willing to help us, 



they bear their share of responsi- 
bility, and it is a rare thing that a 
mistake is made, we rarely get the 
wrong man. As a rule the right 
man is designated by the inspiration 
of the Lord. We can hardly make 
a mistake in this regard, for the 
councils of the stakes of Zion are 
made up of choice high priests ; they 
are sober, honest, upright and con- 
scientious. We love them, we 
counsel together, and are in each 
other's confidence and fellowship, 
and in the fellowship and confidence 
of the people. I consider President 
Smith is a fortunate president of 
this Church, coming to the condi- 
tions that the Church has reached 
at the present time, so extended and 
numerous, so many stakes, wards, 
and missions, and so thoroughly 
manned with men of integrity. 
Their hearts are inspired and full 
of faith, and the Lord recognizes 
them ; every one of them has been 
called of God ; if any one has 
"shown the white feather" on any 
occasion, it has not been because he 
was not the right man for the place, 
it has been because he has not had 
the courage and strength to stand 
up and carry the load. The Lord 
makes no mistake in calling men ; 
if we fail, it is our own weakness, 
for the Lord is ready to give 
strength sufficient to sustain the 
brethren in the responsibilities that 
are upon them. It is expected that 
these men shall be so advised and 
instructed that they will take care 
of matters that are entrusted to 
them, that the shoulders of the 
Presidency of this Church shall not 
be broken, that they shall not be 
overloaded with responsibility and 
care. The general affairs of the 
Kingdom keep them busy all the 
time. It is the duty of these men, 
such as have been talking to us 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



here, from the missions and from 
the stakes of Zion, to take care of 
the affairs in their respective dis- 
tricts, to take care of the army of 
the priesthood and the associations ; 
and so with the bishops of wards, 
it is their duty to take care of mat- 
ters that arise in their wards. 

Occasionally we have a little 
trouble, not very often. When I 
come to think of it, and look over 
the field, I notice it is a rare thing 
that there is a ward in the Church 
that develops any conditions that 
are serious, and they don't become 
chronic. Matters of difficulty and 
trouble between brethren should be 
settled at once, taken care of and 
relief brought immediately to those 
who are in trouble in the wards, 
quorums, or auxiliary organiza- 
tions. Every man who has received 
responsibility should feel it resting 
upon him, just as every father and 
every mother should feel, and every 
member in this Church, as sug- 
gested by Brother Paul in ancient 
times in instructing his Brother 
Timothy in regard to the labors of 
a bishop. He made this important 
suggestion, that I think possibly has 
not been comprehended as it should 
be, that a bishop should be apt to 
teach. Now, it is not any truer that 
a bishop should be apt as a teacher 
than it is that every other Latter- 
day Saint should be apt as a teacher. 
Fathers, mothers, brethren and sis- 
ters should be teachers. Every mem- 
ber of this Church that has be- 
come converted into the fold and 
into the doctrines of the Lord Jesus 
Christ should convert their neigh- 
bors, or labor for that purpose. 
Hence, I would like to impress upon 
the Latter-day Saints, in conference 
assembled, the importance of every 
member of this Church cultivating 
an aptitude for teaching, be teach- 



ers, and help others, just as the ex- 
ample set by our brother who spoke 
here yesterday, helping to redeem 
others. We can't always save them, 
but we should do something, and 
generally we will be successful. The 
more experience we have in that 
line the more successful we will be, 
and the more successful we will be 
in our own lives, for the men who 
are teachers, and are apt to teach, 
always get the first good out of the 
instructions that are given, for it 
is better that a man teach than that 
he be taught, as it is better that a 
man should give than that he should 
receive. It is better to help others, 
do something for others, for when 
that is done it brings the most pleas- 
ure, it profits those who perform 
the mission. I want to so exhort 
my brethren, that they shall take 
care of the field that is entrusted to 
them, that their responsibilities shall 
be faithfully performed, and I 
promise them that the Lord will be 
with them. 

I want to bear my testimony, not 
only in regard to what President 
Penrose said this morning, for he 
said exactly the truth, and a great 
deal of it, and so did President 
Smith. Every word they spoke and 
•every instruction they gave were 
words inspired of God. It was the 
Lord that put tho~° things in the 
hearts of our brethren to declare 
to us. The truth presented by our 
brethren in such great variety was 
from the Lord. I want it impressed 
upon our hearts that the men of 
God, who are placed in the position 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
his successors, have been the only 
men authorized to speak the Word 
and Will of God for Israel and the 
world. 

And so it will be while this 
Church and this earth stand, we 



ELDER LEVI 

have the sure guide for us, the key- 
note is : Stay with and listen to 
the man who stands at the head of 
this Church, who is entrusted by the 
Lord, and we will make no mis- 
takes, we will not go astray. The 
Lord will guide him, and he speaks 
as the Lord Himself would speak in 
regard to these matters. Let us 
listen, let our ears be open to hear 
what the Lord says through His 
servant. And how grateful we 
ought to be for this important boon 
and blessing that He has established 
in the earth. That is my testimony 
to you. The mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Was divine, just as divine 
and sacred as that of the Savior, for 
it was the Savior who sent him, 
who selected him, and trained him 
and knew him from the beginning, 
and there was no mistake. It was 
the order and will of God when he 
was brought forth as the represen- 
tative of the Lord in these last days. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren, and sisters, and to bless 
all Israel, and to pour out His 
spirit upon us, that we may take 
care of the responsibilites that rest 
upon us individually, as well as in 
quorums and in associations and 
stakes of Zion, that all may pros- 
per and be blessed together, breth- 
ren and sisters, in their official as 
well as in their private capacities, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

"From afar, gracious Lord, Thou 
hast gathered Thy flock." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Wm. H. Smart.

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I hope that what is said this 
morning may be dictated by the 
Spirit of the Lord. I have been very 
greatly impressed with the services 
of this conference. There is one 
phase of the meetings of yesterday 
and day before that, to me, is a 
study in social intelligence. I think 
you were all impressed in the same 
way. When a man of the type of 
President Joseph F. Smith as "leader 
of this Church, can stand before 
an audience of eight or ten thou- 
sand people, and call men from the 
congregation to the stand, in a mag- 
nificent building like the tabernacle, 
and have those men come forth and 
speak with the intelligence that they 
did, I say that it is a study in social 
intelligence which should impress 
everybody greatly. It is a known 
fact that in the Christian world 
there are few men, comparatively 
speaking, who can -give any reason 
for their lives, for the hopes that 
they have, for their attitude toward 
the higher life, and I doubt if you 
could get as many men in all of this 
country to speak on the spur of the 
moment, as we can get within the 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



membership of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am 
this morning impressed with the 
thought, that "Mormonism" finds 
its power and efficacy after all in 
the human heart, that it is directed 
and inspired by the best that is in 
life and the best that can come from 
the throne of Almighty God. 

I can speak to you but a few mo- 
ments, but I want to leave this mes- 
sage with you. If there is anything 
needed today in the world, it is a 
knowledge of Jesus, the Christ. I 
believe that after all the only salva- 
tion for the social, political, eco- 
nomic and religious conditions of 
"■he world today is through the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

We hear a great deal of what we 
call the philosophy of "Mormon- 
ism." It was only yesterday that 
I was asked this question : Of what 
I believe to be the philosophy of the 
social aspect of "Mormonism?" I 
did not know what the question 
meant. It was indefinite. But I 
wish to make this reply to it: If 
people would only hark back to the 
simplicity of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and get that simplicity in 
their hearts, first, last and all the 
time, there would be no time what- 
ever for idle gossip, idle talk and 
idle thoughts, if you please, con- 
cerning the meaning of this religion 
and the meaning of life. We are 
becoming, I sometimes think, too 
complex. We are growing out of 
harmony with all that is best in life, 
because of our trying to cope with 
what I call the mechanical fads and 
fashions of the day. The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Sains rests upon the teachings 
of the greatest Soul, yet the 
simplest Soul, in expression and 
in thought; it rests upon the 
thought of the Redeemer of the 



world, whose every act, whose 
every word, was so simple, so child- 
like, so clean, so enlightened, that 
kings would bow to him. And we 
are told by tradition, in the Talmud, 
that little children kissed his hand.' 
Now there is a thought there that 
we must not forget, and in this day 
and age of the world, in this con- 
fusion of life, all of us are working 
very, very hard to make life full of 
meaning, and to get out of it all that 
is best. He lives best who thinks 
best; he acts best, who loves best; 
he becomes the greatest light, the 
greatest influence in his religion of 
the pure Christ, when he passes on 
through life honestly, and when his 
whole body and soul in activity vi- 
brates to the simplicity of the gos- 
pel of Christ. Now I say I was^im- 
pressed with this thing on yester- 
day, and it is a study of social in- 
telligence. 

. 1 am proud of this people. I be- 
lieve we are already taking the 
leadership of intelligence and mor- 
ality in the world. That is my can- 
did belief, and I have a right to say 
it. I believe that we have already 
set the pace for the solution of the 
social problem. I think we have set 
the pace for the solution of all the 
problems that concern the human 
race. I believe in the efficacy and 
in the power of men who hold the 
priesthood of God, because it is only 
through the priesthood that these 
problems will ultimately be solved. 
Another thing that I think has been 
impressive in this conference is this 
fact — you know, by the way, we all 
go home asking ourselves what les- 
sons we have got out of the meet- 
ing; we should certainly do that — 
this meeting will do me and you no 
good unless you and I carry into 
our hearts a real, good reason, 
thought and suggestion to put into

our lives tomorrow and the next 
day and all the days to come. 

Now I say another thought has 
impressed me very forcibly in this 
conference thus far. It is the fact 
that there is a difference between 
priestcraft and priesthood. Priest- 
craft is the hierarchy of a man-made 
government ; it is a result of man's 
force and energy. Priesthood is the 
expression of the power of Al- 
mighty God in the soul, the very 
being of men who bear that divine 
calling. Historically, socially, re- 
ligiously, there is a difference be- 
tween priestcraft and priesthood. 

My brethren and sisters, we are 
living in a very great age. I believe 
that we are all going to be more or 
less agitated at times in our feel- 
ings concerning things that are said 
and done towards us and said about 
us. But the glorious thing about 
this Church, if we are living our re- 
ligion, is that nothing in the world 
can hurt us. You know nothing 
can injure truth. Truth has, it is 
quite true, but one enemy, and that 
is untruth. Untruth has two ene- 
mies, truth and itself. And my 
faith is that truth in any line will 
always become • pre-eminent, pre- 
dominant, and will always win out 
in the end. If we are living our re- 
ligion as best we can, nothing from 
outside can ever injure us. The in- 
jury would come from our own 
hearts, our own activities, our own 
passions. So I say it behooves us 
as Latter-day Saints to study very 
hard, to think very accurately, and 
to allow our activities and our 
words to become mere expressions 
of our inner souls, and lives. 

We ought to have ideals. We 
ought to have greater ideals every 
day. We ought to have greater 
dreams. I claim there never has 
been anything accomplished by a 



man unless he dreamed dreams and 
had visions of greater things. I 
glory when a Latter-day Saint says 
to me: "I dream, I have my vision 
of greater things," because that is 
pre-eminently the gift of God to 
man, and when men do dream, 
when men have their visions, then 
will men have their ideals, and will 
strive to carry these ideals out and 
make of life the greatest, the glori- 
ous thing that God had intended it 
to be. I love the man or the woman 
who goes from day to day, staking 
his whole being upon the fact that 
in his life there is but one sum and 
substance, and that is work. 

Recently, in an interview, a man 
asked when these "Mormon" men 
and women found time, for joy or 
fun, for, he said, "it seems to me 
that the men and the women vou 
have here are all working, work- 
ing." It is in our work that we find 
our joy. It is in our work that we 
find our light and our happiness. It 
is in our work that we discover our 
lives. So we must work and never 
become discouraged. We must 
study and look up to the higher 
light, for there is always a higher 
light. God pity the man or the 
woman who has never seen it. We 
must learn to live ideally and ideal- 
istically. We must learn not always 
to say things that are practical in 
the sense of being materialistic. We 
must become practical but we must 
get away from the materialistic at 
times, and live the spirit which 
comes of God. That is practical. 
Some people get the idea, you know, 
that if any one lives a spiritual life, 
he is not practical. That is another 
thing that has impressed me in this 
conference, that men say by their 
lives that they are spiritualistic, and 
yet they make life real, practical, 
and true. We should then study the 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. We should study the Holy 
Bible. We should study that equally 
great book, the Book of Mormon. 
We should find our rest, our peace, 
expressed in the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants. I want to say here — and 
every man has a right to believe 
what he wishes and to hold 
what he wishes to be true — T want 
to say to you, Read the book, the 
Pearl of Great Price, and read the 
Book of Abraham. The Pearl of 
Great Price I hold to be one of the 
most intelligent, one of the most 
religious books that the world has 
ever had ; but, more than that, to me 
the Pearl of Great Price is true in 
its name. It contains an ideal of 
life that is higher and grander and 
more glorious than I think is found 
in the pages of any other book un- 
less it be the Holy Bible. It be- 
hooves us to read these things, un- 
derstand them ; and I thank God 
when they are attacked, because it 
brings to me, after a study and 
thought, back to the fact that what 
God has given He has given, and 
He has nothing to retract. 

God bless you in your work, and 
may we be united as a people, for in 
unity there is strength. Let us learn. 
Let us learn to look up. Let us 
learn that God made the stars and 
the sun and the moon for us. Life 
is too big, too noble, too true for 
us to stoop to low things. We have 
not time to talk about our neighbor. 
We have not time to speak unkind 
thoughts. We should be so active 
that every moment counts for the 
better life, and our dreams and our 
hopes and our ambitions should be 
lodged in the light of God, and our 
verv activities should be making for 
His Kingdom. This applies to us 
all. And so let us take from this 
conference great thoughts. Let us 



find in it the kernel in the nut. Let 
us see to it that we carry these 
great thoughts home with us, and 
as much as possible weave them into 
our lives, that our lives may be 
made more resonant, more fruitful, 
that we may harmonize our very 
beings with the light, and with the 
will and the kingdom of God more 
each day. Then will the world sav 
of us, that our light, the light of 
"Mormonism," so shines that it be- 
comes the ideal for the world to 
follow. 

The gospel is true, every word of 
it. Jesus is the Christ. Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, and 
the revelation of God to his children 
will make it known better and bet- 
ter every day and every hour. God 
bless you. Amen.

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have greatly rejoiced at the tes- 
timonies, teachings and spirit of this 
conference, and I trust that by the 
blessings of the Lord the feast may 
continue. 

The Constitutional Convention, 
over which the late lamented Prest. 
John Henry Smith presided, de- 
clared that "a frequent recurrence 
to fundamental principles is essen- 
tial to the securitv of individual 
rights and the perpetuity of free 
government." I think that truth is 
equallv apolicable in the Church, 
and that it was altogether timely 
and appropriate for the Presidency 
of the Church to refer to the funda- 
mental principles underlying the or- 
ganization of the Church and the 
practice of the priesthood, so that

the exceptional, justifiable under 
exceptional circumstances, might 
not tend to crystalize into the estab- 
lished rule of practice. Like others 
of the speakers, I am not afraid 
that the third, the fourth and sub- 
sequent generations in the Church 
will forsake the gospel, if they are 
only properly indoctrinated in the 
principles of the Church. The dan- 
ger is when they do not know the 
truth. 

I met, sometime ago, a young 
student from the East, of "Mor- 
mon" parentage, who was a little 
adrift and had his doubts, because 
so called evil exists in the world. 
His attention had not been called 
to the doctrines of the Church in 
reference to that subject, which 
poets and philosophers have wres- 
tled with. The poet Pope discussed 
the question when he reached the 
conclusion that, 

"All nature is but art unknown to thee, 
All chance, direction which thou canst 
not see ; 

All discord, harmony not understood, 
All partial evil, universal good." 

A familiar song declares that, 
"There is no song within our glad 
heart singing but has an echo of 
some minor strain." That amid the 
leaves of the most beautiful rose, a 
thorn is to be found ; that the 
brightest, day closes in shadows and 
in darkness, etc. 

The poet Holland, in his beau- 
tiful poem entitled, "Bitter Sweet," 
considered the question in a very 
deep and thoughtful way, and when 
faith came to him, finally concludes : 

"Evil is only the slave of good ; 

Sorrow the servant of joy, 
And the soul is mad that refuses food 

Of the meanest in God's employ. 
The fountain of joy is fed by tears, 

And love is lit by the breath of sighs , 



The deepest griefs and the wildest fears 

Have holiest ministries. 
Strong grows the oak in the sweeping 
storm 

Safely the flower sleeps under the 
snow ; 

And the farmer's hearth is never warm 
Till the cold wind starts to blow." 

The poet Tennyson considers the 
question also, and concludes, or ex- 
claims : 

"O yet we trust that somehow good 
Will be the final goal of ill, 
That nothing walks with aimless feet, 
That not one life shall be destroyed 
Or cast as rubbish to the void, 
When God hath made the pile com- 
plete ; 

That not a worm is cloven in vain ; 

That not a moth with vain desire 

Is shriveled in a fruitless fire, 

But subserves another's gain. 

I can but trust that good will fall 

At last — far off— at last, to all, 

And every winter change to spring." 

But I know of no literature that 
discusses the question more intelli- 
gently or philosophically than it is 
discussed in the Book of Mormon. 
Lehi, in speaking, to his son Jacob, 
says : 

"For it must needs be that there is an 
opposition in all things. If not so, my 
first born in the wilderness, righteous- 
ness could not be brought to pass, 
neither wickedness, neither holiness, nor 
misery, neither good nor bad. Where- 
fore, all things must needs be a com- 
pound in one. Wherefore if it should 
be one body, it must needs remain as 
dead, having no life, neither death nor 
corruption nor incorruption, happiness 
nor misery, neither sense nor insensi- 
bility. Wherefore it must needs have 
been created for a thing of naught. 
Wherefore there would have been no 
purpose in the end of its creation. 
Wherefore this thing must needs de- 
stroy the wisdom of God and his eternal 
purposes, and also the power and the 
mercy and the justice of God. And if 
ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also 
say there is no sin. If ye shall say 
there is no sin, ye shall also say there 



76

is no righteousness ; and if there be no 
righteousness, there be no happiness. 
And if there be no righteousness nor 
happiness, there be no punishment nor 
misery. And if these things are not, 
there is no God. And if there is no God, 
we are not, neither the earth, for there 
could have been no creation of things, 
neither to act nor to be acted upon. 
Wherefore all things must have van- 
ished away. And now, my sons, I speak 
unto you these things for your profit 
and learning. For there is a God, and 
He hath created all things, both the 
heavens and the earth, and all things 
that in them are, both things to act and 
things to be acted upon, and to bring 
about His eternal purposes in the end 
of man, after he had created our first 
parents, and the beasts of the field and 
the fowls of the air, and in fine all 
things which are created, it must needs 
be that there was an opposition ; even 
the forbidden fruit in opposition to the 
tree of life ; the one being sweet and 
the other bitter ; wherefore the Lord 
God gave unto man that he should act 
for himself. Wherefore man could not 
act for himself, save it should be that 
he was enticed by the one or the other." 

My young friend would really 
have done away with the free agen- 
cy of man, if the universe had been 
planned after his order. Every- 
thing would be on the dead level of 
sameness ; no extreme of cold, no 
extreme of heat, the temperature 
always being medium ; no darkness 
in contrast with light, no evil in 
contrast with good, no sorrow in 
opposition to joy, etc. These oppo- 
sites, as we are clearly informed in 
the Book of Mormon, really go to 
the question of free agency in this 
world of ours. 

Some of the speakers commented 
upon the fact that we might expect, 
or that it was a little strange that 
there were not, larger numbers in 
the world flocking to the standard 
of "Mormonism," in view of its 
glorious principles. One reason 
there are not greater numbers con- 
verted is that the "Mormon" people 



have been misunderstood and their 
doctrines misunderstood. We have 
been to the world as "ships that 
pass in the night," as Longfellow 
gives us the figure in his Tales of a 
W ayside Inn : 

"Ships that pass in the night, 

They speak one another in passing, 

Only a signal shown 

And a distant voice in the darkness 

So on the ocean of life, 

We pass and speak one another. 

Only a voice and a glance, 

Then darkness again and a silence." 

Individuals living even under the 
same roof do not in all respects un- 
derstand one another. Some of the 
most serious tragedies that have 
come to my attention have been on 
account of a misunderstanding even 
by those who were very close to one 
another by the ties of kinship and 
affection. If those beneath the same 
roof may not understand one an- 
other aright, is it to be expected 
that those living remote from us 
should not have a misconception of 
our ideals and doctrines? Those 
brethren who responded yesterday, 
and who gave such strong testi- 
monies to the truth of the gospel, 
were men who probably have not 
had the direct call of a heavenly 
messenger. The voice does not 
come to all as it came to Moses in 
the burning bush ; not always as it 
came upon the Mount, amid the 
thunderings and lightnings; not 
always with cloven tongues of fire; 
and yet the silent call of the still 
small voice, the call of the divine, 
led these men and tens of thousands 
of others into the Church, in many 
cases in the face of contumely, 
scorn, sarcasm, and disinheritance; 
but the call was so potent to them, 
the call of the divine in their souls, 
that they were willing to bear ostra- 
cism of society, the disinheritance

of their parents, to devote their lives 
to the truth, although it might 
mean, in a certain sense, a life of 
hardship, toil and trouble. Yet joy 
unspeakable came to them, the su- 
preme joy of knowing that their 
lives were in harmony with the In- 
finite, and that they were respond- 
ing to the silent call of the divine 
voice. 

I must not occupy more of your 
time. May the Lord bless you, I 
pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

As I picked up the Bible in the 
commencement of our services for 
the purpose of finding a certain 
passage in Jeremiah, I opened me- 
chanically to another part of the 
Sacred Volume, to find myself look- 
ing into that part called the Apoc- 
rypha, without knowing that the 
books known by that name were 
contained in this particular edition 
of the Bible lying here on the stand. 
But finding myself looking into the 
second book of Esdras, a passage 
occurred to my mind, which I will 
read : 

"And whereas thou sawest that he 
gathered another peaceable people unto 
him. These are the Ten Tribes which 
were carried away captives out of their 
own land in the time of Oseas, the king, 
whom Salmanaser, the king of the As- 
syrians, took captive and crossed them 
beyond the river ; so were they brought 
into another land, but they took this 
council to themselves, that they would 
leave the multitude of the heathen and 
go forth onto a further country, where 
never man dwelt, that they might keep 
the statutes, which they never kept in 
their own land. And they entered in 



at the narrow passages of the river 
Euphrates, for the most High then 
showed them signs and staid the springs 
of the flood till they were passed over ; 
for through the country there was great 
journey, even of a year and a half, and 
the same region is called Arsareth." (2 
Esdras 13:39-45.) 

A few years ago I had occasion 
to visit the land of Palestine, and 
having made a very interesting lit- 
tle tour to the top of Mount Tabor, 
and to the Sea of Galilee, and had 
also visited Cana, in Galilee, where 
Jesus turned water into wine, I 
found myself back in the little city 
of Nazareth ; thence turning my 
face toward the south, I commenced 
a journey of about eighty miles 
through the heart of Galilee and 
Samaria to Jerusalem. On that 
journey I crossed the plain of Es- 
draelon, and passed by the village 
of Nain, where the widow's son 
was raised from the dead in the 
days of old by our Redeemer. I 
also passed by Endor, where the 
woman with a familiar spirit lived 
in the days of Saul, climbed up the 
slopes of Mount Gilboa, where Saul 
committed suicide and his sons were 
slain, and passed through Dothan, 
where Joseph was sold by his breth- 
ren to the Ishmaelitish merchants, 
who took him down to Egypt and 
there sold him. .1 next found my- 
self passing through Samaria, the 
old capital of the Ten Tribes. Turn- 
ing thence a little toward the east, 
I came to Shechem, and a little east 
of that I found myself on the plains 
of Moran, where is situated the 
well of Jacob and the tomb of 
Joseph. Changing again my course 
of travel toward the south, I trav- 
ersed the plains of Moran in their 
entire length, and from the south 
end of the plain I found myself 
climbing the mountains until I 
reached the town of Bethel, where 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, 
had a peculiar dream, in which he 
saw angels passing" up and down, 
as it were, on a ladder that seemed 
to connect heaven and earth. And 
turning my face toward the east a 
little, I beheld a town situated about 
half way between Luz and Bethel 
and the Jordan River, and that town 
I was told by my Arabian com- 
panion was known as Ephraim. At 
once it dawned upon me that I 
stood in the midst of the mountains 
of Ephraim, and that here was the 
land where the Ten Tribes dwelt, 
particularly the strongest of all 
those tribes, the tribe of Joseph or 
the tribe of Ephraim. I could not 
then help thinking of this passage 
that I have just read. When I 
looked toward the east, I imagined 
that I could see far away over the 
plains of Syria into the land of 
Chaldea, where Abraham once 
dwelt, and where he was told by 
the Lord to leave the land of his 
fathers and come to live as a 
stranger in the land of Canaan. I 
thought of how his children, or his 
descendants. subsequently went 
down into Egypt, where they dwelt 
several hundred years, and after- 
wards came back under Moses and 
Joshua, and took possession of the 
land of Canaan, which was then 
divided between the twelve tribes, 
and how still later, when the chil- 
dren of Israel did not keep the com- 
mandments of God, they divided up 
into the Northern and Southern 
Kingdom, the tribe of Judah and 
part of another tribe onlv remaining 
loyal to the house of David, while 
the Ten Tribes revolted, and chose 
another king. In this divided con- 
dition the children of Israel lived 
for a number of years, until the 
wrath of the Almighty was kin- 
dled against them, because they 



would not serve the God of 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but 
worshiped strange gods, and the 
consequence was that Salmane- 
sar came over from Assyria and 
took them over the river Tigres 
some seven hundred miles from 
Samaria. Here we come to the 
events narrated in the passage 
which I have read, where it says 
that the people counseled among 
themselves, and as they did not like 
to live among the heathens, they 
took their goods and chattels and 
started on a long journey, disap- 
pearing in the lands of the north. 
From history we do not know any- 
thing more of them than that. That 
is where history ends, if we can call 
the apocryphical writings of Esdras 
history. There are undoubtedly 
many things in Esdras that are just 
as reliable as things found in the 
scriptures that are called canonical. 

We are at the present time com- 
mencing investigations from the 
other end. We are looking very 
deep into genealogy. We have 
genealogical societies organized. 
Among others we have the Genea- 
logical Society of Utah, of which a 
number of you perhaps are mem- 
bers. Genealogical societies are try- 
ing their best to hunt up all the in- 
formation they can about our fore- 
fathers, and in a private way we 
are endeavoring to go back as far 
as we can to know from whence 
we sprang. 

It is a source of great pride on 
the part of many Americans who 
live on this side of the Atlantic 
Ocean, to trace their ancestry back 
to some ship, commencing with the 
"Mavflower," that brought the 
Anglo-Saxons over to America. It 
is a source of pride, I say, for them 
to trace back their ancestry to that 
ship, or some other ship, that came 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON. 



79 



over to this land bringing immi- 
grants who laid the foundation of 
this great commonwealth. In trac- 
ing our genealogy we soon find our- 
selves on the other side of the water 
among the English people — not 
among the descendants of the old 
Britons, as a rule, but among the 
English people. And the question 
is then : Whence came the English 
people? We understand, of course, 
the close relationship between those 
on this side and those on the other 
side of the Atlantic Ocean ; and we 
are pleased to note that the two 
great Anglo-Saxon nations are the 
banner-bearers today of liberty and 
the equal rights of men. I take un- 
usual interest in this proposition, 
because England is ruling her colo- 
nies with the same degree of liber- 
ality as that which governs the 
States of our own Union on this 
side of the Atlantic. This you can 
find out personally if you visit Aus- 
tralia, New Zealand, and other Eng- 
lish colonies, as well as Canada, 
where the people are enjoying free- 
dom and liberty, the same as we are 
in the United States of America. 
But whence came the Anglo-Sax- 
ons ? Going back into English his- 
tory, we read of the Danish and of 
the Norman conquests. But before 
that, we read about Horsa and Hen- 
gist, who came over the North Sea 
about 449 years after the birth of 
our Savior, and took possession of 
England. We need not look into 
the details of the history of the 
wars, though we naturally think of 
how the Vikings fought with the 
Picts of Scotland and afterwards 
subdued the Celts or Britons, and 
introduced what we call the English 
language in the British Isles. 

In the northern part of Europe 
we find a strong race of people, 
known as the Germanic race. We 



also notice as a branch of the Ger- 
manic race the Scandinavians. The 
ancestors of the Germans, the 
Swedes, the Norwegians and the 
Danes subscribed to a universal 
mythology, and have to a certain 
extent a common history, and when 
we read their histories by different 
authors, all agree in stating that the 
first inhabitants of those northern 
countries migrated to the north 
from the central part of western 
Asia. This is especially true of 
those who dwelt in ancient Saxony 
— not the present Saxony, where 
Dresden and Leipsig are located, 
but the old Saxony which was a 
part of the present Hanover, Mech- 
lenburg and Holstein, etc., and the 
Angles, who lived in a country a 
little further north known as Schles- 
wig and Jutland. It is universally 
understood that the early inhabi- 
tants of the Scandinavian countries 
came from Asia. Take up any his- 
tory that traces the Scandinavian 
and German peoples, and they will 
agree that tradition points to the 
fact that these early Scandinavian 
and Germanic races came from the 
very part of Asia where the Ten 
Tribes were lost. 

This to me is a most interesting 
study. Referring again to the 
mythology of the Scandinavians 
and Germans, what do you find? A 
religion of good morals. I venture 
to say that if modern Christianity, 
corrupted as it is today, is a rem- 
nant of the true Christianity intro- 
duced by our Savior; if the Free 
Masonry of today is a remnant and 
corruption of the true signs and 
tokens of the Priesthood revealed 
in the days of Solomon, when the 
Temple of Solomon was built, then 
it is easy for us to understand and 
believe that the mythology of the 
north is simply a corruption of 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the true Jehovah-worship, as Abra- 
ham knew it and taught it to his 
children. It is an easy thing to un- 
derstand and believe this, because 
the mythology of the north is so 
godlike, chaste and morally pure, 
that it is almost heaven compared 
with the voluptuous worship which 
was known and practiced in the 
South. I refer particularly to the 
Latin and Greek mythologies, and 
those worships that were adopted 
by the people of the South or the 
lands bordering on the Mediter- 
ranean. 

A great deal could be said in re- 
gard to this most interesting theme. 
We can approach the subject from 
the earliest dawn of history down 
the stream of time as far as we 
can reach ; and then we can proceed 
the other way, going back from 
ourselves as far as we can, and we 
meet the proposition in Scandinavia 
and Northern Germany that the 
Anglo Saxons, the Germans and the 
Scandinavians are greatly mixed 
up with the remnants of the House 
of Israel. We can scarcely come 
to any other conclusion. Then we 
naturally spring another question: 
Why have the Latter-day Saint 
missionaries met with much more 
success among the Anglo-Saxons 
and the German and Scandinavian 
races, than among any other races 
upon the face of the earth? The 
answer is : We are, in fulfillment 
of the predictions of the ancient 
Prophets, gathering Israel. Why 
do we have so much to say at the 
present time, and at this conference, 
about the second, third, fourth and 
fifth generations of Latter-day 
Saints? It is the most natural thing 
in the world. If we are of 
Israel, our genealogy must assume 
a shape like that, for the children 
of Israel, if not corrupted by en- 



vironments, will naturally worship 
the God of their fathers. And we 
are of Israel ; there is no doubt of 
it, and we will find that when our 
genealogy is revealed in detail, it 
will lead us back from America to 
England, from England to Scandi- 
navia and Germany, and from there 
to the country lying between the 
Caspian and the Black Sea, that part 
of Asia where the Ten Tribes were 
lost. We can then easily trace it 
back to Palestine and Chaldea ; we 
have the history completed from the 
Bible. 

I rejoice that so many faithful 
men and women have believed and 
embraced the gospel as it has been 
preached by the Latter-day Saints 
during the last eighty years. I re- 
peat, that when we have turned our 
attention to Latin or Oriental coun- 
tries, we have met with but little 
success. If we have preached the 
gospel successfully in Australia, it 
is perhaps because the people there 
are mainly of English origin, and 
the same can be said of New Zea- 
land, as to the white population. 
And if we speak of the Hawaiians 
and the Samoans and the Maoris, 
then they are simply another branch 
of the House of Israel, and that is 
undoubtedly the reason why we 
have met with success among them. 
Study the history of our missionary 
career ever since the Church was 
organized and I will venture to say 
that we hitherto have made very 
little progress among any people ex- 
cept those who come, as we claim, 
either pure or mixed from the 
House of Israel. We have not had 
success among the Latin or Orien- 
tal races, or among the Chinese or 
Japanese. There may be some of 
the blood of Israel among them, 
but so far we have discovered but a 
very little. Then I say, let us study 



ELDER GEORGE F.RICHARDS. 



81 



this matter intelligently, when we 
endeavor to trace our genealogy and 
seek to complete the chain connect- 
ing us with Father Abraham. The 
subject is certainly a thing of im- 
mense interest to us. 

I rejoice that the amalgamation 
of the Latter-day Saints of different 
nationalities takes place so beau- 
tifully and completely. People who 
have come from different climes 
soon become one strong and united 
community. The way we associate 
and affiliate, and the way we destroy 
all differences that naturally would 
and do exist in many other parts 
of the would between the Ameri- 
cans and the Germans and the Scan- 
dinavians, ought to be a lesson to 
all others. All differences seem 
to be passing away and disappearing 
in a single generation, and thus we 
are fast becoming "one nation upon 
the mountains of Ephraim." 

Brethren and Sisters, God bless 
yon. May we understand onr priv- 
ileges and live up to them ; may we 
rejoice in the many blessings that 
we receive almost daily, and appre- 
ciate the privilege we have had to be 
assembled in a splendid conference. 
The many glorious testimonies, to 
which we have listened, are certain- 
ly calculated to make the heart of 
every Latter-day Saint rejoice. That 
we may go away from this con- 
ference renewed in our determina- 
tion to serve God more perfectly 
hereafter than we have done hither- 
to, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Obedience a heavenly and eternal prin- 
ciple. — Essentials to salvation. — The 
Redeemer a perfect exemplar of obe- 
dience. — Duties to be learned, and dil- 
igently fulfilled. 

My brethren and sisters, I sup- 
pose this congregation is made up in 



large proportions of members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and there is one prin- 
ciple which I desire to impress upon 
your minds this morning, in the 
few minutes that -I shall occupy, — 
and that is the principle of obedi- 
ence. 

I call your attention to the 20th 
chapter of Exodus, the Ten Com- 
mandments, which were written by 
the finger of the Lord upon the 
table of stone. One of these com- 
mandments, in part, reads: "For 
in six days the Lord made the heav- 
ens and the earth, and seas and all 
that in them is." The Apostle Paul, 
in his epistle to the Hebrews, tells 
us how this was done. He says : 
"Through faith we understand that 
the worlds were framed by the word 
of God, so that things which are 
seen were not made of things which 
do appear." If the things which 
are seen were not made of things 
which do appear, what must they 
have been made of but the elements 
of which they are composed? which 
elements are eternal. God com- 
manded the elements, and they 
obeyed, and out of chaos came forth 
order, and the earth was formed, 
and the waters were separated from 
the earth, and the light from the 
darkness, and the sun was placed 
in the firmament to give light by 
day and the moon and stars to give 
light by night, and vegetation was 
placed upon the earth, grains and 
fruits and flowers and grasses, and 
all things which are necessary to 
beautify the earth and to sustain the 
life of men, animals, fowls, etc. An- 
imals were also placed upon the 
earth, and' these all were for the 
benefit of man. Order, then, fol- 
lows obedience unto the commands 
and the laws of God. The law by 
which the universe is governed, is 



6 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the law of God. We may call it the 
law of nature, but the law of nature 
is the law of God, and all His cre- 
ations excepting man are obe- 
dient, hence the beautiful order 
which we see in all nature. If they 
were disobedient, as man is diso- 
bedient, there would be universal 
confusion, disorder and annihila- 
tion. Afan only of all the creatures 
of God disobeys His command, and 
disregards the law which He has 
framed for our guidance and gov- 
ernment, that order and perfection 
might be established. This, because 
of man's agency. This is the point 
which I desire to call to your at- 
tention, that the law which God 
has given to us for our govern- 
ment is a divine law, and just as 
perfect as are the laws by which 
the universe is governed. And if 
we would be as obedient as are the 
elements, and His other creations, 
we would be perfect, and all would 
be in harmony and order. The dif- 
ference between the Gospel law and 
the manner of our observance of 
it, represents the things which we 
have to repent of. 

Repentance is a divine principle, 
a principle without which we can- 
not be saved and exalted in the 
kingdom of God, because we have 
exercised our agency in unright- 
eousness, we have not been strictly 
obedient unto the Lord's command- 
ments, and therefore we have need 
to repent and to put ourselves in 
order. These are provisions the 
Lord has made in his gospel for our 
salvation ; and we Will not repent, 
we cannot repent, if we have not 
faith ; hence faith is a principle of 
the gospel, a necessary principle of 
life and of salvation. The ordinan- 
ces which the Lord has established 
as a part of the gospel law, for the 
salvation of the children of men, 



must be obeyed and we must add 
to our faith virtue ; and to virtue 
godliness, brotherly kindness, chari- 
ty, etc, thus making ourselves as 
Godlike as it is possible. We are 
His children in very deed, having 
been born of Him in the spirit, and 
we have inherited the very attrib- 
utes which he possesses. They are in 
us, and they make us God's embryo, 
We believe that as we are now God 
once was, and by the practice of 
virtue and righteousness, by obedi- 
ence unto law and authority, He has 
become what He is, and as He is, 
man may become, on the same prin- 
ciple. 

There is no perfection of salva- 
tion and exaltation in. any other 
way than this, by observance of the 
laws which God has given us for our 
government. Christ, our Savior, is 
the great prototype of mankind. He 
gave Himself a ransom for our sins, 
that we might live again after death, 
thus redeeming us from the effects 
of the transgression of our first par- 
ents, and also that we might be re- 
deemed from the effects of our in- 
dividual sins through accepting 
Him and His mission, and yielding 
obedience unto the principles of the 
gospel. We stood with Jesus in our 
former estate, when by His power 
Lucifer, who was the arch enemy 
of God the Father and His Son 
Jesus Christ, and who has ever since 
sought to lead the children of men 
clown to his level, was cast out of 
heaven, we stood upon the same 
platform, and that is why we are 
here, and privileged as we are to- 
day, because of our integrity and 
faithfulness in that former estate. 
We kept our first estate, and if we 
will do as Jesus did, keep our sec- 
ond estate, we will be "added upon 
forever and ever." Jesus kept the 
covenant which He made on the 



ELDER GEORGE F.RICHARDS. 



83 



other side for that covenant 
pertained to this life, as well as the 
previous life. "Thy will be done, 
and the glory be thine for ever," 
characterized his whole life's con- 
duct. It should be so with us. It 
should be only necessary for us to 
know what our Father would have 
us to do, and with all our might, 
mind and strength we should go to 
and try and do those things. The 
beautiful song, so beautifully ren- 
dered yesterday by President Bal- 
lard : 

"I'll go where you want me to go, dear 
Lord, 

Over mountain, or plain, or sea ; 
I'll say what you want me to say, dear 
Lord : 

I'll be what you want me to be." 

That is the principle which should 
actuate us, whether it be great 
things or small which may be re- 
quired at our hands, whether it 
comes direct by the voice of God 
to us or through His servants whom 
He has called, it matters not, for 
the Lord has said "Whether it be 
by my own mouth or the mouth of 
my servants, it is the same." That 
which comes through the mouth 
of him whom God hath called and 
sustained in his position God rec- 
ognizes as doctrine, as law for the 
guidance of His people. That in- 
dividual Prophet of God who thus 
speaks is responsible for what he 
says, and those who hear are re- 
sponsible for their course, whether 
they accept and yield obedience 
unto those things, or whether they 
reject them. When the authorities 
of the Church have established an 
order in the Church, for instance, 
that one day in the month we shall 
abstain from food and drink, fast- 
ing and praying, giving assistance 
to the poor, that is all that should 
be necessary, even as it was all that 



was necessary for Adam to know 
that his Father commanded him that 
he should offer burnt offerings and 
perform sacrifices. It was sufficient 
for Abraham to be commanded of 
God to go and offer up his son, an 
offering on the altar, which he 
was told would be acceptable unto 
the Lord. It ought to be sufficient 
for us, my brethren and sisters, to 
know that these things have come 
to us through the servant of the 
Lord, all the commandments, all the 
laws and ordinances of the gospel, 
and we should observe them with 
all our hearts, yield obedience im- 
plicity and without reserve. I want 
to tell you that nothing short of 
this, is pleasing and acceptable unto 
God. Therefore let us learn our 
duties. Let us learn where the Lord 
would have us to go, what he would 
have us to do, how he would have 
us to speak, and let us do these 
things, regardless of what other 
men or peoples might think of us. 
Unless we have the courage to do 
right, to act conscientiously before 
God, we will not be accepted of 
Him. 

I pray the Lord to bless you. I 
feel to thank those who have made 
music for us on this occasion, and 
these our brethren who have taken 
part in the exercises, and you for 
your faith and attention. I thank 
the Lord, and pray that all that has 
been said, and the inspiration of His 
spirit which has been felt by us on 
this occasion, may be sanctified to 
our good and profit. 

And now I bear my testimony, 
that I know that this gospel is 
true, that it is the power of God 
unto salvation, and there is no 
power outside of this gospel that 
is the power of God unto salvation, 
if we will keep the commandments 
of God, and will be honest and sin-

cere in our purposes, that we will 
know the truth of these things, that 
we will love the truth, and that we 
will rejoice in sacrifices that we will 
have to make in order to fulfill the 
law of God. May the peace of the 
Lord be upon all Israel, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang a hymn, com- 
mencing "Here, by Babylon's way." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder John N. Pike. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Joseph F. 
Smith Jr., presided. 

The Thirty-first ward choir again 
furnished the musical exercises. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Star 
of descending night." 

Prayer was ottered by Elder 
Moroni Snow. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Grant us peace, O Lord." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy. 

The short time that I shall occu- 
py I trust that what I shall say I 
can crystalize, and make clear and 
comprehensive. Of course the 
great question is as to whether I 
have a message to deliver to you. 
This call has come somewhat unex- 
pected, although I try in my labors 
in the ministry to always think 
about something and then try to 
tell it. Now, if there is any one 
thing that I am normal in, it is 
frankness. Whenever the time 



comes, in my ministerial labors, that 
I cannot be frank and honest with 
the people I will feel that my use- 
fulness has come to an end. I can- 
not talk if I have not freedom, and 
if I ever feel that I have not the 
spirit of the people I will be unable 
to talk. There has been a great 
deal said, during this conference, 
about the third generation, and the 
fourth generation. Now, I am not 
going to speak on that subject, be- 
cause God is the Father of all, and 
Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and 
helper of all. But there is a great 
responsibility rests upon us who are 
fathers, and upon the mothers, and 
I do not think there has ever been 
a time in my life when I have felt 
the responsibility to be so weighty 
and great upon me in all my labors 
in the Church as it is at the pres- 
ent time with my own family. They 
are not many in number, but there 
are enough, and about all I can 
handle. 

I think you will find somewhere 
in the Old Testament, that "the 
fathers have eaten a sour grape and 
the children's teeth are set on 
edge." I have to confess to you 
that I have eaten some sour grapes 
in my day, and there is a problem 
regarding by children ; and while I 
am interested in my children and 
family, I have similar interest for 
your children and families. I will 
read some other scripture that I 
thought of today. I have heard it 
many times; it is found in Mat- 
thew, 8th chapter and 11 and 12th 
verses : 

"And I say unto you, That many 
shall come from the east and west, 
and shall sit down with Abraham, and 
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of 
heaven. But the children of the king- 
dom shall be cast out intc °uter dark- 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



85 



ness: there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth." 

I am very proud of my parentage. 
I do not think any one appreciates 
their parentage more than I do. 
But, I want to say to the Latter-day 
Saints, pride in parentage won't 
save you. If we get salvation, we 
must keep the commandments, and 
serve the Lord. Knowledge per- 
taining to the gospel of Jesus Christ 
does not come through ordination, 
nor by appointment, nor by lineage, 
nor through father and mother, 
though they are helpful. But no 
matter who my father and mother 
were, or how devoted and faithful 
they have been ; no matter how 
much work they have accom- 
plished, and how much gospel they 
have preached to the children of 
men, I tell you if Heber C. Kim- 
ball's children are saved in the 
kingdom they must keep the com- 
mandments of God, or they won't 
be saved. If they don't accomplish 
it here, I am glad to know they will 
have another chance. 

I don't want to be radical, but I 
think we are in great danger ; I 
think it is wrong for us to sit down 
quietly and feel satisfied that "All is 
well in Zion," that our children and 
children's children are not in con- 
stant danger. There was a time in 
the peaceful valleys of these moun- 
tains when we were as one great 
partiarchal family, when it seemed 
practically safe for our children to 
run hither and thither. When it was 
just as safe in this great city of Salt 
Lake as it is in your distant country 
places to leave your doors open. I 
was born right up here on the hill, 
and have known this city all my 
life : it is not safe any more. 

There is no people, I think, in 
the known world where there is as 
much laxity and freedom given to 



the children as there is among the 
Latter-day Saints. I want to warn 
the people that there is great dan- 
ger on every hand. I would just as 
soon think of putting my daugh- 
ters in a den of lions as to send 
them to Salt Lake without some 
one to look after them. When I 
say that, I am not saying anything 
against the people of Salt Lake. I 
am not saying there is not as good 
a class of people in Salt Lake, as 
good Latter-day Saints, and as pure 
a lot of people as can be found in 
the world. But, I tell you there is 
no longer safety for your children, 
if you don't look after them, I don't 
care who you are, Apostle, or 
Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor, or 
Teacher. The responsibility rests 
upon us to look after our children, 
and I appreciate the responsibility. 

My heart has not been broken 
yet over my children, but I realize 
the danger ; and whenever one of 
my boys goes away I am concerned ; 
I am full of anxiety, I have little 
peace or rest of body. All in the 
world I can do with my boy, my 
oldest boy, who is away now at 
work, because I cannot get him 
work here — and that is a responsi- 
bility resting upon us, to provide 
employment here for our boys and 
girls, so that we won't have to send 
them away off; we should regard 
that as a part of our religion ; — all 
in the world I can do for my boy is 
to teach him good principles. I do 
a sfreat deal of writing, and I just 
put a little good counsel in here and 
there, and hope he will catch it, and 
f-et his feet anchored, and realize 
the danger that menaces him on 
everv side. 

I believe in public worship ; it is 
part of our religion ; it is part of the 
revelation to this people that they 
shall attend to their public worship ; 
but I don't believe that public wor- 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shihp is the only worship acceptable 
to our heavenly Father. It is along" 
that line I would like to talk to you 
a few more moments, that is, about 
private worship. I have given the 
matter a good deal of thought, as 
far as I am individually concerned, 
but I will not be able to impart to 
you all my thoughts. I have found 
it a very difficult thing to do. We 
all have different viewpoints, and 
perhaps there is not one man in 
Israel that will look at a thing in 
just the same way, from just the 
same view point I look at it. If I 
do look at it from a different view- 
point from you, I want to ask the 
question, Am I wrong? And I 
answer, Not unless I preach false 
doctrine. Now I am going to ask 
a few questions, and then I am go- 
ing to answer a few of them. 

Jesus lays great stress on private 
devotion. "When thou prayest," 
says our Master, "enter into thy 
closet, and when thou hast shut thy 
door, pray to thy father which is in 
secret." The reason this thought 
has come to me is because of my 
own household. It is not because I 
am intending to criticise your home, 
or render judgment as to the way 
in which you manage your house- 
hold, but because I have a house- 
hold of my own. The question is 
as to private devotion. Now, Isaac's 
closet was a field, David's closet was 
his bed chamber, the Lord's closet 
was the mountain, Peter's closet 
was the house-top. Now, the 
question is, can God be nearer to us 
while we are praying in solitude 
than when praying in congrega- 
tions ? Do we need to go to church 
to find God. Some say, why is 
prayer necessary, since God. pre- 
sumably, knows, without being told 
the wishes of all men? God as- 
suredly does know the wishes in the 
hearts of all men. Is not the im- 



pulse to pray a natural one, spring- 
ing from love for the Lord? And 
is that impulse given to all of God's 
children ? Yes, if the person loves 
the Lord he will have a great desire 
to communicate with Him. But if 
this love is lacking, is it not almost 
useless to force it? Now, there is 
the question. I am trying to get 
my children to pray. When I was 
a boy, my father did most of the 
praying in the home, and when I 
got to manhood I did not know 
how to pray; I did not know just 
how nor what to pray for. In fact. 
I did not know very much about 
the Lord, because my father died 
when I was fifteen years old, but I 
can remember how he prayed, and I 
have been sorry, many times, that I 
can't pray like my father did, for 
he seemed on those occasions to be 
in personal communication with 
God. There seemed to be a friend- 
liness between my father and God, 
and when you heard him pray you 
would actually think the Lord was 
right there, and that father was 
talking to Him. Can you pray that 
way? Are you on such friendly 
terms with the Lord ? I don't mean 
that we should get too friendly and 
take advantage of it, like children 
with parents, but that we should 
manifest reverence and love for the 
Lord, ask only for what we need, 
and not for what we want. I think 
if you will just ask the Lord for 
what you need each day, and you 
will believe that the Lord is near 
and can answer your prayers, then 
there may be friendship between 
you and God. Well, then, learn to 
love the Lord. 

(I am going to read this to get 
my statement before you.) But, how 
is this love to be cultivated? Now, 
there is the question, can we sit 
down and teach our children ? How 
are von going to cultivate love for 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



87 



the Lord? In other words, how is 
this love to be obtained ? There are 
surely thousands of the Lord's chil- 
dren who admit the existence of 
Deity, but without feeling any emo- 
tion or desire to pray. They ac- 
knowledge that is a duty; every- 
thing gives evidence of it, but they 
have no desire, no emotion. They 
perhaps have not been taught to 
pray, consequently, they do not 
pray. Just like children : you who 
have children know what your anxi- 
ety is, and you know what fathers 
and mothers do for children, espe- 
cially mothers. I have learned one 
lesson with children that I never 
knew before ; there is nothing on 
this earth grieves and hurts me 
worse, outside of sin and wicked- 
ness and rebellion, than, when I do 
everything I can for a child that he 
deserves, there is no evidence given 
of gratefulness, no gratitude, no 
thankfulness, but it is regarded as a 
debt the father owes to the child. 
Have you ever had a child say to 
you, "Well, you owe it to me?" I 
never had any of them do that but 
once, and it made me feel as if I 
could have eaten them up. That I 
owed him ! T don't owe my children 
anything but love, protection, a 
home and shelter, and an education. 
I owe that to them, and the law re- 
quires it. But outside of that, shall 
they be grateful? Now, if we feel 
sad, and the mother so broken down 
after she has gone and worked her 
fingers' nails off to do something 
for a child, and then they don't ap- 
preciate it because they see some- 
thing on the outside that is greater, 
see some one make a better pres- 
ent ! Did you ever make a Christ- 
mas present to a child, and when 
they got it they were disappointed, 
and your Christmas was ruined, 
and you were made to feel almost 
broken-hearted, when you had af- 



fectionately expended every dollar 
you had, and because other people's 
children had presents much better, 
the whole day was spoiled to them 
and to you, too? Ingratitude is a 
sin in the sight of God. 

Now, then, we have to learn to 
love our fathers and mothers, and 
unless you learn to love your fath- 
ers and mothers and appreciate 
what they have done for you, then 
you are not grateful. If you can- 
not understand what God has done 
for you, and you cannot learn to 
love God, then you cannot pray to 
Him. I may be wrong in stating 
that you can't pray. You might 
practice until you can, but you don't 
feel satisfied after you have got 
through praying, and you don't feel 
like vour pravers have ascended to 
the Father, because your prayers 
are not built on love and gratitude. 
Now, how are you going to culti- 
vate love for God? You don't 
know much about Him, He has 
not communicated much to you. 
Perhaps some of our children have 
never had a prayer answered. We 
must study, think, reason, try to 
comprehend the goodness and the 
wisdom of God, and the knowledge 
you obtain will help you to appre- 
ciate what God has done. You can- 
not then fail to love Him, if you 
can only get impressed with what 
God has done for you. 

I love God for one thing, if 
nothing" else, that He gives to every 
one of His children, black or white, 
bond or free, an equal chance. I 
like equalitv of opportunity, and 
whenever parents make a favorite 
of a child, I feel sorry for the fa- 
vorite. If you want to destroy your 
familv show favoritism, and do not 
give every child an equal chance. 
We parents have got to learn that 
lesson. Not to favor the child be- 
cause you love it, but favor each

and every child alike, that is a sa- 
cred obligation. God does that with 
all of His children, and if there is 
any disadvantage or any wrong, we 
do it against each other, God does 
not. 

Prayer can be made in a simple, 
humble manner, without using a 
multitude of words. A person does 
not love the Lord just because He 
created him, or because He has 
given him health or wealth ; it is 
not for outward manifestations. 
Your love may become weakened 
when illness and sorrow come to 
you. I hear people pray, "I thank 
thee, Lord, for health." They ought 
to be thankful ; it is the greatest 
blessing we can have. But what do 
you do when you are sick ? Do you 
forget God ? What do you do when 
you accumulate a little means ? I 
haven't been in poverty all of my 
life, and I haven't been raised with 
a silver spoon in my mouth. I 
went out and fought my battles in 
the north country. I know what it 
costs to earn your bread by the 
sweat of your brow. I was mighty 
grateful for what I acquired, be- 
cause I worked for it, I never graft- 
ed men for it, but I lost it. Now, 
have I forgotten God, because I 
lost it? Is my love and gratitude 
to God on so small a foundation 
that, just as soon as I lose my 
health, I will forget my Maker? I 
have had a little experience along 
that line, when I went into the 
South and got poisoned from the 
crown of my head to the soles of 
my feet with malaria. I have now 
got appendicitis on both sides. Am 
I going to forget God. Am I going 
to say that God has not been good 
to me ? Why, no ; I feel that I have 
been favored above the whole Kim- 
ball race ; I have got oportunities 
and privileges some of them have 
never had. Am I going to forsake 



my God? No, I have learned to 
love Him — not as well as my father 
loved Him, perhaps, but I am learn- 
ing to love Him. 

Now, what do you love the Lord 
for ? We should love the Lord for 
His justice, for His perfection and 
mercy, because He manifests His 
love by giving his children an equal 
chance in life's labor. We should 
ask for what we need, and find 
pleasure and spiritual enjoyment 
in it. 

Now I am going to read to you 
what Alma says about prayer : 

"Begin to call upon his holy name 
[Just begin — just make a start]. Yea, 
cry unto him for mercy, for he is 
mighty to save. * * * Yea, cry 
unto him when ye are in your fields, 
yea, over all your flocks. Cry unto 
him in your houses, yea, over all your 
household, both morning, midday and 
evening. Yea, cry unto him against 
the power of your enemies. Yea, cry 
unto him against the devil, who is an 
enemy to all righteousness. Cry unto 
him over the crops of your fields, that 
ye may prosper in them. Cry over the 
flocks of your fields, that they may 
increase. But this is not all. Ye 
must pour out your souls in vour clos- 
ets, and your secret places, and in 
your wilderness. * * * Do not 
suppose that that is all, for after ye 
have done all these things, if ye turn 
away the needy and the naked, and 
visit not the afflicted and impart of 
your substance, if ye have, to those 
who stand in need — I say unto you, if 
ye do not these things, behold your 
prayer is vain and availeth you noth- 
ing, and ye are as hypocrites who do 
deny the faith. If ye do not remem- 
ber to be charitable, ye are as dross 
which the refiners do cast out, it be- 
ing of no worth, and is trodden under 
foot of men." 

Let us awake from indifference 
and carelessness, and bring forth 
fruit unto repentance. The test is 
in that, and another test the Mas- 
ter directed His disciples to say is, 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL.

"By their fruits ye shall know 
them." I acknowledge that I am 
imperfect, and no one is more sorry 
than I am. I have made mistakes, 
blunders, but I have faith in God, 
and I know God will forgive a man 
who repents. I know that we have 
got to teach our children to pray. I 
remember an incident that hap- 
pened upon the fated Titanic. Those 
people were in distress on that great 
ocean — I have never seen the ocean, 
but I have always been afraid of it 
— I read about a group that climbed 
on to a raft, some of them rich and 
wealthy, many of them as good peo- 
ple as ever lived, and they wanted to 
pray. The band was playing, and 
the end was about to close upon 
them. They wanted to offer the 
Lord's prayer, but they did not 
know it, and some one had to lead 
them, and they followed in saying 
the Lord's prayer. They did not 
know how or what to ask for. They 
were so frightened, perhaps, and so 
unaccustomed to prayer that they 
could only repeat the Lord's prayer, 
and some one had to lead them. 
Now, I would like to learn how to 
pray before I get in such an emer- 
gency. I think we ought to teach 
all of our people how to pray. I 
am going to ask you a question, and 
I am going to let you answer it, and 
I am not going to criticise you. I 
know what your difficulties are, be- 
cause they are just like mine. I ask 
the Latter-day Saint husbands if 
you have wives that look at every- 
thing just like you do? I would 
not give a snap of my finger for a 
woman that did not fight for her 
rights. I am thankful that my wife 
happens to be one of that kind ; she 
has her own personality, her own 
individuality, and we don't always 
see things just alike. 

Now I am going to ask you an- 
other question. I am not going to 



ask you what kind of a wife you 
have, but I could bet they don't all 
look at things just like you, if you 
do hold the priesthood; they don't 
look at things just like we do when 
it comes to handling the children. I 
want to ask you Latter-day Saints 
if you can have private devotion in 
the borne unless you are agreed 
and unless you have everything in 
order ? Do you ever try to pray in 
the morning when the children have 
only fifteen minutes to get to 
school? I thank the Lord there is 
one place where my children are al- 
ways on time; whether they get 
their breakfast or not, they get to 
school. Did you ever know chil- 
dren to lose their breakfast to get 
to prayers ? The father almost needs 
the patience of Job to get a family 
together for morning prayer. That 
is pretty plain talk, but you seem 
to understand what I mean. I 
guess you have tried it. 

Now, brethren and sisters, some 
find a great deal of fault with the 
Church. I have been associated 
with men that found fault. I don't 
mean my companions in the minis- 
try, but I have happened to be with 
others that have found fault with 
the Church, and with the authori- 
ties. I want to tell you there is no 
fault in the organization of the 
Church, it is perfect. There is no 
fault in the gospel of Christ if lived 
up to it makes you better ; it makes 
you good in your home ; it makes 
you good to your wife, and good to 
your children. It makes you good 
on the streets; it makes you hon- 
est; it makes you kind and gener- 
ous. I know that, nobody knows 
it better than I do. That is what 
the religion of Christ does. The 
Church is all right. I have got no 
ax to grind, I am not one of the 
men that worship men, I worship 
God. I do not put my trust in the 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



arm of flesh, but I honor the priest- 
hood that men hold. I have this to 
say concerning the authorities of 
the Church, I have labored with 
these men for twenty years, and the 
men that work the hardest of any 
men I have ever lived with in my 
life are the men who are in author- 
ity in the Church of Christ. I know 
what I am talking about. Now, 
where is the fault? I invite every 
one of you to go home and find it, 
and I promise that if you find any 
big fault anywhere it will be right 
in your own home. If you can han- 
dle you own home, and mind your 
own business, you will have no time 
for fault-finding. 

Now I pray the Lord to bless 
you. You go right home now. I 
know where my trouble is, and I am 
trying to cure it. I am learning this 
lesson, that there is no use of my 
trying to govern a family until I 
govern myself. 

Don't forget private devotion ; 
learn to pray in your home and get 
in communication with God, as my 
father did, right up there on Gor- 
don avenue, in that little bit of room 
there my father communicated with 
God, and God answeerd him. I 
have got it in writing. I am a liv- 
ing witness that it has been ful- 
filled. 

T will tell you a story, and then I 
will quit. Father had men working 
for him for a good many years, and 
he had one he called Col. Smith. It 
was in the days of hardships and 
poverty, and men had great difficul- 
ty. They employed a great many 
people, the brethren did, that was a 
part of their religion. He em- 
ployed the colonel, who had been a 
soldier in Great Britain, and on one 
occasion he went to father for a 
pair of shoes, and I guess father 
felt prettv cross, and answered him 
a little abruptly, perhaps. So the 



Colonel went home feeling badly, 
and when he prayed that night, he 
made a complaint to God against 
father, saying that "Thy servant 
Heber" was not treating him right. 
When he came past that little place 
on Gordon avenue, next morning, 
father came out and said, "Robert, 
what did you complain against me 
for? You come in and get your 
shoes, and don't do it again?" Now, 
how did he know that Col. Robert 
Smith, who lived away down in the 
Nineteenth ward, had filed a com- 
plaint against him? Don't you 
think that we can get on friendly 
terms with God? Not on familiar 
terms, but friendly terms. I tell you, 
God will answer your prayers. If 
there was any one thing I knew bet- 
ter than another, when I was travel- 
ing in the South, it was that God 
answers prayers, and softens the 
hearts of people towards you. May 
the Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RTJLON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

During the meetings of this con- 
ference we have heard a great deal 
about the organization of the 
Church and the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood, and those of us 
who had the privilege of listening to 
President Smith, yesterday morn- 
ing, were deeply impressed with the 
magnitude of this work and with 
the perfection of its organization. 

Provision has been made in the 
organization of this Church to carry 
the gospel to the nations of the 
earth, and also to carry it to the 
homes of the people, who have been 
gathered from the farthest parts of 
the earth. If we will read the New 
Testament we will find that when 
the Lord organized His Church in 
that day, that He "Set in His 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



91 



church; first apostles, secondarily 
prophets, evangelists, pastors and 
teachers, for the work of the min- 
istry." Every one was given a duty 
to perform. And so it is in the day 
and age in which we live, God has 
again set up His Church, and has 
placed in the church, first the apos- 
tles, secondarily prophets, pastors 
and teachers, high priests, seventies, 
and evangelists, for the work of the 
ministry, and this ministry is broad 
enough to accomplish all the pur- 
poses of the Lord, for He operates 
through this organization, and 
through this priesthood to whom He 
has delegated divine power and au- 
thority. In the operations of this 
ministry, every need is provided for. 
It is for the "edifying of the body 
of Christ," as well as bringing: 
strangers to the knowledge of the 
truth. 

In the exercise of that divine au- 
thority the gospel is proclaimed to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people. The message of salvation is 
being taken to all of our Father's 
children in every part of the world. 
Through this splendid organization, 
those who have been converted and 
brought up hither into these valleys 
of the mountains to cast their lots 
and identify their interests amongst 
the people of God, every one of 
them may be reached, for it is not 
only for the purpose of proclaiming 
the gospel to the world, but it is for 
the "edifying of the body of Christ," 
or the Church and Kingdom of God. 
It is for the "perfecting of the 
Saints." There are none of us so 
perfect that do not need the min- 
istry to labor with us — that do not 
feel the need of this organization. 
We need the teachers to come and 
visit us, and to labor with us and 
with those that are wayward, seeing 
that there is no iniquity in the 



church, putting their arms around 
the wayward boys and bringing 
them to the fold of Christ, to the 
sacrament meeting, and seeing that 
they worthily partake of the sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper. We 
need the priests to visit the homes 
of the people, to impart spiritual 
food unto them in their homes. We 
need the bishop, who is the presid- 
ing priest in every ward, the presi- 
dent of the Aaronic priesthood. The 
bishop is a priest after the order of 
Aaron by reason of his bishopric. 
Sometimes I think that our bishops 
forget that, and imagine that they 
belong to the High Priests' quorum. 
Not so, they belong to the Priests' 
quorum, the bishops do, but by rea- 
son of being ordained high priests 
they also belong to the High Priests' 
quorum. 

In the wards in which we live we 
need the ministry of our bishops for 
the perfecting of our own charac- 
ter, and the ministry which they 
perform in other directions in the 
wards where they live. We need 
the elders, the standing ministers 
in the stakes of Zion where they are 
called to labor in the exercise of the 
functions of their priesthood, to 
minister in the work of God, to 
labor for the salvation of souls, to 
perfect the Saints, to "edify the 
body of Christ." We need the sev- 
enties to proclaim the gospel to the 
nations of the earth. We need them 
to carry the gospel message to our 
Father's children even to the furth- 
ermost parts of this earth. We need 
the Apostles, who are able to bear 
testimony of the divinity of the mis- 
sion of Jesus Christ, and to set in 
order all the affairs of the Church, 
both at home and abroad. As a 
people, we need the Prophet and 
mouthpiece of God, and we ought 
to honor, reverence and yield obe- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



dience to his counsels, for he speaks 
as the representative of God upon 
the earth, to tell unto the people the 
mind and will of the Father. We 
need this "for the work of the min- 
istry," the "edifying of the body of 
Christ," for the "perfecting of the 
Saints." Not only do the wayward 
need them, not only do those who 
sit in darkness and have not heard 
the sound of the gospel need this 
ministry, not only them, but also 
those of us who have accepted the 
truth, for we need to be perfected, 
to be developed and to grow in the 
knowledge of God and in good 
works. 

These are some of the purposes 
for which this great organization 
was established, and some have said 
in regard to it that it was the most 
wonderful in all the world, except- 
ing perhaps the German army. I 
recollect hearing one of the brethren 
make the remark, that they might 
just as well have said, when they 
were looking up in the canopy of 
heaven, that the sun is the most 
splendid orb in the universe, except- 
ing perhaps the moon. Indeed this 
organization is of divine origin, and 
it has no parallel in all the world, 
even the Germany army does not 
compare with it. 

Now then, brethren and sisters, 
this work is for the "perfecting of 
the Saints." It is for the "edifying 
of the body of Christ." Wherein 
do you need this ministry? It be- 
comes an individual affair with each 
and every one of us. Wlierein do we 
need the ministry of the servants of 
God? Wherein can we benefit by 
submitting and receiving their ad- 
ministrations to us ? It is not enough 
that we should be what is ordinarily 
termed a good citizen. It is not 
enough that we should be honest in 
our desires. It is not enough that 



we should refrain from taking the 
lives of our fellow men, or from the 
stealing of their property. All these 
things are necessary, that we should 
refrain from doing those things that 
are wrong and that we should take 
on us the Christian virtues and make 
them a part of our own characters. 
Remember the case of the young 
man who came to the Savior and 
said to him, "Lord, what good thing 
shall I do that I may obtain eternal 
life?" and the Savior's reply, "Keep 
the commandments." A very nec- 
essary thing to do, a very essential 
thing, "keep the cammandments." 
"Which commandments?" said the 
young man. "Well, thou shalt not 
steal, thou shalt not commit adul- 
tery, thou shalt not kill," and he 
went on enumerating a number of 
the ten commandments. "Why," 
said the young man, "these have I 
done from my youth up. What lack 
I yet?" The Savior said, "If thou 
wouldst indeed be perfect, sell that 
which thou hast, give to the poor 
and come and follow me." It was 
not enough that he should merely 
be complying with the moral code. 

There is something else for the 
development, for the perfecting of 
the Saints. It is necessary that our 
hearts should be loyal to God, that 
we should render obedience to Him, 
that we should put ourselves in com- 
plete harmony with the Divine mind 
and will. There is no one thing 
that you can say or do that will 
comply with this requirement. It is 
not enough that we should observe 
this commandment or that one, but 
we must devote all to the service 
of God, and be willing to obey His 
Divine mind and will and yield obe- 
dience thereto. That is the thing 
that is required of us, and there is 
not any one thing. If it be required, 
sell that which thou hast, and give 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



93 



to the poor ; and that is not enough 
either, "but come and follow me." 
That means that we shall "not live 
by bread alone, but by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the 
mouth of God," if we want to go 
on to perfection ; and this ministry 
which God has instituted in His 
Church is for the purpose of "per- 
fecting the Saints," until they shall 
place themselves in complete har- 
mony with the divine mind and will. 
Let us, therefore, struggle on in 
that direction, until we can over- 
come our faults, weaknesses and 
imperfections. If the call should 
come to any young man, to leave his 
home and go out in the mission 
field, to proclaim the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, what should he 
do? Can he think he has done 
enough, because he has kept these 
commandments or those ? Why no. 
What should he do? There is but 
one thing, go, go in obedience to the 
will of God and proclaim the gospel 
in that country where your services 
are needed. If it should be neces- 
sary that we give up all that we 
have, give it up, and remember that 
God requires it. That is the doc- 
trine, and until men and women are 
willing to lay their all upon the altar 
they will not have attained perfec- 
tion. 

While none of us are perfect in 
our lives by any means, there are a 
great many weaknesses which we 
can and should overcome. Draw 
nigh unto God and He will draw 
nigh unto us. Resist the devil and 
he will flee from you. Seek to ob- 
tain the companionship of God's 
Holy Spirit, even the Comforter 
that will lead us unto all truth, and 
then we are on our road to salva- 
tion. But none are saved, onlv those 
who shall endure unto the end. And 
may God help us all to do it, I pray 
in Jesus' name. Amen. 



A male quartet sang the hymn, 
"I think when I read that sweet 
story of old." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MUREIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

At the close of one of the meet- 
ings of this conference, President 
Joseph F. Smith made a number 
of announcements. Among other 
notices that were given out by him, 
was one to the effect that there had 
been established a Correspondence 
Missionary Course, in connection 
with the Church school system, you 
my friends know that is the form 
of education that has accomplished 
so much good among the young 
people of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. The thought 
came into my mind, brethren and 
sisters, that this new step in con- 
nection with our Church school ac- 
tivities was one well worthy of more 
attention than it is receiving at the 
hands of many of those who are 
men of influence in the Church. 

In the early history of the Church 
the Lord gave revelations to the 
people, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, bearing upon the great sub- 
ject of education. In one of those 
revelations we read the following. 

"Therefore, verily I say unto you, 
my friends, call your solemn assembly, 
as I have commanded you. And as all 
have not faith, seek ye diligently and 
teach one another words of wisdom ; 
yea, seek ye out of the best books words 
of wisdom; seek learning even by study, 
and also by faith." 

As I have said, this instruction 
was given of the Lord at a very 
early period in the history of the 
Church, and even at an earlier date, 
than the date of this revelation 
from which I have just read, there 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



had come the voice of the Lord to 
His people of the Latter dispensa- 
tion concerning' the great import- 
ance of selecting and writing books, 
that such education might be im- 
parted to the people as would be 
pleasing to the Lord. That injunc- 
tion has been upon the people from 
that date to the present, and you 
my brethren and sisters, know that 
very great efforts have been made 
by the proper authorities of the 
Church, to give to the young people 
of Zion every possible educational 
advantage. The statement was 
made in a meeting last night which 
many of the brethren attended, that 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, appropriated last 
year about the same amount of 
money for the higher education of 
the children of the Latter-day 
Saints in Church acadamies as was 
appropriated by the Legislature in 
the State of L'tah for higher educa- 
tion. Notwithstanding this, we are 
oftentimes spoken of by those who 
are either misinformed, or who are 
wilfully wicked, as people who are 
opposed to education. 

I would like, if possible, to im- 
press upon the minds of fathers and 
mothers, and upon the minds also 
of the young men and women who 
are in this congregation, the great 
advantage that is offered them by 
this Missionary Correspondence 
School. I happened just yesterday 
in going through some papers at 
my home to run across this im- 
portant communication, which is ad- 
dressed to the Bishopric of the 
Church. I will read a part of the 
letter. It is over the signature of 
President Joseph F. Smith and re- 
lates to the splendid opportunity of 
obtaining a theological training by 
means of this missionary corre- 
spondence school. He first calls at- 



tention to the fact that some of our 
young men go into the missionary 
field not very well prepared for the 
responsibility that comes to them 
as advocates of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. He says : 

"In this respect they do not rep- 
resent our people fairly, nor do they 
accomplish as much good as they 
would if they were better informed. 
In some instances it requires the 
first year of their mission to prepare 
them for their calling. This is a 
great loss to themselves, their 
parents, and the cause they repre- 
sent. 

"To remedy this condition, classes 
for missionaries have been main- 
tained in all of our larger Church 
schools for many years, and while 
they have done much good, they do 
not satisfy all the needs of the mis- 
sionaries. To quit work and go 
to a church school for one or two 
years, and follow that with a mis- 
sion of two or three years, is a 
greater sacrifice than many feel they 
can make. For all such as need the 
work and cannot take a regular 
course in a church school, a cor- 
respondence course has been pro- 
vided. This course includes thor- 
ough instruction in the principles of 
the gospel, the leading facts in our 
Church history, a practical course 
in English, and some statistical and 
other information that every mis- 
sionary should possess. All the 
work in this course can be done by 
the students at home, without inter- 
fering with their earning capacity. 
Utilizing evenings that otherwise 
might be wasted, and thereby es- 
tablishing good habits to displace 
poorer ones. 

"The services of Bishop Edwin S. 
Sheets have been secured to conduct 
the course. He is a practical 
teacher and an experienced mission-

ary. The text books used during 
the first part of the course are : 'A 
Young Folks' History of the 
Church,' by Nephi Anderson. 'The 
Gospel,' by B. H. Roberts. 'Mor- 
mon Doctrine,' by Charles W. Pen- 
rose ; and a good text on English. 
The cost of these books is $2.50. 
The books used in the second part 
of the course are : 'Articles of 
Faith,' by James E. Talmage ; 'Ec- 
clesiastical History,' by B. H. 
Roberts ; 'Restoration of the Gos- 
pel,' by Osborne J. P. Widtsoe ; to- 
gether with a brief outline of sta- 
tistics and other general information 
pertaining to the Church, and also 
to our state. The cost of the books 
for the second part of the course is 
$3.00. Those who already have the 
above named books will have no 
other expenses than $10.00 tuition 
fee, which is payable in advance. 

"Students may enroll at any time. 
The length of time required to com- 
plete the course will depend largely 
upon the ability of the student and 
the time he can devote to the work. 
The course not only prepares broth- 
ers and sisters for the mission field, 
but also for a life of usefulness at 
home, in the quorums and in the 
auxiliary organizations." 

I have taken the liberty of read- 
ing the larger part of this commu- 
nication, to bring to your attention 
the views of the President of the 
Church in relation to the importance 
of this movement, and I hope these 
views will be very strongly im- 
pressed upon the minds of the 
young people, and upon the minds 
of the fathers and mothers and pre- 
siding authorities who are in this 
congregation. This course provides 
an opportunity for the young men 
and women of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints to gain 
a most desirable training in rela- 



tion to the doctrines of the gospel, 
even while they remain at home, 
and continue to give attention to the 
daily affairs of life. Some may feel 
that there is not a very good chance 
to accomplish much by a system of 
education by correspondence. I will 
read a few words in regard to the 
judgment of some of the bright in- 
tellects of this modern age, who 
have discovered the very great op- 
portunity that exists for the ad- 
vancement of one and all, who will 
give the proper attention, and who 
will undertake to educate them- 
selves. I might say in passing, that 
we need only look to some of the 
presiding authorities of the Church, 
and we will make the discovery, if 
we are not already aware of it, that 
there are some men of a very schol- 
arly character numbered among 
those authorities, who have never 
had an opportunity for gaining 
scholastic information to any great 
extent through going to school or 
college, but they have obtained the 
wonderful fund of knowledge of 
which they are possessed very 
largely by utilizing spare moments 
in the reading of good books and 
seeking to educate themselves very 
much after the manner that is in- 
tended bv the presiding authorities 
of the Church in establishing this 
correspondence school for mission- 
aries. One writer has said : 

"Oh, what wonders have been 
performed in one hour a day. One 
hour a day withdrawn from friv- 
olous pursuits, and profitably em- 
ployed, would enable any man of 
ordinary capacity,"— and I would 
like you to mark this statement, 
young men and maidens — ''any man 
of ordinary capacity, to master a 
complete science. One hour a day 
would make an ignorant man a well- 
informed man in ten years. One 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hour a day would earn enough to 
pay for two daily and two weekly 
papers, two leading magazines and 
a dozen good books. In an hour a 
day any boy or girl could read 
twenty pages thoughtfully — over 
seven thousand pages, or eighteen 
large volumes, in a year. An hour 
a day might make all the difference 
between bare existence and useful, 
happy living. An hour a day might 
make, nay, has made an unknown 
man a famous one, a useless man, 
a benefactor to his race." Young 
people, such a warning as this, from 
an intelligent writer should be as 
a trumpet call for an hour a day, or 
for some period of time earnestly 
devoted to the acquirement of gos- 
pel knowledge and other useful in- 
formation. 

There is no young man or young 
maiden in our community that is 
not able, if they so determine, to 
give an hour a day or even a less 
amount of time in such a laudable 
effort. The great educator, Dr. 
Chas. W. Eliot, who was recently 
offered the honorable post of em- 
bassador from the United States of 
America at the court of St. James, 
and who for years stood at the head 
of Harvard College, in preparing 
the set of books known as the Har- 
vard Classics, says on this subject: 
"I believe that the faithful and con- 
siderate reading of these books, with 
such re-readings and memorizings 
as individual taste may prescribe, 
will give any man the essentials of 
a liberal education, even if he can 
devote to them but fifteen minutes a 
day." The faithful reading of any 
other set of equally good books will 
accomplish the same thing. 

Young people should give atten- 
tion to the opportunities that abound 
around them on every hand, and be 
determined to stand fully abreast of 



the time. There ought not to be 
any young men who have come to, 
say, twenty-five years of age, who 
do not have an understanding con- 
cerning the gospel. 

We have the revelations of the 
Almighty as contained in the Holy 
Bible, and in the revealed word of 
God as given in our own time, and 
other good books without number, 
that can be had for a few pence 
each ; every young man and every 
young woman should be so con- 
cerned about the birthright that has 
been spoken of so much during this 
conference and the responsibilities 
that are sure to come as time ad- 
vances, that they would be deter- 
mined, even though they might not 
have the opportunity to go into the 
school room, and obtain the advan- 
tages that are given to those who 
have such privileges, that at home, 
by means of this correspondence 
course and by giving attention to 
proper reading, they would fill their 
minds with good information and 
become equipped for the great re- 
sponsibilities that are awaiting 
them. Be careful, young people, of 
your companionship and where and 
how you spend your time, I will 
again read a few words that I com- 
mend to you most earnestly, for I 
believe them to be very precious and 
worthy of serious consideration. 

"No one is anxious about a young- 
man while he is busy in useful work. 
But where does he eat his lunch at 
noon? Where does he go when he 
leaves his boarding house at night? 
What does he do after supper? 
Where does he spend his Sundays 
and holidays? The great majority 
of youths, who go to the bad, are 
ruined after supper. Most of those 
who climb upward to honor and 
fame devote their evenings to study, 
or work, or the society of the wise

and good. For the right use of 
these leisure hours, what we have 
called the waste of life, the odd mo- 
ments usually thrown away, the au- 
thor would plead with every youth." 

That is what the teachers of the 
correspondence school pleads for — 
the odd moments. They are plead- 
ing with the youth of Zion that they 
take advantage of them, for they 
can be made more precious than 
rubies. Fathers, and mothers, 
bishops and presidents, ought to 
give attention, and encourage not 
only the two hundred and forty 
young men and maidens who are 
thus engaged today, but there ought 
to be easily, at the very least, one 
thousand students in this corre- 
spondence school. Those who are 
engaged in the correspondence 
school work are sending in testi- 
monials of the highest character 
telling of the great good and ad- 
vantage the course has been to them. 
One of the students says : 

"I consider the institution of the mis- 
sionary correspondence school one of the 
most useful and practical means that the 
Church has yet adopted to bring an all- 
around, up-to-date, civil and ecclesias- 
tical education to every one that will 
avail himself. However poor financially 
or remote in distance one might be, this 
method will meet every circumstance 
and remove the last excuse of educa- 
tional unpreparedness to meet any call 
at home or abroad. Its systematic 
teaching has made the matter of study a 
pleasure to me and has inspired me with 
new life and vigor to reach oui for more, 
and still more knowledge." 

I commend these various state- 
ments and this new line of work to 
this congregation, and feel that there 
will be a blessing come to every one 
who will give attention. God bless 
you, my brethren and sisters in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

This very interesting meeting, 
thus far, is being conducted by a 
member of the Council of Twelve. 
I have tried to induce him to use 
the time that he desires I should 
use, because, I think, he has not 
spoken at any other meeting of this 
conference ; but he has seen fit to 
decide otherwise. I beg the liberty 
to ask you who are here, unless you 
have some very urgent matters, that 
you remain until the close of this 
meeting, if not to hear me, at least 
to listen to the voice of Brother Jo- 
seph F. Smith, Jr. Arrangements 
have been made, I believe, with all 
railroads that visitors can remain 
until the close of meeting, without 
fear of missing trains ; and we may 
fairly assume, I think, that the Tab- 
ernacle services will not conclude 
for, perhaps, a half hour yet. 

In that splendid work entitled, 
"Joseph Smith the Prophet-Teach- 
er," by Brother B. H. Roberts, ref- 
erence is made to the last public 
speech of that great statesman, Dan- 
iel Webster, delivered, I believe, in 
the year 1852. I should like to read 
a few of the words he uttered at 
that time, which seem applicable to 
a matter that I should like to dis- 
cuss : 

"Let me say, that if any of our poster- 
ity shall be true to the Christian religion, 
if we and they shall live always in the 
fear of God and shall respect His com- 
mandments, if we and they shall main- 
tain just moral sentiments and such con- 
scientious convictions of duty as shall 
control the heart and life, we may have 
the highest hopes of the future of our 
country. But if we and our posterity re- 
ject religious instructions and authority, 
violate the rules of eternal justice, trifle 
with the injunctions of morality or reck- 
lessly destroy politicial instruction which 
hold's us together, then no man knows

when a sudden catastrophe may over- 
whelm us." 



I believe there are many men and 
women in America today who dis- 
credit the Bible, who are seeking 
for the opportunity to prove, if 
they can, that the Bible is not au- 
thoritative. They are seeking, in var- 
ious ways, to win the hearts and 
minds of people from a belief in its 
fundamental teachings. There are 
many, who do not believe the New 
Testament, and say that it is only 
a myth, or a story concocted by men. 
I saw yesterday, or day before, a 
dispatch purported to be from the 
greatest city of the old world, that 
Londoners have given up reading 
the Bible, and are fast becoming 
Pagan. In the light of these con- 
ditions it is well for us to stand 
close and fast by the teachings that 
have come down to us in that sacred 
book. The Bible is a revelation of 
God to man and it reveals men un- 
to themselves. It plays no favor- 
ites. If there were those who were 
wicked, the Bible tells us so un- 
qualifiedly. When the great King- 
David fell, the Bible writer did not 
shield his faults, nor magnify his 
virtues. No. He was given a just 
rebuke, and his history was written 
just as that of the humblest man of 
his time might have been. 

After all, my brothers and sisters, 
if we believe in that book, we shall 
consider ourselves to be free and in- 
dependent creatures. We are ac- 
countable to our Father and God, 
and should recognize the authority 
that He has established in this 
world. If we believe the teachings 
of those who wrote in the time of 
Christ — not necessarily all there is in 
the New Testament — we may also 
look to other writings contempor- 
aneous with that time, and we will 



find ample proof and assurance that 
those conditions that the Testament 
relates were true and authoritative 

Where shall we find a parallel for 
that work, that great battle to win 
human hearts, participated in by 
humble men in the days of Christ? 
There is no parallel in this world 
excepting in this Latter-day Church 
that was founded by Joseph Smith 
under God's direction, and who fol- 
lowed by humble, though strong 
and brave men, some of whom still 
remain to fight similar battles, bat- 
tles for the human heart. A belief 
and faith in God and his Son, Jesus 
Christ, a belief in divine revelation 
a belief which if lived up to will 
save and exalt the human race 
characterizes everyone that is hon- 
est in religious convictions. 

It has been said during this con- 
ference that the test of this Chruch 
will come in the third and fourth 
generations. I am one of the third 
generation of our family that have 
joined the Church, and even though 
imperfectelv I have endeavored to 
live my religion. If I can main- 
tain the standard set by my father 
and mother I shall be deeply grate- 
ful. If my children of the fourth 
generation, emulate the attitude of 
my father, their grandfather, in sup- 
porting and advancing this glori- 
ous work. I shall praise God. His 
name receives praise in my heart to- 
day, that I have been privileged to 
devote a part of my life in the ser- 
vice of the Master. God grant that 
our lives, our thoughts and actions 
may be given to it in so much that 
all that we have and are, if need 
be, may be devoted to advancement 
of this great Latter-dav work I 
humblv pray in the name of Jesu= 
Amen.

Authorities of the Church ; each

positions designated, by unanimous 
vote of the congregation. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JE. 

Descendants of righteous men admon- 
ished to be faithful. — Saints should 
diligently obey God's laws. 

I appreciate the kindness of my 
brother, Elder Herrick, in proffer- 
ing me the time that was alloted to 
him. I have enjoyed all the meet- 
ings of the conference, listening to 
the remarks of the brethren. I feel 
that it would not be wise for me to 
occupy much time and keep you 
here longer this afternoon ; but I 
desire to say that I am grateful for 
the testimonies and instructions that 
have been borne during this con- 
ference, and am proud to be a de- 
scendant of Latter-day Saint parent- 
age, of the fifth generation. I am 
also proud to be a grandson of one 
of the original members of the 
Church, a man who was faithful to 
the end, and laid down his life for 
the truth ; and I am glad to know 
that so many of his descendants are 
actively engaged in the cause, and 
are also faithful in the truth. 

I trust that the sons and daugh- 
ters of the Latter-day Saints will 
walk in the footsteps of their fathers 
in righteousness, and be true to the 
Church. I hope they will remember 
their covenants, honor the Priest- 
hood, and the parents who gave 
them birth and made it possible for 
them to receive the many blessings 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Through faithfulness we shall over- 
come all things and receive an exal- 
tation in our Father's Kingdom. 
I trust that the people will go from 



this conference with the determin- 
ation in their hearts to serve the 
Lord, be true to his laws and the 
covenants they have made with 
Him, and keep the commandments 
better than they have done in the 
past, from this time henceforth. 

We should labor diligently for 
the salvation of the souls of men, 
the living and the dead, that Zion 
may prosper, the truth spread in the 
earth and righteousness cover the 
face thereof. The time is coming 
when wickedness shall cease. This 
is inevitable ; and it is plain to see 
that a people who will observe the 
laws of the Lord and keep them- 
selves pure and free from the sins 
that curse the world, will be the peo- 
ple of wisdom possessed of the 
knowledge of the things of God, and 
eventually will have power and do- 
minion in the earth. It does not 
require the spirit of revelation to 
understand these things, God's pur- 
poses shall not fail. It behooves us, 
therefore, to be obedient to the will 
of our Heavenly Father, and receive 
all principles of truth as they have 
been revealed from on high, and not 
partake of the sins of the world 
that lead to destruction. 

I pray that we may all be faith- 
ful and true in the discharge of 
every duty as Latter-day Saints, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Edna Evans, and choir, 
sang the anthem, "Inflammatus." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
President Hugh J. Cannon. 



BARRATT HALL MEETING 

The afternoon sessions of the 
Conference, in the Tabernacle and 
Assembly Hall, were overcrowded, 
hundreds of persons were unable to 
obtain admission to either of those

places, and another meeting was 

held, for their benefit, in the Bar- 
ratt Hall of the L. D. S. University, 
on the adjoining block, at 2 p. m. 

The services were under direc- 
tion of President Seymour B. 
Young, and the musical exercises 
were conducted by Prof. Charles 
Kent, Mrs. Kent acting as accom- 
panist. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, all ye sons of Zion 
And let us praise the Lord; 

His ransomed are returning, 
According to His word. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Lewis Anderson. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor 
labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Elder Seymour B. Young pre- 
sented the names of the General 
Authorities of the Church ; each 
and all were duly sustained in the 
positions designated, by unanimous 
vote of the congregation. 

Prof. Charles Kent rendered, as 
a solo, the hymn entitled, "Let us 
oft speak kind words to each other." 

ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 

(President of Wayne Stake.) 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
inspiration of the Lord that has been 
manifest in all the sessions of the 
conference that it has been my priv- 
ilege to attend. 

The beautiful thoughts of the 
song that we have just listened to 
have been emphasized in the talks 
that have b^en made during our con- 
ference. There have been no crit- 
icisms whatever made of the faith 



and beliefs of professed Christian 
people. Reference has been made, 
occasionally, by way of comparison, 
but there has been nothing said to 
which any professing consistent 
Christian could take exception. The 
gospel preached to the people during 
this conference has been the Gospel 
of Love. The principles of saving 
grace as enunciated by the Master 
have been very forcibly proclaimed. 

If I have been impressed with one 
truth more than another during this 
conference, that is of great import- 
ance to the Latter-day Saints, it is 
the necessity for tho"se who have 
entered into covenant with God in 
these last days to give heed to the 
living oracles. Very frequently, the 
Church of which we are members 
is criticised unfairly because of the 
unity that obtains among them with 
regard to sustaining the Church of- 
ficials, the authorities of the Church, 
the implicit confidence we have in 
their word, and our willingness to 
obey their counsels. We are living 
in a day when much emphasis is 
placed upon the subject of individ- 
ual liberty, and it is often inti- 
mated, bv those who do not know 
us as well as they should, that we 
are a priest-ridden people. My ex- 
perience in traveling in the world 
i> yerv onnosite. If there is anv 
religious oeoole upon the arth who 
are free from domination, who are 
free from oriest-craft, it is the 
Latter-day Saints. The Gospel that 
we have espoused, if we are living 
its orinciples, makes us free indeed. 

The order, discipline, and nnre 
oriesthood of God was verv plainlv 
and beautifully explained bv Presi- 
dent Smith in the opening discourse 
of the Conference, and I am sure 
that the instructions imparted, and 
the testimotiv bom*» regarding the 
order of the priesthood, as laid 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY.

down by our President, found an 
echo in the heart of every Latter- 
day Saint. 

The very necessary and timely 
counsel imparted by President 
Lund, that the fathers and mothers 
of the Latter-day Saints should use 
diligence to see that their children 
are properly instructed in the ways 
of the Lord, in the principles and 
doctrines of the Church, was coun- 
sel well worth the close attention of 
the Latter-day Saints. It will profit 
us very little, my brethren and sis- 
ters, the years of sacrifice and toil 
and earnest endeavor that has been 
spent by the fathers and mothers 
in this work, if we do not succeed 
in rearing our children in the way 
that we have tried to go. I feel 
that these keynotes that were 
sounded at the commencement 
of our conference have been ringing 
in our ears ever since, in the re- 
marks and the testimonies of our 
brethren. 

I have been reminded that while 
we do perhaps give closer attention 
and more implicit obedience, be- 
cause of the confidence that we have 
in our leaders, than do people gen- 
erally of other churches, that yet we 
are not wanting in our reverence 
for the prophets of old ; we are not 
wanting in reverence for the Word 
of God that has come down to us 
through the ages. It is a mistaken 
idea that we do not reverence as we 
should the ancient worthies, do not 
place enough importance upon the 
testimony of the ancient apostles. 
The fact is, that we believe all that 
God has revealed in the past, that 
was written and spoken anciently 
and that was necessary in the day in 
which it was given, for the edifica- 
tion and blessing and consolation of 
the people, though we go further 
than that. We believe in present 



day revelation —we believe all that 
God is now revealing, and we be- 
lieve that in the future He will con- 
tinue to reveal to His people as oc- 
casion may require, those things 
that are necessary for their edifi- 
cation, and for their perfection and 
glory. 

A careful perusal of the Scrip- 
tures and of history reveals the fact 
that great and good men have sel- 
dom been fully appreciated for their 
worth in the day in which they 
lived. This is true of men and wo- 
men who have been reformers in 
various spheres as well as it is true 
of the ministers of the gospel of the 
Redeemer. The people in the ages 
and times when men have spoken 
as they were inspired by the gift of 
the Holy Ghost have not generally 
received the message, people in gen- 
eral have turned a deaf ear to the 
testimony of the living prophets, 
while professing that they were will- 
ing to be guided by the words of 
those who had passed away. Such 
was the condition when John the 
Baptist came to the people as the 
fore-runner of Jesus the Redeemer 
of men. Such was the condition as 
Jesus followed in the mighty work 
that He was called to do. The peo- 
ple said they were willing to have 
Abraham for their father, were will- 
ing to believe in him, willing to ac- 
cept the testimony of the prophets 
who had preceded the Messiah, but 
were unwilling to accept Him and 
believe in His testimony and in His 
doctrine. 

You will remember the beautiful 
story that is told of Lazarus and the 
rich man. You remember how anx- 
ious, after he had left this life and 
was reaping the reward of his life's 
work, the rich man was when he 
lifted up his eyes and saw Lazarus 
among the redeemed and blessed. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He was tormented in his spirit. His 
mind went back to mother earth, 
and he was anxious for his brother, 
he was anxious for his relatives who 
were living upon the earth. He de- 
sired that they might escape the con- 
dition that he found himself in, and 
so he asked that one might be sent 
to warn his living relatives that they 
might peradventure repent, and not 
reach the condition that he found 
himself in. The answer came to him 
that though one should be sent from 
the dead, yet they would not be- 
lieve. They had living prophets and 
they should give heed to their testi- 
mony and to their doctrine, and if 
they were not willing to do this, 
they would not receive the testimony 
of one that might be sent to them 
from the spirit life. 

And so it is to-day. The voice 
of the servants of God proclaiming 
the truth appeal to the hearts of 
those who are seeking for light and 
knowledge, and for purity of life. 
"My sheep ;" said the Master, "hear 
my voice, and a stranger they will 
not follow." And wherever the 
blood of Israel is scattered in the 
nations, and comes in contact with 
the humble Elders that are sent 
forth to declare the gospel of truth, 
the words appeal to them as the 
words of God. 

Now, I think that as a people 
we believe all that God has revealed 
in the Scriptures. We believe in 
the testimony as proclaimed in the 
Gospel of John when he said that 
God so loved the world that he gave 
His only begotten Son, that whom- 
soever believed in Him should not 
perish but have everlasting life. We 
believe that to have faith in Jesus 
Christ means to believe not only 
that He lived and died for the sins 
of the world, but we believe in the 
Church that He organized, and in 



the doctrines of salvation that He 
promulgated, and we believe in liv- 
ing, actual faith, that produces a 
godly repentance from sin, a sor- 
row that leads me and women to 
humility and to contrition of 
heart, and leads them to observance 
of the ordinances of baptism for the 
remission of sins, that, being 
cleansed by the atoning blood of 
Jesus Christ, they are worthy to re- 
ceive, by the imposition of hands, 
the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is 
a faith in Jesus Christ that im- 
plies that we believe in all that He 
taught, in all that He did for the 
salvation of the human race. If the 
people in the day when Jesus minis- 
tered among them had believed in 
the living oracles. If they would 
have accepted His living testimony, 
instead of the written word of the 
ancients, or better, in addition to the 
written word of the ancients, then 
they might have been redeemed 
from their sins and have enjoyed 
the testimony of the righteous. 

Now, I thank the Lord with all 
my heart for the restored gospel 
of the Redeemer. 1 thank the Lord 
that it is my privilege to live in the 
day and time when God has again 
spoken from the heavens, when He 
has again ministered by holy an- 
gels, when He has revealed and 
restored the fullness of the priest- 
hood. 

I know there is saving power in 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I know 
that every individual who will obey 
the injunction of Jesus of Nazareth, 
the Redeemer of the world, that 
everv man and every one who will 
do the will of God, who will obey 
the doctrines that He taught, shall 
know assuredly for themselves con- 
cerning the truth of the principles 
that have been revealed for the sal- 
vation of the human race. 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNON.

I know that the mission of the 
Latter-day Saints is to teach kind- 
ness, long-suffering, patience, mer- 
cy, and endurance, to bless and not 
to revile. I know that it is not only 
our mission, but it is the actual work 
that is being done by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I " i nv, my brethren and sisters, 
that the spirit of repentance may al- 
ways dwell in our hearts, that we 
may always be in a condition to re- 
ceive the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord, that we may always be 
able, in our life's work, to know the 
voice of the true Shepherd, and that 
we may be willing to follow its 
promptings to our salvation and ul- 
timate glory. I pray that as a result 
of the conference meetings that the 
Latter-day Saints who have assem- 
bled may go to their homes with re- 
newed determination to serve the 
Lord in spirit and in truth, in every 
action of their lives, that they may 
proclaim by their daily walk and 
conversation that they have indeed 
drank of the fountain of truth, that 
they have experienced the new birth 
referred to in the chapter that I 
previously referred to. 

I pray that light and truth may 
continue to spread in the earth, that 
the influence and power of this work 
may extend until the kingdoms of 
this world shall become the kingdom 
of our God and His Christ. I pray 
that the words of the poet may be 
exemplified in our lives, 

"Be it my only wisdom here 

To serve the Lord with filial fear. 

With loving gratitude, superior sense 
may I display 

By shunning every evil way and walk- 
ing in the good." 

May the Lord incline our hearts 
to all that is good and pure and true, 
and may we follow in the way that 
is marked out for us from time to 



time. May we give heed to the 
counsels of those who are placed to 
guide us, that we may find contin- 
ually the abiding testimony of Jesus 
in our hearts, which in the end shall 
make us wise unto salvation, I hum- 
bly pray through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

. 1 P ra y that while I occupy a por- 
tion of your time that 1 may say 
something that will be of benefit I 
consider it a very important posi- 
tion to stand before the Saints in 
conference assembled, to feed them 
the bread of life. 

This gospel with which vou and 
1 have become identified" is the 
power of God unto salvation, to 
every man and woman who will 
render strict obedience to its re- 
quirements. There is no position in 
which mankind may be found but 
what the gospel is applicable to that 
condition. Hence we gather our- 
selves together from the places 
where the gospel sound greets our 
ears to the places the Lord has ap- 
pointed for the gathering of His 
people. The prime object in this 
assembling and gathering is that we 
may be taught in the ways of the 
Lord, that we may walk in His 
paths and become intelligent fol- 
lowers of the meek and lowly Jesus. 
When we get through with mortal- 
ity, the only thing we can take with 
us is our intelligence. That which 
we have done which has been 
praiseworthy before the Lord and 
that meets with His approval will 
be to our credit upon the other side 
of the vail ; but as to our earthly 
possessions, and those things that 
w r e esteem to be things of great 
value in this world, we cannot take 



104

them with us when we are called to 
lay this earthly tenement down. The 
elders of the' Church go forth to 
the nations of the earth, calling 
upon mankind everywhere to re- 
pent of their sins, have faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ and go down into 
the waters and be baptized by one 
having authority, for the remission 
of sins, and receive the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. And the elders of the 
Church, no matter where they travel 
or go, say to the people everywhere 
when calling upon them to repent. 
If you will do the will of the Father, 
you shall know of the doctrine : it is 
the privilege of every individual 
who is obedient to this gospel, and 
is endeavoring to carry out its re- 
quirements, to know of the doctrine. 

It is not a person who says "Lord, 
Lord," or who is baptized and stops 
at that, or who receives a portion 
of priesthood and stops at that, that 
is going to be saved with a fulness 
of glory, but he who knoweth the 
will of the Father and then goes 
forth diligently to carry it out in his 
life. In all conditions of life men 
are called upon, without exception, 
to conform to these requirements. 
The promises, the blessings, are to 
follow those that believe and obey 
the gospel. It is not confined to 
those that are living, or who were 
living at the time that the Savior 
and His apostles were upon the 
earth. The Savior told the apostles 
to preach the gospel to every creat- 
ure — not just a few — and he that 
believed and was baptized should be 
saved and he that believed not 
should be damned. And the signs 
were to follow them that believed. 
That proclamation is still binding 
upon the people, and the elders go 
forth and call upon people every- 
where to repent of their sins. It is 



to greet the ears of every individ- 
ual, no matter whether he lived in 
the ages past or at the present time, 
it is his duty to repent and be bap- 
tized for the remission of his sins, 
and if he does render himself obe- 
dient to these ordinances, the signs 
will follow him. 

The question often arises, what 
are we going to do with those that 
have died during the dark ages, 
during the time that the gospel was 
not upon the earth ? We have the 
answer exemplified in what is being 
done today in the midst of the peo- 
ple. We find that not only people 
who have become identified with the 
Church, but the people of the world, 
especially of this American nation, 
are diligently looking for informa- 
tion concerning their progenitors. 
Men are searching after their gene- 
alogical records, becoming familiar 
with pedigrees pertaining to their 
ancestors, who do not ask the ques- 
tion, What is it that prompts me 
to act thus, to spend my money, and 
time to gather together what con- 
stitutes my family tree? But when 
they become familiar with the gos- 
pel of the Son of God. they learn 
the reason. They are doing it be- 
cause by this gospel, in its earliest 
inception, the hearts of the fathers 
were turned to the children and the 
hearts of the children turned to the 
fathers, as prophesied by Malachi. 
At the time of this turning of the 
hearts of the fathers to the chil- 
dren and the children to the fath- 
ers, there was not a genealogical so- 
ciety upon the face of the earth. But 
men who became familiar with the 
Church afterwards, have said that 
they were moved upon about that 
time to search for their ancestors. 
My father said that soon after the 
organization of the Church, he had 
began gathering genealogical data, 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNON. 



105 



for what he could not tell, but as 
soon as the gospel came to him he 
knew the reason why he had been 
doing this. 

Another thing that came upon the 
people at the same time was the 
spirit of gathering. Think of what 
this work has come to the earth to 
accomplish : how could its members 
have accomplished it in a scattered 
condition? As soon as the gospel 
began to be preached, that moment 
the spirit of gathering took posses- 
sion of the people. I remember 
hearing about President John Tay- 
lor, when he was in England on his 
mission, about 1838 or 1840. A sis- 
t Q r said to him one morning, "I 
dreamed last night that the Saints 
were going down into ships, and 
singing the songs of Zion. What 
does it mean?" "It means," said he, 
"that the spirit of gathering has 
taken possession of you. The time 
will come when the Saints will have 
the privilege of gathering to the 
places that God has appointed, that 
they may go into holy places to re- 
ceive those blessings that pertain to 
them and to their kindred dead." 
The spirit of gathering was coming 
upon the people at the earliest 
period of the Church's history. 
Since then the Saints have spent 
their money and time in the erection 
of temples, that they may go in and 
do the work for the dead, and the 
world has been paving the way for 
them to do that sacred work. We 
had a temple in Kirtland, and we 
had one in Nauvoo. I did not see 
the Kirtland Temple, but the Nau- 
voo Temple I remember very well ; 
and I observed the anxiety of the 
people, and the willingness with 
which they gave up their substance 
for the completion of that building. 
The object that the Saints had in 
view was to go into the Temple 



and do the work necessary for the 
redemption of their dead, because 
of the spirit having manifested to 
them that they without their dead 
could not be made perfect. They 
went into the font of the temple and 
were baptized for thousands of their 
progenitors, but before they had the 
privilege of doing much of the other 
work for the dead for which the 
Temple was built, they were driven 
from their homes. 

When we first came here, Presi- 
dent Young marked the place where 
there would be a temple, before they 
had thought much about a city, 
schoolhouses, meetinghouses, or 
other things. The Saints felt they 
could not be saved without their 
dead, nor the dead be saved without 
this people, and temples have been 
erected. While there has been com- 
paratively little work done in the 
temples for the redemption of the 
dead, yet a good beginning has been 
made. Thousands have gone into 
the temples and have received bless- 
ings in their own behalf, and per- 
formed baptisms and other ordi- 
nances that pertain to the salvation 
of their dead. 

But it is not temple work alone 
that this gospel comprehends in its 
vastness ; the gospel is applicable 
to all mankind, and to each indi- 
vidual in every condition. We are 
required to conform strictly to 
every law of God. It is not just the 
redemption of the dead, it is not 
just to be baptized and receive the 
imposition of hands of the servants 
of God for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, it is not sufficient for us to 
receive the holy priesthood and then 
magnify it to a limited extent. It 
is required of us to live by every 
word that proceeds from the mouth 
of God, no matter what it pertains 
to, the education of the children of 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Latter-day Saints, the gathering 
from the nations of the earth, the 
building of meetinghouses and 
temples, or anything else that is 
necessary. These things are parts 
of the gospel of Jesus, and must be 
conformed to, if we would know 
of the doctrine. 

There are other things in connec- 
tion with this. People say to me, 
"How is it that you dwell so much 
upon the law of tithing? You hard- 
ly ever speak to the people but you 
say something about tithing, it looks 
as though you were always thinking 
about money matters, or that the 
Church is wanting money." Why 
do I dwell upon it? It is another 
of the laws that the Lord has re- 
quired His people to observe. Is it 
because the Church is in such a con- 
dition that it has to have the tithes 
of the people in order to conduct the 
work? Not essentially, because the 
earth is the Lord's, and the fulness 
thereof. He could turn everything 
to yield to the accomplishment of 
His purposes. But He has given 
the law of tithing to the people, as 
a school-master to prepare us for 
the future that is before us ; and 
there is a promise connected with 
the observance of this law, that it 
shall be as a mark upon the door- 
post. You know, at the time when 
the children of Israel were about to 
flee from Egypt, they marked the 
door-post with blood, that when the 
destroying angel came he should 
pass by, and that house should be 
spared. It is promised that those 
who render strict conformity to the 
law of tithing, at the time destruc- 
tion comes upon the earth, will be 
soared and preserved ; at the time of 
the burning they shall not be burned, 
but shall be orotected. Another 
thing, when they hear of any good 
thing that has been accomplished in 



the Church, or that is to be accom- 
plished, they feel that they are iden- 
tified with that purpose, because 
they rendered assistance to its ac- 
complishment by paying their tith- 
ing. 

Then there are free-will offer- 
ings. We hear some people say, 
"Well, what I am going to give, if 
it is for charitable purposes, I pre- 
fer to give myself, and then I know 
to whom it is given, and for what 
purpose it is used." But I feel, and 
the gospel has taught me that if I 
would be blessed of the Lord, I 
must conform to this law that we 
shall observe a day of fast, and 
place in the hands of the bishop the 
value of what we would have eatsn 
on that day, for the poor. This help 
is not given to the poor to make 
them feel that they are paupers, or 
dependent upon the charity of the 
people ; they should be made to feel 
that they are entitled to this assist- 
ance, because of their fidelity to the 
work of God. Having paid their 
tithing, and done the things that 
God has required of them, and being 
now poor, and not able to toil and 
labor for their sustenance, God has 
established a principle by which they 
shall be provided for, that the 
bishop, the father of the ward, will 
look after them and see that their 
needs are supplied. 

When we have lived until our 
hair is white, and are ready to lay 
our body down in the grave, we feel 
in our hearts that time has been too 
short to accomplish all that God has 
designed. In order to know the 
doctrine, we must do the will of the 
Father, and in order to do the will 
of the Father, we must conform to 
every law that God has revealed for 
the redemption of His people. When 
we. kneel down at night, as I trust 
all who are Saints do, and pour out 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNON.

our hearts in gratitude to our 
Father, in whose image we are 
created, we ask him among other 
things to grant that we may be eter- 
nally exalted in His presence with a 
fulness of glory. That is the bur- 
den of our prayer, that we may 
have the privilege of returning to 
the Father. Though we offer our 
prayers in that faith that brooks no 
denial, yet our lives do not always 
conform to the requirements of the 
gospel. But, my brethren and sis- 
ters, if you will put yourselves in 
such condition that God will see 
your sincerity not by your words 
alone, but by your life, walk, and 
conversation before Him, you need 
have no fear about being exalted in 
His presence with a fulness of 
glory, for it is sure to come to you. 
How are you to know that it is 
coming to you, and that you are 
approved of God? Not simply sit- 
ting down and being inactive in re- 
gard to these matters. The way to 
know is to live so that the hope of 
eternal life that was implanted at 
the time the servants of God im- 
pressed you with its importance 
grows brighter every day in your 
hearts ; and as you do, you will be 
better satisfied with your life's la- 
bors. A person begins to doubt 
when he neglects his life's duties, 
and spends his time criticizing his 
brethren and sisters. If you will 
devote your time to the service of 
God, and keep bright within your 
heart the feeling that brings you in 
fellowship with the Spirit of God, 
it will be as a well of knowledge 
springing up into eternal life. That 
is my testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters. 

You know there are many people 
connected with this Church that 
spirituallv died in the days of Joseph 
Smith. T remember one time com- 



ing across a man of that kind who 
had nothing remaining of the spirit 
or genius of the gospel in his dis- 
position or makeup, and yet he was 
expecting, because of Joseph Smith's 
promises to him, to reap eternal life 
and celestial glory in the presence 
of the Father — and he was back in 
the states waiting for something to 
turn up, waiting for the people to 
go, he said, out west and then back, 
in the form of a horseshoe. But 
there was something connected with 
that promise, that he should be 
saved in the presence of the Father, 
that you know, you people in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. The promise was pre- 
dicted on condition of his faithful- 
ness. Did you ever receive the 
promise of a blessing in your life 
that you did not think was predi- 
cated upon your faithfulness ? You 
have heard among other things be- 
ing said to people being married, 
"All these blessings, together with 
all the blessings pertaining to the 
new and everlasting covenant, I 
seal upon you by virtue of the holy 
priesthood, through your faithful- 
ness." A man who has been prom- 
ised by the Prophet Joseph, or the 
other prophets, Brigham Young, 
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, 
Lorenzo Snow, or Joseph F. Smith 
— any of these worthy servants of 
God — has had the blessing con- 
ferred upon condition of his faith- 
fulness. 

What made Abraham what he 
was? How came Abraham to be 
considered the father of the faith- 
ful? God said that He knew that 
Abraham would teach his seed after 
him to keep His commandments. 
What caused Abraham to have this 
blessing? The Lord had tried him 
to the very utmost, and found him 
worthy of eternal life. That was 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



what caused Abraham to become 
the friend of God, a man upon 
whom God could rely. Abraham 
had been told that his seed would 
be like the sands upon the seashore, 
or the stars, as they are innumera- 
ble so would his posterity be. Abra- 
ham knew that his hands must not 
be imbued with the blood of his 
fellows. Yet, when the Lord said 
to Abraham, "Take your son and 
offer him as a sacrifice," Abraham 
took him, nothing doubting - . When 
they got to the foot of the hill and 
commenced its ascent, the boy said, 
"Here is the wood, but where is the 
sacrifice?" And that father turned 
to that son, through whom the 
blessings had been promised, in 
whom the hope of the future was 
concentrated, and he said, "My son, 
thou art the offering." What a ter- 
rible thing for a father to tell a son ! 
Yet it was in obedience to the re- 
quirements of God. When the time 
came and the knife was finally 
raised to strike the fatal blow, 
Abraham was told, "Hold, look in 
yonder thicket, and find a ram." 
And Abraham, because of his fidel- 
ity to that which God had revealed, 
came to be the Father of the faith- 
ful, and the friend of God. 

May His blessings be upon you. 
May we, in contemplating the fu- 
ture, remember that it is necessary 
for us to do the will of the Father 
before we will know of the doc- 
trine, then will it be truly accom- 
plished through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(President First Council of Seventy.) 

The spirit of this conference has, 
I believe, fastened upon our minds 
the necessity of receiving every 
nrincinle of the gospel and living 
the same, practicing in our daily 
lives all that belongs to it. 



When the Prophet Joseph Smith 
received the visitation of the Father 
and Son, he was under the power of 
the Holy Spirit to that degree that 
he could endure the presence of 
these heavenly beings. After they 
had commissioned him, and in- 
structed him by embassadors sent 
from time to time, he was entrusted 
with a very great work, that of 
translating an ancient record, the 
history of the races that were found 
upon this continent when it was dis- 
covered by Christopher Columbus. 
The prophet states that, while 
translating this sacred record, he 
and his fellow -worker, Oliver Cow- 
dery, were impressed with a passage 
of scripture, found in III Nephi, re- 
lating to the ordinance of baptism, 
and they retired to a secret place 
and prayed to the Lord for light in 
regard to this ordinance. In answer 
to their prayer, the Lord sent to 
them John the Baptist, the forerun- 
ner of our Lord, and he revealed 
unto Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
dery the meaning of the ordinance 
of baptism, and the way in which it 
should be administered, at the same 
time conferring upon them the 
Aaronic Priesthood, and promising 
them that they should receive the 
Melchizedek Priesthood in the due 
time of the Lord. 

When our Savior was upon the 
earth, in the meridian of time, He 
came in fulfillment of the predic- 
tions of ancient prophets, and ac- 
cording to the promise of the Father 
that He would send a Redeemer 
into the world, His only begotten 
Son, that was to save the people 
from the condition caused through 
the fall of their first parents, sub- 
ject to eternal death, banished from 
the presence of Godjesus came and 
brought life and immortality to 
light, yet, though He was the Son 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



109 



of God, the Redeemer of the world, 
He subjected Himself to receive the 
sacred ordinance of baptism. We 
are told that He came unto John, 
who was baptizing repentant Jews 
in the River Jordan, and requested 
that He be baptized ; and John said, 
"I have need to be baptized of thee, 
and comest thou to me?" But Jesus 
answered, "It becometh us to fulfill 
all righteousness ;" and then John 
suffered him. When Jesus came up 
out of the water, the Father mani- 
fested His approval of the ordi- 
nance by proclaiming, "This is my 
beloved Son in Whom I am well 
pleased." Then the Holy Ghost, in 
the sign of a beautiful dove, came 
and res.ted upon the Savior as an 
evidence to the people of the fulfill- 
ment of the prophetic words John 
the Baptist had uttered sometime 
previous when he said, "Upon 
whom you see the Holy Ghost de- 
scending, know you indeed that this 
is He." 

Afterward, when Jesus was min- 
istering among the people, John was 
taken and thrown into prison, and 
he sent to the Savior two faithful 
mesengers who asked : "Are you 
indeed the promised Messiah ? or do 
we look for another?" And Jesus 
sent this answer to John, "Behold 
the gospel is preached to the poor, 
the dead are raised, the deaf are 
made to hear, the blind have their 
eyes opened" — leaving John to 
judge by these words whether He 
was indeed the promised Redeemer 
or not. We are not informed as to 
what the effect was upon John when 
he received this message from our 
Lord, but this we do know, that 
when the Savior arose from the 
dead He sought to impress upon 
the minds of His disciples that He 
was indeed a resurrected being. He 
said to one who was doubting, 



Come and handle me and see: be- 
hold the prints of the nails in my 
hands: behold the wound of the 
Roman spear in my side, and no 
longer doubt, but believe, for a 
spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye 
see me have. Later, He said to 
His apostles, "As my Father has 
commissioned me, so I commission 
you." He declared that all power 
was given unto Him in heaven and 
in earth, and then said, "Go ye 
therefore, and teach all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost * * * * and lo, I 
am with you alway, even unto the 
end of the world." 

We find, my brethren and sisters, 
that there were many, in the early 
history of this work, who when they 
heard the gospel, said to the elders, 
"Why, I was baptized into the Bap- 
tist church," or "I was baptized, 
when an infant, into the Methodist 
church," or "I have received that 
ordinance in other churches." But 
the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph, 
All persons that desire to be re- 
ceived in the Church of Christ in 
this dispensation must repent of 
their sins, and receive baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, 
that they may receive the Holy 
Ghost, and this ordinance must be 
administered by one having author- 
ity ; for no man taketh this honor 
to himself but he that is called of 
God as was Aaron. Aaron, as we 
know, was called by the Lord 
through the Prophet Moses. The 
Lord said, lay your hands upon 
your brother Aaron and call him to 
be your spokesman, that he may 
take some of' the burden from your 
shoulders. 

Many have said, "If I must be 
deprived of the comforts of life that 
I so much enjoy, in the way of 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



using tobacco, or wine, or tea, or 
coffee, I do not want to join the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I would rather have 
my enjoyment of these luxuries 
than belong to the church whose 
doctrines you have introduced to 
me." Others have refrained from 
embracing the work, fearful that 
they would be deprived of some 
pleasures that they have heretofore 
enjoyed. Some refused to embrace 
the gospel because, as I have stated, 
they did not think it necessary to be 
baptized again. Others hold back 
for fear that they might meet with 
censure from their neighbors and 
fellow-churchmen. Many a person 
has held himself aloof from this 
work of the Lord because he was 
afraid of public opinion. You know 
very well, my friends, that the 
Saints have not always been spoken 
well of. In fact, I am reminded of 
one of old, who said, This people 
are spoken evil of everywhere : and 
yet they seem to prosper : they love 
each other: and they grow in 
strength, in power and in numbers. 
One said concerning the Apostles 
of Jesus, Let these people alone and, 
if their doctrine is of man, they will 
be scattered and. come to naught; 
but if their doctrine be of God, let 
them alone, lest perchance you be 
found fighting against God ; a very 
wise and correct admonition. 

You know Paul said, in relating 
his experience to some who were 
listening to him to condemn him, I 
was indeed a Pharisee of the 
straightest kind. I went from city 
to city to prosecute the followers of 
the Nazarene. I was journeying to 
Damascus with letters of apprehen- 
sion in my hand and that I might 
find people there who were pro- 
claiming the gospel of the Nazar- 
ene. And as I journeyed to Damas- 



cus, a great light came upon me 
and I fell to the earth, and I heard 
a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me?" and I said, 
"Who art thou Lord?" and the 
voice said, "I am Jesus whom thou 
persecuteth." Then Saul asked 
what he should do, and he was told 
to arise, and someone should lead 
him into Damascus, and one Anan- 
ias would tell him what to do to be 
saved. Paul declared, I rose up 
from the dust and one took me by 
the hand and led me to the city of 
Damascus, and there I prayed to the 
Lord, and the Lord revealed to me 
that there was a man in that city 
who was also praying to the Lord 
to know what his duty was, and the 
angel came to this other man who 
was praying, and said to him, Arise, 
and go to such and such a place 
in the city, and find one Saul, for 
behold he prayeth. This servant of 
the Lord obeyed the voice and 
found Saul and said to him, "Broth- 
er Saul, receive thy sight," and Paul 
says, I immediately felt my sight 
restored as of scales falling from 
my eyes. And then this good man 
who was sent to him, who was 
called Ananias, said to him, "Broth- 
er Saul, why tarriest thou? Arise 
now and be baotized and wash away 
your sins, calling upon the name of 
the Lord." And so, Paul declares, 
I was brought to a newness of life 
by being buried in the liquid grave. 
And not only were my eyes opened, 
my physical vision restored, but the 
eyes of my spirit and understanding 
were onened as well. Then Paul 
knew he had been persecuting 
Saints of God. who were indeed the 
followers of the meek and lowly 
Nazarene, who was indeed the Son 
of God. 

My brethren and sisters, we have 
listened to the doctrines of the gos- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



Ill 



pel from a number of speakers dur- 
ing this great conference, and I 
must say, in the experience that I 
have had in attending conferences, 
I never have attended one in the last 
sixty years that I have been any bet- 
ter satisfied with than this which is 
now about to close. 

May the Lord bless the people, 
comfort everyone. Those who could 
not come to this conference, may 
they receive from their friends the 
message of good will and kindliness 
that came from the lips of our 
prophet, and leader, and from the 
lips of his brethren who have spoken 
during this conference. May health 
and peace continue to abound in the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The hymn commencing, "I know 
that my Redeemer lives," was sung 
by Prof. Charles Kent. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder George E: Bench.

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Inspiration in the hymns of Zion. — Re- 
spect and friendship of neighbors de- 
sirable. — Testimony lost by failure to 
live Gospel principles. — Children honor 
parents by being true to the faith. — 
Godliness and loyalty characteristics 
of Church leaders. 

I rejoice exceedingly in the spirit 
of the meetings of this conference. 
I endorse most heartily all that I 
have heard during the conference, 
and bear testimony to the inspira- 
tion of the Lord in those who have 
spoken ; and I humbly and earnestly 
pray that the time I occupy, this aft- 
ernoon, that the same good spirit 
and inspiration which have been 
given to those who have already 
spoken may be given to me. I have 
no desire today, in standing before 
you, and I have never had when oc- 
cupying this position or a similar 
one, except to say only those things 
which might be beneficial to those 
who listen as well as to myself. I 
have been blessed upon more than 
one occasion, while speaking to the 
Saints, and have felt truly grateful 
to the Lord for the encouragement 
that has come to me. because of the 
rich outpouring of His Holy Spirit. 

I have been particularly im- 
pressed during this conference, with 
the many old-time and inspiring 
hymns which have been sung by 
the choir and the congregation. I 
never hear, "Come, come ye Saints," 
"Though Deepening Trials throng 
your way," and other inspirational 
songs which the Lord has given to 
the "men and women of this com- 
munity, by the inspiration of His 
Spirit, that I do not reioice as I lis- 
ten to them. I feel that this very 



112 



GEXERAL CONFERENCE. 



splendid hymn, "Though Deepening 
Trials throng your way," could be 
read by every one within the sound 
of my voice, at the close of the 
meeting today, and they would be 
profited thereby ; and the same 
would be true with reference to the 
others that we have listened to. 

I rejoice in the unity existing 
among the Latter-day Saints. As 
you know, it falls to my lot, in con- 
nection with my associates in the 
Council of the Twelve, to visit the 
different Stakes of Zion ; and wher- 
ever I have visited in any of the 
Stakes I have always found love and 
devotion to the work of the Lord, 
on the part of the stake officers, and 
of the ward officers, and all those 
who are connected as officers with 
the auxiliary associations in the 
Church. I was delighted with the 
report made here by Brother Mur- 
dock, that they had Religion Classes 
after their school exercises, through- 
out the entire Wasatch Stake. There 
are some of our people that have 
stood up so straight, where they 
were school trustees, that in my 
judgment they have leaned over 
backwards, in objecting to religious 
training after the school sessions. 
I hope that the very splendid ex- 
ample of liberality that has been ex- 
hibited in the Wasatch Stake of 
Zion may spread all over the stakes 
of Zion. I rejoice in hearing that 
those not of our faith in that stake 
of Zion had good fellowship and 
good will for the Latter-day Saints. 
That is as it ought to be. As I 
understand the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, it enjoins upon u« to live 
lives of virtue, of charity, of up- 
rightness, of fair and honorable 
dealing, so that all men seeing our 
good deeds shall glorify God and 
shall be led to investigate the gospel 
of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the 



elders in the Church, at home and 
abroad. 

I can indorse the statement made 
by President Hinckley, that I do 
not know any person who has once 
had a testimony of this gospel who 
has ever lost that testimony unless 
he first failed to do his duty and to 
keep the commandments of God. 
The writings of James, wherein he 
says that faith without works is 
dead, that it is like the body with- 
out the spirit, have always appealed 
to me. I have discovered that dead 
faith, among professed Latter-day 
Saints, comes from the failure to be 
honest with the Lord in the pay- 
ment of our tithes and offerings, 
the failure to observe what is known 
as the Word of Wisdom, the failure 
to attend to secret and family pray- 
ers, and the failure to live a life of 
pure religion as James puts it down, 
which is to visit the widow and the 
orphan and to relieve the distress of 
those that are needy. It is this 
class and this class only, so far as 
I have ever seen, and the class who 
commit sin, who lose their faith in 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. I re- 
joice beyond my power to tell, that 
as men grow in good deeds, as they 
grow in love for their fellows, as 
they grow in absolute honesty in 
their dealings with their fellow men, 
as their lives are shown to be worthy 
of the imitation of all men. that 
those who so live grow and increase 
in a burning testimony of the divin- 
ity of the work in which we are en- 
gaged, and that there are no doubts 
or dubieties which cross their minds 
as to the inspiration of the Lord to 
His servants who stand at the head 
of this work. 

We have heard gratitude ex- 
pressed by many of the speakers be- 
cause they, like Nephi of old, have 
been born of goodly parents. I feel 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



113 



that I would be unworthy the won- 
derful teachings and the magnificent 
and splendid example of a widowed 
mother who reared me, if I too did 
not lift my voice here today and 
thank God for a mother who loved 
Him, who loved the religion of 
Jesus Christ, whose life was an ex- 
ample above reproach, than whom 
I knew no more loyal, patriotic and 
true woman among the Latter-day 
Saints. I thank the Lord for my 
father, although I never knew him. 
I have had love lavished upon me 
by the leaders of this Church and 
by influential men from one end of 
this country to the other, because 
of the love and respect which they 
felt for my father. Particularly was 
this the case with the late President 
John R. Winder, who often told me 
that the first encouraging word and 
helping hand, and the first loyal 
friend that he found in Utah was 
my father ; and he certainly paid 
and repaid this love four fold, by 
love and kindness and encourage- 
ment and blessing to me and other 
members of my father's family. It 
is indeed a wonderful and a splen- 
did thing to be born of goodly 
parents ; and it is one of the saddest 
of all sad things where the sons and 
the daughters of goodly parents are 
recreant to the faith of their parents, 
when they are careless and indiffer- 
ent, where they fail to honor their 
fathers and their mothers, and 
thereby fail to honor their God, 
where they follow after the things 
of this world, and allow the ideas of 
men to blind them. 

I particularly enjoyed the re- 
marks of President Smith. Many 
of them came home to me ; and with 
the help of the Lord I propose to 
practice his teachings and to see to 
it that they shall not be to me as a 
"dead faith." They particularly 



impressed me when I realized that 
upon very many occasions I had 
been guilty of referring to the faults 
and the failings of people, instead 
of magnifying their good deeds. 
With the help of the Lord I propose 
to try and learn to sing the favorite 
song of my counselor in the Tooele 
Stake of Zion, and my successor, 
the late Hugh S. Gowans, "Nay 
speak no ill, a kindly word can 
never leave a sting behind," etc. 

I thank the Lord for my intimate 
association, from a little child, with 
President Brigham Young, John 
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo 
Snow, and with President Joseph 
F. Smith. I thank the Lord that I 
have never known anything but 
good in all my association for fifty 
years with these men. I remember 
very distinctly, when a child six 
years of age, a conversation with 
President Brigham Young; and for 
fifty years I have never heard in 
public or in private anything fall 
from the lips of the servants of 
God, who have been chosen to stand 
at the head of this work, but what 
was for the uplift and the better- 
ment of the people of God. I know, 
as I know that I live, that those 
men who have passed away were 
in very deed God's representatives 
upon the earth, and that Joseph F. 
Smith is the Lord's anointed today. 
I know that each and every one of 
us who are loyal, who are true, who 
are patriotic, who learn the lesson 
that "obedience is better than sac- 
rifice and to hearken than the fat of 
rams," will be blessed of God, that 
He will magnify us, and that as we 
sustain His representative He will 
sustain us. God bless all Israel, and 
help us all to be loyal and true, and 
to serve Him with full purpose of 
heart. I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HYRTJM M. SMITH. 

Honor to parentage a general charac- 
teristic of faithful Saints. — Marriage 
advocated as a moral safeguard. — 
Righteous life an important qualifica- 
tion for Marriage. — Trouble and sor- 
row lessened, happiness increased, 
where true love prevails. — Immorality 
of divorce. — Unfortunate results of 
Marriage outside the Covenant. 

I believe that all who have been 
fortunate enough to be in attend- 
ance upon this conference have re- 
joiced in the spirit of it. . I believe 
that God has looked down upon us 
in our assemblies in approbation, 
and that He has poured out upon 
us a very rich portion of His Holy 
Spirit ; and I believe that the angels 
have rejoiced with us. I believe 
also that the faithful fathers, of 
whom witness has been borne by 
faithful sons, have also been filled 
with joy in seeing the integrity, 
faithfulness and devotion of their 
sons and grandsons. 

I could have wished that the spirit 
might have directed that others of 
our brethren of the presidencies of 
stakes might have been called to ad- 
dress the Saints. Those who have 
spoken have spoken under the di- 
vine inspiration of the Lord ; and it 
has given the Latter-day Saints an 
opportunity to judge of the charac- 
ter, the caliber, and the quality of 
the men whom the Lord has sought 
out and chosen to preside over the 
various stakes of Zion and mission 
fields. There are between fifty and 
sixty other presidents of stakes, 
who are the peers of the brethren 
who have spoken; and I rejoice in 
the strength and in the integrity of 
these servants of the Lord. If time 
would permit there are many of the 
bishops who could also give a splen- 
did account of themselves, if called 
upon to do so. This power of the 



priesthood is not only enjoyed and 
exercised by the general authorities 
of the Church, but the same power 
is held and the same authority is 
wisely exercised by presidents of 
stakes, and bishops of wards. I may 
say, further, that there are hun- 
dreds and thousands of men who do 
not hold these responsible positions 
of presidency, but who do hold the 
priesthood and are exercising the 
authority of it in honor and right- 
eousness among the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Underlying the remarks of many 
of the brethren can be found that 
great law of God, that command- 
ment which He recorded with His 
own finger upon the tables of stone, 
namely, "Honor thy father and thy 
mother that thy days may be long 
in the land which the Lord thy God 
giveth thee." We have seen ex- 
emplified, in the lives of the breth- 
ren who have been called upon to 
address the conference, a complete 
and full obedience to this law and 
commandment. They have spoken 
in praise and thanksgiving of their 
fathers, and of the faith of their 
fathers, and have testified that they 
likewise have the same testimony of 
the truth and the same determina- 
tion to stand firm, steadfast and 
true to the covenants and obliga- 
tions of the gospel. I rejoice in this 
fact, and I may testify that this is 
not confined to those who are 
termed authorities in the Church, 
but it is general among the Latter- 
day Saints. There is always in the 
heart of the faithful Latter-day 
Saint gratitude to God, if he or she 
were born of parents who were 
faithful in the Church ; and there is 
always great joy and happiness in 
being conscious of the fact that we 
ourselves love the truth and desire 
to be faithful and true. It is not 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



115 



so much that we honor our fathers 
and our mothers that, individually, 
our days may be long in the land. 
This is a great principle of heaven 
and a great law unto the people of 
God, and pertains to the congrega- 
tion or to the whole Church as well 
as individuals ; and when we all are 
faithful to the parents whom God 
has given us, then it goes without 
saying that the lives of the people, 
and the perpetuity of the Church, 
will be extended and prolonged in 
the land that the Lord has given 
unto His people. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
while upon general principles it is 
a wise thing to see the fruits of 
righteousness and of goodness and 
of faith and obedience in our breth- 
ren and sisters, nevertheless there 
are conditions that prevail among 
the children of men that are dan- 
gerous to their peace and happiness. 
Against these evils that threaten 
our happiness and salvation we 
cannot always be justified in closing 
our eyes or remaining silent. The 
moral condition of the world is very 
bad indeed, so bad that it is causing 
grave concern among others than 
the ministers of the gospel. States- 
men, governors and other state offi- 
cials are concerned about these 
things, and are investigating these 
matters with the view of determin- 
ing the causes thereof, with the 
hope of finding a remedy. Immor- 
ality of various kinds is rife in the 
world. While I am thankful to say 
these things are not so prevalent 
among the Latter-day Saints, yet 
there "is danger in them, and occa- 
sionally they come very close home 
to some of us. 

I would like to say just a word or 
two upon the principle of marriage. 
It is being advocated by some as the 
remedy for the immoral condition 



so prevalent among men, that 
churches should take up the doc- 
trine of marriage and preach it 
more often and extensively, to en- 
courage men and women to marry, 
and to be faithful in the marriage 
relation. That is timely, it is a good 
doctrine ; it has been forgotten alto- 
gether too long, and needs attention 
on the part of both the clergy and 
the civil authorities, and of the peo- 
ple themselves. It is a great prin- 
ciple in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints ; as practiced 
outside the Church it is a principle 
that is not altogether a remedy for 
immorality in the world, as may be 
illustrated in the boast of one of our 
neighboring states, and published 
under great leaded headlines, that 
that state had the record in divorces, 
that out of every seven marriages 
there was one divorce. Now, I 
would like to say to my brethren 
and sisters of the Latter-day Saints, 
we ought to have respect and re- 
gard for that great and vital prin- 
ciple and doctrine of marriage. We 
should advocate it among our young 
people in the spirit of righteousness 
and- sacredness, and never speak of 
it in the spirit of levity or funmak- 
ing, or do that which would dis- 
courage young people from entering 
into the marriage relation, or that 
would discredit that relation. There 
are far too many of our young peo- 
ple of marriageable age unmarried. 
I do not know the reasons why they 
remain unmarried. Many young 
men fear that they are unable to 
support a wife, build a home and 
care for a family. Many young 
women have the same fear, that the 
young man will not be able to sup- 
port them in the manner that they 
are accustomed to; losing sight of 
the great fact that their fathers and 
mothers, perhaps, have come up 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



from the beginning, even in pover- 
ty, starting very low indeed in the 
scale of possession of this world's 
goods, but by frugality, sacrifice and 
skimping themselves, practicing 
rigid economy, they have eventually 
achieved success in life and reached 
a reasonable degree of prosperity. 
Young men ought to be willing, 
with the help of God, to undertake 
this great responsibility, if they 
have health of body and a willing- 
ness to work and earn a living ; and 
young women, who can find honor- 
able and virtuous young men so de- s 
termined, ought to be willing to ac- 
cept them and help them, be help- 
meets to them, and not seek to 
marry only that they may have 
someone to earn money for them 
that they can spend in pleasure and 
extravagance. I would like to read, 
in this connection, just a paragraph 
from a discourse delivered by one 
of the early apostles in this dispen- 
sation, upon this subject. I read it 
because I feel that the doctrine and 
the principle could hardly be ex- 
pounded more beautifully. I recom- 
mend this paragraph to our young 
men and young women, and to their 
fathers and mothers, and advise the 
latter to commence early teaching 
their children to prepare themselves 
for the duties and responsibilities of 
life, rather than for merely enjoying 
those foolish and worldly pastimes 
and pleasures after which so many 
seek. 

"Let that man who intends to become 
a husband seek first the kingdom of God 
and its righteousness, and learn to gov- 
ern himself according to the law of God, 
for he that cannot govern himself cannot 
govern others. Let him dedicate his 
property, his talents, his time and even 
his life, to the service of God, holding 
all things at his disposal to do with the 
same according as He shall direct 
through the counsel He has ordained. 
In selecting a companion let him not 



look wholly at the beauty of the counte- 
nance, or the splendor of the - apparel, 
or the great fortune, or the artful smiles, 
or the affected modesty of females, for 
all these without the genuine virtues are 
like the dew drops which glitter for a 
moment in the sun and dazzle the eye but 
soon vanish away; but let him look for 
a kind, amiable disposition, for unaf- 
fected modesty, for industrious habits, 
for sterling virtue, for honesty, integrity 
and truthfulness ; for cleanliness in per- 
son, in apparel, in cooking, and in every 
kind of domestic labor, for cheerfulness, 
patience, and stability of character, and 
above all for genuine religion to control 
and govern her every thought and deed." 

That is the doctrine of the gos- 
pel of Christ, that I would like to 
present for the consideration of the 
young men and women ; that young 
men contemplating marriage should 
contemplate it in a spirit of prayer 
and devotion to God and to service 
of the Lord, and that young women 
should prepare themselves to be 
such as described by Brother Orson 
Pratt in his discourse from which 
I have selected this paragraph. I 
would say to young men and women 
that they should honor their fathers 
and mothers, and should seek the 
counsel and advice of their parents 
in such important steps as marriage. 
It is one of the most vital and im- 
portant moves that young men and 
women can make in life. Upon it 
depends more of joy, more of hap- 
piness, more of peace and genuine 
satisfaction than can be found in 
almost any other thing in the world, 
where the union is entered into in 
the spirit of truth and righteous- 
ness, and a determination to fulfil 
the laws of God and of nature. On 
the -other hand it is a step fraught 
with trouble, sorrow, misery, and 
nnhappiness when it is not entered 
into in this spirit and for this pur- 
pose. Young men and women must 
determine that they are willing, with 
the help of God, to endure whatso- 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



117 



ever experiences come to them in 
life. The responsibilities of mar- 
riage are great, but where love 
abounds, there will be happiness and 
joy unspeakable. So, likewise, in 
that relationship, they will be called 
upon, in all probability, to undergo 
very sorrowful experiences, that 
will bring sadness to their souls and 
try them severely ; yet all these 
things can be endured if the love 
that should exist does exist in the 
hearts of those who have plighted 
their faith to each other. 

"My house is a house of order, 
saith the Lord, and not a house of 
confusion." Brother Penrose read 
that passage this morning. That 
relates not so much to the little or- 
dinary noise, and disturbance, and 
confusion that we may find some- 
times in homes, or in communities. 
It may cover that point, but it has 
a more deep and a much wider 
meaning than that. That home 
where the furniture may at times be 
deranged and the children may 
create din with their lusty shouts, 
that is not confusion, that can easily 
be remedied. That home wherein 
a son rises up in rebellion against 
his father, and against the order, 
rules and regulation of the home, 
there is confusion. That community 
where one man lifts himself up in 
opposition against his brother in the 
priesthood, and opposes its author- 
ity, creates confusion ; but this 
passage of scripture was given, 
more particularly, in connection 
with the revelation that the Lord 
gave upon the great subject of mar- 
riage. There is no thing in the 
world that can bring about such 
great confusion as promiscuous 
marriage and divorce ; the woman 
being married a half dozen times, 
and being divorced a half dozen 
times, bearing children with each 



husband; that, I say, brings about 
confusion; and the same it is with 
the man who marries and is di- 
vorced, time and time again. It is 
a most immoral condition; and the 
issue therefrom are without father 
or mother, and without name, al- 
most, in this world, and surely will 
be so in the next. 

Our young men who marry gen- 
tile girls create confusion. They 
marry not according to the law of 
God. They are not joined together 
by the holy spirit of promise, they 
are joined together for only a little 
time, to be severed and separated 
after this life. They have no more 
claim upon one another; and the 
children that may have been born 
find themselves likewise without 
father or mother, or relationship in 
the world to come, and this is con- 
fusion. It is as it were the forging 
of a chain of unwelded links, that is 
easily broken and scattered, and is 
not in accordance with the law of 
God. No young man can marry 
outside of the Church,' except he 
dishonor his father and mother, and 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and the command of God as given 
in the revelations of the latter-day. 
The same it is with a young woman 
who marries out of the Church. She 
marries unhappiness and misery, 
separation and disintegration, loss 
of husband and children in the 
world to come, and loses happiness 
and peace of mind and heart here ; 
and it is unfortunate. I would like 
to call attention to this great prin- 
ciple and plead with our fathers and 
mothers to more thoughtfully and 
thoroughly teach these doctrines to 
their sons and daughters ; that such 
dishonor to the latter, to their 
parents, to the Church of God, and 
the principles of righteousness may 
not be shown, and that the incident 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



misery and unhappiness may not be 
or have to be endured. Let our 
young men and young women mar- 
ry in the Church, and in the holy 
places that God has set apart where 
that ceremony may be performed. 
Let them marry as the performance 
of a part of their sacred religion, 
because it is a religious rite, and 
marriage without religion will never 
be a success but must spell failure 
sooner or later, both in time and 
eternity. 

Now, if you would have your 
children rise up, in a later day, and. 
take the stand toward you that our 
brethren, the presidents of stakes 
who have addressed us, have taken 
towards their parents, you will 
honor your fathers and mothers, 
and the gospel to which they have 
been true all their lives here. I 
thought myself, what a terrible 
thing it would be for a man to be 
born of parents so unequally yoked 
together as one to be a "Mormon" 
and one a Gentile. He would have 
to say : My father was a Gentile ; 
my mother was a Latter-day Saint ; 
or, My mother was a Gentile, and 
my father was a Latter-day Saint. 
I was born without the covenant ; 
my parents were not sealed by the 
holy spirit of promise and by the 
authority of God. I have no father 
and no mother in the hereafter, ex- 
cept, through the blessings of the 
gospel, my mother may be given, 
and I with her, to some good man, 
by the holy priesthood for eternity. 
That, to me, would be a terrible 
condition. 

My brethren and sisters, I want 
to say and can say, as my brethren 
have said, I love, honor and revere 
my parents, and I trust that my 
children after me can say the same 
thing, and God be pleased that their 
children after them, to the latest 



generation, can rise up and declare 
their fathers blessed. 

May God bless the Latter-day 
Saints ; may they look into the doc- 
trines of the Church and the holy 
principles of righteousness, the 
principles of heaven, of truth, as 
they have been revealed, and prac- 
tice them in their lives, revere them, 
honor them, and live by them, that 
they may be blest of God and ex- 
alted in the land which God has 
given us, and exalted too, in due 
time, in the presence of the Father 
with the redeemed and sanctified, in 
a saved and a glorified condition. I 
ask this blessing for the Latter-day 
Saints, each and every one of us, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

If it may not be considered in- 
trusion, I would like to supplement, 
in a few words, the remarks that 
have just been made. The house of 
the Lord is a house of order and 
not a house of confusion ; and that 
means, that the man is not without 
the woman in the Lord, neither is 
the woman without the man in the 
Lord ; and that no man can be saved 
and exalted in the kingdom of God 
without the woman, and no woman 
can reach perfection and exaltation 
in the kingdom of God, alone. That 
is what it means. God instituted 
marriage in the beginning. He 
made man in His own image and 
likeness, male and female, and in 
their creation it was designed that 
they should be united together in 
sacred bonds of marriage, and one 
is not perfect without the other. 
Furthermore, it means that there is 
no union for time and eternity that 
can be consummated outside of the 
law of God and the order of His 
house. Men may desire it, they

may go through the form of it in 
this life, but it will be of non effect 
except it be done and sanctioned by 
divine authority, in the name of the 
Father and of the Sqn and of the 
Holy Ghost. 

It is my pleasure to read to the 
congregation a message that I have 
received today from Washington, 
D. C: 

"April 5th, 1913. 
"President Joseph F. Smith : 

"I have been thinking all day of home 
and our general conference. I am with 
you all in spirit, if not in person. May 
the spirit of unity, of prayer, of charity,

man. "Reed Smoot."

Declaration that the Lord is pleased with 
His people. — Prayer for continued 
success of the Lord's work. 

I declare unto this great gather- 
ing here that the Spirit of the Lord 
has been with us in this conference, 
with those who have spoken, and 
with those who have listened. The 
Lord is pleased with those whom 
He has called to direct His work 



in the earth in this day. He is 
pleased with their fidelity, and with 
their fearlessness to declare His 
truth that has been revealed, and 
restored to the earth again. The 
Lord is pleased with those whom 
He has called to teach the youth of 
Zion the principles of righteous- 
ness, the principles of truth and ed- 
ucation. The Lord is pleased with 
those who sing His praises, not only 
here in our choir, that we have 
heard today, but in the choirs 
throughout the stakes of Zion. The 
Lord is pleased with all who are 
serving Him, who strive to honor 
His name and perform His work in 
the earth. 

May the Lord continue to be 
pleased with us. May we so live 
that He will continue to bless us, 
and look down upon us in love and 
mercy. May we take home with us 
the counsels, admonitions and 
teachings that we have received in 
this conference, both young and 
old ; that we may honor the Lord 
and His servants in the earth. May 
He bless you in your homes and in 
your endeavors to serve Him and 
keep His commandments, to live 
clean and unspotted from the sins of 
the world. May we so live that He 
will be pleased with us in all of our 
endeavors to serve Him, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

Several times during this confer- 
ence, while listening to the brethren 
and contemplating the doctrines 
which they have presented, I have 
made this mental comment: How 
excellent is the wisdom of the Lord. 
And in the few moments that I am to 
address you, if I could. I would like 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to point out, by demonstration, the 
truth of my comment. 

The people in some parts of the 
United States have recently been 
passing through wonderful experi- 
ences, experiences I may say 
that have been foreshadowed by 
the inspired utterances of the 
great prophet of the new dis- 
pensation of the gospel ; for as early 
as 1831 the Lord, both by vision and 
word of mouth, decreed that there 
should be great destruction upon 
the waters of the Missouri, the Mis- 
sissippi and the Ohio valleys; and 
no one in recent years has noted the 
annual recurrence of destruction, in 
various forms, upon those waters, 
but what has been convinced that 
the warning word of the Lord, 
through the Prophet, was being ful- 
filled. Great distress has come 
upon the people of the land by rea- 
son of storm and tempest and by 
dangers that have been developed in 
those regions of country to which 
reference has been made. The 
country has been appealed to and is 
now appealed to for help to relieve 
the distress that has come upon the 
people. In this connection I want 
to say to you that there has been no 
single act that has so completely met 
with the approval of my spirit than 
the fact that the President of the 
Church, in his capacity as Trustee- 
in-trust, has stretched forth a help- 
ing hand to the distressed people of 
Ohio, and in a small way, has helped 
those who are in distress. 

Now, what I want to call your at- 
tention to is a little of the wisdom 
of God, which, if followed out by 
the inhabitants of the earth, would 
provide a means for meeting emer- 
gencies of this kind, a means which 
we ourselves, it seems to me, do not 
properly appreciate. It was a way 
found out in the midst of our own 
distresses, an institution of the 



Church, born to the Church, out of 
the midst of the things which our 
community was called upon to suf- 
fer. During the year 1855, the com- 
munity of Latter-day Saints in these 
valleys, was. sore distressed by a 
double calamity of drought and 
grasshoppers. The crops were well 
nigh destroyed, and the people had 
to be put again upon rations, as in 
the earliest years of their experience 
in these valleys. Those who had 
been provident and careful of their 
means, and were blest with means, 
had to. share with those who had 
not. This calamity of drought and 
grasshoppers was followed by a se- 
vere winter in which much of the 
stock of the people was destroyed; 
and then, while they were distressed 
in this way, the responsibilities of 
the people increased by an unusually 
large immigration, into these val- 
leys, both of our own people and the 
passing immigrant companies on 
their way to California, with whom 
the Latter-day Saints always shared 
their pittance. To meet the very 
great demands of charity upon the 
Latter-day Saints in those trying 
years, our fast day came into exist- 
ence ; the servants of the Lord in- 
stituted the first Thursday in every 
month as fast day, with a view of 
taking what was saved by this sac- 
rifice and minister unto those who 
otherwise would be in want. This 
plan of meeting that emergency be- 
came an established institution ; and 
in course of time the servants of the 
Lord changed the fast day from the 
first Thursday of the month to the 
"first Sunday of the month. 

I want to call your attention to 
some very pretty sentiments and 
some very substantial wisdom con- 
nected with that thing. The regula- 
tions of the Church were to the 
effect — and are to the effect : 

"That a fast meeting should be 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



121 



held in every ward on the first Sun- 
day of each month, at which time 
the Saints should remember the 
poor and donate for their benefit, 
which should at least equal the 
amount saved by the person or 
family so fasting. All such funds 
shall be applied exclusively for the 
purpose of assisting the worthy 
poor, as in the judgment of the 
bishopric may be necessary. The 
Latter-day Saints should liberally 
observe the payment of their dona- 
tions for the worthy poor, so that 
the bishop may have funds to assist 
the destitute and needy." Now, 
mark you this : "who should always 
have our sympathy and aid ; but 
whenever a person drawing assist- 
ance is able to do something toward 
his or her support, however small, 
the bishopric should endeavor to 
provide such with employment 
suited to their capacity and their 
condition." 

I call your attention to the fact, 
in passing, that the institution of 
this means for providing for those 
who may be in want is limited to the 
worthy poor; because there is no 
intention, on the part of the Lord, 
so far as His will is revealed to the 
Church — there is no intention to 
create a permanent pauper class, or 
to permit the vicious and idle to 
prey upon the industrious and the 
provident; and hence this wise 
counsel that these charities are to 
be extended to the worthy poor. 
Counsel is given, also, that even 
these, wherever and whenever it is 
possible, should have the glorious 
means or opportunity afforded them 
to preserve their personal independ- 
ence by giving something in return, 
in labor, in service, for the help 
that is given them. 

The subject, of course, is capable 
of great expansion. All I can do 



here and now, and all I desire to do 
now, is to show by reference to this 
little thing, how excellent is the wis- 
dom of God! Suppose the Chris- 
tian people of New York, with her 
between five and six millions of peo- 
ple, largely of at least nominal 
Christian profession, suppose that 
Christian city were to adopt God's 
method of providing a permanent 
means of charity for the worthy 
poor; if they would but take this 
one little fragment of "Mormon- 
ism" and apply it in their charity 
economics, they would establish a 
permanent revenue for the chari- 
ties of that city that would stop the 
cry of hunger rising up to greet the 
ears of the God of Sabbaoth. They 
would have sufficient to feed, to 
clothe, and to lodge the worthy 
poor, and what is more, if you 
mathematicians will take the pains 
to work it out, and suppose that 
only one-half of the Christian peo- 
ple of that city were to faithfully 
observe this little principle, you 
would have means not only to clothe 
and feed and lodge the worthy poor, 
but when emergencies of calamity 
arose in the city there would be am- 
ple means to meet those emergen- 
cies. And if a state were to adopt 
that bit of charity economy, if the 
nation were to adopt it, if the Chris- 
tian world were to adopt it, out of 
that one fragment of God's inspired 
truth given to His people, there 
would be ample means to meet all 
the demands of charity at the hands 
of the people. How great, how ex- 
cellent is the wisdom of God, even 
in small matters. The Lord bless 
you. Amen. 

[The speaker would also add to 
the thoughts above expressed, that 
in the above described fast system 
established in the Church, all — the 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rich and the poor, the wealthy man 
of business and the common laborer 
— would contribute equally to this 
proposed charity. Not that what 
would be saved from the fast of the 
common laborer's family for the 
fast fund would equal in dollars and 
cents the amount that would be 
saved from the fast of the rich 
man's family ; but it would cost one 
as much as the other, viz., the sacri- 
fice in each case of the meals that 
would otherwise be eaten ; and that 
which costs the same to each, ought 
to be equal, and in the sight of God 
would be equal, in contribution to 
such a cause. 

Again, another beauty of this 
charity proposed for universal 
Christian acceptance, is the fact that 
it would place those who live always 
in the enjoyment of an abundance, 
in sympathetic relations with those 
who frequently feel the pangs of 
hunger, and sense the weakness that 
comes of insufficient food. When 
the children of the rich feel the las- 
situde and perhaps the faintness that 
arises from their voluntary fasting, 
they can better understand the 
meaning of insufficient food, and 
days of enforced fasting that must 
be endured by the poor, and make 
them more ready and willing, -not 
only to deal kindly, but justly, with 
those who toil for rewards less than 
sufficient to meet their daily needs. 
It is for the Latter-day Saints to 
magnify this regulation of the 
Church, vindicate its wisdom, and 
demonstrate for the instruction of 
the world its wonderful possibili- 
ties.]

What "Mormonism" Stands For. — Gath- 
ering and Unity. — Things of God only 
to be Comprhended by the Spirit of 
God. — How to Obtain and Retain that 



Spirit.— Obedience the Key to all 
Blessings. 

This great gathering of God's 
people reminds me of a remark 
dropped by a reverend gentleman in 
a conversation between him and my- 
self. It had devolved upon me to 
correct a public statement made by 
him, to the effect that the "Mor- 
mon" people advocate a social sys- 
tem destructive of the purity of the 
home. After I had, from this stand, 
corected that statement, the gentle- 
man called upon me and explained 
very courteously that he had not in- 
tended to impugn the morality of 
the "Mormon home." He had 
meant to say merely that "Mormon- 
ism," as he viewed it, destroyed the 
oneness or integrity Of the home. 
He had used the word purity, he 
said, in the sense of oneness, and he 
added : "It seems to me that your 
system has a tendency to disunite 
and scatter things." 

I did what I could on that oc- 
casion, and have subsequently taken 
pains, to correct this mistaken no- 
tion. If "Mormonism" stands for 
anything, it stands for the gather- 
ing, not the scattering, of things, 
It is for the unification of all that is 
good and virtuous and pure and 
praiseworthy'. This vast congre- 
gation is a testimony to the char- 
acter and results of our religion. 
These are the days of the gathering 
of Israel from their long dispersion. 
This is the dispensation of the full- 
ness of times, when God has set his 
hand to gather in one all things in 
Christ, things in the heavens and 
things upon the earth. For this 
purpose the Gospel was instituted, 
and for this purpose it was restored 
in these latter days. Gathering is 
the great distinctive feature of the 
dispensation of the fullness of times.

"Mormonism" does not scatter, 
does not disintegrate, does not div- 
ide ; it gathers, unifies, and proposes 
to bring together all things in 
Christ. 

But how impossible it is to see 
the kingdom of God except by the 
Spirit of God. "Except a man be 
born again he cannot see" that 
kingdom. It does not matter how 
intelligent he may be, how learned, 
how educated, how well trained ; if 
he have not the gift of the Holy 
Ghost he cannot comprehend the 
things of God. 

I have often marveled why those 
great men who came in contact with 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, men like 
Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham 
Lincoln, men of intelligence, men of 
character, men whose motives were 
pure and worthy for the most part 
— why they were not converted to 
the Gospel — the religion that Jos- 
eph Smith preached and represent- 
ed. I have often wondered why 
such men as Hoarce Greeley, who 
came here in early days and had 
long interviews, with President 
Brigham Young — why he was not 
converted. Greeley, like Lincoln, was 
a good man, a great man, whose 
word at that time was more in- 
fluential than that of the President 
of the. United States ; he was prob- 
bably the greatest editor that ever 
lived. He came here, saw President 
Young, conversed with him, investi- 
gated "Mormonism," and went 
away and wrote a book in which 
he recorded his impressions of Utah 
and her people. -He wrote in 
praise of the people, but he was not 
converted to their religion. He did 
not see in "Mormonism" what you 
and I see in it. Why? It was not 
because he lacked intelligence, or 
education, or learning, the wisdom 
of the world. Schuyler Colfax 



came some years later ; he was then 
Speaker of the House of Represen- 
tatives ; and he came again when he 
was Vice-President of the Nation. 
He also had interviews with Presi- 
dent Young; he heard him preach 
in the "Old Bowery" then on this 
Block, and spoke there himself on 
the character and principles of Ab- 
raham Lincoln. But Colfax was 
far from converted to "Mormon- 
ism." He .wrote against it, used 
his powerful influence against it ; 
utterly unable to see in it what you 
and I recognize. 

And so with this reverend gentle- 
man to whom I have referred. He 
is right here among us ; has studied 
our sacred .books ; has heard our 
preachers ; has made a diligent 
study of our system and faith; and 
yet he has formed the misconcep- 
tion that "Mormonism," whose. very 
sign-manual is gathering and unity, 
stands for and has a tendency to- 
ward division and distintegration. 

The explanation is simple, after 
all. Spiritual things are only to 
be comprehended by the Spirit. 
"Eye hath not seen, ear hath not 
heard, nor hath it entered into the 
heart of man to conceive of the 
great things that God has reserved 
for those who wait for Him. But 
God hath revealed them unto us by 
His Spirit, for the spirit searcheth 
all things, yea the deep things of 
God. For what man knoweth the 
things of a man save by the spirit, 
of man that is in him? Even so, 
the things of God knoweth no man, 
but the Spirit of God." And the 
Spirit has been given to every man, 
woman, and child who has em- 
braced the Gospel. All who have 
had faith in God, who have repent- 
ed of their sins, have had their sins 
remitted by baptism, and have re- 
ceived the laying on of hands for 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the gift of the Holy Ghost, are en- 
titled to the possession of that 
Spirit, and it enables them to see 
what is hidden from the wisdom of 
the world. 

What a precious possession ! Can 
we afford to part with it? How 
and why did we become possessed 
of it? It was because of our obe- 
dience. Every blessing comes from 
God upon that principle. There is 
"a law irrevocably decreed in the 
heavens," governing tfie distribu- 
tion of all things, spiritual and tem- 
poral ; and when we receive any- 
thing from Him who is the giver 
of every good and perfect gift, it is 
because of our obedience to the 
principle or law upon which that 
blessing was predicated. Men may 
sit upon thrones, may preside over 
nations, may issue edicts or enact 
laws ; they may go through college 
may become eminent; may possess 
all human wisdom and all worldly 
wealth, by virtue of their obedience 
to the laws governing such things ; 
but if they ever receive the king- 
dom of God and the testimony of 
the truth, it will be because they 
obey the laws pertaining to these 
higher blessings. They can be ob- 
tained in no other way — neither ob- 
tained nor retained. Obedience is 
the key to it all. This is why our 
Savior exhorted the hearers of the 
word to be doers of it too, thus 
building upon the rock, and not up- 
on the sand. There is no safety 
in any other course. We cannot 
receive a testimony that this is 
God's work, without obedience to 
Him, without the Spirit that re- 
wards obedience. Neither can we 
retain that testimony, only by keep- 
ing God's commandments and hav- 
ing the Holy Spirit ever burning 
brightly upon the altar of our hearts. 

May the Lord help us to profit, 



through obedience, by all the good 
things that we have heard during 
this Conference. May he enable 
us to maintain ourselves firmly up- 
on the rock where He has planted 
our feet, I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF 
LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 



FIRST DAY. 



The Eightieth Annual Confer- 
ence of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints convened in 
the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, at 
10 a. m. on Sunday, April 3, 1910, 
President Joseph F. Smith presid- 
ing. 

AUTHORITIES PRESENT. 

There were present of the First 
Presidency, Joseph F. Smith and 
Anthon H. Lund ; of the Council of 
the Twelve Apostles, Francis M. 
Lyman, John Henry Smith, Heber 
J. Grant, Rudger Clawson, Hyrum 
M. Smith, George F. Richards, Or- 
son F. Whitney, David O. McKay 
and Anthony W. Ivins; Presiding 
Patriarch John Smith ; of the First

Golden Kimball, Rulon S. Wells 
and Charles H. Hart ; of the Pre- 
siding Bishopric, Charles W. Nib- 
ley, Orrin P. Miller, and David A. 
Smith. There were also a large 
number of Presidents of Stakes and 
Missions, with their Counselors, 
Bishops of Wards, Patriarchs, and 
numerous other prominent men and 
women representing various quor- 
ums and organizations of the 
Church. 



President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and an- 
nounced that an overflow meeting 
will be held this morning in the 
Assembly Hall, to be presided over 
by Elder Anthony W. Ivins. 

The conference services were 
commenced by the choir and con- 
gregation singing the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor la- 
bor fear, 
But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 

David McKay. 

The choir sang the hymn : 
* 

O awake! my slumbering minstrel, 
Let my harp forget its spell; 

Say, O say, in sweetest accents, ■ 
Zion prospers, all is well. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

supported. — The principles of Mor- 
monism incite to righteousness. — 
— Use of tobacco and intoxicants 
denounced. — Wisdom exercised in 
expenditure of tithing. 

I must confess that I do not feel 
adequate to the task of speaking 
to you this morning, but I hope the 
good Spirit from the Lord may rest 
upon us, not only during the time I 
may occupy but throughout the en- 
tire meeting, and, indeed, through- 
oat the sessions of this conference. 
I feel in my heart to say to this vast 
congregation, God bless you and 
pour out His Holy Spirit upon you. 
May He reward you, by its rich 
outpouring, for your presence here, 
which indicates your faith and your 
desire to be present at the general 
conference of the Church to take 
part in the services and exercises 
thereof, and show that unity, that 
interest, that love and devotion to 
the work of the Lord, which should 
characterize the lives and acts of 
every member of the Church. It 
is almost marvelous, considering the 
condition of the weather, to see such 
a vast congregation as is assembled 
here, today at the opening session 
of our conference ; and, again, from 
my heart, I thank you for your at- 
tendance, and for the interest you 
feel in the work of the Lord in 
which we are all engaged. I feel, 
in my soul, that those who have 
come, sparing the time and the 
means necessary to attend the con- 
ference here, will not go away at 
the conclusion of our meetings eith- 
er barren or unfruitful, for I be- 
lieve the Lord will bless you and 
pour out His Spirit upon you in 
abundance. 

I take it for granted that the vast 
majority of those assembled here to- 
day are members of the Church of 



Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 
good standing, and I would that this 
might be said of every soul that is 
present; for it is my belief that 
there is no greater honor, nor can 
there be any greater blessing ob- 
tained by man in this world, or in 
the world to come, than to be mem- 
bers in the Church of Christ in good 
fellowship with Him. 

There are one or two matters 
that have rested upon my mind of 
late. While there are many things 
that might be spoken of here to- 
day, or at least hinted at, or simply 
mentioned, they will be more fully 
spoken of, unquestionably, by those 
who shall occupy the stand during 
our conference. But one thing has 
seemed to impress itself very 
strongly upon my mind, and I de- 
sire to say a few words in relation 
to it. It may be considered a secu- 
lar matter, but to me it is both spir- 
itual and temporal. I do not think 
it would be possible for me to ap- 
preciate, very highly, that sort of 
salvation that is only spiritual. I 
desire to see, and to witness, and to 
embrace the religion that is both 
temporal and spiritual, and to par- 
ticipate in and enjoy the salvation 
that is both temporal and spiritual. 
The matter that I refer to is home- 
building and the providing of places 
to dwell for the children of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

We have witnessed a disposition, 
among some of our people, to want 
to draw off and go away, almost 
limitless distances away from the 
body of the Church — a disposition 
to scatter abroad, rather than to 
gather together, and a tendency of 
our children to go away from their 
homes, to seek homes for them- 
selves somewhere else, in some oth- 
er state, or territory, or country, 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

away off from their parental homes. 
Now, it appears to me that there are 
almost limitless opportunities and 
advantages yet to be utilized, not 
only here in the state of Utah but 
in the near-by or adjoining states, 
where our young people may find 
lands and build homes for them- 
selves without wandering away off 
into South America, or into South- 
ern Mexico, or into any other for- 
eign country. It is being demon- 
strated that there are within our 
reach, under our very eyes, larg" 
tracts of country that only needed 
either co-operation of labor or cap- 
ital to bring it under cultivation 
and to render it susceptible to build- 
ing homes, and towns, and villages. 
It is, in my judgment, wise, pru- 
dent and proper for our young peo- 
ple to try to secure for themselves 
lands as near to their homes as pos- 
sible, near the homes of their par- 
ents, and as closely associated as 
possible with the communities of the 
Church, that they may have the ad- 
vantages of Sunday Schools, im- 
provement associations, primary as- 
sociations ; in other words, that they 
may have the advantages of Church 
organizations for the benefit of their 
children, as well as for their own 
benefit. While they are thus reap- 
ing the benefits and blessings of 
these privileges at home, they are 
building up this country instead of 
leaving it to the stranger, to come 
here and build it up, — and, perhaps, 
a class of strangers that we could 
not affiliate with, or who could not 
affiliate with us. There are classes 
of people we know of in the world 
who are not, or at least have not 
proven themselves to be up-to-date, 
desirable neighbors and pleasant as- 
sociates ; but they, this class, are 
seeking dwelling places, seeking op- 



portunities, both in our country and 
elsewhere, and it is just as well that 
our own people — our own boys and 
girls should build up among us as 
for the stranger to come from 
abroad, from distant countries to 
occupy the land instead of them. I 
want to say to this congregation 
that we have not approved, and we 
do not approve of this disposition 
that has manifested itself, to some 
extent, on the part of some of our 
brethren, to go away off into some 
distant country where neither life, 
nor liberty, nor property is safe. We 
would rather see our people operate 
together, and help to build up and 
develop this country so long as 
there is room for us to dwell. When 
the necessity comes, for us to col- 
onize, we may do it in some organ- 
ized way by which, in the doing of 
it, all concerned may obtain the best 
and greatest advanatges and reap 
the greatest benefit to themselves. 

Now, I want it understood that I 
do not hold to the idea that one lit- 
tle state, perhaps, is going to be 
sufficiently large to accommodate all 
the Latter-day Saints, or that the 
Church of Jesus Christ will of ne- 
cessity be confined within small lim- 
its. I do not view it in this way; 
but I wish it understood that when 
it becomes necessary for the Latter- 
day Saints to colonize in distant 
lands, or away from the body of the 
Church, that it is best to do it un- 
der the sanction, approval and coun- 
sel of the presiding authorities of 
the Church and of leading men who 
have experience and the welfare of 
the people at heart, who can direct 
their energies and their course, and 
help them to colonize, where it is 
necessary for them to colonize and 
build homes. Briefly stating it, in 
my opinion it is proper, it is wis-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dom, indeed, I think it is, a neces- 
sity for the Latter-day Saints to 
take every advantage they possibly 
can to secure homes for themselves 
in Utah, in Idaho, in Wyoming and 
Colorado, in the adjoining states 
here, and in our own country — in 
our blessed America — under our 
grand and glorious government, 
where life, property and the liber- 
ties of men may be protected and 
not jeopardized by mob-violence, by 
revolutions, or by any sort of dis- 
ruption that so often occurs in some 
of our neighboring countries, of 
course I commend and approve of 
our colonies, formed by authority 
and guidance of the Church in 
Northern Mexico and in Canada, 
and recommend tbem to home-seek- 
ers who desire to go there. 

In connection with this matter, I 
think it is wisdom for us, as agri- 
culturists, to study agriculture and 
to become able to produce out of an 
acre of ground as much as the 
"heathen Chinee" or as much as any 
Other people can produce from the 
same ground. I do not see why 
we cannot learn to cultivate the soil 
as intelligently and as profitably as 
any other class of people in the 
world; and yet it is a well known 
fact that up to the present we have 
not devoted that attention, care, 
thoughtfulness, or that intelligence 
to agriculture in our country that 
we should have done and that we 
are now learning to do, by the aid 
of schools where men who desire 
to follow agriculture may learn the 
nature of the soil and all the other 
conditions necessary to produce the 
largest results for their labor. 

Now another thing. The thought 
has prevailed in olden time that it 
was proper, and an effort used to be 
made, to get our people, every- 



where, to co-operate together, to 
combine their energies and their lit- 
tle means in the establishment of 
home industries that will give em- 
ployment to themselves and to their 
children, and will be productive not 
only of those things that are need- 
ful for us in our homes and coun- 
try, but that will be a source of rev- 
enue to us by transportation. To- 
day we have allowed this home in- 
dustry spirit almost to perish from 
amongst us, and that spirit of loy- 
alty which impels a man or woman 
to sustain home industry by their 
patronage is almost a thing of the 
past. We do not witness that same 
loyalty among the people to patron- 
ize home industries and institutions 
that are established by ourselves or 
our communities, intended for the 
building up of the country and for 
the production of those things that 
are needful to society. We do not 
exhibit that spirit of loyalty to- 
wards these things that we should 
do. In my opinion, there are too 
many of us that would rather go to 
a "Cheap John" establishment and 
buy shoddy — because we could get 
it a few pence less per yard— than 
to go to a home producing estab- 
lishment and buy cloth that is all 
wool and a yard wide, and that will 
wear and pay the price for it. It is 
a short-sighted idea and policy for 
us to patronize foreign capital, for- 
eign labor, when we can produce 
the same articles, in a better condi- 
tion and class, at home bv our own 
labor, giving 'ourselves employment, 
and thereby build up our country, 
and preserve our money at home. 

These things will, no doubt, be 
referred to, more or less, by the* 
brethren who shall speak during 
the conference, and they may dwell 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 5 



upon these matters at greater 
length. 

I desire to say that Mormonism, 
as it is called, is still, as always, 
nothing more and nothing less than 
the power of God unto salvation, 
unto every soul that will receive it 
honestly and will obey it. I say to 
you, my brethren, sisters, and 
friends, that all Latter-day Saints, 
wherever you find them, provided 
' they are true to their name, to their 
calling and to their understanding 
of the Gospel, are people who stand 
for truth' and for honor, for vir- 
tue and for purity of life, for hon- 
esty in business and in religion, peo- 
ple who stand for God and for His 
righteousness, for God's truth and 
His work in the earth, which aims 
for the salvation of the children of 
men, for their salvation from the 
evils of the world, from the per- 
nicious habits of wicked men and 
from all those things that degrade, 
dishonor or destroy; or tend to less- 
en the vitality, and life, the honor, 
and godliness among the people of 
the earth. I love the Gospel to- 
day more than I ever did before in 
all my life. I believe more firmly — 
if such a thing can be possible — in 
the divine mission of Christ and in 
the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith than ever before. I 
feel in every fiber of my being, that 
they have been sent of God, that 
they have laid the foundations for 
life everlasting to the world. I be- 
lieve that Christ is, indeed, the Re- 
deemer from sin and death, and 
the only door that has ever been 
opened, to my understanding at 
least, whereby man may live again 
after he has died. I believe in 
these principles, I have received 
them, I have accepted of them in 
my soul, and I feel that they are 



true. I know that they are good, 
for they incite men to deeds of hon- 
or, of virtue, of honesty, and of up- 
rightness ; they make men feel that 
it is their duty as well as their priv- 
ilege — and it is a glorious privilege, 
too — to obey God and keep His 
commandments, that they might be 
worthy to meet Him and enjoy an 
inheritance in His kingdom, to par- 
take of His glory and of His sal- 
vation. Let the people be united, 
and not divided one against an- 
other. In union we have strength, 
but in division and discord we be- 
come like water spilled upon the 
ground, that cannot be gathered up. 
Let the people be united in their 
worship of God,united in their faith, 
united in their love of all that is 
good, noble and godlike, united one 
with another in helping to establish 
the standard of peace and right- 
eousness in the earth, that all men 
may come to it and partake of its 
blessings and glory. Let your light 
so shine that the world may see it 
and be constrained to glorify God 
therefor. , 

I feel, again, in my heart to bless 
you, and I pray that we may have 
power given to us, one and all, to 
stand in the truth — firm and faith- 
ful, unbending and unyielding to 
any of the things to the contrary 
that come from the outside. Let us 
attend to our prayers. Do not for- 
get that the Lord Almighty has 
said, "I will be inquired of by you," 
and, "he that seeketh me early shall 
find me." The Lord has made it 
obligatory upon us to seek after 
Him, to have prayerful hearts, and 
spirits, that we may supplicate the 
Lord, if for nothing more, than to 
acknowledge to Him that we feel 
we are His children, and believe in 
His word and in the promises that 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He has made to us. While He may 
have blest us with all the temporal 
blessings that are necessary for our 
happiness and well-being, and we 
need not ask Him for food, for 
clothing, nor for houses, or where 
to lay our heads, — we can at the 
same time acknowledge to the Lord 
our gratitude that He has so over- 
ruled all things, so provided for us 
and opened our way, that we have 
been able to obtain all these things 
and surround ourselves with the 
temporal blessings of life. Surely 
the Lord has been very merciful and 
very providential to us, up to this 
time, with reference to all these 
things. 

Another requirement that I wish 
to mention is that the parents in 
Zion will be held responsible for the 
acts of their children, not only until 
they become eight years old but, 
perhaps, throughout all the lives of 
their children, provided they have 
neglected their duty to their chil- 
dren while they were under their 
care and guidance, and the parents 
were responsible for them. One 
thing I deplore, and that is the fact 
that I can scarcely go onto the 
street or side-walk but I see one to 
a dozen or more boys in their 'teens 
— with pipes of tobacco in their 
mouths, puffing away in the open. 
When I see them, I think, Oh ! what 
a pity, oh ! what a shame ! How 
foolish, how imbecile, how useless, 
and how injurious is this practice 
to the youth of the people. I de- 
plore the sight of it wherever I see 
it ; I want to tell those present, who 
are in the habit of using these 
things, that when you meet me in 
the street with a pipe, cigarette, or 
a cigar in your mouths, please do 
not recognize me — go right by, and 
I will do the same. I never did 



like to bow to a nasty, old, stinking 
pipe, nor to take my hat off to it. 
(Laughter.) I deplore the habit 
that many of the youth of this city, 
many of the youth of this state, aye 
and of everywhere — not only in this 
state but everywhere else — falling 
into this pernicious, useless, and in- 
jurious habit, — costly, too, and no 
return; it is simply an outlay for 
injury. I think it would be quite as 
manly if they would take directly 
to the use of opium, and use it until 
they killed themselves quickly. It 
would be sooner over with to do 
that than to take the slower means 
of reaching death by sucking a pipe, 
cigarette, or something of that kind. 
Again, respecting intoxication, I 
want to say to you that we deplore 
the existence of this- evil in any com- 
munity, anywhere; and we deplore 
the fact that it may, possibly, be 
said — I do not say it is so, but I de- 
plore the fact that it may be said 
that some of the members of the 
Church are patrons of saloons. I 
would to God it could not be said 
in truth, and I hope the time will 
come when no man in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
will ever condescend or so humili- 
ate himself as to enter into a saloon, 
or to even cross the threshold of 
those places of death. I hope the 
time will come when this can be 
said. I cannot see how it is possi- 
ble for Latter-day Saints to claim 
to be members of the Church, in 
good standing, or expect to receive 
the blessings and advantages of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, while they 
themselves are violating some of 
these most precious principles of 
purity of life that the Lord has 
made manifest to us in this dispen- 
sation. Leave these poisonous and 
injurious things alone; live within

your means; get out of debt, and 
keep out of debt ; do not run faster 
than you can go safely; be careful 
and cautious in what you do; ad^ 
vise with those who have wisddm 
and experience, before you leap lest 
you leap into the dark ; and so guard 
yourselves, from possible evil and 
disadvantage, that the Lord ^an 
pour out the blessings of heaven 
upon you, yes "open the windows 
of heaven" and pour out upon you 
blessings, that you shall scarcely 
have room to contain them. 

Remember the commandment of 
the Lord concerning the law of rev- 
enue for the Church. We are do- 
ing the best we know how, by the 
advice and counsel of the wisest 
men we have and by the inspira- 
tion, as we trust, from the Lord, in 
the use and employment of the 
means that belong to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Up to date, I do not believe there 
is one of the brethren connected 
with the management of the finan- 
cial affairs of the Church, who will 
be or can be in the least ashamed 
of the course that he has taken, or 
of ,the work that he has done or con- 
sented to the doing with reference 
to the expenditure of the Church 
means. Not a dollar has been ex- 
pended, so far as I have any knowl- 
edge, contrary to the laws of the 
Church, or contrary to that which is 
deemed, by the wisest men we have, 
to be for the best good of our cause. 
It is true we are building meeting- 
houses all over the land — that is, 
we are helping; we can't do it all; 
we are not in a position to do even 
half of it, but we are helping hun- 
dreds of our wards to build their 
meeting-houses, according to the 
means that we have. We expect to 
be able to continue to do this; but 



there are a great many people in the 
Church whose names are recorded 
in a book/ — some of you would be 
surprised, I am sure, to see that 
book, called the record of the non- 
tithe-payers. I believe that if all 
these members, whose names are 
recorded in 'the book as non-tithe- 
payers, would pay anything like, an 
honest one-tenth of their interest 
annually into the bishop's store- 
house, we .would have means to 
build all the meeting houses in Zi- 
on, that it is necessary to build. 
We could not build them all this 
year, or next year, but we could 
build some this year, as far as the 
means would go; a few next year, 
as far as the means would go, — 
and so we would keep on until we 
would build meeting-houses and 
school-houses for all the Latter- 
day Saints in every part of the land. 
But we can't do it yet — there are 
too many non-tithepayers. Now, 
whether these people do not believe 
in the law of tithing, or whether 
they are disgruntled for some other 
cause, or whether they are so poor 
they could not pay their tithing, or 
what may be the reason, they do 
not do it. I do not know the rea- 
son, but I believe that if they only 
knew what would be for their best 
good they would observe and keep 
that law, though they were only ab- 
le to give their little mite toward it, 
and thus have their names at least 
recorded on the tithe-payers' list and 
record. It would be a good thing 
for them to do it, because of the 
blessing attached to the observance 
of the law. I repeat again that if 
all the Latter-day Saints would pay 
an honest tithing, we would have 
plenty of means to build all the 
meeting-houses that we need, — that

is, gradually, as we would have 
the means to do it with. 

Again, the Lord God Almighty 
bless you. My heart is full of bless- 
ing for the Latter-day Saints. I 
love the man, with all my heart, 
who I know to be an honest, up- 
right, true, faithful Latter-day 
Saint. A man of this description 
is one of the best citizens of any 
country ; he is a good citizen of any 
city, of any county, of any state, or 
of any nation wherever he may be ; 
and he is one of the very best. A 
real Latter-day Saint, is a good hus- 
band, he is a good father, he is a 
good neighbor, he is a good citizen, 
and a good man all round; and it 
takes a good Latter-day Saint to 
be a first class everything else. 
Again, — the Lord bless you, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

Israel," was rendered by Brother A.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Loving tribute to the memory of the 
late President John R. Winder. 

I scarcely know what I could say 
with reference to the absence from 
this conference of one of the best 
men that it has ever been my lot to 
know. Of course, I cannot trust 
my feelings in speaking of him, but 
I felt that it might be thought, pos- 
sibly, that I had too soon forgotten 
that good man who has stood by me 
and by others for the many long 
years of his life, as true and as 
faithful as it is possible for one man 
to stand with another. I have lost a 
father and a brother and a coun- 
selor, one in whose judgment I 
never failed to have implicit trust, 
one who was good and true in 



every position in which he was 
placed. If anything was wanted of 
President John R. Winder, and he 
was asked to perform it, he did it, 
if it was in the power of man to do 
it. He never shrank from, any duty, 
but was always valiant, and vigilant, 
and faithful in the performance of 
every labor that was required at his 
hands. He was a choice spirit, a 
noble soul, a wise and prudent man, 
just and honest both to God and to 
his fellow beings. 

My brethren and sisters, I felt 
that I might at least say these few 
words with reference to President 
Winder who but recently passed 
away after a long illness, as I de- 
sired to at least show my love and 
my regard for him, and the deep 
regret that I feel in my heart be- 
cause of the deprivation that I have 
suffered by his death. The Lord 
bless his widow and his children and 
his children's children to the latest 
generation; and may there never 
come a time when President John 
R. Winder shall not have both sons 
and daughters to represent him be- 
fore the altar of truth and right- 
eousness in the House of God. This 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LTTND. 

Prosperity, and increased membership,

all merited by that good man. . I 
feel the same loss that the president 
expressed, and I know that you do, 
my brethren and sisters. I hope for 
myself and for } r ou that when we 
shall be called hence, such good 
words may be spoken truly in our 
behalf. 

I have followed with great inter- 
est the remarks of our president, 
and I believe we all feel that they 
were timely and that the Latter- 
day Saints should give heed to them. 
I am pleased to see this large con- 
gregation which is attending here 
this morning, in spite of the weath- 
er. It shows the love of the Saints 
to come to the house of the Lord 
and to participate in His worship. 

The year that is now past has 
been a prosperous one to the Saints 
and the Church in general. Our 
missions abroad have prospered. In 
Europe Great Britain leads, with 
the greatest number of baptisms, 
and Germany follows close to the 
British mission, in that regard J and 
in all the missions they report pro- 
gress. Our missionaries have la- 
bored assiduously to bring the Gos- 
pel unto their fellow-men. They 
are called from their homes with- 
out being furnished means, except 
what they have themselves, and 
therefore in their acceptance of the 
call they show their love for the 
Gospel. They are working unsel- 
fishly to make others acquainted 
with what they have received, and 
though they are not always re- 
ceived pleasantly and given a wel- 
come, they rejoice in having the op- 
portunity of laboring for the spread 
of the true Gospel revealed in our 
day. I feel to ask the Lord to bless 
our brethren the missionaries, that 
they may be successful in their en- 
deavors to prove unto men that 



Jesus is the Christ, the one who has 
redeemed us, — as our brother, A. 
C. Crawford, sang so beautifully 
just now, — and that Joseph was a 
prophet of the Lord, and was used 
as the instrument to bring back the 
Gospel unto men. I pray that they 
may be successful in bearing their 
testimonies unto men, that the good 
and the honest may hear these^ glad 
tidings which they have to present. 

We are having meeting houses 
built or bought in a good many of 
the missions, respectable places 
where the Elders can invite men 
and women to come and listen to 
our worship and to the testimonies 
borne, and this has a tendency to 
draw the people to us. 

At home our different organiza- 
tions are prospering, The Priest- 
hood movement among the quorums 
is successful, although there might 
be better hours appointed for them 
to meet; but all things have to be 
considered, and we believe that it is 
best as it is at present There is 
nothing to hinder the priesthood in 
meeting the evening that has been 
proposed, and the quorums from 
being successful in developing our 
young people and all the members 
of the quorums in a knowledge of 
their'duties and of the truth. I be- 
lieve that this movement will have a 
great influence for good among the 
people in Zion. Our auxiliary or- 
ganizations are doing a good work. 
Some of them have increased in 
numbers, — a few have not done so; 
I do not know the cause. The re- 
ports of what they are doing gives 
a great deal of satisfaction. The 
Primaries have increased consfder- 
ably in numbers. The Religion 
Classes are also doing much good, 
and our brethren and sisters work- 
ing in these classes are to be com- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mended for the work they are do- 
ing. We are trying to carry out in 
these classes the Lord's command 
that the parents in Zion shall teach 
their children to pray and to walk 
uprightly before the Lord. To im- 
press the hearts of the children with 
this command is the object of th~e 
Religion Classes ; it is to make them 
understand that religion means the 
doing of that which is the Lord's 
will ; and we are 1 rying to teach the 
children attending these classes to 
do and to perform such acts as shall 
be inspired by our holy religion. I 
hope that those who are engaged in 
this work — the superintendents, 
their aids and assistants, and the in- 
structors — will continue to take an 
interest in these classes. Many of 
them have to leave their business 
on week days to engage in the Re- 
ligion Class work, and this requires 
a sacrifice at their hands. I Be- 
lieve, however, that they will be bet- 
ter off for doing this, and that In 
fulfilling their duties in this regard, 
they will have more -joy than they 
can estimate. 

Our people have shown a great 
readiness donating their means to- 
wards erecting public institutions. 
Meeting houses have been and are 
building, and our people are do- 
ing a great deal towards this wor#. 
The Trustee-in-trust has appropri- 
ated money towards these enter- 
prises to as great an extent as he 
has dared to do. This work should 
be encouraged. Our people are re- 
alizing the value of having meeting 
houses where the Sunday school 
children can be divided and sent 
into different class rooms, so as not 
to disturb one another in the large 
auditoriums. It is a remarkable 
thing to see how much the people 



have been able to do in this direc- 
tion. 

The Lord has prospered His peo- 
ple both temporally and spiritually, 
and although the people have ex- 
pended so much means in building 
meeting houses and so on, they have 
still increased their tithing quite a 
per cent over last year. It is a dis- 
tinguishing mark of the living faith 
of the people when they pay their 
tithing. Those who do so will feel 
strengthened and blest, and feel that 
they can approach our Heavenly 
Father in greater faith when the'y 
kneel at the family altar or in their 
secret chamber to ask for the things 
they want. May the Lord bless 
the Saints for the fulfillment of this 
duty as well as the many other du- 
ties required at their hands. 

In regard to the poor, I am glad 
I can say the Saints have shown that 
they do not forget them, — that a 
great amount of means has been 
spent in this direction. Our fast 
offerings have increased consider- 
ably. This, brethren and sisters, 
is a duty resting upon us — to look 
after the poor, that they shall not 
suffer want. The Lord loves a lib- 
eral giver. When Jesus was upon 
the earth, He found there was a dfs- 
position to grow rich, to gather 
means, and forget the poor. So His 
lessons were often given to impress 
upon the people that they should 
remember the neighbor, and He 
gave the beautiful commandment 
that we should love God above all 
things, and our neighbor as our- 
selves. If we place ourselves in the 
condition of our poor brethren and 
sisters, then ask, "What would you 
that he should do, if your condi- 
tions and his were reversed?" and 
then act upon the answer, we would 
not neglect our duty mi this regard. 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND.

Let not the cry of the widow and 
the fatherless, the poor and the op- 
pressed, rise unto the ears of the 
Lord of Sabaoth. Look after them. 
Both the presiding Bishops and the 
Bishops in the different wards, are 
to be commended for the work they 
are doing in this direction. 

I am reminded that today it is 
seventy-four years since the Proph- 
et Joseph and Oliver Cowdery re- 
ceived a glorious vision in the 
Kirtland Temple and it was also 
on a Sunday. We did not build 
meeting houses in those days. This 
is a temple-building dispensation, 
and early in the rise of the Church 
the feeling was in the hearts of the 
people that they should build a tem- 
ple unto the Lord. In their pov- 
erty they contributed their means 
and built a temple in Kirtland, and 
the Lord was pleased with their la- 
bors. In this temple Jesus ap- 
peared unto Joseph and Oliver; 
they saw Him; they received in- 
structions from Him and listened 
to His blessed words. Among oth- 
er things He told them that the 
fame of that house should go forth 
to all nations. That itself was a 
great prophecy. Who, that looked 
upon that little handful of people in 
a backwoods village, would believe 
that the fame of that house should 
go out to other nations ? Why, on- 
ly a few knew anything about it 
then, but it has been fulfilled. What 
was done there that day has been 
told in most parts of the earth, and 
men and women have rejoiced in 
reading this section of the book ot 
Doctrine and Covenants, section 1 10, 
which gives an account of what took 
place there : Jesus said unto them : 

"Yea, I will appear unto my serv- 
ants, and speak unto them with mine 
own voice, if my people will keep my 



commandments, and do not pollute 
this holy house. 

"Yea, the hearts of thousands and 
tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice 
in consequence of the blessings which 
shall be poured out, and the endow- 
ment with which my. servants have 
been endowed in this house; 

"And the fame of this house shall 
spread to foreign lands, and this is 
the beginning of the blessing which 
shall be poured out upon the heads of 
my people. Even so. Amen." 

This is what Jesus told these His 
servants, and the words have been 
literally fulfilled, though looking jit 
it in a human way there was little 
prospect that this could be fulfilled. 
I read further : 

"And after this vision closed, the 
heavens were a^ain open unto us, and 
Moses appeared before us, and com- 
mitted unto us the keys of the gather- 
ing of Israel from the four parts of the 
earth, and the leading of the ten tribes 
from the land of the north." 

These keys were given on that 
day seventy-four years ago. the keys 
of the gathering. Moses, the great 
gatherer of Israel, who took them 
from Egypt to the land of Canaan, 
held this commission from the Lord, 
and he came unto these men in that 
temple and gave them unto Joseph 
and Oliver. This has also a proph- 
ecy in it. There had been no gath- 
ering from foreign lands. The Gos- 
pel had not yet been sent abroad • 
it had been preached in only a fr"' 
places, but according to the revela- 
tion to them Israel should be gath- 
ered from all parts of the earth. 
We have lived to see this, It took 
some years before they commenced 
to gather from abroad, but since 
that gathering commenced it has 
constantly continued. Why have 
we gathered here? My brethren 
and sisters, why did you leave your 
homes and all that was dear to you? 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It was to do as Isaiah says, "To go 
up to the house of the Lord, to learn 
more of His ways." For this rea- 
son we have gathered, and I hope 
you will all remember the teach- 
ings of our president this morning, 
not to scatter, not to go to other 
lands. Here is the place where the 
Saints should gather, where they 
can meet together and go into the 
temples of the Lord and learn more 
of His ways and do work for those 
that look to them to have their work 
done, for we read in this vision : 

"Elijah the Prophet, who was taken 
to heaven without tasting death, stood 
before us, and said — Behold, the time 
has fully come, which was spoken of 
by the mouth of Malachi, testifying 
that he (Elijah) should be sent be- 
fore the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord came, 

"To turn the hearts of the fathers to 
the children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten 
with a curse." 

So Malachi prophesied, and so 
Elijah the fulfiller of his prophecy 
alludes to here, and he gave unto 
Joseph the keys of this work, to turn 
the hearts of the children to the 
fathers, and the hearts of the fath- 
ers to the children. Since those 
keys were given, what a great work 
has been done in this direction! 
Societies upon societies have sprung 
up to hunt for the fathers, to trace 
out their genealogies, and these 
have been printed in books by the 
thousands and are come-at-able by 
the children, so that they can trace 
their lives and do work for them. 

I want to say here that we have 
a genealogical society in our midst. 
We have a great many books that 
we have gathered on this subject, 
and these are open to the people. 
However, in order that we may 
have means to continue to increase 



our library, a fee has been charged 
for membership. The money that 
is received is not being used for 
salaries or wages, or to pay any 
one but the one who takes care ot 
the books and the room. All the 
other work is being done for the 
love of it; so when asked to pay 
the membership fee you are simply 
asked to help increase our library, 
that we may be able to do more 
good work in this direction. A 
magazine is being printed in the in- 
terest of genealogy, and we would 
like to see the people sustain it, for 
I think it will be the means of do- 
ing a great deal of good to those 
who are seeking for their fathers. 

Brethren and sisters, this beauti- 
ful section, in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, is worth studying. It 
bears the marks of divinity upon it. 
We know that the prophet saw what 
he says he saw, for the very words 
he heard have been fulfilled. We 
know that the Lord accepted that 
house, — that the manifestations giv- 
en there were so remarkable that 
those who were present never for- 
got them. How pleased I have been 
to converse with members who were 
present. They were delighted to 
talk about what they saw and heard. 
The Lord accepted that house, and 
He has accepted the other houses 
built unto His worship. 

Though they did not build meet- 
ing houses in those early days, the 
necessity of having such houses has 
been felt by the Saints, and now we 
rejoice that in nearly every city, 
town, and hamlet throughout Zion, 
houses of worship are found, and 
that the people have felt to make 
these houses as beautiful as any in 
the place, showing the reverence 
they have for Him whom they wor- 
ship.

I see the time has passed. I want 
to impress upon us all to remember 
what the president told us: to live 
the lives of true Latter-day Saints, 
abstaining from those things that 
are evil for the body, for the body 
cannot be hurt without the spirit is 
hurt also. A sound body is neces- 
sary for a sound mind. In order 
that the Spirit of the Lord may do 
the most good for a person he must 
keep himself clean and pure in spir- 
it and abstain from that which un- 
dermines his health — and all the 
things forbidden in the- word ot 
wisdom tend to undermine health. 
The scientists are admitting this, 
and the doctors will admit it, though 
many of them do not keep it. The 
word of wisdom is, indeed, a bless- 
ing of the Lord unto His people, 
one that will not take anything away 
from their pleasures, but it will give 
them more joy and make life more 
enjoyable unto them. Let us keep 
it ; let us do our duties in every di- 
rection, and I say to every one who 
does this that he has chosen the wav 
to happiness. God bless you all. 
Amen. 



President Smith stated that an 
entertainment bureau had been es- 
tablished in the office of Elias Mor- 
ris & Sons, at South Temple and 
Richards streets, and that those who 
lacked places of entertainment 
might report there and be supplied. 
Those having places to offer for 
lodging and boarding during con- 
ference were also invited to notify 
the entertainment committee. 

It was announced that an over- 
flow meeting would be held in the 
Assembly Hall, adjoining the Tab- 
ernacle, at 2 p. m., under the direc- 
tion of Elder Orson F. Whitney. 



The choir sang the anthem, "In 
our Redeemer's name." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Frank Y. Taylor. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, April 3rd, 1910. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Anthony W. Ivins. Prof. O. 
A. Kirkham conducted the singing 
exercises, in which the Latter-day 
Saints' University Choir partici- 
pated. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion; 

No longer as strangers on earth 

need we roam, 
Good tidings are sounding to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
Joseph D. Smith. 

The choir rendered the selection, 
"Just for today." 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Idea that this Rocky Mountain region 
could not be occupied by civilized 
people. — Astounding change in con- 
ditions, under God's blessing. — 
Great increase in Church member- 
ship, and faithfulness of the Saints. 
— Tribute to memory of the late 
President John R. Winder. 

We have not a very large con- 
gregation of Latter-day Saints here 
this morning, but I certainly feel 
that the Spirit of the Lord will 
characterize this meeting, and that 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we will go forth renewed and ben- 
efited from these services, and 
grateful for the opportunity that 
we have to meet together here this 
morning in annual Conference. 

I feel grateful for this comfort- 
able place to which we can come, 
and where we are sheltered from 
the rigors of this spring storm, and 
can in comfort worship the Lord, 
and review, briefly, the great work 
which He has established in the 
dispensation in which we live. 

I have been thinking while sit- 
ting here of the wonderful change 
that has come to the world, and par- 
ticularly to this intermountain re- 
gion, since the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, eighty years ago. Wash- 
ington Irving wrote about that time 
of this rocky mountain region and 
I suppose he understood it better 
than any other man of his time, for 
he had before him a great mass of 
manuscripts made by Bonneville, 
Wyeth and those who accompanied 
the expedition which went with 
Lewis and Clark across the conti- 
nent, and he reached his conclusions 
largely from the deductions of those 
men who had explored and become 
familiar with this intermountain re- 
gion. After concluding the volume 
in which he treats of the explora- 
tions of Captain Bonneville, Wash- 
ington Irving says that the "fur 
trade undoubtedly will in the near 
future be exhausted ; that the great 
inter-mountain region is not suscep- 
tible of agricultural development; 
that it has but scanty resources so 
far as grazing facilities are con- 
cerned; that it is occupied by sav- 
age men ; and that the intermingling 
of the blood of the trappers through 
marriage with Indian women will 
undoubtedly develop a race of men, 
in this intermountain region, who 



will compare with the Tartars of 
the East." And he reaches the final 
conclusion that there might be, in 
the then not very distant future, 
developed in the rocky mountain 
region, a race of men living largely 
through plunder, whose predatory 
habits would make them a menace 
to the civilization which will exist 
to the east and to the west of them. 
These men could see possibilities 
of civilization on the Pacific slope. 
They could discern scope and pos- 
sibility for the development of civ- 
ilization in California, in Oregon, 
and of course in that district of 
country lying east of the Rocky 
Mountains. But they reached the 
conclusion that the facilities here 
in this intermountain country were 
not susceptible to a development 
which would result in the establish- 
ment of a highly civilized people. 

I thought this morning how lit- 
tle men comprehend the possibili- 
ties of achievement when the Lord 
sets His hand to the accomplish- 
ment of any work. How little do 
they comprehend the will of the Al- 
mighty so far as it applies to this 
region which they called barren, 
and sterile, and which they looked 
forward to as the home of unciv- 
ilized people only. Compare that 
with the actual conditions of today. 
Civilization has been built up in 
all of this Rocky Mountain region, 
from Canada on the north to Mex- 
ico on the south. The wonderful 
development, cities which have been 
builded, schools which have been es- 
tablished, churches which have been 
erected for the worship of God, our 
Father — these all rose as it were 
before my eyes, and I said to my- 
self, How marvelous are the works 
of the Lord. Let us give the credit 
to the Lord for it, because he 
brought His people here, He estab- 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS.

lished them in these valleys of the 
mountains. He has cared for them. 
He has blessed their labors. He has 
multiplied them, and from here the 
Gospel of the Lord, Jesus Christ 
has gone out into all the world, 
where it is being preached as a wit- 
ness to every creature before the 
end shall come. 

I thought how little Irving could 
conceive, when he wrote the words 
which I have quoted, that, in the 
life of men then living, men and 
women would be gathered together 
in this valley, to which he referred 
as a desert, alkali plain, here upon 
the borders of this great lake which 
Captain Bonneville was the first to 
explore and survey, that there 
would be gathered together under a 
roof like this a congregation of men 
and women in the service of the 
Lord. How little he was able \o 
comprehend that here, in this val- 
ley, schools would be established 
which would be the equal of any 
schools that exist in the world. How 
little he thought that there would 
ever be here a choir composed of 
boys and girls, young men and 
young women, members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, finished, accomplished 
in music, representing a school that 
should be established on one of 
those storm-beaten and desolate 
plains. These reflections bring 
great satisfaction to me, because I 
seem to see in all these things His 
hand plainly manifest, in all the cir- 
cumstances and conditions which 
surround the Latter-day Saints, and 
which make us comfortable here 
today while a storm rages without. 

Not only do I thank the Lord 
for that, but also that we come 
here with peace in our souls, satis- 
fied with the Lord. We come here 
understanding Him, knowing His 



will, and striving, so far as He 
gives us power to do it, to over- 
come the world and bring our lives 
into subjection to the will of God. 
That is what has brought this con- 
gregation of Latter-day Saints to- 
gether this morning, and that which 
has brought the large assembly of 
people together who are now in the 
Tabernacle. They have come here 
to be taught the way of the Lord, 
that they may lear-n to walk in His 
paths. They have come here, for a 
few days, to review the Lord's 
work, to look back over it and see 
whether He has "made good," to 
see whether His purposes are being 
accomplished, that they may find 
out through the presiding authori- 
ties of the Church as to the condi- 
tions that exist in it. I expect, in 
all probability, that the President 
of the Church is now reporting to 
that large congregation of people, 
assembled in the Tabernacle, condi- 
tions as they are in the Church of 
Christ in the beginning of this 
month of April, in the year of our 
Lord nineteen hundred ten. I am 
sure, my brethren and sisters, that 
if you could all be there and hear 
the report that the President makes, 
that it would bring comfort to you, 
it would bring satisfaction, and you 
would be encouraged, because you 
would learn that the work of the 
Lord is developing in the earth. You 
would learn that the Saints are not 
faltering in their faith, and you 
would learn that every day, every 
week, every month, as time passes, 
men and women are being convert- 
ed to the Church in the world. 
They are putting away their sins by 
repenting of them and going down 
into the waters of baptism and hav- 
ing the hands of the servants of the 
Lord laid upon them for the recep- 
tion of the Holy Ghost. Statistics 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



show that a greater number of bap- 
tisms are being performed by our 
Elders in the world than perhaps at 
any time in the past, at least than 
in 1908. Statistics show that there 
is a greater number of Elders 
abroad proclaiming the Gospel than 
ever before in the history of the 
Church. The reports of presidents 
of missions- show that new fields 
■ are constantly being opened ; that 
friends are being raised up to de- 
fend the truth ; that the way is pro- 
vided by which the Elders are sus- 
tained in the fields of labor in which 
they are called to preach the Gos- 
pel ; that here at home the faith of 
the people is not faltering, for they 
are accomplishing more than ever 
before. More meeting houses are 
being erected; more Church 
schools are being established ; more 
tithing is being paid in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
than ever before; and it is these 
things that make possible the devel- 
opment of the work of the Lord. 

I want to say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, and I say it intelligently, 
because I know it to be the truth, 
that while it is a fact that the tithes 
and offerings and the good works of 
the Latter-day Saints are increas- 
ing, have increased during the past 
year, it is also a fact that your bus- 
iness in connection with tithes and 
offerings, the funds which you en- 
trust to the management of the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church, 
has never, in the history of the 
Church, been more carefully and 
more economically administered 
than it is being administered at the 
present time. The accounts of the 
Church are audited by men who are 
not in any way connected with the 
disbursement of its funds, who go 
into every detail. There is not a 
detail, there is not a, fund, there is 



not a receipt or a disbursement in 
the Church which is not scrutinized 
by them, and which they do not 
thoroughly understand. This aud- 
iting committee are men of unques^ 
tioned integrity and qualifications, 
so far as their ability to judge in 
these matters is concerned ; and they 
will tell you — probably will tell that 
large congregation over there, be- 
cause they will make this report, I 
suppose, today — if not today, at 
some other time during the confer- 
ence — they will tell you that they 
know of no corporation, and they 
are associated with many large cor- 
porations, that they know of no in- 
dividual business of magnitude that 
is so carefully and economically 
handled and administered as the 
business of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I felt 
gratified when I heard them say it, 
and I feel, my brethren and sisters, 
that it is proper for you to know it. 

The work of the Lord is not fin- 
ished, by any means. It is only be- 
ginning. It is only in its incipiency. 
True, it will soon be one hundred 
years since the Church was organ- 
ized, and that measured by the life 
of a man is a long time ; but meas- 
ured by the time which is required 
for the development of the purposes 
of the Almighty and the accom- 
plishment of His designs in this 
great Latter-day work, it is, after 
all, but a little while. We shall con- 
tinue to preach the Gospel. This 
burden rests upon the Latter-day 
Saints. This Gospel must be 
preached in all the world as a wit- 
ness to every creature before the 
end shall come ; and that is what we 
are trying to do ; that is what your 
sons and many of your daughters 
are doing. They are in all parts of 
the world, bearing glad tidings of 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. . 17 



great joy to the inhabitants of the 
earth. 

We all regret that during the past 
year, and since we last met in Gen- 
eral Conference, the Lord has call- 
ed home one of His servants who 
was a member of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church. I. need not 
extol the virtues of President Win- 
der. I need not refer to his life and 
works, because Latter-day Saints all 
know them. They are familiar with 
them. I only desire to say that he 
has been gathered home, into the 
garner of the Lord, like a harvest 
that is fully ripened, and gone back 
into the presence of God His Fath- 
er, whose name he has honored and 
magnified while he has been in. the 
flesh, whose work he loved, and to 
which as a servant of the Lord he 
devoted his life. Throughout his 
long life the thought of true and de- 
voted service to the Latter-day 
Saints and to the Church of Jesus 
Christ was ever uppermost in his 
mind. 

It is not my purpose to prolong 
my remarks. I thank the Lord for 
His blessings to us individually and 
to the Church in general. I love 
the society and fellowship of the 
Latter-day Saints. My desire and 
my determination, with the help of 
the Lord, is to magnify my calling 
as a member of the Church of 
Christ, to keep the commandments 
of the Lord, to defend that which 
He has established and to oppose 
that against which His voice has 
been raised, to seek, so far as in my 
power lies, to overcome the world, 
to point out to my brethren and sis- 
ters the way by which they may 
overcome it, and to contend against 
those evils that exist, and which the 
Church has always had to contend 
against, and which the Lord has 



declared have no place nor part in 
His everlasting work. 

May the blessings of the Lord be 
with us while we are together here 
this morning, and with our brethren 
and sisters who are gathered in the 
Tabernacle, and with the Latter-day 
Saints who are not here, and with 
all the world, that the way may be 
opened for the accomplishment of 
His purposes, that His kingdom 
may come and His will be done up- 
on the earth as it is done in heav- 
en. That this condition may be 
hastened and a reign of righteous- 
ness be ushered in, is my sincere 
prayer and desire, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
been very much interested in the 
remarks of Brother Ivins, and re- 
joice with him exceedingly that we 
have this opportunity to meet to- 
gether in this comfortable hall, 
where we are sheltered from the 
storm, and where we can commune 
together in regard to the work of 
the Lord in which we are all deeply 
interested. 

Early in February, 1831, the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and one or 
two of his associate brethren ar- 
rived in the town of Kirtland; a 
town that has become memorable 
on account of its associations, and 
because the first temple erected by 
the Latter-day Saints is located 
there. On his arrival in Kirtland, 
the prophet went into the store of 
Gilbert and Whitney, and, walk- 
ing up to Mr. Whitney, who was 
then a member of that firm, but not 



18 



genz::.:l conference. 



a member of the Church, he said, 
"Newel K. Whitney, thou art the 
man. You have prayed me here ; 
now what do you wiant me to do?" 
Mr. Whitney said, "You have the 
advantage of me; I do not know 
you." The prophet smilingly re- 
plied, "I am known as the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith." Mr. Whitney 
welcomed him kindly and took him 
home., The prophet Joseph and his 
wife remained domiciled with New- 
el K. Whitney and family during 
the fore part of the year. Soon 
after this, some of the Saints began 
moving farther west, into the state 
of Missouri ; and during the latter 
part of 1831, the prophet himself 
visited that state, and also in 1832. 
Previous to his second visit to the 
state of Missouri, he lived in the 
town of Hiram, but moved back to 
Kirtland again in 1833. When the 
Saints were driven from Jackson 
county, where the center stake of 
Zion was designated, many of the 
people moved to Kirtland, frqm 
Missouri, and Kirtland became a 
ward of the Church, numbering one 
thousand five hundred souls, most 
of whom were young men and 
young women, without families. 
You may thus understand that the 
town of Kirtland in 1833 was a 
strong branch of the Church: In 
March of that year, the first stake 
of Zion was organized, and the first 
High Council in connection with 
the Church. The Prophet Joseph 
and his counselors, Sidney Rigdon 
and Frederick G. Williams, were 
the presiding officers of the stake. 
This implies they did not organize 
a presidency of the stake aside from 
the prophet and his counselors. The 
stake was well organized, having its 
High Council and other officers 
complete. 



On the 14th day of February, 
1835, the Quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles was organized, the first in 
this dispensation. In the months 
of February and March following, 
, the first two quorums of Seventy 
were organized. On the 27th day 
of March,- 1836, the Temple of the 
Lord was dedicated. You will re- 
alize something of the spirit of that 
solemn occasion by reading the ded- 
icatorial pr.ayer offered by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, contained in 
the 109th section of the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants. The reve- 
lation which is found in the 110th 
section, which was given to the 
Prophet a few days later, proclaims 
the fact that seven days after the 
dedication of that temple the 
Prophet Joesph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, beheld the Savior stand- 
ing upon the breastwork of the pul- 
pit, upon a platform of pure gold 
shining like amber, brighter than 
the noon-day sun. The Savior de- 
clared to the Prophet and to his as- 
sociate that He was the Mediator 
with the Father for His people, 
from that time forth. At that time 
Moses came also and delivered the 
keys of the gathering of Israel. Al- 
so, the great Prophet Elijah, that 
was taken into heaven without tast- 
ing death, came in accordance with 
the promise of the Angel Moroni, 
when he informed the youthful 
prophet concerning the plates on 
which was engraved the Book of 
Mormon; for Moroni said that the 
Lord would send these great lead- 
ers of dispensations to the Prophet 
Joseph. Elijah delivered the keys 
that were to turn the hearts of the 
children to the fathers and the 
hearts of the fathers to the children. 
That Temple was erected without 



. PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



19 



a baptismal font, for the reason that 
the keys of baptism for the dead 
were not given by Elijah to the 
prophet tijl after its completion. 
Temples since that day have had 
placed in their basement rooms, the 
molten s sea, or baptismal font, for 
the redemption of the living and the 
dead; 

The first stake of Zion was or- 
ganized in Kirtland. Now we have 
sixty-one stakes. We have grown 
a little. Assuredly there has been 
some increase of power among this 
people. The organizations were 
continued in Illinois, and finally, 
when Brigham Young reached Salt 
Lake Valley, after the breaking up 
of the people and their expulsion 
from their homes in the state of 
Illinois, a stake of Zion was organ- 
ized here in Salt Lake valley in 
1847-8. John Smith, the uncle of 
the prophet, and the presiding patri- 
arch at that time, was ordained 
president of the stake, the first stake 
of Zion in the intermountain coun- 
try. The growth of the Latter-day 
Saints is attributable to the fact, in 
my estimation, that they, at least a 
large majority of them, have sought 
with all their hearts to keep the 
commandments of God, and they 
• have shown their faith by their 
works. In place of only one temple, 
and that one without a baptismal 
font, we have today four completed 
edifices of that kind, all having this 
wonderful preparation within their 
walls for the redemption of our 
dead kindred. 

Brother Ivins alluded very feel- 
ingly to the death of President John 
R. Winder. From the beginning of 
our temple work in this city, pres- 
ident John R. Winder has been a 
leading spirit and diligent worker 
in the house of the Lord. In Oc- 



tober, 1891, the Saints passed a res- 
olution at their conference, moved 
by President Francis Marion Ly- 
man, that the temple be completed 
at the April conference of 1893, or 
at the end of the forty years from 
the time of its commencement. 
Brother Winder was then placed in 
charge of that work. I speak of 
him now with my heart full of grat- 
itude to my Heavenly Father that 
I had the pleasure of knowing him 
intimately, probably as much so as 
any man, for I say with pride and 
gratitude that I have been very 
near him as his medical adviser. 
You know, we get every close to 
men with our sympathy and love 
during the hours of their suffering 
and pain; the heart of the doctor 
is drawn out in love and tenderness 
for the sufferer. This has been my 
experience. Now I want to say 
this, that President Winder when 
he had the charge of completing the 
temple, although the foreman of the 
builders and the architects them- 
selves declared it would be impos- 
sible to gather sufficient material of 
requisite kinds to complete it with- 
in the time named, yet it was done 
because President Winder stood al- 
ways upon this platform, "It must 
be done ; the temple must be finished 
on time for its dedication at the end 
of forty years." It was accom- 
plished at the April conference of 
1893, through the energy of the 
brethren and the Saints generally, 
their means being freely given for 
that purpose. The faith and pray- 
ers of the Latter-day Saints, and 
their earnest works in that direction 
were crowned with success. Other 
temples have been completed in this 
intermountain region, and the breth- 
ren who have the presidency of this 
work, the leaders in these ordi- 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nances, have been energetic to that 
degree that millions of people in the 
spirit world have had the ordinance 
of baptism performed for them by 
living friends and kindred. These 
faithful workers, among the fore- 
most of whom was President John 
R. Winder, with the brethren and 
sisters who form the corps of work- 
ers in each temple, have been dili- 
gent and faithful for all these years ; 
and we may ask ourselves "What 
will the harvest be?" How glor- 
ious will be the welcome of Presi- 
dent John R. Winder and others as 
they go into the spirit world and 
meet their kindred and those for 
whom they have worked in the tem- 
ples of the Lord ! You can imagine 
for yourselves, my brethren and sis- 
ters, occupants of a prison house, 
without the freedom that the Gos- 
pel brings, how they must rejoice 
when they learn that the ordinance 
of the Gospel has been performed 
vicariously for them, that will give 
them their freedom from the bonds 
of death, hell and the grave. We 
can rejoice today, my brethren and 
sisters, for the blessings of the Lord 
which have been showered upon His 
people. From this barren country 
that Emerson pronounced unfit for 
white man to live in, gardens and 
orchards have sprung up as if by 
magic, and the Lord has sent the 
early and the later rains for the 
benefit of His children. Daniel 
Webster, who was a great states- 
man as you well remember, asked, 
"For what purpose does the presi- 
dent of the United States purchase 
the Louisiana District, including 
this great western and intermoun- 
tain region, what is' his aim and 
object, I cannot fathom. It is a 
country of rock and sagebrush 
plains, where nothing that is food 



for man can grow, and inhabited 
by lizards and poisonous reptiles, 
and the wildest kind of untamable 
savages." But the Lord led His 
servants here, Brigham Young and 
his pioneer band, and indicated to 
him that here he would £nd a ref- 
uge for His people. The refuge was 
found, and in this valley of the 
Great Salt Lake, a successful 
colony and community of living 
working people was established. 
The thrift and industry of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have been man- 
ifested from the first by the results 
attained in this once sterile coun- 
try, in causing it to blossom and 
become fruitful. 

As I remarked in the beginning 
of my conversation this morning, 
in Kirtland we had one stake of 
Zion; today we have sixty-one. 
That is some growth, and there is 
some advancement. Today, as 
Brother Ivins truly said, we are be- 
ginning to rank with people who 
are known to be foremost as edu- 
cators. Our schools rank very high 
in the records of the United States ; 
we are among the five most ad- 
vanced states of the Union in lit- 
eracy, away up among the leaders, 
although we are but a youthful 
state. 

The Church today is approach- 
ing its eightieth birthday, which 
will be on the 6th of this month. 
We can realize my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord has been very 
kind to His children. Not only 
have the Latter-day Saints been 
benefited by the redemption of this 
intermountain country, but all peo- 
ple of the Union and of other coun- 
tries are looking toward this great 
region of the west as a safe place 
for homes and investment. Many 
visitors come to our cities, and es-

21 



pecially this great city, and are fa- 
vorably inpressed and more are 
coming. Many of the people in the 
East are looking to the West, to 
these once arid plains and valleys. 

I rejoice with you today, because 
I know the principles of the Gos- 
pel which we have received are true. 
I know that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith was inspired by the Spirit 
of the Lord to organize this Church, 
and to organize the quorums of the 
Priesthood, ' and that Brigham 
Young and those who have suc- 
ceeded the Prophet Joseph have 
been inspired to gather the people, to 
this land of Zion, and we are here 
rejoicing this day in general confer- 
ence because of the blessings of the 
Lord unto us. 

May we be faithful and true, and 
always have a living testimony with- 
in our hearts of the truth of this 
great work, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The young ladies of the L. D. S. 
U. choir sang the hymn entitled, 
"This is the Sabbath morn." 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I believe that the Latter-day 
Saints here present must feel with 
me a certain amount of pride in 
listening to the voices of these Lat- 
ter-day Saints' University students, 
who are rendering such beautiful 
music to us here this morning. A 
good deal has been said this morn- 
ing in regard to the educational 
status of the Latter-day Saints. We 
have here now an object lesson, 
these young men and young wom- 
en, members of the Latter-day 



Saints' University in this city, pur- 
suing their studies there, also re- 
ceiving instruction in the divine art 
of music, under the able leadership 
of Brother Kirkham. I am sure 
that we must feel proud of these 
our young brethren and sisters and 
what they are accomplishing in an 
educational way. I regard music 
as a part of their education, and the 
ability they have shown is a result 
of their application. I believe that 
it is the destiny of this people to be- 
come the leaders in education, in 
knowledge, in understanding and in 
all those accomplishments which 
go to make the perfect man and the 
perfect woman. Every acquirement 
in these lines helps to polish the 
young lady or young gentleman to 
give to them an air of culture and 
improvement that is completely in 
harmony with the great work of 
the Lord in which we are all en- 
gaged. 

If there is anything that this 
work stands for it is for enlighten- 
ment, for education; for improve- 
ment, and the accomplishment of 
the great ends for which this 
Church has been set up, organized 
and established, for after all our 
mission upon this earth is one of 
education. We are, so to speak, at- 
tending school, fitting and qualify- 
ing ourselves for a habitation in 
the realms above, in the presence 
of our eternal Father, whose glory 
is sometimes referred to as being 
intelligence. Intelligence is the 
glory of God. It is by reason of 
His great intelligence and knowl- 
edge that He is able to manifest 
such power, for knowledge is pow- 
er. We have organizations that are 
particularly adapted to the youth of 
Zion, not only in our Church 
schools, that are doing so much in 



22

that line and are accomplishing such 
a great work, but also in the var- 
ious organizations for our young 
people, the young men's and the 
young ladies' Mutual Improvement 
Associations, our Sabbath Schools, 
Primary associations and Religion 
classes. 

Sometimes people in the world 
imagine that the study of religion 
is not particularly an intellectual 
attainment, and that men and wom- 
en can be religious and keep mor- 
al without any particular amount of 
intellectual pursuit or application. 
But I wish to call attention to the 
fact, which seems to me to be self- 
evident, that it requires intelligence 
to be good, to be moral, to be vir- 
tuous, and to be honest. It is a 
mistaken idea some people have, 
that they prefer — for they say they 
prefer — to bring their sons up into 
some occupation that will require a 
great amount of mental application. 
They would like to have their sons 
become good lawyers or physicians ; 
but when it comes to following re- 
ligion, why anybody can follow that, 
as it does not require any particular 
amount of intellect or knowledge to 
be an upright man. That, think they, 
is something that can be turned over 
to weaker minds. But I wish to 
call attention to the fact, that the 
greatest amount of intellectual ener- 
gy is necessary to overcome evil in 
all its various forms as it presents 
itself to mankind in gefneral. I 
wonder how many there are who 
have resolved in their own mind "I 
will do no evil, T will think no evil, 
I will resist all that is wrong and 
try to do only that which is good." 
In other words, how many are there 
who are trying to follow the in- 
junction of the Lord Jesus Christ 
when he said, "Be perfect even as 



your Father in heaven is perfect." 
If we have resolved this in our 
minds and determined that we are 
going to try to live tnat kind of a 
life, have we not learned, and found 
out to our own satisfaction, that it 
requires intellectual effort for us to 
do so? To govern the mind, the 
desires of the heart, require the 
greatest amount of intellectual pow- 
er. To resolve in our minds that we 
are going to try, is the biggest step 
in that direction. What are our 
intentions? It has been said by 
some one that "hell is paved with 
good intentions." I do not believe 
one word of it, I regard that as a 
false aphorism. Hell is not .paved 
with good intentions ; it would be 
more appropriate to say it is paved 
with evil intentions. It may be true 
that some people have particularly 
good intentions at times, and fail 
to carry them out; but I believe 
that the most difficulty is in our 
failure to have good intentions. I 
believe this, that anyone with good 
intentions will never be found do- 
ing anything very wrong. If we 
can control our thoughts or our 
minds, if we can control our think- 
ing, our intentions and our pur- 
poses, I believe that our deeds will 
take care of themselves. But we 
want to get the reins and hold them, 
that we may control the thinking 
of our minds; that is intellectual 
energy, and it requires a vast 
amount of it. There is no under- 
taking so vast and so great as the 
obtaining of this self-control, and 
it is all a part of our religion. The 
Gospel takes hold of us exactly in 
this way, or it should do so. 

Fundamental in the Church of 
Jesus Christ, is the principle of 
faith. We must have faith in God, 
and plead with Him for His 'as- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



23 



sistance, for the companionship of 
His Holy Spirit. Fundamental, al- 
so, in our Church, is the great prin- 
ciple of repentance from sin. With- 
out it we. cannot improve. It is the 
application of this principle that is 
going to help us to cleanse our- 
selves from sin. The resisting of 
evil is exercised by us every day, 
if we are leading the lives of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Opportunity to ex- 
ert these powers is afforded to us 
every day of our lives. We should 
indulge only in pure thoughts ; do 
we endeavor at all times to reject 
the evil ones that are constantly pre- 
senting themselves to us ? If we do, 
we have something to accomplish, 
something that requires our great- 
est effort. It requires a superior 
quality of spirit and intelligence for 
us to combat the evils of the world, 
not only as it applies to communi- 
ties at large, but as individuals, 
fighting the great fight, cleansing 
and purifying ourselves from all 
evil. That is what repentance will 
do for us. But it necessitates con- 
stant and daily application, some- 
thing that we have got to do every 
day of our lives. If we are imbued 
with this kind of a spirit, when we 
arise in the morning the first 
thought will be "Today I will keep 
myself clean and unspotted from 
the world ; I will do no evil ; I will 
resist every evil that presents itself 
to my mind that it may find no rest- 
ing place within me." Someone has 
said — I do not know who it was — 
that "we cannot prevent the birds 
from flying over our heads, but we 
can prevent them from building 
nests in our hair." Sometimes I 
think that we can, to a certain ex- 
tent, prevent them from flying over 
our heads. A short time ago I was 
in the city of Los Angeles, and 



while there I visited a pigeon farm, 
owned by one of our people who 
formerly lived in Sanpete county. 
Nearly all the visitors who go to 
Los Angeles make it a point to visit 
this pigeon farm, for it is possibly 
the largest pigeon farm in the 
world. The brother showed us his 
pigeons, numbering 125,000. It is 
only a small farm as far as the area 
is concerned. There were housed 
there, as stated, 125,000 pigeons. 
There is a little creek running 
through his farm, and a little green 
growing on either side of it, and 
these pigeons fly all around on this 
particular farm, but it was notice- 
able that none of them left th° 
boundaries of the farm. On the 
right and on the left were garden 
patches with green garden stuff, 
vegetables growing in the garden, 
and houses were all around. You 
would naturally think that these 
pigeons would fly over and devour 
these green vegetables, that they 
would go over on to the houses of 
the neighbors and rest upon the 
roofs. But no, they all remained on 
that farm. We asked Brother John- 
son — I think that is his name — how 
it was. He said they never leave 
the farm. "When I first started 
business here thev began to go on 
the neighboring farm, but I went 
out with a shotgun and I fired off 
a few shots and they went back, 
and," he says, "I never had anv 
trouble since." Now, my brethren 
and sisters, if we fire a few shots* 
at the evil thoughts and evil desires 
which sometimes present themselves 
to us, and set ourselves against 
them, we can prevent them from 
flying over our heads. We want 
to endeavor in every way to avoid 
evil thinking, because out of an evil 
thought comes" an evil deed; and if 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we will take care of this part I 
think that the deeds will take care 
of themselves. 

I rejoice in the Gospel of re- 
pentance, because I know that it 
has within it the power of God un- 
to salvation; and I know that it is 
necessary for us to make individual 
efforts to control the thinking pow- 
ers of our minds, to control those 
elements of our nature that require 
our purification to fit and qualify 
us to dwell in the presence of God. 
That is the part of our salvation 
that is left to us. Through the 
grace of God we will be redeemed 
from the dead. Through the grace 
of God we will be relieved from 
the consequences of evil, not only 
from the original transgression of 
our first parents in the Garden of 
Eden, but also of all our own per- 
sonal acts and shortcomings, pro- 
vided we will practice this great 
Gospel of repentance from sin, and 
bring unto the Lord a broken heart 
and a contrite spirit, and manifest 
in our daily lives that we are de- 
termined to lead that perfect life 
and to resist evil in all of its forms, 
no matter how it may present it- 
self to us. May the Lord of heav- 
en help us to go on and on until 
finally we shall gain the victory, 
which is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 
i 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
and sisters, in having the opportu- 
nity this morning of listening to the 
remarks and testimonies of the 
brethren who have preceded me, 
and of listening to the sweet sing- 



ing of our college choir, and of 
taking part in these meetings con- 
nected with the eightieth anniver- 
sary of the organization of the 
Church. Prof. Geo. Trumbull Ladd, 
professor of moral philosophy and 
metaphysics of Yale University, in 
the introductory preface of a recent 
work on Mormonism, makes the 
statement that "the rise and growth 
of Mormonism is one of the most 
remarkable phenomena of the nine- 
teenth century," and that "it is de- 
serving of thorough investigation 
whether the investigation be con- 
ducted from the point of view of 
the sociologist, the psychologist or 
the student of politics or of reli- 
gion." Mormonism has been inves- 
tigated, not only by those who are 
its friends and adherents, but also 
by those who have sought to find 
some satisfactory explanation of its 
origin other than the true one that it 
is of divine founding. Thus far, 
these counter theories or efforts to 
account for the introduction of 
Mormonism Upon some hypothesis 
other than the one given by Joseph 
Smith, have not received any con- 
siderable number of adherents to 
any particular theory. There was 
the Spaulding theory, and that has 
been so thoroughly exploded that 
you can scarcely find any one, I ap- 
prehend, in this enlightened age 
who thinks the Spaulding theory 
satisfactorily accounts for the Book 
of Mormon and Mormonism. 

Then there is the theory that Sid- 
ney Rigdon was the author of the 
Book of Mormon, and the real 
genius and founder of Mormonism ; 
and that, I suppose, has also very 
few adherents. Of course we Lat- 
ter-day Saints know that as a mat- 
ter of fact Sidney Rigdon had noth- 
ing to do with the origin of Mor-

monism, had no knowledge of it, 
and never met the Prophet or his 
followers until after the Book of 
Mormon had been published. 

Some one suggested that the suc- 
cess of early Mormonism was due 
to choice of men, that "as Harris 
had supplied the money, so Pratt 
supplied the eloquence, and Rigdon 
the brains," but no one believes such 
nonsense. The antithesis, though 
somewhat striking,receives the scoff 
of the investigator who realizes that 
Joseph Smith was a power, had es- 
tablished this work, and was direct- 
ing it with a master hand, before 
making the acquaintance of Rigdon 
or the Pratts. 

I believe that the world is com- 
ing today to realize as never before 
the sincerity of the direct witnesses 
to the Book of Mormon. Truths 
are established either by direct or 
circumstantial evidence. It is no 
light task to fabricate or formulate 
a false theory, or a falsehood, and 
successfully palm it off as the truth. 
My reading of the history of human 
experience in this respect teaches 
me that it is a very difficult thing to 
fabricate even the smallest item and 
have it established as the truth ; that 
it is even difficult to forge so much 
as a downward stroke of the pen or 
add a syllable to a word; for the 
reason that they do not conform to 
the truth, and are not in harmony 
with things as they exist. And so 
it would have been an impossibility 
for Joseph Smith, the Prophet to 
have acted a false and fictitious part 
for nearly a quarter of a century 
without his fellowmen being able to 
detect the imposture. As a recent 
illustration of the difficulty of a per- 
son palming off falsehood success- 
fully upon the people for any con- 
siderable length of time, take the 
case of Dr. Frederick A. Cook. No 



doubt Dr. Cook thought it would be 
an easy matter to put forth the false 
statement that he had been to the 
north pole, and have it believed. It 
would not be expected that he 
would erect a monument at the 
north pole ; a monument of rock, if 
you please, such as our surveyors 
sometimes place upon the summit of 
mountain tops which they scale. It 
would not be expected that he 
would leave any record there that 
other explorers might afterwards 
find to prove beyond all doubt that 
he had been there. It would not be 
expected that he would leave a trail 
in the snow or ice, that others might 
trace. And so Dr. Cook thought it 
would be an easy matter to mislead 
the world as to where he had trav- 
eled. Even the two representatives 
of a half-civilized race who were 
with him would not be able to deter- 
mine, with any degree of certainty, 
how far north he went. They were 
not sufficiently acquainted with as- 
tronomy or astronomical observa- 
tions to know just how far they had 
traveled or what ground they had 
covered. So no doubt he thought 
it would be an easy matter to de- 
ceive the public in that respect. But 
he was not able to deceive the one 
board of learned men in the north 
country to whom he presented the 
evidences of his trip; much less 
could he deceive the entire public. 

Mormonism has been before the 
world now for these eighty years, 
and thus far, as expressed by Rid- 
path, the historian, in his history of 
the world, "It has never succumbed 
to the force of logic nor to the logic 
of force." And today, men investi- 
gating it realize the sincerity of the 
direct witnesses to the founding of 
Mormonism. They know that the 
three witnesses would not have re- 
mained true to their testimony if it 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



had been based upon fraud or collu- 
sion with the prophet, just as they 
know that the prophet would not 
have dared 'to break with the wit- 
nesses and e!xpel them from the. 
Church for their failure to live up 
to the strict requirements and disci- 
pline of the Church, if there had 
been any collusion between the wit- 
nesses and himself. And so with 
the eight witnesses. There were 
enough of them who failed to live 
according to the rigid discipline of 
the Church and who were disfellow- 
shipped to demonstrate that there 
was no collusion between them and 
the prophet. A chance acquaintance 
of mine, in Idaho, had a theory with 
reference to our missionary system, 
and why thousands of our young 
men, at the call of the Church, would 
go upon missions. He thought they 
had been hypnotized. I soon con- 
vinced him of, his error. You may 
examine so-called Mormonism in 
the light of mesmerism, hypnotism, 
or any other form of psychological 
phenomena, and still you will find 
no satisfactory explanation of Mor- 
monism except that given by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. In recent 
times Mormonism is being investi- 
gated from the point of view of the 
psychologist. We welcome such 
study as we have welcomed every 
other attempt to scrutinize and in- 
vestigate to the fullest the claims of 
Mormonism. 

In addition to the testimony of 
the three and of the eight witnesses, 
we have an overwhelming array of 
circumstantial evidence in favor of 
the divine founding of Mormonism. 
We have the fact that the Book of 
Mormon and the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants and the organization of the 
Church dovetail with all truth, are 
in harmony with the Jewish scrip- 



tures, with the -learning and revela- 
tions of the past ; and the fact that 
the Book of Mormon is in harmony 
with the archaeology of the Ameri- 
can continent, with the philology 
and the ethnology and all the other 
ologies that have any connection 
with these matters. All these sciences 
corroborate and dovetail and unite 
in support of the claim of the Book 
of Mormon to be a true history. It 
is useless to attempt to explain away 
the testimony of the dozen or more 
men, direct witnesses to the Book 
of Mormon, upon any of these mod- 
ern hypotheses, because not one of 
these theories can be pursued satis- 
factorily for any length of time 
without disclosing the futility and 
the weakness of the same to account 
for the phenomena connected with 
the growth and establishment of our 
Church. 

I rejoice with you in the splen- 
did growth that Mormonism has 
achieved in the few years of its ex- 
istence, the largest part of that his- 
tory being within the easy remem- 
brance of the largest part of this au- 
dience. During this time it has 
grown from a Church composed of 
six individuals to an organization 
of 400,000 or more members. And 
if in the next eighty years there is 
a corresponding ratio of increase in 
membership in the Church, what a 
power Mormonism will be in the 
world It is today a leaven that is 
working upon the lump of human- 
ity. The doctrines of Mormonism 
of yesterday that were unpopular 
are becoming the popular doctrines 
of religious creeds today ; and grad- 
ually the truth is being established, 
and truth and knowledge are being 
extended upon the face of the earth 
and established in the hearts and 
minds of the children of our Father.

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN 

Facilities for prosperity, and plenty of 
room in Utah. — Urgent need for ex- 
perienced missionaries.: — All Saints 
entitled to testimony that this work 
is of God. — Works manifest the 
measure of faith. Splendid effects 
produced by good examples. — Ed- 
ucation in self-control. 

I appreciate, as a very great priv- 
ilege, this opportunity of meeting 
with such a large congregation of 
Latter-day Saints and, possibly, 
with some of our friends and neigh- 
bors who are not Latter-day Saints. 

We had a very profitable meet- 
ing this morning, and the key-note 
was given to us in regard to the 
building up of our state and of the 
sections of country already occu- 



pied by the Latter-day Saints. I 
have felt, for a long time, the ne- 
cessity of advising our brethren and 
sisters to stay at home, to stay in 
our state of Utah and in other near- 
by sections that have been selected 
for the gathering of the Latter- 
day Saints, where stakes have been 
organized, and where wards, in 
great numbers, have been estab- 
lished. It is not a good thing for us 
to have the spirit of wandering 
from one state to another, or from 
one stake to another, or from 
one ward to another. It occurs, oc- 
casionally, that moves are necessary, 
but as a rule it is better to stay set- 
tled and established, developing our 
farms and our business affairs, es- 
tablishing homes, and becoming sol- 
id, stable citizens of our common 
country. I believe it is a bad habit 
that the brethren sometimes get in- 
to, of moving about, roaming about 
and losing their standing and fel- 
lowship in the Church, and making 
new acquaintances instead of re- 
maining settled and fixed in the 
country — especially, as suggested by 
the President, this morning, in our 
own country. Utah is not yet 
thickly populated. There isn't a 
city, nor a county, in the state, that 
I think of at the present time, that 
is thickly populated. There is plen- 
ty of room in our state — in Salt 
Lake valley, Weber valley, Utah 
valley, Juab, Sanpete, Millard, 
Beaver, Iron, and all the southern 
part of the state, as well as in the 
northern part. 

Everywhere, there is plenty of 
room in Utah, but it is rapidly fill- 
ing up with our friends and neigh- 
bors from abroad, and it will be well 
for us, my brethren and sisters, to 
heed the counsel given this morn- 
ing to stay at home and locate, that 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we may occupy this land and de- 
velop the resources of our country. 
We do not need to go abroad for 
mining facilities ; we do not need to 
go abroad for coal mining, gold 
mining, silver mining, lead mining, 
or copper mining. We have as fine 
prospects and as profitable oppor- 
tunities in this state as can be found 
in any of our neighboring states. 
Every little while there are open- 
ings and opportunities in agricul- 
tural lines; new sections are being 
opened, and the water is being bet- 
ter controlled. I think I shall be 
perfectly safe in saying that for the 
future our gteat work will be to 
take care of the water that we have 
and utilize it properly, so the lands 
of our state will be suitably irri- 
gated. There is plenty of mois- 
ture; the country is desirable, and 
it is fruitful, and if it is not occu- 
pied by the Latter-day Saints, it 
will be occupied by our friends who 
are not Latter-day Saints, because it 
is inviting. All the measures and 
points of superiority in our state 
are being appreciated and our 
friends are coming in with their 
capital. We do not object to their 
coming; we have no objection to 
that, but we want to stay ourselves 
and share with them the good things 
of which these mountain valleys are 
so fruitful. 

We want to stay at home. Our 
mission carries us abroad a great 
deal to preach the Gospel, but we 
will find an ample field for preach- 
ing the Gospel right here at home, 
for those who are not able to go 
abroad. We have in the field, now, 
an army of a couple of thousand 
men, or more, and we expect to 
keep that army up to that standard 
—the standing army of the Church 
of Jesus Christ. We want to keep 



it up to two thousand men, or near 
that ;> and possibly increase it as we 
can. As we listen to the reports 
of the presidents of missions, when 
they come to see us twice a year, at 
least the presidents of missions in 
the United States, we discover that 
they all want more missionaries. 
There is no section of the country 
that is satisfied They are all call- 
ing for more brethren: We want 
more German speakers; we want 
more Scandinavian Elders, or those ' 
who speak the language of that 
country; and Elders who speak 
Dutch, French, and Spanish can be 
used to good advantage. We are 
in need of a great deal of help,' and 
I thought of this matter when I 
looked over the congregation, this 
morning, and saw such a large per- 
centage of brethren. I do not think 
I have ever seen the congregation 
so well supplied with men as this 
morning. Whether the storm kept 
some of the sisters away, or not, I 
cannot say, but at any rate the 
brethren braved the storm and 
seemed to be here in very great 
numbers. I want to ask my breth- 
ren, with whom I am particularly 
interested, the Seventies to prepare 
for this work. We want you ready 
for missionary work. We want the 
Bishops to supply us with plenty of 
Seventies, for the Seventies are at 
their service, ready to be called up- 
on. We want our brethren, par- 
ticularly the Seventies, to be out 
of debt and in condition to preach 
the Gospel. We are in great need 
of experienced and trained men. 
The brethren complain that they are 
getting too large percentage of the 
young men, who have never been in 
the missionary field before, young 
men as young as twenty, and under 
twenty, years of age, and from that 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

to twenty-five, who have had no 
training at all, except what they 
have had at home. We would ask 
the Bishops and presiding breth- 
ren that when requisition is made 
for ten, twenty, thirty, or forty men, 
you send us at least one-third of 
trained, experienced and tried men. 
Unless you do this, our presidents 
of missions will not be satisfied. 
We want to see the time when the 
field will be pretty well occupied 
with men who are seventies, who 
are consecrated and dedicated to 
this calling and ministry, having 
had training, so they may go out 
into the world representing the 
Lord, being His witnesses — men 
who know the Lord lives, for every 
Seventy who has done his duty fair- 
ly well is entitled to that testimony ; 
so is every Elder and every High 
Priest entitled to that same testi- 
mony, to know that God lives, to 
know that Jesus is the Christ, that 
He lives, and that He is the Re- 
deemer of the world. All Latter- 
day Saints are entitled to this testi- 
mony and witness. 

If there be doubts or misgivings 
in the hearts of any of the Latter- 
day Saints, in regard to the truth 
of the Gospel as revealed through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, I would 
like to say that it is our own fault. 
That would be evidence that we had 
not quite done the will of the Lord, 
for all who do the will of the Lord, 
we understand, will "know of the 
doctrine. They will not only know 
of the doctrine, but they will know 
of the divinity of the Church ; they 
will know of its authority. They 
will know of the Father; they will 
have a witness, for the Son will bear 
witness to them of the Father, and 
the Father will bear witness to them 
of the Son; and the Holy Ghost 
will bear .witness, to all Saints, of 



the Father and the Son. So, no 
Latter-day Saint ever need to be 
without a testimony. It has oc- 
curred at times that Elders, over 
conscientious, have been afraid to 
bear testimony that they knew the 
Gospel was true, that they knew the 
Prophet Joseph was sent of God. 
They have been fearful lest they 
might bear testimony to something 
that they did not know to be true. 
Now, all Latter-day Saints are en- 
titled to a witness and to know, and 
I thought, just in connection with 
this, I would read one or two verses 
from the ninety-third section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord, it shall 
come to pass that every soul who for- 
saketh their sins and cometh' unto 
me, and calleth on my name, and 
obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my 
commandments, shall see my face 
and know that I am, 

"And that I am the true light that 
hghteth every man that cometh into 
the world; 

th/v\^ 1 am in the Father > an d 
I are one" the Father and 

_ Every Latter-day Saint is en- 
titled to this witness and testimony. 
If we have not received this wit- 
ness and testimony, mv brethren 
and my sisters, I want vou all to re- 
member that the fault'is ours and 
not the Lord's ; for every one is en- 
titled to that witness, through faith 
and repentance, forsaking all sin 
baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins, and the reception of 
the Holy Ghost through the laying 
on of hands. Now, if any of our 
brethren and sisters have lived for 
years without really knowing be- 
ing thoroughly satisfied and thor- 
oughly convinced, just as positive 
as of anything in life, that this work 
is of God, if they have lacked that 
witness and testimony it is their 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fault, for it is not possible for a 
man to do the will of the Father and 
not know the doctrine. If we do 
His, will, we shall know. We can- 
not avoid knowing, any more than 
we can avoid anything else. We 
know by what we see and hear and 
feel and taste, if our senses are in- 
volved and are convinced; and so 
it is with every one who has done 
the will of the Father. Let us, my 
brethren and sisters, see to it that 
we be not satisfied until we are so 
established in the Gospel, with a 
knowledge of the truth, that we 
shall be unshaken and stable — not 
like the wind and the waves that 
come and go, but serene and set- 
tled and established in our faith, 
so that nothing may occur to arouse 
questions in our hearts and minds in 
regard to the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus, or in regard to our heavenly 
Father, but that we shall know that 
He lives, that we shall know that 
Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer 
and Savior, and that we may realize 
what He has done for us. He has 
not made requirements of us, nor 
given us commandments that we are 
not able to keep, for it is quite pos- 
sible for us to meet every require- 
ment He has made of us ; and thus 
we may approach the injunction that 
He made, that His disciples should 
be perfect as our Father in heaven 
is perfect. 

No doubt, our heavenly Father, 
as well as the Son and the righteous 
who have gone before us have done 
their duty, and done their best. 
That is what is required of us. Our 
responsibilities are great; the re- 
quirements made of us in the world 
today are very exacting ; though we 
be modest, and hesitate in stand- 
ing before congregations of people, 
as is the case with many of our 



brethren and many sisters, also, to 
advocate the Gospel at home and 
abroad, yet there is one most elo- 
quent sermon that we are all com- 
petent to preach wherever we are, 
in our own homes and families, in 
our own neighborhoods, and abroad, 
and that is the sermon of correct 
and proper example. We can be 
moral, upright, true, and faithful. 
We can love one another; we can 
deal justly by one another; and we 
cannot please GoJ without all these 
virtues are developed in us. We 
cannot please the Lord with any one 
virtue, although the Apostle Paul 
made this declaration that without 
faith it is impossible to please God. 
It is not possible to please the Lord 
with faith alone. A genuine, liv- 
ing faith, never goes alone; it al- 
ways produces works ; it moves up- 
on intelligences, and requires them 
and propels them to works of right- 
eousness. So that if Paul declares 
that without faith it is impossible 
to please God, I think I can just as 
safely say that without works it is 
impossible to please God. I may 
also say that without faith we will 
not work, and we have not worked 
without faith; we have labored just 
in proportion to the faith that' we 
enjoy. Our works in the future will 
determine the measure of our faith, 
for if men have faith they work. If 
men have faith in the principle of 
prayer, they will pray ; if in the 
principle of tithing, they will meet 
their tithing obligation; they will 
pay their tithing just according to 
the measure of their faith. That is 
what you and I have been doing in 
the past, and it is what we will do 
in the future, according to the meas- 
ure of our faith. So. will we meet 
that requirement, according to the 
measure of our faith. So will we 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 31 



repent of our sins, and work right- 
eousness, serve the Lord and hon- 
or Him, and make good use of the 
opportunities that He places in our 
way. 

Not only is the field to be filled 
with missionaries abroad, for that 
seems to be the field assigned parti- 
cularly to the Seventies and to the 
Elders— the Seventies particularly 
are expected to go out into the field 
and be traveling Elders all their 
li ves __but the greater field, that is, 
the field that can, be occupied by 
greater numbers-, and always will 
be, is the home field. It is becom- 
ing more important , by reason of 
the process of gathering, not only 
the gathering that we are doing as 
Latter-day Saints, but the gathering 
of other .people into our borders, in- 
to our neighborhood, and into our 
nation,— for they are coming from 
all nations and from all peoples. 
They are to receive the Gospel and 
be taught it in the United States 
as well as in the outside world. 
They are to receive it in the states 
and territories, wherever the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are located, and it 
will be carried to other parts. It 
is our duty to preach the Gospel. 
That is our chief calling— to preach 
the Gospel by word, to preach it by 
our conduct throughout our lives. 
Nothing is stronger, nothing is more 
real, or more reliable and substantial 
than the good example that men set 
in their lives. 

I want to say just a word of com- 
mendation for our brethren who 
are at the head of our missionary 
work abroad, for our brethren who 
are at the head of our stakes of 
Zion and of our wards and quor- 
ums, and all the brethren and sisters 
who are at the head of the various 
associations. I believe that the 



Church has never been in better 
condition than it is today, that we 
are making good progress, good 
headway, and that the secret of our 
success and improvement lies very 
materially in the fact that the pre- 
siding brethren and sisters lead in 
their good examples — not alone in 
their preaching and in their teach- 
ing and the like, but they are liv- 
ing better lives. I believe we are 
living better and doing better than 
we have ever done Before. I be- 
lieve more of us are sober, steady, 
and temperate ; more of us are faith- 
ful and are struggling to set good 
examples before the departments 
that are entrusted to our care. That 
is my observation in my traveling, 
and I believe it is the observation 
of my brethren who travel in all the 
stakes of Zion. I believe the same 
is true of our brethren abroad, in 
all the missionary fields. The reins 
are being held fairly close and safe, 
and our brethren are being better 
trained and are more faithful. The 
training and schooling they have at 
home has its influence upon them 
and is preparing them for the min- 
istry. We are in the ministry at 
home all the time; there is a field 
of labor on every hand. We need 
to have no trouble because we can- 
not go abroad. Some may be anx- 
ious to go abroad, and there is 
plenty of labor abroad. We will 
welcome all the brethren that can 
be furnished; we can employ all 
that the Bishops can send us. We 
can employ them all and give them 
plenty of opportunity abroad; and 
when that is done, and every man 
is satisfied with going into the field, 
we will have the greater army, the 
very great majority of all the priest- 
hood and of all the people here at 
home, in the home missionary field. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I want to exhort my brethren and 
sisters — not only the Bishops and 
the presiding brethren and leading 
sisters, not only the prominent men 
in official positions, and those in the 
quorums of the priesthood, — not on- 
ly them but every Latter-day Saint, 
is required to set a good example 
and preach the Gospel by example 
and precept. We are expected to 
use our tongues to talk, and we are 
to labor faithfully here at home, 
just as faithfully as though we 
were abroad, and our lives should be 
just as blameless here at home as 
would be possible if we were in the 
mission field. 

Every man who has received the 
priesthood has a mission and a min- 
istry to perform — from the last dea- 
con ordained to the first man who 
bears the priesthood and holds the 
most lofty position in the Church. 
It is just as necessary for the dea- 
con to be pure and upright, to per- 
form his duty and be active in his 
field of labor, under the direction of 
the Bishop who presides over him, 
as it is for the brethren who stand 
in responsible positions in wards, 
and stakes, and in the presiding 
quorums of the Church to perform 
the duties devolving upon them. It 
will take just as good living to save 
one of us as it will to save the 
Prophet. We must serve the Lord 
and honor Him ; we must be pure in 
our thoughts, in our words, in our 
conduct, and seek to be in commu- 
nion with Him and honor Him con- 
tinually. If men do that, they will 
have joy in this life. We will have 
a taste of heaven before we get 
there; in fact, we will have a little 
heaven here, — arid it is a good thing 
to have it commence here. If we 
get a little taste of it here, we will 
have a good deal of faith in the 



heaven of the future. I am pleased 
to say that we are surrounded with 
splendid material, splendid men, a 
splendid body of young men who 
are being developed and trained — 
those who go abroad and those who 
stay at home. Our organizations, 
our auxiliary associations, our edu- 
cational institutions of - higher learn- 
ing, and our splendid district 
schools. 

Great efforts are being made for 
the education of the people, and our 
opportunities are just as fine as can 
be found in any state surrounding 
us.; in fact, I think we average well 
with the United States in that re- 
gard, and we have as fine speci- 
mens of boys and girls as can be 
found; they are healthful, strong, 
and with good constitutions. If 
they are but taken care of and prop- 
erly trained, so that they will love 
literature, love to learn, love to la- 
bor — for it takes hard work and lots 
of it — they will become useful, up- 
right men and women. It takes 
hard study and application to pre- 
pare ourselves for the work we are 
expected to engage in. We must 
learn the Lord, and be acquainted 
with Him; to learn His Spirit, and 
know the operations thereof, that 
we may not be deceived by men, 
that we may not be deceived by spir- 
its that are abroad in the earth. 
The Lord is at hand, and ready to 
sustain us and to inspire us and 
qualify us for the responsibilities 
that rest upon us. 

I thank the Lord for the condi- 
tions that prevail today — the condi- 
tions that are right and pleasing and 
proper in His sight. There are con- 
ditions that we regret, of course, 
and I suppose there will be for a 
long time. I presume there are con- 
ditions that the Lord has always 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

regretted in fallen men; and He is 
anxious for their salvation, as we 
are anxious for the salvation of our 
own children. But' we have our 
agency, and, Latter-day Saints, if 
we examine ourselves, we will find 
that we have obtained the measure 
of faith according to the way we 
have devoted ourselves and exer- 
cised our agency in the service of 
the Lord. Our faith will grow with 
cultivation ; our love of literature, 
our love of learning, our love of 
intelligence, wisdom, judgment, 
morality, and purity, will all in- 
crease with cultivation. If we live 
as we ought to live, for a few 
years, it becomes easy for us to live 
a proper life and to crucify the ap- 
petites that have afflicted us and 
caused us trouble and sorrow ; and 
we are soon able to control our tem- 
pers, our passions, and every evil 
influence with which we are afflict- 
ed, and we can exercise such con- 
trol that we can require ourselves 
to do just exactly what is right, 
whether other people do as they 
ought or not. It is the duty of Lat- 
ter-day Saints to do what is right ; 
and the right will prevail. It will 
prevail with individuals ; it will pre- 
vail with the community; and it is 
found, I believe, quite generally 
with the majority of men and wom- 
en. They love the right, they love 
the truth — I believe. They are not 
always enlightened ; they do not al- 
ways comprehend the truth and un- 
derstand it ; they are not always ab- 
le to discern it and know it, but 
what they think is right and just 
and proper, I believe, prevails in 
the minds of the children of men. 
In fact, I believe that all men, as a 
rule, are more good than they are 
bad. I believe there is more good 
in man than there is wickedness, 



more righteousness, more of 'the 
love of truth and charity, justice 
and mercy. I believe these virtues 
prevail, in men quite generally ; yet 
there are very serious vices, no 
doubt, among people ; but, as a rule, 
I have faith in men, faith in hu- 
manity, and it gives me faith when 
I discover that the Lord has had 
faith in His children, and that it 
has been pretty well determined that 
not many of them shall be finally 
lost. We cross the track in our 
wandering, on our crooked way as 
we are traveling, but finally we will 
be brought back, and the Lord has 
declared unto us that very nearly all 
of His children will be saved. 
There are but few that will be ab- 
solutely lost, and that will go with 
the sons of perdition. Nearly all 
will be saved in some degree of 
glory and salvation, just accord- 
ing to what they have earned. That 
' is what we shall receive finally. 

The Lord has laid down His life 
and shed His blood and prepared 
the way for His people. He has 
done this for everybody — not for 
Latter-day Saints alone, but for 
every one of the children of God. 
There is not one born in the earth 
but what is entitled to receive and 
enjoy salvation, and the Lord will 
bless and redeem and save all that 
can be saved. As long as men will 
repent and reform and do better, 
the Lord will remember them; He 
will not forget them, and they will 
never be lost sight of; but, blessed, 
are they who seek the Lord early 
and walk uprightly before Him. 
As quoted by the President, this 
morning : "He that seeketh me ear- 
ly shall find me, and shall not be 
forsaken." That is the word of the 
Lord. What a fine thing it is when 
the boys and girls seek the Lord

early, and where they commence in 
early life to serve Him regularly. 
It comes so natural for them when 
they are taught by their parents and 
led by the example of their par- 
ents and the spirit of the Lord. For 
His Spirit is conferred upon them 
early in life; it is about the first 
thing they are entitled to receive — 
the Spirit of the Lord, at the hands 
of His servants, when they start 
life. Jesus Himself set this exam- 
ple, for in His day the little chil- 
dren were brought to Him, and He 
took them in His arms and blest 
them, that they should have favor 
and fellowship with the Lord, and 
receive His assistance in their in- 
fancy. He arranged to have them 
taken care of, that Satan should 
never be able to carry off little chil- 
dren, but that they should be pre- 
served and redeemed by His blood 
and offering. We must become like 
them ; we must be led by the Spirit ' 
of the Lord ; we must be entitled to 
forgiveness and have freedom from 
sin and transgression. We have a 
big struggle in this life, but our 
obligation and undertaking with the 
Lord has been to serve Him until 
the end of our mortal days. Let 
us try to do that, or, rather, let us 
do it ! Let us have faith that we 
can do it, and then there will be no 
serious difficulty, for it is easier and 
better to be saved than it is to be 
damned. Of course, it is a down- 
hill road, I suppose, to be damned ; 
and an up-hill road to be saved ; but 
it is easier and better to travel up- 
hill than down-hill in sin and trans- 
gression. Let us serve the Lord and 
honor Him ; let us set a good example 
to the world, that they may find 
among us the most temperate and 
practical people that there are to be 
found — in business matters, in spir- 



itual matters, in Church matters. Let 
us preach the Gospel to the world ; 
let us serve the Lord and live accord- 
ing to our professions. Let us keep 
the Sabbath day holy, and do all 
the things that He has commanded, 
that we may be entitled to enjoy 
from the Lord the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost. That is the exhortation that 
I feel to present to this great gath- 
ering of Latter-day Saints on this 
occasion. I believe it is good doc- 
trine for our friends as well. The 
way has been prepared, and the 
Lord has so arranged that all who 
serve Him and keep His command- 
ments shall know the doctrine. 
They shall see His face and know 
that He is. We shall all know the 
Father and the Son, thro'ugh our 
devotion and faithfulness to the end 
of this mortal life of ours. Let me 
so exhort you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and pray that God may bless 
and lead us gently in the ways of 
righteousness and truth. Let us 
sin no more, for it is not neces- 
sary, and it is quite possible for us 
to do just what is right. I trust 
we may do so and enjoy the out- 
pouring of the Spirit of the Lord 
abundantly, in all our labors and 
ministry at home and throughout 
the world, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

There, is a Latin proverb which 
says, that "the gods sell everything 
for work." In the instructions that 
were given us this morning, by our 
brethren of the First Presidency, 
the impression made upon my mind 
was that it is their desire that the 
Latter-day Saints should continue 
to be a people esteemed and hon- 
ored for their industry in the de- 
velopment and uplifting of the re- 
gion which they occupy. Realizing 
the necessity that exists everywhere 
in the world for the maintenance 
of employment, the opening up of 
industries, the establishment and 
building of homes, I felt, in listen- 
ing to the remarks that were made 
to us, that we should wisely and 
prudently look around upon the 
right hand and upon the left, in 
every section of the land we oc- 
cupy, and ask ourselves the ques- 
tion: Are we maintaining the 
standard that was set in the early 
commencement of our homes in this 
western land? We are not only 
anxious in regard to this problem of 
the maintenance within our borders 
of the evidences of industry, but 
also the changing of' the current 
from gathering, too largely, of the 
inhabitants of the land into the 
larger cities. It is a question that 
is deeply interesting thinking men 
everywhere within the confines of 
our great Republic. "Back to the 
farm !" is the cry that is emanating 
from the press, the pulpit, and from 
the lips of thoughtful and prudent 
statesmen wherever they congregate 
together. 

The recent gathering, . in the city 
of Chicago, of what is known as 
the National Farm Land Congress, 
presented this slogan, "Back to the 
Farm," with an appeal to residents 
in those great centers of popula- 



tion to make an effort to change 
the feeling and sentiment that has 
been established in the minds of 
thousands, that the only place to se- 
cure a home is within the confines 
of some great city. Every state that 
was represented in that congress — 
and there were many of them — 
came and presented . their claims, 
each showing that the particular 
section named was a fit and proper 
place to open up new homes, and 
secure opportunities for the estab- 
lishment of men and women upon 
the soil. While listening to the rea- 
sonings and arguments that were 
madS by representative men of 
every section of the land, I was very 
much pleased to hear them declare 
that within the confines of their 
states were most wonderful oppor- 
tunities. Some of them stated they 
had come from localities where 
there is an abundance of rainfall 
to produce crops, and some from 
sections that possess large oppor- 
tunities to secure ample water for 
irrigation. Some of the places 
were, indeed, described as veritable 
gardens of Eden, possessing every- 
thing that the heart could desire, 
as explained by the representatives 
of those sections of the country. 
The feeling and sentiment ex- 
pressed was that more thought 
should be given to this problem of 
the opening up of farms, and the 
leading of the people to believe that 
the opportunities for comfort and 
wealth are more largely in that di- 
rection than any other within the 
confines of the great Republic. 

We have ample opportunities 
within our own state of Utah, as 
well as the adjacent states, if we 
will but apply the spirit of industry 
and determination in working out 
these problems connected with the 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



building of new homes. People 
who crowd into cities and live in 
rented homes, who are subject to 
every little, change in the character 
of their employment, and who find 
themselves, in a great measure, the 
slaves of their fellow-men, can not 
be fully patriotic and devoted to 
their country. The man who lays 
his foundation upon the basis of the 
soil, builds *his home, increases its 
comforts, enlarges his acres, and in- 
creases the cattle, horses, and sheep 
necessary to stock his ' homestead 
properly, soon finds himself among 
the independent ones in the world. 
When the people of any nation' shall 
stay by its farms, maintain and de- 
velop them along proper lines, you 
will find in that nation the most pa- 
triotic, devoted, and earnest men 
that can be found anywhere in the 
world. There is a saying, that any 
man will defend his homestead with 
his gun, that would not stand by a 
boarding house to protect it with 
« his life. 

Looking into these matters, we 
should weigh them thoughtfully and 
prudently. Nearly every man un- 
der the sound of my voice is na- 
turally a statesman. You have had 
experience in the practical things 
of life. You have noted changes 
that have arisen in some of the 
neighborhoods with which you are 
acquainted. Boys have gradually 
drifted away; and' as you look- 
around among the homes of the 
people, you discover there has been 
little improvement in that home 
where, in former times, the father 
had established himself and made 
a nice little start in the world, to 
provide for the wants and needs of 
those that were dependent upon 
him. The boys have drifted away 
into other sections. The father has 



remained upon the little farm, but 
age has come upon him, and the 
ability to care for it, to cultivate it 
and make it support himself and 
any that might be dependent upon 
him, has in great measure passed 
away. The fences ai-p down ; there 
has been no paint upon the build- 
ings; the furnishings of the home 
are, in many instances, virtually 
broken in pieces. The spot that was 
sacred to the children, in their boy- 
hood and girlhood days, no longer 
possesses the attraction that was 
there when the little home was neat- 
ly painted, and when the furnish- 
ings therein, though they may have 
been of a cheap character, afforded 
comfort, and there was a degree of 
independence, and the spirit of lo've 
abode within that sacred citadel. 

My brethren and sisters, in the 
problems that confront us as a peo- 
ple, we should look to the main- 
tenance and beautifying of these 
growing villages as the best part of 
our land. I recognize the fact 
that young men are gradually drift- 
ing away from the land, and that 
the homes of the older ones are 
lacking that attention, care and 
thought that should be bestowed up- 
on them. I believe that, in most 
instances, these homes, under the 
guardianship of an active, earnest, 
industrious son, could be main- 
tained, and bring to him better re- 
sults than would come to him in his 
efforts in other places The spirit 
of restlessness, concerning which 
the President spoke to us this morn- 
ing, is very much to be regretted. 
I have found men in Mexico ; I have 
seen them subsequently in Arizona ; 
then I have met them in Colorado • 
I have been in their companionship 
in Wyoming ; and I have found them

in Canada. I have known them to 
leave Canada, afterward, and I 
have seen them in Oregon. A lit- 
tle later I have found them in north- 
ern California ; and later you would 
find them again on the borders of 
Mexico, in Arizona, wending their 
way back into that southern land. 
As suggested in the remarks of our 
President, this restless spirit, this 
feeling and sentiment should be dis- 
couraged, and we should restrain 
ourselves from this species of ac- 
tion. His remarks should make the 
deepest impression upon our minds. 

To the east of us, on the borders 
of Green River, is a section of coun- 
try as good as can be found any- 
where in the world. It has ample 
water, and after a few years of toil, 
sacrifice and struggle, the men who 
shall establish themselves there will 
find that they are in the line of in- 
dependence. To the south, to the 
north, to the west, and to the east 
of us are sections of country which, 
if properly developed and cultivat- 
ed, would soon make the men and 
women thus engaged independent 
in every sense of the word. 

My brothers and my sisters, I 
plead with you to keep in view this 
thought of the beautifying and 
maintenance of these homes, the 
building of other homes, holding 
our children, as far as it is possi- 
ble for us to do so, within the con- 
fines of our own section of coun- 
try. Let us impress upon their 
minds devotion, regard and love for 
that liberty, for the maintenance of 
that patriotism, that comes from a 
love of the soil, a love of the lib- 
erty that is enjoyed upon the soil, 
and the love that one can have in 
the companionship of the free men 
and the free women who live and 
labor thereon. God bless you. Amen.

Manufactures in Utah should be loyal- 
ly sustained, — Evidences of superi- 
ority of Utah-made woolen cloths. — 
Illustrations of financial advantages 
in purchasing home-made goods. — 
Three hundred and fifty factories in 
Utah prepared to supply demand. 

I have been very deeply interest- 
ed in the remarks that I have heard 
during this conference. I earnestly 
desire that the time I may occupy 
shall be for our mutual benefit. 

From my childhood, I have been 
interested in home manufactures, 
and I was very pleased with the re- 
marks of our President on this sub- 
ject. So far as I may have the abil- 
ity, I am anxious to make an im- 
pression upon the minds of my 
hearers today, that when they shall 
return home, from this conference, 
they will do so with a determina- 
tion that in the future they will be 
more loyal in sustaining and building 
up our manufacturing institutions 
than they have been in the past. From 
the time that I was a boy of six- 
teen, until the factory closed, with 
only two or three exceptions, I nev- 
er wore a suit of clothes that was 
not made of cloth manufactured at 
Provo. I purchased a suit, once, 
while in California for six months, 
as my clothes became the least lit- 
tle bit shabby. I paid more than 
twice as much for it as I would 
have paid for a Provo Woolen 
Mills suit, and I was ashamed of it 
at the end of four months, and gave 
it away. I have worn many a suit 



38 GENERAL C 

of Provo goods continuously for 
three years, barring the time that it 
was at the tailors, being cleaned and 
pressed, and then I did not wear it 
out, and it didn't get shiny either; 
but I can't get a suit of clothes to- 
day, for ten dollars a suit more than 
I used to pay for a Provo suit that 
does not shine and shine like every- 
thing in three months, instead of 
three years. I remember, when the 
Wyoming legislature was here, that 
I was wearing a light-colored suit. 
I happened to be a member of the 
Utah legislature, and they gave a 
ball in the theater ; so I had to buy 
a black suit, so as not to be the 
only "white sheep" in the crowd, 
at that ball. But I gave the suit 
away the next day, for fear I might 
want to preach home manufacture 
when I had it on, and that the chips 
would fly back in my own face. 
Subsequently, when in New York 
for over six months at one time, I 
bought a suit there ; but as that was 
in the panic of 1893, which wiped 
me off the earth, financially, I could 
not afford to give that suit away, so 
I wore it out. With these excep- 
tions, I wore nothing but Provo 
goods until the factory closed down. 

The way I figure, the wool that 
would have made a suit of clothes, 
if shipped out of our country, will 
bring back about one dollar to help 
enrich the community; but if that 
wool were put into cloth, and the 
cloth into a suit of clothes, at least 
twenty-five dollars of the value of 
that suit would remain here and 
would be received by somebody for 
labor or in the increased value. We 
are told that a dollar is to the world 
of finance what a drop of blood is 
to the body, — that it is the circulat- 
ing medium. I understand from 
doctors, that the heart handles about 



four ounces of blood every time it 
beats; that it beats seventy-eight 
times a minute, with the average 
individual — call it eighty, in order 
to make it easy, and we have twenty 
pounds of blood handled every min- 
ute, or practically every drop of 
blood in the body. Multiplying that 
by sixty, and then multiply it again 
by twenty-four. Of course, they 
say it does not beat quite so lively 
while you are asleep ; but it amounts 
to more than ten tons, every twenty- 
four hours ; and, yet, there is only 
twenty pounds of it. It is going 
and going, circulating and circu- 
lating. It is the same with money. 
Where the money goes out of a 
community, to import goods into 
that community, the circulating me- 
dium is weakened ; the life blood is 
taken away, and the community be- 
comes about as sickly as the indi- 
vidual would be if you should bleed 
him, and take half of his blood out 
of him. He would have a' pretty 
light color. 

Now, I remembe,r a story, and I 
have repeated it a number of times, 
because it hit me very hard. It was 
told by P)ishop George L. Farrell, 
then presiding at Smithfield. It 
was many years ago, and they were 
having quite a time boosting for 
home manufactures. A . meeting 
was held in the Assembly Hall, dur- 
ing conference, and Brother Farrell 
was called on for a speech. H^ 
fave the people to understand that 
he was very much like the rest of 
us — that of all his father's sons, he 
loved himself the best ; and he said 
one reason why he bought home- 
made goods was that he would like 
to keep the money here at home, 
so that he might get a chance to 
pick it up as it went moving around. 
He said that he had been coming

39 



down here to conference, twice a 
year, for twenty years ; and as east- 
ern capital owned the railroad, he 
wanted to know how much of the 
money he paid out for railroad tick- 
ets ever came back to him. So he 
marked the money every time he 
went to the depot to buy his tick- 
et, but never did a single railroad 
five dollars come back. But he al- 
so marked the money he paid for 
home-made goods; and every little 
while he would pick up some of the 
money and put it in his pocket. 
Then he said, "Just to give you an 
illustration — This very conference, 
when I was at the depot, I saw a 
man who had made some shoes for 
my children, and I paid him $5.00. 
The man who got the five dollars 
for these home-made shoes, handed 
it to. another man ; he handed it to 
another; he to another; and when 
the fourth man got it, he handed it 
back to me, and figuratively speak- 
ing, I put my home-made shoes back 
in my pocket. Now," he said, "that 
five dollar bill paid $25.00 worth of 
debts quicker than it takes me to tell 
you of it; but if I had bought im- 
ported goods, there would have been 
five of us looking for five dollars." 

I remember, on one occasion, go- 
ing to one of our merchants here in 
the city, trying to sell him a box 
of soap, and he said : "Oh, I make 
as much profit on the imported ar- 
ticle, and it is established; I don't 
have to talk to try to get rid of it ; 
and I don't care to buy your soap." 
"Well," I said, "you, undoubtedly, 
make the people pay you at least 
25 per cent profit, so I will just 
give you 25 per cent if you will buy 
my soap ; that is, I will take orders 
on" your store." Well, you know, 
he liked himself the best, and of 
course he wanted that 25 per cent, 



and so he was willing to help boost 
for home-manufacture. He would 
do it if he was paid for it; other- 
wise he would not. Now, I took the 
trouble to keep track of those or- 
ders that came to me — who got 
them, what they did with them, and 
then find out what that party did 
with them. By keeping track of 
these orders, we found they went 
through seven hands during the 
week, before they got into the mer- 
chant's till, — so they did one hun- 
dred per cent a day of work, and 
did enough in six days to be able 
to rest on Sunday. If the import- 
ed article had been purchased in- 
stead of the home-made article, sev- 
en hundred per cent of debts, in 
one week — equal to seven times the 
sum of the home-made goods 
bought — would not have been can- 
celled. 

The first money that I ever made 
I put into a vinegar factory, and 
lost it. Why? Because the peo- 
ple and the merchants would not 
patronize it. I remember I said to 
one' merchant, "I have had your 
vinegar analyzed by a chemist, and 
there is about one-quarter of it that 
is mineral — it is acetic acid — and 
you are burning people's insides up." 
He said, "It sells as well." (Laugh- 
ter). I said to him, "I will tell 
you what I will do, — I will sell you 
a barrel two-thirds full of vinegar, 
at a much less price than you are 
paying. Then you can go to the 
drug-store and for seventy-five 
cents you can buy that mineral pois- 
on and put it into the barrel; then 
fill it up with water." Oh, no, — ■ 
he would not do that; he thought 
that would be wrong; but he went 
on selling the stuff manufactured 
that way. I could not get the pat- 
ronage. The only people who pat- 



40 



"general conference. 



ronized the soap I made were the 
Chinamen; (laughter) they bought 
it almost exclusively; they discov- 
ered it was the best they could get 
in the city. There were, also, a few 
of the good sisters who patronized 
it. I know of one lady — I won't 
mention her name; but she is the 
wife of one of the general author- 
ities- — who is quite cranky on the 
question of having first class wash- 
ing in her house. She looks after it 
herself, and sees that the linen is in 
mighty good shape. She always 
believed in Bee Hive soap. 

The reason we closed up was be- 
cause the people would not patron- 
ize us, and I had about twenty 
thousand dollars to add to experi- 
ence on account of soap making. I 
have a bigger experience account 
than all the money I am worth ; and 
I have got a lot of this sad exper- 
ience in trying to build up and es- 
tablish home institutions and home 
manufacture. If I ever get any 
money I will put some of it into 
home manufacturing institutions 
again; and, perhaps, I will lose it. 
They say I am a crank on home 
manufacture. Perhaps I am, and 
I am proud of the appelation, if it 
means that I am an enthusiast in 
that direction. I do not believe 
we accomplish very much in life 
unless we are enthusiastic, unless 
we are in earnest, and unless we 
practice what we preach. James 
has written some things that have 
pleased me mighty well,, and one of 
them is that "faith without works is 
dead ;" and to preach home-manu- 
facture without buying the articles 
is just about as dead as faith with- 
out works. When a fellow is dead, 
why, he is in condition to be buried ; 
(laughter) that is the condition he 
is in; and when we preach to get 



others to sustain home institutions 
and fail to do it ourselves, as far 
as our usefulness in sustaining man- 
ufacture in the community is con- 
cerned, amounts to nothing. There 
are 350 factories in Utah, and they 
are manufacturing over 500 articles. 
I believe the great majority of the 
people do not know this, and they 
never ask the question, "Is this ar- 
ticle made at home? If not, have 
you one like it that is made at 
home?" If we would make up our 
minds to do this, it would make a 
wonderful change. I remember- 
years ago, that I used to write a 
very good hand, I used to teach pen- 
manship at the University of Des- 
eret ; and I found that the very best 
ink for fine writing, the best I could 
find in the city, was made by George 
Goddard. I went to nearly every 
merchant in Salt Lake and couldn't 
buy a bottle of Goddard's ink. They 
didn't have it; they said it would 
not sell; that it was not as good 
ink as some other. I said, "I know 
better; I am a judge." Well, I 
could not get it. and I had to go to 
Brother Goddard down in the 13th 
ward, to buy a bottle of his ink; 
and he had a cellar full of it. No- 
body would have it. "Well," I said, 
"we will create a demand for it;" 
and I said to every one of my stu- 
dents, "This is the best ink, you 
can write the best with it, and if 
you want to learn to write well, 
you must have good ink. Now, you 
go to all the merchants and ask for 
Goddard's ink;" and Goddard got 
a;> order from every merchant in 
town. (Laughter.) The merchants 
are in the business to sell their 
goods, and the reason they all want- 
ed Goddard's ink was that there 
were a hundred and odd boys and 
girls learning penmanship who 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 41 



asked for it. If people ask for a 
certain brand of goods, the mer- 
chant is going to keep it, so it all 
comes back to the people. If the 
people ask for home-made goods, 
they will get them, because what the 
people want is what the merchant 
has to sell. 

I went to the theater last night to 
see the last part of the performance, 
and the house was literally packed. 
I remember that when the grand 
opera was here, the house was not 
packed ; but the show last night sim- 
ply pleased the crowd. There was 
precious little to it — thin as air, lots 
of mighty poor things in it, some 
very suggestive things; there was 
certainly a lack of clothing, and a 
great many objectionable things; 
but that is what the people want to- 
day, and that is what the theatrical 
people are giving them. Therefore, 
the great artists are giving us the 
go-by. The Tabernacle Choir with 
Brother Ensign, Brother Crawford, 
Sister Lizzie Thomas-Edward, with 
some of the greatest artists in 
America, or with one of the great- 
est singers in all the world to come 
here and sing with them, can sing 
to empty benches; but if somebody 
will get up some kind of a skit, 
without much clothing for the wom- 
en to wear, and put it on the stage, 
it will draw a crowd. 

Now, I pray the Lord to bless us 
and give us the inspiration and the 
wisdom to ask for home-made 
goods and for first-class music, 
Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

The message which I bring, my 
brethren and sisters, to this confer- 



ence, from the elders and Saints of 
the great Northwest, is that the 
Lord has been good unto us during 
the past year, and that success' has 
attended our labors, in all depart- 
ments. Never before have we been 
able to reach so many people, nor 
have we had such opportunities to 
converse with them upon the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. Never before 
have we held so many meetings in 
any one year, nor have we baptized 
so many members into the Church; 
nor have we distributed so many 
tracts or sold so many books during 
any preceding year. In fact, the 
work in general has been eminently 
satisfactory to us, and I feel that we 
have enjoyed the approval of the 
Lord upon our labors. We have 
learned, as our fathers before us 
have, that there is something in this 
work that is real, that is tangible — 
something that can be actually dem- 
onstrated in the lives of those who 
keep the commandments of God. 
We know and understand some- 
thing of the powers that moved the 
early Elders of this Church to lay 
the foundations of this work, and in 
carrying it on successfully in the 
world in bringing the Saints to 
these valleys of the mountains and 
establishing them so well as they 
are situated here. 

We have learned that the great- 
est gift God has given to us, and, 
indeed, the greatest gift any of His 
children ever have or will enjoy, up- 
on this earth, is the companionship 
of the Holy Ghost. We have learned 
from contact with Him, from asso- 
ciation with Him, that real inspira- 
tion and real power are had in the * 
companionship of the Holy Ghost. 
We are sent forth to perform the 
ordinances of the Gospel, initiating 
men and women into this Church, 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



giving to them the promise — as the 
Lord gave it to His disciples before 
He left them, and as Peter repeat- 
ed this promise on the day of Pente- 
cost that unto all those who should 
receive the Gospel these blessings 
would be given. He was not fearful 
in making this promise ; neither 
have the brethren who have sent us 
forth to preach the Gospel been 
at all fearful as to whether or not 
the Lord would fulfil our promises 
and acknowledge the ordinances we 
have performed in His name. It is 
our testimony that God has remitted 
the sins of those who have gone into 
the waters of baptism, honestly con- 
fessing their sins and forsaking 
them. We have seen old men and 
women who have lived all their lives 
outside of a knowledge of the truth, 
being convinced of the error of 
their way and the necessity of seek- 
ing the Lord for a forgiveness of 
their sins. We have seen them come 
out of the waters of baptism with 
their countenances shining, and 
with a conscience clear before God ; 
and we have known that they had 
unloaded the weight of their sins, 
and that God had acknowledged 
the ordinances we performed in 
their behalf, that thereby their sins 
were remitted. We have also laid 
our hands upon their heads, and 
they have received the gift and 
power of the Holy Ghost. They tes- 
tify of it, and we have seen evi- 
dences of it in their lives, and we 
know it. It has been with us, in 
our labors, calling us sometimes in- 
to fields that we did not intend to 
enter; it has led us to the honest 
in heart where we never expected 
to find them. It has prepared the 
people for our coming, as it has 
done from the beginning of the his- 
tory of this Church. It is still 



operating as powerfully in behalf 
of the cause of Zion, in assist- 
ing the Elders in their ministry, as 
ever it has done during the days 
and years that have passed and 
gone. It is with the Saints today in 
our missionary field, and I am satis- 
fied it is with the great majority of 
the Saints at home. I repeat, again, 
that we have deemed it the greatest 
gift and blessing that God can be- 
stow upon us — -for what other thing 
can compare with it? In speaking 
of the forgiveness of sins, the Lord 
said that He would forgive all 
manner of sin,except the sin against 
the Holy Ghost; and, by reason of 
that, He has made the possession of 
that gift the choicest and the great- 
est of all the gifts that He bestows 
upon His children. Who of His 
children would not give all they 
possess for the companionship of a 
spirit to which they can turn and 
inquire as to what manner of life 
each ought to live ; how we should 
decide the questions of life that con- 
front us in religious matters? In 
material matters? Yes; for God 
gives that gift to men to be a com- 
forter and a guide to them in the 
material things of life; and if men 
enjoy it they will accept advice on 
material and spiritual things such 
as we have heard at this conference, 
and that Spirit will bear testimony 
to our souls that that which has 
been spoken is true, and there will 
be a desire in our hearts to follow 
it to the letter. So I have experi- 
enced, in my own life, as many of 
you have, that the inspiration of 
God can direct a man in his farm 
labors, in his mercantile labors, and 
in everything that pertains to him. 
No man or woman should engage 
in any business of such a character 
that they cannot feel that they are 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



43 



entitled to the companionship of 
the Holy Ghost to direct them in 
their labors. 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
that many whom we baptize in the 
world, like some of you here, do 
not at once experience the gifts of 
the Spirit. It will come slowly; it 
will manifest itself, at first, in a 
peaceful, inward burning, but in 
time, if heeded, will become a well 
of revelation and light in our souls, 
leading us to understand the truth 
and know the will and purpose of 
God. I remember, on entering a 
carpet factory, I first saw the back 
of the carpet. I went around to 
the other side; the carpet was the 
same but the appearance was dif- 
ferent. On this side was the design, 
the color, and flower, all being 
worked out, and produced by the 
same method of operation. We 
have often looked upon things 
from the reverse side. We have 
not understood God's dealings with 
us as individuals, nor with His 
Church, nor with the affairs of the 
world ; but when we possess the 
key — the gift and power of the 
Holy Ghost, that searches all things, 
that takes of the things of the 
Father and reveals them to us, and 
enables us to unlock the apparent 
mysteries that surround us — we 
shall look upon the design of our 
lives, the design God has concern- 
ing us, concerning His Church, and 
concerning the nations of the earth. 
We shall, thereby, be led to put our- 
selves in harmony with His great 
designs. 

I want to say that Zion, looking 
upon her from the design side, 
where God is shaping her destiny, is 
beautiful to me. No soul needs to 
fear; no heart to quail as to what 
the outcome shall be. God has de- 



creed and designed her purpose, her 
mission, and no hand can sway nor 
turn her from the purpose and 
course that God has fixed for her. 
Let no heart fear, but let there be 
full and absolute confidence in the 
fact that God has taken care of the 
work up to this present time; and 
He will continue to take care of it. 
The thing for us to worry about is 
whether or not we are growing in 
the gifts of the Gospel. That con- 
cerns us most, what are we doing 
individually? Is there a growth 
within my soul ? Am I overcoming, 
through the use of these gifts, the 
weaknesses of the flesh? Am I 
adding to my faith, virtue, and to 
virtue, knowledge ; and to knowl- 
edge, temperance and patience, 
godliness and brotherly kindness? 
These are the fruits of this gift. 
We must not stop after we have 
been baptized and had hands laid 
upon us, we must grow. There 
should always be some growth, and 
that can come only through the ex- 
ercise of our spirituality, listening 
to the Voice, following its inspira- 
tion, and it will become stronger 
and more powerful day by day. If 
I turn a deaf ear to it, I shall find 
that it will soon leave me ; it will 
not abide with me, nor be the com- 
forter, or adviser, or companion 
that if otherwise would be, and that 
I should have. When it does go, 
how lonely, how sad is the heart ! 
Have you for the moment lost it? 
Did you not feel a loneliness, an 
absence, so that you could not feel 
satisfied to live upon the earth un- 
less you could get it back? And 
in sackcloth and ashes, as it were, 
you have sought for that compan- 
ionship, and when it returns — what 
a comforter to the soul that pos- 
sesses it! It is not always given 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that we shall hear the voice speak- 
ing loudly within, or receive the 
revelations of God through this gift 
and power, in an audible way, but it 
is possible for every Latter-day 
Saint to be guided and influenced 
in his or her life by the Holy Ghost. 

There is one key that I am going 
to refer to, that gives this assurance 
— that every Saint, no matter how 
weak, can understand and know the 
operations of this Spirit. I read 
that when Oliver Cowdery was try- 
ing to translate the Book of Mor- 
mon, that he began very well, and 
finally everything was darkened. He 
wanted the Prophet. Joseph to in- 
quire why it was that he failed, and 
the answer was: 

"Behold, it is because that you did 
not continue as you commenced, 
when you began to translate, that I 
have taken away this privilege from 
you. 

"Do not murmur, my son, for it is 
wisdom in me that I have dealt with 
you after this manner. 

"Behold, you have not understood; 
you have supposed that I would give 
it unto you, when you took no thought 
save that it was to ask me;" [How 
many of us ask the Lord for a bless- 
ing, and think that ends our part, and 
that our responsibility ceases there, 
and that He is to blame if we do not 
get the thing for which we ask. Here 
the Lord says, in substance, You have 
thought that all that was necessary 
was to ask me.] 

"But, behold, I say unto you, that 
you must study it out in your mind; 
then you must ask me if it be right, 
and if it is right I will cause that your 
bosom shall burn within you; there- 
fore, you shall feel that it is right; 

"But if it be not right, you shall 
have no such feelings, but you shall 
have a stupor of thought, that shall 
cause you to forget the thing which 
is wrong: therefore you cannot write 
that which is sacred, save it be given 
you from me." 

Is there any Saint but that can 



comply with this key and require- 
ment? Is there a question that the 
boy or the girl, or the man or wom- 
an wants to decide? Then there is 
an opportunity for them to enjoy 
the companionship of this Spirit. It 
was given to us for a blessing, an 
earthly, temporal blessing, as well 
as to promote spiritual growth, to 
preserve us from errors, from dis- 
appointments, from the traps and 
snares of the adversary. It is your 
privilege to enjoy the companion- 
ship of this gift in all things about 
which you have any doubt and un- 
certainty. Is it the girl who has to 
answer the question that is pro- 
pounded by the young man who de- 
sires that she shall become his wife ? 
She should not answer it until she 
has received a testimony, a knowl- 
edge concerning it, through the 
gift and power of the Holy Ghost 
unto her soul, that ministers to her 
this satisfaction as she presents 
herself before the Lord, having 
studied it out with all of her pow- 
ers and ability ; then it will give to 
her the inspiration necessary to en- 
able her to properly decide and an- 
swer the question. So with every 
man in his business. Every man, 
in all his walks in life, ought to be 
perfectly willing to seek with im- 
plicit confidence to obtain the inspir- 
ation of that Spirit. If the thing 
which you have studied out, and 
used all your powers and energies 
to decide and determine, is not 
right, then the Lord, by this Spirit, 
shall cause it to pass away from 
you, and you shall not feel satisfied 
with the conclusion you may have 
reached in the matter; but if it is 
right, then your soul shall burn 
within you. I know that men and 
women can be guided by this key ; 
and, if they do so, it shall grow and 
increase with them until it shall be

a voice speaking within them so dis- 
tinctly that there shall be no ques- 
tion or doubt. This has been 
proven by thousands of Latter-day 
Saints. It gives men the knowledge 
that God lives. 

Our scriptures say that no man 
can know that Jesus is the Christ 
save by the Holy Ghost. I haven't 
seen Him, but I know, within my 
heart and in my soul, as I live and 
stand before you today, that Jesus 
Christ is the Son of God, the Savior 
of the world. When I shall stand 
before Him, in His presence, and 
see Him face to face as He is, I 
shall not know any better the truth 
that He is the Christ, and that He 
lives, than I do today by the wit- 
ness and testimony of the Spirit of 
God in my heart and soul. By that 
same power I know that this is 
God's work, that Joseph Smith was 
His prophet, and that the leaders of 
this Church today enjoy the reve- 
lation and the inspiration of God, 
that they are His prophets, that 
they stand in the right way, and 
that no power can destroy this 
work. God speed its progress in 
the nations of the earth, in the mis- 
sions ; and at home may there be a 
greater and mightier . spiritual 
growth and development that shall 
preserve us from all errors. May 
it continue to guide us in all our 
ministrations, in directing our faith 
and works, in the exercise of the 
priesthood, that we may not be hu- 
miliated, but that we may always 
be guided by the inspiration of this 
comforter. I thank God for it. May 
it always be with me, and with 
you, and with all the Saints of God, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Suggestion to those who desire an- 
swers to queries or problems. 

Circumstances are favorable to 
the remark I desire to make, that 
the Presidency and a number of the 
Apostles are beset, continually, with 
letters of inquiry, asking questions 
about almost numberless and name- 
less subjects. On one occasion, 
haying been importuned by a young 
man who was almost a professional 
questioner, and having submitted to 
his queries, continuously, for a num- 
ber of months, I came to the con- 
clusion that I would make this prop- 
osition to him, and I think it a good ' 
one to make here, because it is not 
always the Bishops, or the Bishops' 
Counselors, or the Presidents of 
stakes who are asking questions of 
us, and who are submitting wonder- 
ful problems for us to solve ; but 
many of the Latter-day Saints are 
doing the same thing, also a num- 
ber who are not Latter-day Saints. 
My proposition was this, and I re- 
peat it to the Bishops and Presi- 
dents and to the Latter-day Saints 
everywhere : If you have a ques- 
tion to ask, or some problem that 
you are not sure you are able to 
solve, I would suggest to you that 
y6u figure it out yourselves and 
reach 'the very best conclusion that 
you can of the matter ; and then, if 
you are still not quite satisfied with 
it, and you cannot get sufficient of 
the Spirit of the Lord to reveal to 
you the absolute truth, as to whether 
you are right or wrong, just submit 
to us your conclusion, and we think 
we can answer that a good deal eas- 
ier and quicker than we can solve 
your questions in the way they are 
generally put to us.

ELDER DAVID H. CANNON. 

(President of St. George Temple.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that in the effort I may put forth in 
attempting to address you this af- 
ternoon.we may be mutually blessed 
with a rich outpouring of the Spirit 
of God, for by and with his aid I 
may be able to say something that 
will be mutually beneficial to the 
speaker and the hearers. 

The Gospel with which we have 
become identified is the power of 
God unto salvation to every human 
being who will adopt its principles, 
and conform their lives to its re- 
quirements. For this purpose -the 
Elders of the Church have left their 
homes, and traversed sea and land 



in order to reach the people with 
their message of salvation that the 
Lord has committed to us. Wher- 
ever mankind has been greeted with 
the sound of the everlasting Gospel, 
they have been called upon to repent 
of their sins and turn from the error 
of their ways. Where they have 
done so in faith, nothing doubting, 
the Spirit of God has carried con- 
viction to their hearts. On render- 
ing obedience to the requirements 
of the Gospel, we do not expect a 
complete understanding of it will 
come to us at once, but we will re- 
ceive a little here and a little there 
until our minds are fully satisfied 
in relation to the matter. But a 
testimony of the truth of it is car- 
ried to our hearts when we hear it. 

I remember hearing a man give 
his experience in regard to the tes- 
timony of the truth which he had 
received. He was traveling, and 
had stopped at a hotel where an 
Elder of the Church had engaged 
to speak, in that hotel, that night. 
This man was sitting in the room ; 
and as soon as the Elder began to 
spread out his books, prepared to 
address the people, the Spirit of 
the Lord bore testimony to him, be- 
fore the Elder had opened his 
mouth, that that man was a servant 
of God, and that the message that 
he bore was the truth, was the ever- 
lasting Gospel. The brother that 
bore this testimony lived to an ex- 
ceedingly ripe age, and never lost 
that testimony. When we arise in 
the morning, if we are up early 
enough, we see the morning star, 
and after a little while see a little 
streak of light, showing that day 
is dawning; and as we remain and 
watch it we see it increase until 
light fills the earth, and the sun in 
its magnificence comes forth, cast- 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



47 



ing its rays upon the face of the 
earth. It is just so in relation to 
this Gospel that we have received. 
We receive a little light here, and 
we render obedience to its require- 
ments, repenting of our sins, man- 
ifesting our faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, going down and being bap- 
tized for the remission of our sins ; 
then receive the imposition of the 
hands of the servants of God for 
the reception of the Holy Ghost, 
which begins to open our under- 
standings. As we conform to the 
laws that the Lord has revealed 
for the guidance of His people, the 
light increases in our minds until 
we have received a fullness, and 
the hope of eternal life has become 
so strong in our hearts that we can 
withstand anything, and our testi- 
mony remains undimmed. 

I bear testimony to the people 
here assembled that I know the 
Gospel to be true. Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God, and so have 
been the various servants of 
the Lord who have presided 
over the Church from the 
days of the Prophet Joseph until 
the present time. They have been 
legally called to those positions, and 
have been the right men in the right 
place to direct the affairs of this 
Church. This work has only just 
fairly begun, although this is the 
eightieth . year since the organiza- 
tion of the Church. Its destiny has 
only fairly begun in the midst of 
the nations ; eventually every knee 
must bow and every tongue con- 
fess that Jesus is the Christ to the 
honor and glory of God. 

I do not desire to occupy more 
of your time, but merely add that 
I rejoice in this conference. The 
more I become familiar with them, 
the more beauty I can see in the 



principles of the Gospel. As we be- 
come conversant with them, we will 
find that they are applicable to every 
condition of life. No condition can 
be found in which .a person will not 
find these principles applicable. 
, May the Lord bless His people, 
and prosper His work. May He 
comfort the minds of His Saints 
under the bereavement that has just 
come upon them in the death of 
our beloved President John R. 
Winder. May we live and see Zi- 
on progress and prosper in the 
earth, the power of evil be done 
away, and righteousness fill the 
earth as the waters fill the mighty 
deep; through Jesus Christ. Amen.' 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 

(President .of Granite Stake.) 

' I pray, my brethren and sisters, 
that I may enjoy the good spirit 
that actuated Brother David H. 
Cannon in his remarks to you this 
afternoon. 

I was very much interested this 
morning in the theme and remarks 
of President Smith, in our morning 
session of conference at the Taber- 
nacle, and I feel the importance of 
them. Not only in the line that we 
will be blessed in dollars and cents, 
with better habitations, more com- 
forts in our homes, by the observ- 
ance, of his admonitions, but that 
we will get a little closer to our 
boys and our girls, and instil into 
them the principles of faith. I have 
always been impressed with some of 
the methods of the Patriarchs of 
old in keeping their household and 
families around them. It seems to 
me as Latter-day Saints that we 
ought to be anxious, particularly as 



43 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to the employment of onr own fam- 
ilies. So in the theme of more in- 
tense cultivation of our farms, bet- 
ter regulations in regard to our 
horticultural interests, etc., these 
things are of vital importance. I 
believe that there are few farms 
in this intermountain country which 
would not produce a much larger 
percentage in cereals, and other 
crops to which they are adapted, if 
we would only apply energy, in- 
telligence and care in the manipula- 
tion of the same, to the end that 
instead of our boys going to' other 
countries and places to secure em- 
ployment, or to get new farms, they 
could remain and be employed in 
our midst. I have always felt that 
there are few large farms in this 
country but what, if they were cut 
up, and our boys were to go to some 
of our agricultural colleges and 
familiarize themselves with better 
cultivation of the soil, that we 
would find plenty of room on our 
farms to accommodate the boys 
without their having to go to some 
other place. It is the duty of a father 
in Israel to look out for the em- 
ployment of his boys, and also of 
his girls, that they may not need 
to go away from their own fire- 
sides and home associations for em- 
ployment. It is a splendid propo- 
sition for the fathers to divide up 
their farms with their boys, help 
them to get a home on their own 
places, and apply themselves to the 
more intense cultivation of the land ; 
thus occupy their boys and keep 
them near, instead of having them 
scatter over the country. It would 
also be profitable for them to do it. 

I have been thinking of these 
matters recently in relation to our 
community, as to how we can bet- 
ter employ our )'Oung people, and 



keep them at home, and on inquiry 
I find that we have men who are 
getting along splendidly in a finan- 
cial way on small tracts of land, who 
are intensely and intelligently culti- 
vating the soil as truck gardens, and 
they are becoming; well off, they are 
giving employment not only to their 
own families but to others in their 
neighborhood who are in need of it. 
I also find that we have people who 
are intelligently cultivating the soil 
on the best lines of our horticultural 
interests, developing their places to 
the end that their own children do 
not have to go elsewhere to find 
employment. They are building oth- 
er homes around the old homestead, 
and they thus keep their boys and 
girls near them. It is right that 
we should have them with us, and 
that we should give employment,not 
only to our own, but, if we have the 
means and ability, we should fur- 
nish employment to as many of our 
neighbors as possible, so that they 
also need not have to go to other 
localities to find work. It has al- 
ways been a source of regret to me 
to think that in this agricultural 
country, where we have the best 
fruit-raising districts in the United 
States, that many of our' boys have 
to go to smelter and mining towns 
and other places to find employ- 
ment, when there are so many op- 
portunities at our own door. 

I was recently talking with a man 
who had rented some land, in fact 
some from myself. He had not had 
any experience in agriculture be- 
fore coming to this country, but he 
saw there was an opportunity for 
him to get along well in that line, 
and he now cultivates the soil in- 
telligently and intensely, with the 
result that he is one of the largest 
tithe payers in the ward where he

lives, and he has been in this coun- 
try only a little while. He not only 
gives every one of his own family 
employment, but a number of other 
people besides. He said to me the 
other day, L could use hundreds of 
the young people if they would only 
follow in this line. They could have 
profitable employment where they 
could be near home, and they would 
not have to be seeking places else- 
where, providing they would take 
my advice, cultivate the soil where 
they are living. I think we ought 
to take advantage of this idea. 
Where any part of our land is 
adapted to a certain crop, we ought 
to cultivate that portion to that 
crop, we should thus cultivate each 
part of our farms and apply them 
to that for which they are best 
adapted. If it is better adapted 
for fruit, plant fruit trees; if 
it is better for truck gardening, 
use our land for that purpose ; if for 
wheat, grow wheat; whatever it is 
we ought to cultivate it in the best 
manner possible, so as to make it 
produce abundantly and give em- 
ployment to our own people near 
our own homes. 

It is wrong in the sight of God 
to have our boys or girls going 
here and there and everywhere for 
employment. We ought to keep 
them under our own roof, or near 
our own fireside, where we can 
teach them the principles of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Not only would this matter, as Pres- 
ident Smith suggested this morning, 
be a great blessing to us in a tem- 
poral way, but it would be a won- 
derful blessing to us in a spiritual 
way. One of the things wherein 
we are lacking as Latter-day Saints 
is, that we do not get close enough 
to our boys. There are not enough 
fathers that work along side by side 



with their boys. They do not know 
enough as to their faith, their habits 
and their conduct. They trust too 
much to them, and let them go here 
and there and everywhere instead 
of having them around them. 

One of the important duties of 
Latter-day Saints is that they 
should teach their own children the 
principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I regret to say that too 
many of us leave it to the quorums 
of the Priesthood, and to the aux- 
iliary organizations, to teach our 
boys the principles of the everlast- 
ing Gospel, when as fathers and 
mothers we ought to have them 
around us, teaching them ourselves. 
I believe that the responsibility, the 
great responsibility, of a father and 
a mother is that they shall rear 
their boys and girls in the love of 
the Lord our God, and with an un- 
derstanding of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and we ought 
to spend more time with them. I 
believe that as fathers, we should 
be companions to our 'boys, and 
get closer to them. There ought to 
be the closest and the kindest friend- 
ship and love and companionship 
existing between father and son and 
mother and daughter, and between 
father and daughter, and mother 
and son. One of the ways that we 
could accomplish this, and get close 
to them, is to gather our boys and 
girls around us by the hearthstone, 
and teach them the principles of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; 
teach them from the standard 
Church works and other good 
books, and be teachers to our boys 
and girls in pure love according 
to the relation that we bear to them, 
and thus they may be to us a great 
treasure and blessing, and we may 
feel that we are doing our duty to 
them, and carrying out what the 



i 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Gospel teaches us. I tell 'you. it is 
a mighty pleasant thing to know 
that our boys have faith in this Gos- 
pel, to feel confident that our girls 
also have faith in the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and that 
they are clean, sweet, and pure. 
The main responsibility that they 
become so rests upon the fathers 
and mothers. When we neglect this 
we do not do our part. We have 
no right to presume upon the Bish- 
op to take care of our boys or girls, 
or upon the Priesthood, or on the 
auxiliary organizations. They are 
doing their part, and doing it splen- 
didly, nobly and well ; but the great 
responsibility of all rests upon us, 
that we should take hold of them 
and rear them in the fear of the 
Lord, that they may keep His com- 
mandments and do that which is 
right, so that when we get older we 
can look around and point to every 
one of them and say that they are 
good, clean and sweet, and that they 
love the Lord and keep His com- 
mandments. Without this condition 
there cannot be much happiness in 
any home. I do not care what your 
surroundings may be ; I do not care 
how palatial your residence may 
be, or how ample your bank ac- 
count, or what your social standing 
may be ; I tell you you cannot have 
much happiness in this world if you 
have one of your boys or girls go- 
ing astray. I would rather have a 
log cabin with all my little ones 
around me, loving the Lord and 
keeping His commandments, than 
to be in a palace with one of them 
not there. I repeat, I think the re- 
marks of President Smith this 
morning relative to not going here 
and there and everywhere are very 
pertinent to us as Latter-day Saints ; 
and if we want to keep our boys and 
g ; rls with us, we should divide up 



the farm if necessary; divide up 
our business, if necessary. Let us 
have our boys and our girls under 
our own wing. 

I feel that it would not be right 
ior me to continue my remarks. I 
am delighted with the Gospel of the 
I ord Jesus Christ. It brings peace 
to me. I know it is true. I know 
ihat Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, and I want to live a life that 
I can always have this testimony 
with me. I hope that every one that 
belongs to me will continue to love 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments. May the Lord abide with 
you in your homes, and bless all that 
appertains unto you ; I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Winifred Smith sang a so- 
prano solo, "Hark ye, O Israel." 



ELDER RODNEY C. BADGER. 

(Of Salt Lake Stake High Priests.) 

I have been very much interested 
and instructed by the remarks of the 
brethren who have addressed us. I 
rejoice exceedingly in their testi- 
monies in regard to the truth of the 
work that we are engaged in, be- 
cause it corresponds with my testi- 
mony. The ideas that they have ex- 
pressed correspond with my ideas, 
and it is a satisfaction to every one 
to feel that they are in harmony 
with those who know that this work 
is true, and that we are engaged in 
the work of the Lord. 

I know of no other people who 
take as large a view of the Gospel, 
and that which the world calls re- 
ligion, as do the Latter-day Saints. 
We believe that we ought to be in 
harmony with the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ all the time. We 



ELDER RODNEY C. BADGER. 



believe that if we are not in har- 
mony with the Spirit of the Lord 
all the time, there is something lack- 
ing, or something we have left un- 
done. I do not know how it is with 
others, but with myself I find there 
are times when I feel that I am no* 
altogether in the way that I should 
be ; but I. am striving constantly to 
place myself in the position of a 
saint, that I may enjoy the spirit of 
the Gospel, because I have tasted its 
influence and found that it brings 
happiness and peace. 

* In our conferences, especially in 
our general conferences, when we 
meet three or four days successively, 
we have a wide variety of instruc- 
tion, pertaining to our welfare, and 
not only to our individual welfare 
but also to that of our fathers and 
mothers, and of our children and 
our children's children. The Gos- 
pel is so broad and so strong that 
it will reach every individual that 
has ever lived upon the face of the 
earth. All men, whether they live 
in this age of the world or not, will 
have the privilege of receiving or 
rejecting the principles of truth and 
salvation. The great responsibility 
that has been placed upon us is that 
we live in accord with this broad 
scheme of salvation that has been 
delivered to the children of men. 
The Lord announced in the begin- 
ning of this work that He was about 
to establish a marvelous work and 
a wonder. The further we go, and 
the more insight we have into the 
work, the more we wonder at the 
broadness and depth of the Gospel, 
the importance of the labor that has 
been assigned unto us, and realize 
the character of men and women 
that we ought to be, in order that 
we may meet the requirements of 
the Lord in this regard. 

I wonder at the actions of men. 



and sometimes I wonder at my own 
actions, weaknesses, failings, and in- 
ability to stand as firm and as 
square as I ought to stand. I was 
born and reared, and educated in 
the Church, and ani still learning; 
as Brother Cannon has said, here a 
little and there a little. I find that 
the more truth I learn the more 
firmly my conviction becomes fixed 
that the Lord is directing the 
work, and is at the head of this or- 
ganization; and that it is necessary 
for each individual to have a testi- 
mony of the Gospel. 

We are getting to be a numerous 
people. We are spreading out and 
scattering abroad, and building up 
the waste places of the earth. Our 
fame has gone out all over the world 
as colonizers, as a people that are 
undaunted in their colonization of 
countries, and especially of desert 
countries. They say, "The Mor- 
mons are not afraid of any proposi- 
tion ; they take hold of the most dis- 
couraging conditions, and make a 
success of them." 

Many people who are prejudiced 
against us say that we are serfs 
and follow our leaders, who are 
shrewd, keen men. Would to God 
that we did -follow them closer than 
we do. As I said, we are scattering 
abroad. We do not get together as 
closely as we used to. I remember 
the time when this assembly hall 
-would hold all that were in Salt 
Lake City,and it doesn't seem so very 
long to me either. We could all hear 
the voice of the prophets every few 
days, or every week or two, and we 
were constantly under their instruc- 
tion. But it is not so today ; we are 
scattered abroad. If some of the 
people hear the voice of an apostle 
once or twice a year, they consider 
themselves very fortunate indeed. 
Therefore, the more necessity there 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is for us to live near unto God, that 
we may understand the Spirit of the 
Lord, which is the Spirit of the 
Gospel, that we may receive that 
light, knowledge, and understand- 
ing that is necessary for us in or- 
der that we may stand alone in the 
world, if needs be, and declare the 
truth of the Gospel without fear of 
contradiction. We should know 
assuredly and positively that this is 
the work of the Lord, that He has 
established it upon the earth, and 
that it shall remain forever. It 
shall remain upon the earth until the 
purposes of God are accomplished, 
until our Savior shall come and 
reign upon the earth. We ought to 
know these things, and the time is 
coming when we must depend, not 
altogether upon the voice of an 
apostle, or the presidency, because 
we do not hear them often enough ; 
but we must depend upon the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of the Lord 
unto us, and that Spirit will not 
lead us astray. That Spirit will 
lead us into all truth. 

A marvel has come to pass in the 
earth. Men and women are 
brought from all nations, not being 
able to understand each other's 
language, yet they all comprehend 
alike; they have accepted the same 
Gospel and the same Spirit is their 
instructor. There never was' and 
perhaps never will be a parallel to 
the wonderful work that the Lord 
has done. I rejoice in this work. 
I rejoice in the small service that 
I am able to render. I rejoice in 
the testimony of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. I rejoice in the associa- 
tion of my brethren and sisters, and 
in listening to their testimony. I 
rejoice in all these things, and no 
doubt we all do. May the blessings 
of the Lord be with us, and His 
Spirit be upon us, that we may 



eternally serve God and keep His 
commandments, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

M 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

To begin with, I came to this 
meeting prepared to speak, expect- 
ing to speak; and came provided 
with some information. Having 
done my part, the rest depends upon 
the Lord, and His Spirit, and the 
attention that I receive from the 
people. 

They say, we ought to have three 
kinds of speakers : One on pre- 
misement, one on argument and one 
on arousement. Now, I have been 
on "arousement," for a great many 
years, and- 1 am going to abandon 
that field, I am going to premise 
from now on. I am going to stake 
myself out, and I don't need any- 
body else to try to stake me out as 
to public speaking. It is my inten- 
tion to keep within the bounds of 
reason and consistence. In coming 
to you, good people, today, I do so 
as one having authority. I hold 
the holy Priesthood; I am a Sev- 
enty ; not an apostle, but a Seventy, 
At no time have I ever presumed to 
take the place of an apostle, and I 
do not think for one moment that I 
have the authority 'to instruct the 
people as an apostle would, but as 
one of the representatives of the. 
First Council of Seventv. By the 
way, God gave the First Council a 
place in His Church, and I know 
what that place is, I have studied it 
out. It is in your power to vote 
every one of the First Council out, 
when their names are presented by 
those having authority; this is the 
right time and place to vote any 
men out, if you cannot sustain them.

It is my desire to read to you; 
and it is going to take me a little 
time, because, as I said in the be- 
ginning, I have staked myself out. 
It will take me about eight minutes, 
and that is time enough to put about 
one half of you people asleep. I 
have discovered that some people 
are not good listeners, especially if 
they are not interested. I don't 
know whether I can interest you or 
not, but I am going to try, with 
the help of the Lord. I have a 
theme. This is something I hardly 
ever have. I never took a text in 
my life and stuck to it. This may- 
be an occasion of that kind ; but I 
am willing to say anything the Lord 
wants me to say, and I don't care 
what it costs. I have never been 
afraid of the children of men when 
I had the Spirit of God. I never 
was afraid of a mob in the Southern 
States when I had the Spirit of 
God, but I was scared pretty nearly 
to death after the Spirit left. It 
takes lots of courage to say always 
what you think. The trouble is, 
we think things sometimes we ought 
not to say. 

I will read a portion of the 43rd 
Section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, being a revelation given 
through Joseph, the Seer, at Kirt- 
land, Ohio, February, 1831. 

"O hearken.ye Elders of my Church, 
and give an ear to the words which I 
shall speak unto you; for behold, ver- 
ily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have 
received a commandment for a law 
unto my Church, through him whom I 
have appointed unto you to receive 
commandments, and revelations from 
my hand. And this ye shall know as- 
suredly that there is none other ap- 
pointed unto you, to receive command- 
ments and revelations until he be tak- 
en, if he abide in me. But verily, ver- 
ily, I say unto you, that none else 
shall be appointed unto this gift ex- 
cept it be through him, for if it be 



taken from him he shall not have pow- 
er except to appoint another in his 
stead. 

"And this shall be a law unto you, 
that ye receive not the teachings of 
any that shall come before you as rev- 
elations or commandments; and this I 
give unto you that you may not be 
deceived, that you may know they are 
not of me." 

The rest of my theme is contained 
in the documents in my pocket; it 
is revelation. I desire to talk to the 
people on revelation. The Seventies 
have been studying revelation, and 
I have condensed the lessons. It is 
not original ; I never read anything 
that is. 

"What is the definition of revela- 
tion?" "Revelation is the name of 
that act by which God makes com- 
munication to men." How was rev- 
elation received in this dispensa- 
tion? My intention is to compare 
notes and see how we conform to 
the old methods of the prophets 
in receiving revelation. That is, in 
what manner was revelation re- 
ceived ? The Prophet Joseph Smith 
received revelations in every way 
that the Lord communicates His 
mind and will to man. Like Moses, 
he knew the Lord face to face, stood 
in His very presence and heard His 
voice, as in the first communication 
the Lord made to him, usually 
called the Prophet's First Vision, as 
also in the vision given in the Kirt- 
land Temple, where he and Oliver 
Cowdery saw the Lord standing on 
the breastwork of the pulpit, and 
heard Him speak to them. He re- 
ceived communications from an- 
gels, as in the case of Moroni, who 
revealed to him the Book of Mor- 
mon ; John the Baptist, who re- 
stored the Aaronic Priesthood ; and 
Peter, James and John who restored 
the Melchizedek Priesthood. Also 
the communications from angels, 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mentioned in what is usually called 
the Kirtland Temple Vision. See 
Doc. and Cov. Sec. 110. He re- 
ceived communications through the 
Urim and Thummim, for by that 
means he translated the Book of 
Mormon, and received a number of 
the revelations contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants; among 
others, sections 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 
16, 17. He received divine intelli- 
gence by open visions, such as is 
contained in sections 76, and 107. 
*Lle also received revelations 
through the inspiration of Gojd op- 
erating upon his mind ; and, indeed, 
the larger number of the revelations 
in the Doctrine and Covenants were 
received in this manner. Now then, 
how did they receive them in the 
days of the Bible ? The world is so 
bitterly opposed to revelation, let us 
compare notes and we will see that 
the divers manners in which reve- 
lations were given in ancient times, 
and the various ways in which the 
prophets in olden times received 
revelations, agree with the various 
ways in which God communicated 
His mind and will to Joseph Smith. 
I quote the following from the 
"Annotated Bible," published in 
1859: 

"The divine communications were 
spoken to the prophets in divers man- 
ners: God seems sometimes to have 
spoken to them in audible voice; oc- 
casionally appearing in the human 
form. At other times He made use 
of the ministry of angels, or made 
known His purposes by dreams. But 
He most frequently revealed His truth 
to the prophets by producing that su- 
pernatural state of sentient, intellec- 
tual, and moral faculties which the 
scriptures call "Vision." Hence, 
prophetic annunciations are often 
called visions, that is, things seen; and 
the prophets themselves are called 
seers. Although the visions which the 
prophets beheld and the predictions of 
the future which he announced were 



wholly announced by the divine spirit, 
yet the form of the communications, 
the imagery in which it is clothed, the 
illustrations by which it is cleared up 
and impressed, the symbols employed 
to bring it more graphically before the 
mind — in short, all that may be consid- 
ered as its garb and dress, depends up- 
on the education, habits, association, 
feelings and the whole mental, intel- 
lectual and spiritual character of the 
prophet. Hence the style of some is 
purer, more sententious, more ornate, 
or more sublime than others." 

Also the Rev. Joseph Armitage 
Robinson, D. D., Dean of West- 
minister and Chaplain of King Ed- 
ward VII of England, respecting 
the manner in which the message 
of the Old Testament was received 
and communicated to man, said, as 
late as 1905 : 

"The message of the Old Testament 
was not written by the divine hand, 
nor dictated by an outward compul- 
sion. It was planted in the hearts of 
men, and made to grow in a fruitful 
soil. And then they were required to 
express it in their own language after 
their natural methods and in accord- 
ance with the stage of knowledge 
which their time had reached. Their 
human faculties were purified and 
quickened by the divine Spirit; but 
they spoke to their time in the lan- 
guage of their time; they spoke a spir- 
itual message, accommodated to the 
experience of their age, a message of 
faith in God and of righteousness as 
demanded by a righteous God." — Sev- 
enty's Third Year Book, by B. H. 
Roberts. 

What is inspiration? Let us get 
an understanding of the distinction 
between revelation and inspiration 
then we can talk about it a few 
minutes. "Inspiration is the name 
of that divine influence, which op- 
erates upon the minds of men under 
which man may receive divine guid- 
ance." We have Oliver Cowdery's 
case, which is excellent, viz : where- 
in the Lord said: "Behold, I will 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



55 



tell you in your mind and in your 
heart, by the Holy Ghost, which 
shall come upon you and which shall 
dwell in your heart. Now, behold 
this is the Spirit of revelation ; be- 
hold, this is the spirit by which 
Moses brought the children of Is- 
rael through the Red Sea on dry 
ground." Oliver Cowdery had the 
spirit, or the gift of interpretation, 
but he did not understand. Doubt- 
less, he thought he knew the whole 
thing. The Lord gave a revelation 
and told him not to "murmur and 
complain." The thought comes to 
me that Oliver Cowdery imagined 
he knew a great deal more than th~ 
prophet. There are others of that 
kind living in our own day. There 
were men in the days of the prophet 
who wanted his place, I have heard 
it said that there were only two or 
three of all the apostles in that day 
who did not want the prophet's posi- 
tion. They imagined they were 
smarter than he was. The sugges- 
tion Is that Oliver Cowdery was 
one of them ; this may be a mistake. 
The Lord said: 

"Do not murmur, my son, for it is 
wisdom in me that I have dealt with 
you after this manner. Behold, you 
have not understood; you have sup- 
posed I would give it unto you, when 
you took no thought, save it was to 
ask me; but behold, I say unto you, 
that you must study it out in your 
mind; then you must ask me if it be 
right, and if it is right I will cause that 
your bosom shall burn within you, 
therefore you shall feel that it is 
right." 

The Lord says further : or at least 
His servant Job puts it in this way : 
"There is a spirit in man, and the 
inspiration of the Lord giveth them 
understanding." Or, as John words 
it : "That was the true light which 
lighteth every man that cometh in- 



to the world." Paul, in Corinthi- 
ans says: "But the manifestation 
of the Spirit is given to every man 
to profit withal." I take it, that ap- 
plies to the children of men. The 
Lord has not left them without the 
Spirit. Every man has "a manifes- 
tation of the Spirit." If it was not 
so, God's children could not be 
saved. The Lord says through His 
prophet: "Surely the Lord God 
will do nothing but that He re- 
vealeth His secret to His servants 
the prophets." 

We need revelation for the call- 
ing of officers in the Church. Men 
should not be called merely through 
impression. I have felt censured 
for some work that I have done in 
the Church. I set apart Seventies 
as presidents of quorums, and after 
having set apart some of these pres- 
idents, I have been doubtful wheth- 
er God had much to do with it, oth- 
er than they had been- chosen and 
set apart by one who had authority. 
It has not been demonstrated by the 
actions of some men that they were 
chosen of God ; they were chosen by 
mere impression, and time was not 
taken to consider what God wanted. 
My conviction is that men ought 
not to be appointed by mere impres- 
sion. The word of God teaches me 
that no man has a claim upon ap- 
pointment in this Church, unless 
he is called of God as was Aaron. 
It doesn't matter whose son he is ; 
although I fancy sometimes that I 
got my position as one of the First 
Council, out of respect to my fath- 
er, so that his name might be rep- 
resented among the authorities of 
the Church. 

To continue with the subject of 
inspiration : Jesus, before His as- 
cension promised the Holy Ghost 
to His disciples, which He called 
the "Comforter." "I will pray the 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Father, and He shall give you an- 
other Comforter that will abide with 
you forever, even the spirit of 
truth. But the world cannot re- 
ceive it, because it seeth him not, 
neither knoweth him; but ye know 
him,- for he dwelleth in you, and 
shall be in you." 

Revelation is essentially necessary 
to unfold to the Church the future. 
The servants of God must unfold 
to the Church the future, and point 
out to them coming danger. All 
prophets do not enjoy an equal de- 
gree or measure of foreknowledge, 
for the Lord said to Israel : "Hear 
now my words. If there be a 
prophet among you, I, the Lord, 
will make myself known unto him 
in vision, and will speak unto him 
in dream. My servant Moses is not 
so, who is faithful in all my house. 
With him will I speak mouth to 
mouth, even apparently, and not in 
dark speeches ; and the similitude of 
the Lord shall-he behold." 

"God hath set some in the 
Church, first Apostles, secondarily 
Prophets, thirdly Teachers." What 
was the object? The object of these 
officers and gifts is : first, "For the 
perfecting of the Saints ;" second- 
ly, "for the work of the ministry.;" 
and, thirdly, "for the edifying of the 
body of Christ." How long were 
they to remain? They are to re- 
main "till we all come to a unity of 
the faith and of the knowledge of 
the Son of God unto a perfect man, 
unto the measure of the fulness of 
the stature of Christ." 

I have something I want to call 
your attention to. If this was the 
last sermon I would ever preach in 
the flesh, and the last testimony I 
would ever bear to this people, it is 
my desire to tell you what is in- 
grained in my whole being. I be-, 
lieve Joseph Smith was and is a 



prophet of God, and I believe it as 
fervently and honestly as any man 
in all Israel. I may not have the 
knowledge or information that some 
possess; I may not have received 
the revelation and inspiration oth- 
ers have, but I have the testimony 
of its truth in every fiber of my be- 
ing. I may not have been born a 
Latter-day Saint, but my labors in 
the ministry and the testimonies I 
have received in preaching the Gos- 
pel, and the inspiration that God has 
given me, tell me that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God. God 
made him a Prophet but the peo- 
ple, when the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was- or- 
ganized, made him the President of 
the Church. 

Joseph Smith had revelations, 
and they are written and received 
by the Church. My testimony is 
that they are true. I have witnessed 
the fulfillment of many of them. I 
do not know how I could get a bet- 
ter testimony. But President Jos- 
eph Smith is dead, and Brother 
Brigham Young was his successor, 
and I have the same testimony as 
to him, I knew him from the time 
I was a small child, and I testify 
of his greatness, and of his bigness. 
He was a different: man from the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, who was the 
great architect of this work under 
the Almighty. Brother Brigham 
Young was a great builder, and he 
builded well and firmly, and as a 
Prophet of the Lord he continued 
where the Prophet Joseph ended. 
One reason why Brother Young 
was so great was that he had great 
men beside him, he had men who 
were tried as gold seven times, who 
never faltered or fell by the way- 
side; they held up his hands, no 
matter how much their hearts were 
tried. That is my testimony, and I

knew nearly every one of them. 
President Brigham Young is also 
dead. Then comes President Tay- 
lor, a 'most magnificent specimen of 
manhood, a man of God that I al- 
ways honored. Never was I in his 
presence that his bigness and maj- 
esty did not impress me. His per- 
sonality was wonderful. The first 
time I went into his presence was 
in answer to a call to the Southern 
States as an ambassador of the Gos 
pel. I ..never could forget him or 
the impression that he made upon 
my soul. But he is dead. Then 
came President Wilford Woodruff. 
I have personally stood by the side 
of that good man, he has taken time 
enough — thank God his time was 
not so precious that he could not sit 
by me for a few moments, — and 
when rising to go the testimony of 
the Spirit was the same; he surely 
is a prophet of God. He is dead al- 
so. 

Then came .President Lorenzo 
Snow — I had the same Spirit and 
the same testimony concerning him. 
No man was ever kinder to Golden 
Kimball than Lorenzo Snow. He put 
his arm around me before he died, 
and said, "I need you : I need, your 
help; God bless you." That is the 
only time I have ever felt like a full 
grown man. I felt like I was eight 
feet tall, that God needed me. I 
have felt big only once, and that 
was the time when I thought God 
needed me in this great work. 

We now have a living prophet, 
and his name is Joseph F. Smith. 
This may be my last discourse on 
this subject. I am not a man that 
caters to men I have no ax to grind. 
I don't want any place only what 
God wishes to give me ; all I expect 
is salvation, and possibly it will be 
a scratch if I get it. When I do 



get it I have paid the price, and 
am under obligation to no man on 
God's green earth, if I pay the Lord 
the price. My father paid full val- 
ue, and his election was made sure. 
If I get the same salvation, I expect 
to pay the same price. I haven't 
paid it yet. I am entitled to only a 
little, and God will give me all that 
belongs to me. 

President Joseph F. Smith is the 
Prophet of this Church, and he is 
the man who is appointed. When 
the Lord wants to give this Church 
a revelation, or give it instruction, 
He will give it through Joseph F. 
Smith, the Prophet. He will not 
give it through me, and He will not 
give it through an Apostle. The 
Apostles are prophets, seers, and 
revelators, and as such we sustain 
them. God does not give His reve- 
lations through the Twelve for His 
Church; He gives them through 
His living Prophet that is appointed, 
as the Prophet Joseph Smith was. 
I am satisfied I have got this thing 
figured out about right. 

Now, whether the Lord is going 
to give a revelation or not I don't 
know. I have read revelations that 
are not in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and they were given to men 
for their comfort, for their consola- 
tion, to tell them that certain things 
were true. But the Prophet never 
received them; they were not giv- 
en for the Church, for if they had 
been given for the Church they 
would have been received by the 
man appointed, and they would 
have been binding on the Church. 
I might reveal something to 
you that you do not know. My 
father received revelation, that is 
why I honor him so. I know his 
weaknesses ; my father was not, a 
perfect man, but he was just as good 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a man as ever lived ; yet he had his 
weaknesses. But God communicat- 
ed with him, God never communi- 
cated with Heber C. Kimball, the 
first counselor to Brigham Young, 
to direct the Church of Jesus Christ. 
I have revelations written over the 
signature of Heber C. Kimball, and 
I have witnessed their fulfillment, 
and I know that God revealed His 
mind and will to him. But there is 
not a word in one of those revela- 
tions to direct the Church of Jesus 
Christ. Father was a Prophet. 
Brigham Young says : "Here is my 
prophet, and I love to hear him 
prophesy." But Heber C. Kimball 
never sought to run the Church. If 
he had tried it he would have lost 
his place. But he did not lose his 
place. 

In conclusion, there are a lot of 
things that we are troubled over. 
I have spent a few sleepless nights 
myself, regarding the doings and 
actions of men who were in au- 
thority, but have concluded I am 
not responsible for anything I may 
regard as irregularities. I must not 
lift up my "heel against the anoint- 
ed and say they have sinned when 
they have not sinned before the 
Lord." If the Lord cannot care for 
His Church, what can I do? I am 
going to trust in the Lord, and I 
am going to trust in His Prophet, 
Joseph F. Smith. You look over 
Israel. I have looked over it, and 
I know it from Canada to Mexico. 
We are God's people. Brother Jos- 
eph F. Smith is the biggest man in 
the Church today, and there is not 
a man in all Israel that has the rec- 
ord he. has; a cleaner, a sweeter, 
a better record, no. man that lives 
has, to my knowledge. He is the 
President of the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 
God knows he has earned the place, 
and the Lord has preserved his life 
for the appointment. Now you had 
better let him hold it; he will hold 
it any how. You may as well sus- 
tain him with both hands, and sus- 
tain his counselor, and sustain the 
Council of the Twelve, for they are 
chosen, sustained and accepted by 
the Latter-day Saints. Some of 
them are young, and some of them 
are inexperienced, in a degree. I 
have learned that appointment does 
not give a man knowledge. My 
calling gave me no knowledge at the 
time I was chosen and ordained one 
of the First Council of Seventy, but 
it gave me an appointment, oppor- 
tunities and many privileges. I 
have gained knowledge and infor- 
mation just the same as you have 
got yours. I have an appointment 
that you have not got, and anyone 
of you had better not try to get in 
to my shoes, if you do I will kick 
you out. Neither am I going to try 
to get in an Apostle's shoes. I am 
going to let the Apostles alone, 
further than to try to sustain them. 
As I said once, I say again to all 
Israel: If the Lord, through His 
servants the prophets, places a child 
in the Apostleship, with the help of 
God I will try to sustain him, if I 
can. Therefore, O Israel, we must 
sustain the living prophets. The 
dead we honor, but the living are 
chosen, ordained, appointed and 
sustained, and it is to the living we 
look for counsel, reproof and in- 
struction. The Lord bless you. 
Amen.

ELDER ORSON E. WHITNEY. 

The Gospel's plainness and adaptabil- 
ity. — Difference in testimonies. — The 
Holy Spirit the source of all revela- 
tion. 

There is an old saying to the 
effect that it takes all kinds of peo- 
ple to make a world, and we have 
been reminded today that the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ is applic- 
able to the conditions of all people. 
I hope your souls have been fed by 
the great variety of instructions to 
which we have listened. Mine has 
been ; I have extracted from the re- 
marks of each speaker teachings 
adapted to my condition, and have 
profited by all that has been spoken. 

I appreciate the plainness and 
simplicity of the Gospel. "My soul 
delighteth in plainness," said Nephi 
of old. I heartily echo that senti- 
ment. I like to speak so that people 
can understand me. I do not care 
a fig for eloquence if it be obscure. 
A speaker's first duty is to make 
himself understood, to speak with 
plainness, and he must also be in 
earnest, must mean what he says, 
and say what he means, or he can 
never impress the hearts of his 
hearers. If he be sincere, earnest, 
and plain in his instructions, elo- 
quence will take care of itself. A 
man is never eloquent when he tries 
to be. Eloquence comes from be- 
ing earnest, from having in our 
hearts a desire to bless the people 
and feed them with the bread of 
life. It is my desire, during the 
few moments I shall stand before 
you, to speak plainly, to make my- 
self understood, and reach your 
hearts by the power of the Spirit 
of God. 

It is one of the signs of the di- 
vinity of the Gospel, that it is plain 



and adaptable to all conditions. It 
it could be understood only by a 
few, if it adapted itself only to the 
condition of a class, its divinity 
might well be questioned. That is 
one of the signs of a false doctrine, 
of a man-made creed. But the Gos- 
pel searches all hearts, and inter- ' 
prets itself to all classes and con- 
ditions. Not always in the same 
way, nor in the same degree, but in 
one way or another it makes itself 
understood by all. 

The Gospel of Christ, the power 
of God unto salvation, was intend- 
ed to save all men. When the Sa- 
vior commissioned His Apostles to 
go forth and preach the Gospel, He 
did not say, Go to this class, or to 
that nation, or to this man, or that 
people? He said, "Go ye into all 
the world and preach the Gospel to 
every creature; he that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved ; he 
that believeth not shall be damned." 
And that Gospel, in like plainness, 
is now being preached in all the 
world, with a view to saving every 
son and daughter of God. He is 
not trying to damn anybody, but 
trying to save all, and His word is 
therefore understandable by all. 
Not until every man has had a 
chance to be saved, and every means 
of salvation has been exhausted, 
will the Gospel have completed its 
work, and Mormonism have ful- 
filed its mission. 

I have a testimony that this is 
God's truth, and I presume I re- 
ceived it in a different way to what 
many of you received your testi- 
monies. What of it? Does it mat- 
ter upon what day Christ was born ? 
The main fact connected with Him, 
is that He was born and that He 
died that we might live ; that 
through faith in and obedience, to 
Him all men might be saved. That 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is the essential part. And the es- 
sential part of our testimony is that 
we received it and still have it. It 
does not matter particularly how it 
came. I never saw an angel. No 
audible voice ever said to me, "Thus 
saith the Lord." But God gave me 
a conviction that this is His truth. 
It came to me in this way : I was 
in Kirtland, Ohio, laboring as a 
missionary, and was walking up a 
hill toward the Temple one even- 
ing', when suddenly my mind was 
illumined and expanded until it 
seemed as. if I could comprehend 
the whole scope of human history 
from the beginning, from the days 
of Adam- down to the end of time. 
I saw why Adam had been, and 
Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham, 
and Christ, and the Apostles, and 
Joseph Smith, and Brigham Young, 
and the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I saw the fu- 
ture also, the events for which this 
great work is preparing; and the 
whole plan of redemption opened 
before the vision of my mind. I 
saw nothing with my natural eyes, 
but from that moment I recognized 
my place in history; I saw what 
God required of me. I knew where 
I came from, why I am here, and 
where I am going. And that con- 
viction has never left me; it is the 
greatest thing the Lord . ever gave 
to me. I have had dreams. I have 
healed the sick by the power of God. 
I have been healed myself, I have 
been blessed in many ways, have 
had my prayers answered again and 
again ; but nothing ever came to me 
so great as that mental or soul il- 
lumination that revealed to me my 
duty, and my place, in God's great 
scheme. That is what I call my 
testimony. 

It is not given to every man to 
look upon the face of God as did 



Moses, as did Joseph Smith. One 
must be specially prepared before 
he can see what Joseph saw. What 
do we read concerning him in the 
Book of Mormon ? He is there re- 
ferred to prophetically, not by name, 
but is designated as "a choice seer.'" 
What is a seer? One who can see. 
Joseph Smith had to be a choice 
seer, to see the Father and the Son. 
I used to think that if any good 
boy went into the woods and prayed 
the Lord would speak to him and 
manifest Himself in person, just as 
He did to Joseph. And there was 
a time, perhaps, when I would have 
thought that had He not done it He 
would have, been partial. But I 
have got over. that. It was a child- 
ish view. I do not expect the Lord 
to manifest Himself to me in the 
same way that He did to Joseph 
the Prophet. I expect Him to com- 
municate with me through the gifts 
He has endowed .me with, not 
through those with which He has 
endowed my brother or sister, un- 
less they have the right to receive 
for me a message from Him. When 
.the Lord speaks to me or to you, 
it will be in a method and manner 
justified by our preparation, our 
gifts, our powers; for we have all 
been endowed in some degree. Trie 
Prophet Joseph was prepared from 
the foundation of the world to do 
the work he accomplished. It was 
the work of a seer, a prophet, a 
revelator; and the truth was re- 
vealed to him in ways, perhaps, that 
it could not be revealed to us, be- 
cause of a difference in gifts. 

The Spirit of the Lord is the 
source of all spiritual gifts, but He 
"divideth to every man severally 
as He will." God can reveal the 
truth in a dream, and has done so 
on many occasions. When my 
grandfather, Heber C. Kimball, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



61 



with Orson Hyde, Willard Rich- 
ards and others, went to England in 
1837, to introduce the Gospel there, 
they found many people prepared 
to receive them.' Whole villages 
were converted. The Lord had pre- 
pared the way before them. And 
how had He done it ? He had giv- 
en to some of the people dreams, 
in which they had seen these very 
men landing on the shores of Eng- 
land, and when they came to them 
with the Gospel message these hum- 
ble factory or farm hands knew 
they were servants of God, because 
they had seen them in dreams. It 
was their privilege to receive the 
message that way. 

I believe my testimony came by 
the spirit of revelation, that illu- 
mines the mind, and makes manifest 
the things of God. Another may 
be converted by seeing the sick 
healed, or by beholding a vision. 
It is all right if the Lord chooses 
to manifest Himself that way. It is 
all revelation. It all comes down 
from the Father of light. 

It is the mission of the Holy 
Ghost to make manifest the things 
of God. "I will not leave you com- 
fortless," said the Savior, "I will 
send you another comforter, even 



the spirit of truth, that proceedeth 
from the Father, and He shall testi- 
fy of me." That is the secret of it 
all. Not one of us could under- 
stand or appreciate this work, if 
the Lord had not first prepared the 
way by placing within us a portion 
of the Spirit that comprehends the 
things of God. "He will bring 
things past to your remembrance ; 
He will show you things to come; 
He will take of the things of God 
and reveal them unto you." There 
are hundreds here today, thousands, 
perhaps, who, if called upon, could 
testify that the Holy Spirit, in some 
of the many ways in which it op- 
erates, has revealed to them the 
truth of this work. They have had 
it manifested 'to them not by man, 
but by the Holy Ghost. We know 
this is the work of God. He has 
given us a testimony l to that effect, 
and this testimony will remain with 
us, my brethren and sisters, so long 
as we live for it, and prove our- 
selves worthy. God grant that we 
may do so, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Hyrum Goff. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Monday, April 
4th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Jos- 
eph E. Robinson. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICX. 

(President of Western States Mis- 
sion.) 

"If any man among you seem to be 
religious, and bridleth not his tongue, 
but deceiveth his own heart, this man's 
religion is vain. 

"Pure religion and undefiled before 
God arid the Father is this, To visit 
the fatherless and the widows in their 
affliction, and to keeo himself unspot- 
ted from the world." 

These words from the epistle of 
James seem rather pertinent today, 
since so many people, at this time, 
are thinking more than ever before 
upon the plan of salvation, and the 
redemption of the human soul. De- 



fined, religion is the outward act or 
form by which men indicate their 
recognition of a God or Gods hav- 
ing power over their destiny, to 
whom obedience, service and honor 
are due. Specifically stated, it is 
conforming by faith and life— or by 
faith and works, if you please — to 
the precepts inculcated in the Bible 
respecting the conduct of life and 
duty toward God and man. Aside 
from what we believe, and practice, 
and know, a question occurred to 
me a short time ago, about the time 
of the death of Mr. E, H. Harri- 
man, the greatest railroad magnate 
that the world has known, I pre- 
sume. In reading a letter, which 
was supposed to have been read at 
his funeral, and which he had 
caused to be written to those resid- 
ing on his vast estate,— the ques- 
tion occurred to me, Is religion 
worth while? Referring to those 
who have made a success in life 
financially and otherwise, and who 
feel independent of oeople of this 
world, is it worth while for them to 
be religious? This is the letter he 
wrote : 

ThJ? t 1 he f m - en residen ts of Arden- 
The lack of interest on your part is 
discouraging to those who provide 
means whereby you can have the im- 
portant privi ege of attending church 
services. Fair weather Christians are 
of no more use in a community than 
the same sort of laborer, milkman 
dairyman farmer, carpenter, black- 
smith, railroadman, or any k nd I of a 
fair-weather man. It seems to me ?hat 
your responsibility does not end with 
yourself, but extends to those over 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



63 



whom you have an influence. The op- 
portunity is given your children for 
religious training at Sunday School, 
and the church for yourselves and 
families, if you avail yourselves of it. 
I hope by next Sunday, that you may 
evidence more interest by attending 
the service." 

This incident in the life of that 
man, coupled with another related 
at the same time, indicates his great- 
ness. We are told that on one oc- 
casion, afthe holiday season, he dis- 
covered that a child of one of his 
laborers had been overlooked and 
would receive no remembrance in 
the way of a Christmas gift. He 
himself went out into the snow, in 
the middle of the night, and walked 
three miles to that woman's home 
to assure her that her child would 
not be forgotten. A man that can 
entertain such ideas as this for re- 
ligious worship and its necessity, 
with such an attitude toward those 
of the human race with whom he is 
connected, cannot help but be a 
great man. So I thought that it 
might be profitable to look into the 
lives of other great men of whom 
we have heard or have come in con- 
tact, and see if, perchance, they had 
not been religious ; and the religious 
side of some of these men was gone 
into with a great deal of interest. 
Since the discovery of this great 
country, when Columbus, with those 
who were with him. bowed down 
on his knees and kissed the earth, 
and 'thanked the God of the uni- 
verse for having guided and di- 
rected them to this land, — coming 
down through history to the great 
•patriot and father of the country, 
George Washington, as well as 
Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lin- 
coln and all the great men, in fact, 
who had anything to do in the fram- 
ing of the destinies of this new 



country, were men who acknowl- 
edged a living God. They acknowl- 
edged the existence of a divine be- 
ing who ruled the destinies not only 
of men but of nations ; and they rec- 
ognized His hand in the affairs of 
this blessed country of ours. 

Yesterday, when President Smith 
referred to the home and what it 
should be and consist of, I was re- 
minded of Moroni who, at the age 
of twenty-five, stood at the head o 
the Nephite armies of this country, 
who fought and gave up their life's 
blood, — and what was it for? For 
the dual reason of protecting their 
homes and their religion, equall 
Did they realize what these two in- 
stitutions meant to them? That is 
what they fought for and prayed 
for. After they were successful in 
overcoming the opponents who, out- 
numbering them, the first thing they 
did was to say to their enemies that 
the Lord had seen fit to place them 
in their hands, and it was by His 
goodness and mercy that such con- 
ditions had been brought to pass. 

The thinking man today is reach- 
ing out in his contemplations far 
beyond mortality. It is inborn in 
the human race to have some con- 
ception and idea of God; and to- 
day, more than at any other time, 
I believe, among the sectarians, they 
are realizing this truth,— that God 
is a living being, and that their 
bodies are immortal. Immortal life 
is so closely connected with us and 
our work, our religion, our faith, I 
would like to read a few lines of 
the inspired poetess, Ella Wheeler 
Wilcox, which, perhaps, explains 
our position, or at least it suits my 
view, particularly in regard to the 
question of immortality : 

"Immortal life is something to be 
earned,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



By slow, self-conquest, comradeship 

with pain, , 
And patient ' seeking after higher 

truths. 

We cannot follow our own wayward 
wills 

And feed our baser appetites and give 
Loose reins to foolish tempers, year 
on year, 

And then cry, 'Lord, forgive me, I be- 
lieve — ' 

And straightway bathe in glory. Men 

must learn 
God's system is too great a thing for 

that; 

The spark divine dwells in each soul, 
and we 

Can fan it to a steady flame of light, 
Whose lustre guilds the pathway of 
the tomb 

And shines on through eternity.or else 
Neglect it till it simmers down to 
death 

And leaves us but the darkness of the 
grave. 

Each conquered passion feeds the liv- 
ing flame; 

Each well-borne sorrow is a step to- 
ward God. 

Faith cannot rescue, and no blood re- 
deem 

The soul that will not reason and re- 
solve. 

Lean on thyself, yet prop thyself with 
prayer, 

For these are spirits, messengers of 
light, 

Who come at call and fortify thy 
strength, 

Make friends with thee and with thine 

inner self, 
Cast out all envy, bitterness, and hate, 
And keep the mind's fair tabernacle pure ; 
Shake hands with Pain, give greeting 

unto Grief, 
Those angels in disguise; and thy glad 

soul, 

From light to light, from star to shin- 
ing star, 

Shall climb and claim blest immortal- 
ity." 

I bear you witness, my brethren 
and sisters, of the divinity of this 
work in which we are engaged. I 
bear my humble testimony to the 
truth of, and I feel to subscribe to, 
the principles enunciated by Presi- 
dent Smith at the opening of this 



conference. I pray God's blessings 
to rest upon him and strengthen 
him in the loss of his beloved com- 
panion and counselor in this 
Church. I pray God's blessing up- 
on us all, that we may be endowed 
with sufficient of His Spirit to live 
uprightly, to do our duty to our 
fellow-man and to our God, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

Examples of astounding wealth and 
extravagance.--The Savior's exam- 
ple of disregard for earthly riches.— 
True happiness derived from other 
sources than wealth. 

I feel a good deal like President 
Smith expressed himself, last eve- 
ning, that to stand before a large 
congregation of this character in- 
spires one with a feeling of awe, if 
not of fear ; and if I shall be able to 
say anything this morning that shall 
be profitable to us, it will be due to 
the help and assistance of the Spirit 
of the Lord. 

I quote from the Proverbs, chap- 
ter 23 : 

"Labor not to be rich: cease from 
thine own wisdom. - 

"Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that 
which is not? for riches certainly make 
themselves wings; they fly away as an 
eagle toward heaven." 

Again, in Proverbs, chapter 30 : 

"Two things have I required of thee; 
deny me them not before I die: 

"Remove far from me vanity and 
lies; give me neither poverty nor 
riches; feed me with food convenient 
for me; 

"Lest I be full, and deny thee, and 
say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be 
poor, and steal, and take the name of 
my God in vain." 

This prayer of the wise man is

worthy of our consideration — how 
beautiful, how appropriate, how 
consistent! He prayed not for 
riches, for fear that he would for- 
get the Lord; he prayed not for 
poverty, because it is a distressing 
thing and may lead to crime; but 
he prayed for just sufficient to meet 
his reasonable wants, and then he 
would be content. 

Brethren and sisters, the spirit of 
the age is a spirit to seek after 
wealth, to get rich, and to get rich 
quickly. There are innumerable 
schemes and enterprises devised by 
which this might be accomplished, 
and many people run into specula- 
tions that lead down, swiftly to fin- 
ancial ruin. 

At the beginning of the nine- 
teenth century there were very few 
people in America who could be 
classed as wealthy. If a man was 
known to be worth a million dollars, 
nearly every eye was upon him, it 
seemed to be such a wonderful 
thing; but now a million dollars is 
looked upon as quite a paltry sum, 
and he who has attained to this de- 
gree of opulence attracts no atten- 
tion whatever. During the past 
century great fortunes have been ac- 
cumulated by the wealthy in the 
United States. Henry Clews, a 
Wall Street banker, and an author- 
ity of eminence in financial matters, 
has prepared a list of some of the 
rich men of the country. Here it is : 

John D. Rockefeller $500,000,000 

Andrew Carnegie, $115,000,- 

000 given away, leaving. 250,000,000 
Wm. Waldorf Astor, chiefly 

real estate 200,000,000 

John Jacob, Astor 175,000,000 

The Gould family (of which 

Geo. J. Gould's personal 

portion represents $35,- 

000,000) 150,000,000 

Marshall Field 100,000,000 

Blair estate 100,000,000 



W. K. Vanderbilt 80,000,000 

Russell Sage,now Mrs. Rus- 
sell Sage 80,000,000 

D. O. Mills 75,000,000 

Wm. Rockefeller 75,000,000 

J. P. Morgan 60,000,000 

Jas. J. Hill 60,000,000 

Henry H. Rogers 50,000,000 

Henry Phipps 45,000,000 

Jacob D. Archibald 40,000,000 

Henry M. Flagler ... 40,000,000 

Jas. B. Haggin 40,000,000 

James Henry Smith (not 
John Henry Smith (laugh-" 

ter) 35,000,000 

Wm. H. Tilford 20,000,000 

James Stillman 15,000,000 

[Just think of that — the paltry sum 
of $15,000,000.] 

George F. Baker 15,000,000 



This makes a total, owned by 
twenty-two men, of two billion, two 
hundred and five million dollars. 
Mr. Clews admits that his list is in- 
complete, but says that it undoubt- 
edly contains the names of the rich- 
est men in the country. Now, pause 
and reflect, brethren and sisters. 
Think what an immense responsibil- 
ity rests upon these men who own 
such vast wealth. You could scarce- 
ly suppose that they would have a 
moment's time to devote to religion, 
or even to devote to their families, 
their time would be so completely 
occupied in looking after and man- 
aging these millions of dollars. 

I would like to say in this connec- 
tion, brethren and sisters, that the 
possession of great wealth often 
leads to extravagance and folly of 
the worst character. I was reading, 
the other day, of a case in court, 
where a wealthy woman was suing 
out a divorce from her wealthy hus- 
band, and in order to- impress the 
judge with the necessity of allowing 
her a large alimony, she gave to 
him and to the court a detailed ac- 
count, which was published, of her 
yearly expenses, the moneys ex- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pended by her for dress amounting 
to $40,000. I am sure it would be 
interesting to you to know the num- 
ber and cost of the various articles 
required by this wealthy woman to 
furnish her wardrobe for one year; 
and, of course, the expense is con- 
tinuous, as the fashions, you know, 
change frequently. She required : 

Twelve morning gowns that cost 
from $50.00 to $100.00 each. These 
often very elaborately ornamented 

* would' cost from $350 to $800 each. 

Fifteen reception gowns, $250 to 
$350 each. 

Twenty-four street gowns at $100 to 
$200 each. 

Six house gowns, $350 each 

Six negligee gowns, $50 to $175 each. 

Six tailored suits, $90 to $150. 

Four riding habits, $150 each. 

Twenty yachting suits, $50 each. 
Furs: 

One black muff and boa, $225. 
One black caracul skirt, $700. 
One black otter boa, $125. 
One fur coat, $300. 

Now I submit to you the question 
and ask if you do not think that one 
hundred women, and even a greater 
number, could be clothed properly, 
' to make a very respectable appear- 
ance, and to look reasonably well in 
all respects, with the money that 
was expended by this one woman 
on her wardrobe for one year? So 
that it would appear to be a very 

• foolish and extravagant outlay. In 
order to satisfy her it would require 
a very large sum in alimony, and 
that is what she wanted. 

Now, in the matter of wealth, as 
in all other matters, we must look 
to our Lord and Master as the great 
exemplar, and we may well judge 
from what the scriptures say that 
He despised wealth, for upon one 
occasion He said — think of it, the 
Lord of life, the Savior of the 
world, the Son of the living God, 



said, "The foxes have holes, and 
the birds of the air have nests, -but 
the Son of Man hath not where to 
lay His head." He seemed to give 
very little attention to the question 
of wealth. Even the adversary was 
permitted to take Him to the top of 
a high mountain and to show Him 
the kingdoms of the world and the 
glory thereof; and the adversary 
turned to Him and said, "Fall down 
and worship me, and all these things 
I will give thee." The Savior said, 
"Get thee hence, Satan : for it is 
written, Thou shalt worship the 
Lord thy God, and Him only shalt 
thou serve." Upon one occasion, as 
you will remember, a ruler of the 
Jews came to the Savior and said 
to Him, "Good Master, tell me what 
I shall do to inherit eternal life." 
The Savior turned to him and said, 
"Why callest thou me good ? None 
are good except God. Thou know- 
est the commandment, Do not com- 
mit adultery; do not kill; do not 
bear false witness; defraud not; 
honor thy father and thy mother." 
"Why," said the young man, "all 
these have I kept from my youth 
up." And the Savior, looking upon 
him, loved him and said, "Yet lack- 
est thou one thing." Now, think of 
it, what a remarkable life this 
young man had led, he had kept 
all these great commandments from 
his youth up, every one of them, 
and was only lacking in one little 
thing, the correction of which would 
enable him to grasp eternal life. 
The Savior said, "Sell all that thou 
hast and distribute to the poor, and 
thou shalt have treasure in heaven : 
and come, follow me." This made 
the young man very sad, and it 
grieved him sorely, for he had great 
possessions, and he turned away; 
and the Savior, addressing Himself 
to His disciples, said, "How hardly 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



67 



shall a rich man enter into the king- 
dom of heaven." Whereupon Peter 
replied, "Lo, we have left all and 
followed thee." Jesus answered, 
"Every one that hath forsaken 
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or 
father, or mother, or wife, or chil- 
dren, or lands, for my name's sake, 
shall receive an , hundred fold, and 
shall inherit everlasting life." How 
very fitting were the words of the 
Savior upon another occasion, if ap- 
plied to that young man, wherein he 
said, "Lay not up treasures unto 
yourselves upon earth, where moth 
and rust doth corrupt, and thieves 
break through and steal, but lay up 
for yourselves treasures in heaven 
where moth and rust doth not cor- 
rupt, neither do thieves break 
through and steal; for where your 
treasure is there will your heart be 
also." The acquirement of riches 
was not only referred to upon nu- 
merous occasions, by the ancient 
writers of the scripture, and also by 
the Savior in His day, but the Lord 
in modern times has spoken very 
clearly. and definitely respecting it. 
In His revelations to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, this subject is dwelt 
upon quite fully and seems to be 
counted of great importance. The 
Lord said to Joseph, in section 38 
of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"If ye seek the riches which it is 
the will of the Father to give unto 
you, ye shall be the richest of all 
people, for ye shall have the riches 
of eternity; and it must needs be 
that the riches of the earth are mine 
to give ; but beware of pride, lest ye 
become as the Nephites of old." 
And how were the Nephites of old ? 
We read that they grew to be quite 
wealthy; they became proud and 
high-minded, and went with stiff- 
necks and high looks, and they 
seemed to think thev were better 



than their poorer brethren and sis- 
ters, because of the costly apparel 
which they wore. This was a great 
evil in the sight of God. Upon an- 
other occasion, the Lord emphasizes 
the words of the wise man in the 
proverbs, when he said: "Seek not 
riches, but wisdom, and the mys- 
teries of God shall be unfolded to 
you ; then shall ye be made rich, for 
he that inherits eternal life is rich." 

Brethren and sisters, the late 
President John R. Winder is a rich 
man, for he will inherit eternal life. 
He fought the good fight, kept the 
faith and has won a crown in the 
kingdom of our God. 

Now, we have before us, on the 
one hand, the riches of eternity, and, 
on the other hand, the riches of the 
earth. Which will you choose? If 
you choose the riches of eternity, 
then all other things will be added 
unto you. If you choose the riches 
of the earth, you may lose all else, 
yea, even the riches of the earth. 
There are many, very many among 
the Latter-day Saints who are rich 
today, and others who are growing 
rich; but they do not derive their 
happiness from riches. There are 
five sources from which the Saints 
derive inestimable happiness, and in 
which the principle and power of 
wealth has no influence whatever : 
The first is the possession of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ; the second 
is the contemplation of spiritual 
things in that Gospel; the third is 
the blessings of the house of God, 
in which the endowments are giv- 
en, and the principle of marriage 
for eternity is revealed; the fourth 
is the preaching of the Gospel to a 
fallen world, thus bringing to pass 
the redemption of mankind ; and the 
fifth is administering the necessities 
of life to the worthy poor. This is 
what brings happiness, pure and

unsullied happiness, to the Latter- 
day Saints. Let us seek after these 
thing's. 

May the Lord bless His people. 
May He prosper and sustain them. 
May He bring to them the riches 
of eternity, and may He bring to 
them the riches of the earth, if they 
can only have wisdom to employ 
these riches for the building up 
of His Church and Kingdom. May 
the Lord God of Heaven bless His 
Prophet and His people, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

the hymn, "I know that my Re- 
deemer lives," as a baritone solo. 

ELDER HYRTJM M. SMITH. 

How Joseph Smith became a Prophet. 
— The Gospel and Priesthood re- 
stored. — Continuation of authority 
after the Prophet's martyrdom. — 
God's inspiration manifest in char- 
acter of successive leaders. — Futile 
efforts of enemies to create dissen- 
sion in the Church or retard its 
growth. 

Almost ninety years have passed 
away since the opening of the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, in 
the which the Father, in person, ac- 
companied by His Son, Jesus Christ, 
came from heaven to the earth in 
answer to the prayer offered them 
by Joseph Smith, a boy of fourteen 
years of age. These divine person- 
ages made themselves known to this 
lad, answered his questions and told 
him that the time had come for the 
introduction among men, once 
more, and for the last time, of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
which is the power of God unto 
salvation. This was a most glor- 
ious and effulgent day. We are 
told it was a beautiful day in the 
spring time, a day in every way 



befitting such a condescension on 
the part of the Father and the Son, 
to come from their celestial abode 
into consultation with Joseph Smith 
in this state of life. But almost 
immediately after that glorious vis- 
ion, the clouds of darfeness began 
to encircle this young man, — who 
was now a prophet .of God, — for the 
moment that he declared he had 
seen the Father and the- Son, near- 
ly all who heard the declaration 
rose up in opposition to him, and in 
great objection to his message, de- 
claring it to be false and from the 
evil one, and they tried to their ut- 
most to persuade the prophet him- 
self that he had been deceived. 
Nevertheless, he knew he had not 
been deceived ; and, obedient to the 
instructions imparted to him by the 
Savior, he continued to do„ as near- 
ly as was possible, what he thought 
and understood to be right and ac- 
cording to the will of the Lord. In 
due time, the Lord sent from His 
presence other messages to Joseph, 
with further instructions and with 
proper interpretation of many ' of 
the prophecies that had been made, 
concerning the latter times, by the 
ancient prophets, with other proph- 
ecies and promises to him that the 
Church of Christ should be organ- 
ized, and that he should become the 
instrument, in the hands of God, in 
building up the Church of Jesus 
Christ in the latter days. These 
promises and prophecies were, in 
due time, fulfilled. The Aaronic 
Priesthood was conferred upon Jos- 
eph Smith by John the Baptist, who 
had been the forerunner of the 
Savior in primitive times, and some 
time later the Melchizedek was con- 
ferred upon him by Peter, James 
and John. These were men who 
had lived, and who had been valiant 
in the testimony of Jesus Christ.

They had been preachers of the 
Gospel, and had held the Holy 
Priesthood. They, with the excep- 
tion of John, had been put to death 
for the testimony which they had 
borne. They had been resurrected, 
had come forth from the grave, and 
had been sent by the Father and the 
Son to Joseph Smith to restore the 
Priesthood which was the authority 
of God, by which these great proph- 
ecies should be fulfilled, namely, the 
building up of the kingdom of God 
in the earth, the establishment of 
the Church, and the opening of the 
doors of all nations for the preach- 
ing of the Gospel, that the light of 
truth should be spread into every 
nation and among every people, to 
every kindred and tongue, and that 
the cry of repentance should go 
forth, that all men should have the 
privilege of hearing it and the op- 
portunity of accepting the Gospel, 
repenting of their sins and becom- 
ing members of the Church, thus 
putting themselves in the way, by 
their obedience, to inherit eternal 
life in the Celestial kingdom of our 
Father in heaven. 

All this was accomplished, and 
in the midst of persecution, and all 
manner of evil and slander and op- 
position that were brought to bear 
against the Prophet and those who 
believed in him. In =pite of it all, 
the Prophet was able to accomplish 
his great mission; and during his 
brief life — his presidency over the 
Church was but fourteen years — he' 
laid the foundations of this great 
and glorious kingdom; he effected 
the organization of the Church, an 
organization which is, at the same 
time, the pride of the Saints, the 
glory of the Lord, and the wonder 
of the world. He was martyred for 
the truth's sake, — put to death for 
bearing witness and testimony of 



Jesus. At his death, the Church ex- 
perienced possibly the darkest mo- 
ment of its career. For but a mo- 
ment, however, were the Saints be- 
wildered despite their intense sor- 
row. They were, I imagine, a good 
deal like the disciples of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, when they had seen 
their teacher, their guide and their 
God crucified upon the cross. They 
went away in sorrow, and they de- 
clared that they had hoped that this 
man "had been He which should 
have redeemed Israel." They were 
enthralled, for the time being, in 
doubt, in darkness, and in very 
great disappointment. So were the 
Latter-day Saints at the martyrdom 
of the Prophet and his brother the 
patriarch of this dispensation. They 
were troubled for a little while. 
They were not in doubt, however, 
as to the man having been a proph- 
et of the Lord, and the restorer of 
the Gospel. In order that they 
should not fall into doubt, the Lord 
did not leave them even in this anx- 
ious state for long. He raised up 
him who was to receive the author- 
ity and the mantle of the Prophet. 
President Brigham Young, of the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was 
transfigured before the people; in 
their conference. They knew that 
the Prophet Joseph was dead, yet 
when President Young arose to ad- 
dress them, they saw in the speaker 
the Prophet, in stature and in fea- 
ture, and they heard the voice of 
the Prophet of God speak unto 
them. This renewed <"heir faith and 
gave them courage; it convinced 
them that God had chosen him, and 
he was . accepted by them as their 
leader, and in due time was sus- 
tained by the people as the Presi- 
dent of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, to succeed the 
Prophet Joseph Smith.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



During the dark days of perse- 
cution and mob violence immediate- 
ly following the martyrdom, the 
Saints were driven from their 
homes, and their houses were 
burned and their property de- 
stroyed. They were driven out in 
the winter time, even beyond the 
borders of civilization, into the wil- 
derness. The Lord was mindful of 
His own, however, and revealed 
His purpose and will to President 
Young, and the inspiration of His 
Spirit rested mightily upon the 
Saints, giving them hope and en-> 
couragement and consolation even 
in this hour of deepest distress. 
Guided by the revelation of God, 
President Young led the people 
across the plains, and the Lord es- 
tablished them in the valleys of the 
mountains. President Young, in 
his wisdom and greatness, taught 
the Saints, he guided them, he in- 
structed them, he sent them into the 
north and into the south ; he advised 
them in the manner and matter of es- 
tablishing colonies throughout the 
length and breadth of this land. He 
built up cities, towns and villages, 
and the Saints under his wise presi- 
dency grew daily in the work of the 
Lord, becoming stronger and more 
numerous as time passed on. Presi- 
dent Young presided over the 
Church for upwards of thirty years ; 
and in all his experience there was 
never a time when the Saints, for 
one moment, ever lost faith in him 
as the prophet, seer, and revelator 
of the Church, and the representa- 
tive and mouthpiece of God upon 
the earth. Nor for one moment did 
President Brigham Young ever 
prove recreant to his great trust, or 
prove himself incapable of the won- 
derful responsibility that had de- 
scended to him from the Prophet 
Joseph Smith who was the founder, 



under the Lord, of His Church in 
this day. He also endured perse- 
cution, as did the people during his 
presidency. The world was ar- 
rayed against him, as it had been 
against the Prophet before him. 
Nevertheless, through these dark 
days of its sad experience, the Lord 
was sustaining His Church ; and af- 
ter the darkness the sun always 
shone more brightly. When any 
particular warfare made against the 
people, was over, the Church re- 
bounded with greater force, gath- 
ered greater strength, greater faith, 
greater inspiration, and greater 
power in- the carrying on of the 
work of the Lord towards the ac- 
complishment of the redemption and 
the salvation of the children of men, 
and the spread of truth among the 
people of the world. 

When the Lord gathered Presi- 
dent Young to Himself, He had al- 
ready prepared another mighty and 
good man to take his place — Pres- 
ident John Taylor, one of the great- 
est and noblest men of this dispen- 
sation, was sustained by the peo- 
ple as their president. He also re- 
ceived the mantle of the prophet of 
God. He received the revelations 
of the Lord, and was in constant 
communication with Him in all 
things connected with the building 
up of the kingdom and the spread 
of the Gospel. He was an inspir- 
ational preacher of the Gospel, an 
able writer upon the principles and 
doctrines of salvation, and a vali- 
ant champion of the cause. The 
people rallied to him, supported and 
sustained him. They received the 
same witness that he had been 
chosen of God and had been exalted 
of the Father, as they had received 
concerning President Brigham 
Young and the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Very dark days were ex- 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



71 



perienced during his presidency, 
days of exile, days of sorrow, days 
of persecution, when he with many 
of the general authorities of the 
Church were hunted and hounded, 
by officers of the law, for conscience 
sake, because they were determined 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord, because they believed in the 
principles that they were living and 
practicing, because they were hon- 
est and conscientious ' in their be- 
lief, and would not yield that which 
God had commanded them to do, 
even rhough it necessitated their go- 
ing into exile or prison, or, perhaps, 
suffering even martyrdom for the 
truth's sake. In the end, that was 
the fate of President John Taylor, 
for he died during the time of his 
exile, when he had been driven from 
' home, and when many of the Saints 
were hunted and had to flee to save 
themselves from undeserved punish- 
ment, and many others had been 
sent to prison. But before his 
death, the Lord had been preparing 
his successor, as the Lord always 
does have in preparation those who 
shall be called to carry on the work 
of His servants who have finished 
their work. 

When President Taylor had com- 
pleted his mission,. President Wil- 
ford Woodruff was raised up, and 
he, also, became a wonderful man, 
a mighty man, a man of faith and 
humility, a man of power, of wis- 
dom, of judgment, a man of great 
inspiration, who, like the others, 
lived in the hearts of the people. All 
the people recognized in him the 
prophet of the Lord, the president 
of the Church, the man who held 
the keys of authority and who stood 
at the head of the Church, having 
been raised to that exalted position 
by the Lord Himself, and sustained 



by the Saints. During his lifetime 
he was upheld and sustained in all 
his acts, and the wisdom of the 
Lord was manifest in his appoint- 
ment. He lived to a great age, filled 
his mission and accomplished the 
work the Lord had assigned for 
him to do, and he departed this life 
mourned by all the people of the 
Latter-day Saints and by very many 
who were not members of the 
Church, but who were acquainted 
with him, and knew his worth. 
President Lorenzo Snow succeeded 
him, and like all the rest, he dem- 
onstrated by his h'fe that he labored, 
advised, counseled, and preached 
under the inspiration and direction 
of God the heavenly Father. The 
people loved him. Under his ad- 
ministration the Church made splen- 
did progress. After his death the 
Lord placed at the head of the 
Church another of His servants, 
who magnifies nobly that great au- 
thority of Presidency and in whom 
the power and might and wisdom 
that characterized the lives of all 
the other presidents of the Church 
are embodied. He, hke them, has 
the confidence of the Saints of God 
and enjoys, also, the approbation of 
the Lord and the Lord's blessings 
and inspiration poured out upon 
him. 

Now, during this conference, the 
80th annual conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, we witness that the 
Church has grown larger than ever, 
that the people assemble in greater 
numbers, as each succeeding con- 
ference comes annually and semi- 
annually. It seems a pity that many 
who come find it impossible to be 
accommodated under the sound of 
the voices of the servants of the 
Lord who are called to speak and 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



minister unto them. It appears that 
the Church will have to build, some- 
time, another tabernacle, for there 
is no doubt that another building 
such as this could be filled to over- 
flowing during the conferences. 
Thus has the Lord blest the Saints ; 
He has gathered them in the valleys 
of the mountains ; He has made 
, them mighty. Thev have been 
obedient; they love the truth; they 
understand the word of God; the 
scriptures are plain unto them. They 
comprehend the purposes of the 
Lord in this dispensation, and as a 
general thing they are prepared to 
do whatsoever the Lord requires of 
them, to go and to come, to accept 
and put into actual practice the will 
of God as it is made known unto 
them through the Presidency of the 
Church. 

We have had some dark days in 
our experience. It was but a few 
years ago that an especially bitter 
and cruel warfare was made upon 
the Church, and every effort within 
the power of evil designing men, 
and every effort that could be 
brought to bear upon men by the 
power of the adversary was used to 
discredit the President of the 
Church among the people. The 
people were warned against him. 
Some of the descendants of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith took it upon 
themselves to write letters of warn- 
ing to the President of the Church, 
in which he was accused of deceiv- 
ing the Saints, and warnings to the 
people to beware of the general au- 
thorities and the Priesthood. The 
people were told that they were be- 
ing led astray. The people — it was 
said — were innocent; the people 
were pure and good ; hut their lead- 
ers were impure and had. The 
grandson of the Prophet Joseph 



Smith came here and made a great 
effort with these warnings, to create 
discord and dissatisfaction among 
the Saints of God. He joined him- 
self with those avowed and deter- 
mined enemies of the people who 
for years had made war upon the 
Saints; he was in constant associ- 
ation and communication with them, 
assisted them in their tirade against 
the Priesthood, and in their efforts 
to discredit the Presidency before 
the people. There were a few' — 
just a few foolish and unstable ones 
among the Latter-day Saints who 
had not been very faithful, who had 
not enjoyed the Spirit of the Lord, 
and they were tinctured with this 
folly, and they rose up against the 
brethren. They called themselves 
prophets, claiming to be one or an- 
other of the ancient prophets come' 
again; and because of this the en- 
emy actually imagined that they 
were making great inroads among 
the people. So sanguine and sure 
were some of these men that the 
Church of Jesus Christ- of Latter- 
day Saints was about to be disrupt- 
ed and broken to pieces, and that 
there would be a great harvest fpr 
these pretenders, that even the pres- 
ident of the so-called Re-organized 
church came to Utah with the full 
intention and hope of gathering up 
the fragments and establishing 
again the Church under his leader- 
ship. I remember so well : he made 
a few speeches in this city, as did 
his son. They came to the confer- 
ence, and sat here among the pres- 
idents of stakes. They fully ex- 
pected to see the Presidency of the 
Church repudiated and voted down. 
The Latter-day Saints were assem- 
bled, as usual, in great numbers. 
But, do you know, there were none 
of the general authorities that had

any fears; they did not expect to 
see the kingdom of God destroyed 
and the Church thrown down and 
given to another people. They 
knew better ; the Lord had promised 
otherwise; and so, when the Pres- 
ident's name was presented before 
the great congregation for their 
support, the people responded al- 
most to a man, and just like it might 
have been one man, so united were 
they. I remember the president of 
the Re-organized church and his 
son, — how they looked back over 
the congregation, to see how the 
people would reject the authorities 
of the Church ; but they turned to 
see a sight that they had never and 
that few of us had ever seen before, 
for it seemed to me every hand was 
raised just a little higher than I had 
ever seen them raised before, and 
they remained uplifted just a little 
longer than usual. They were 
raised with a determination, with a 
will, with a faith that conveyed un- 
to all present the knowledge that 
these men were indeed living in the 
hearts df the people, and that the 
people knew for themselves that 
they were God's divinely called ser- 
vants, and that God was at the head 
of this Church, and not men alone, 
but that the men whom the Lord 
had chosen to preside among the 
people were in close touch with the 
Spirit of God, in communication 
with the Lord constantly. 

What a disappointment it must 
have been to our Re-organite 
friends, and what a defeat it was 
to the adversary, a defeat so de- 
cisive that from that time to this 
the enemy has scarcely recovered. 
Those dark clouds which, accord- 
ing to the opinion of some, threat- 
ened the very foundation of the 
Church, have been dispelled and 



the sun has shone forth with great- 
er glory and light upon the people 
than ever, and the Gospel has made 
greater progress in. the world. It 
has made greater advancement in 
the various mission fields. Mis- 
sionaries have had greater power, 
and the people of the world them- 
selves, have come to understand 
more thoroughly and fully the pur- 
poses of the Elders of the Church 
who are preaching this Gospel. 
The hundreds of thousands of peo- 
ple who come to this ,city annu- 
ally, and are entertained at the 
Bureau of Information, and are 
kindly received by the Elders of 
the Church, and are courteousl> 
conducted about these grounds, and 
through these buildings, have the 
Gospel preached unto them. Good 
literature is given to them. They 
go away with a much better under- 
standing of Mormonism with a bet- 
ter impression of the people, with 
more light concerning them. They 
go away with a more ..friendly dis- 
position and feeling toward us, and 
this feeling they carry with them in- 
to the world, and it is having its ef- 
fect. As a result of it, the princi- 
ples of the Gospel are being better 
understood and more people are in- 
vestigating the truths of it. People 
are being baptized constantly, by 
the hundreds, out in the various 
mission fields, and at borne the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are strong and full 
of faith. 

We often bear our testimony to the 
divinity of the mission of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and we all have that 
testimony. We bear testimony, al- 
so, to the divinity of the mission 
of Joseph Smith the prophet; and 
that those who have succeeded the 
Prophet are divinely called and have 
a divine mission to perform in the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



earth. As we bear this testimony, 
so I this morning, would like to bear 
my testimony concerning the people 
of God who are the fruits of this 
restoration and of the preaching of 
the Gospel in this dispensation, that 
they are men and women who love 
the Lord with all their hearts, minds 
and strength, who love the truth, 
and uphold it, who love that which 
is right and good and pure, that 
which is noble and godlike, and they 
are living for these principles and 
sustaining them in the midst of the 
earth. I bear testimony to their 
■ intelligence, to their wisdom, their 
greatness, their humility, their faith 
— that they are a god-fearing peo- 
ple, that they do love the Lord, and 
love their fellow-men. That the)' 
honor the Priesthood and desire to 
magnify their callings May God 
bless us and continue to increase 
us, that we may gather strength 
and power to further persuade the 
world of the fact that God has spok- 
en, that He has raised up a people, 
that He has established His Church 
and is building His kingdom. 

May the Lord ever keep us true 
and faithful to these things. May 
we uphold the work of God and 
ever magnify ourselves and the au- 
thority of the Priesthood, and 
preach to the world the Gospel of 
Christ, that all may be saved. Let 
our prayers still ascend to the Lord 
in behalf of those who are clothed 
upon with such great authority and 
who are under such great respon- 
sibility, in presiding over the people 
and directing the work of God in all 
the world. I know for myself, by 
the power of the Spirit of God, that 
spirit spoken of by Brother Ballard 
yesterday, the Holy Ghost ; that the 
Lord has indeed established this 
work and has set His hand for the 
last time to gather in one all things 



in the Lord Jesus Christ. May we 
do our part in assisting Him in the 
accomplishment of His great and 
glorious purposes for the salvation 
of the living and the redemption of 
the dead, — in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith.

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 

fled?

Elder Heber J. Grant said : To- 
day is the fortieth anniversary of 
the birth of Elder George Albert 
Smith. As you are all aware, Broth- 
er Smith has been in very poor 
health and is now at Saint George. 
Word received from him today is to 
the effect that he is gaining very 
nicely. I am sure that I express 
the sentiments of all who are here 
present when I say that we earn- 
estly supplicate the Lord to restore 
him to perfect health and strength. 
He sends greetings to the Latter- 
day Saints, and his sincere thanks 
for their faith and prayers and the 
love and sympathy extended to him 
during his sickness. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(Pres't of Southern States Mission) 

I earnestly pray that the spirit of 
my remarks may be in harmony 
with the spirit that has accompanied 
the remarks of my brethren during 
this conference. 

When the angel Moroni appeared 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, to de- 
liver his message to that boy, to re- 
veal the place where the plates were 
hidden, from which the Book of 
Mormon was translated, he told 
Joseph that God had a work for him 
to do. To that work the Prophet 
Joseph consecrated his life and all 
that he had, until his days closed in 
martyrdom. It was the perform- 
ance of that duty, his devotion to 
that work, that made Joseph Smith 
great ; and it is the Gospel, restored 
under his administration, that has 
given this people the commanding 
position they occupy. We have not 
made this Church great ; we have 
not shed any honor or lustre on the 
Gospel ; the Father hath done that, 



and we are working to glorify His 
holy name. It is the Church, the 
Gospel, that has made us great, and 
it has magnified us in the eyes of all 
honorable men and women, and by 
it we have found favor with God. It 
is the kind of work we engage in 
that forms our characters. If we 
engage in dishonorable work, we 
shall be dishonorable men; but if 
we are engaged in a great and glor- 
ious work, such as this gospel is, 
we become great and honored in 
the sight of God, and in the sight of 
all good men and good women. We 
ought to be grateful to the Lord for 
the marvelous opportunities that He 
has given unto His people. We are 
a peculiar people, but. we should be 
a people peculiarly zealous of good 
works. Look at the organization of 
the Church, so complete and per- 
fect. The opportunities it affords to 
every man, woman, and child, to 
develop their characters, their spir- 
ituality, to make them great in the 
service of the Almighty, and to be 
of service to their fellow creatures 
are many and invaluable. As we re- 
alize our loftiest ideals of citizenship 
through this great government of 
ours and its institutions, so through 
the Church organization may our 
spiritual ideals be realized, and our 
labors find a profitable and legiti- 
mate expression. 

One of the good things in the • 
world today, one of the signs which 
indicates that the Gospel is being fa- 
vorably received, is the ready sale 
which the Book of Mormon is find- 
ing. Men and women are purchas- 
ing that sacred record, arid they are 
prayerfully perusing its pages. In 
many places in the Southern States 
mission, where, a few years ago, we 
could not give it away, we are to- 
day selling large numbers ; and that 
book is the best missionary, the 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



best friend-maker in all the world. 
Before I left Chattanooga a few 
days ago, a lady came to me and 
said, "Brother Callis, I want to be 
baptized; I am converted to the 
Gospel." I said to her, "Sister, I 
haven't seen you at our meetings 
very much." "No," she replied,"that 
is true, but I have been reading the 
Book of Mormon, and I am con- 
verted to the truth. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, 
through reading that book, and I 
know that the Gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation." I love the 
Book of Mormon because it con- 
tains the fulness of the Gospel as 
taught by Jesus to the people on the 
western hemisphere. It contains 
plain and precious things that have 
been left out of the Bible, which we 
love and in which we believe. 

Paul, in discoursing on charity, 
said, "Though I speak, with the 
tongues of men and of angels, and 
have not charity, I am become as 
sounding brass, or a tinkling cym- 
bal," and the Apostle goes on to 
say that though he gave his body 
to be burned, and all his goods to 
feed the poor, yet if he had not 
charity it profited him nothing. 
Then he continued, "Whether there 
be prophecies, they shall fail; 
whether there be tongues, they shall 
cease ; whether there be knowledge 
it shall vanish away. For we know 
in part, and we prophesy in part. 
But when that which is perfect is 
come, then that which is in part 
shall be done away." And he closes 
that remarkable chapter with these 
words : "And now abideth faith, 
hope, charity, these three; but the 
greatest of these is charity." It is 
not clearly defined in the foregoing 
just what the Apostle means by 
"charity," and to get the definition 
of the term we appeal to the Book 



of Mormon. On page 599 of the 
sacred Nephite record, Moroni, in 
expressing his admiration and love 
for the Lord, said: "And now I 
know that this love which thou hast 
had for the children of men, is char- 
ity;" and the same Prophet said 
that, "Charity is the pure love of 
Christ." The Apostle Paul and Mo- 
roni spoke and wrote as they were 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost; 
hence there is harmony and beauty 
in their teachings. - Wherever truth 
is found, though it be separated by 
oceans, it agrees ; it is harmonious, 
because it was given by the same 
Spirit, by the same Lord who send- 
eth every good and gracious gift un- 
to the children of men. But how 
is charity expressed? I hold and 
firmly believe that of all the people 
on the face of the earth, the Latter- 
day Saints, taken as a whole, have 
more charity than any other people. 
The love of God is greater than all 
other gifts, because God is love, and 
love is eternal. The love of God is 
expressed in the redemption of His 
sons and daughters. It is beauti- 
fully declared in the Gospel of Saint 
John : "For God so loved the world 
that He gave His only begotten Son, . 
that whosoever believeth on Him 
should not perish, but have everlast- 
ing life." That is the true love ; that 
is the true charity which moves us, 
not to distribute gifts needlessly, 
not to bring up our children in idle- 
ness and pleasure-seeking — not to 
extend to our children that false 
kindness that gives them everything 
they ask for, but to use the love we 
have for them to persuade them to 
do right, to teach them the word of 
God and to keep His command- 
ments. 

You know it is said in the same 
glorious book — the Nephite record 
— and by the way, I might say that 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS.

this verse that I am going to quote 
gives us a glimpse into eternity — it 
shows us, in a measure, at least, 
what our future life or course will 
be; and I want only a glimpse. I 
believe with Emerson that, "all that 
I have seen teaches me to trust God 
for what I have not seen." "For," 
said the Lord to the faithful Nephi, 
"my work is not yet finished ; neith- 
er shall it be until the end of man ; 
neither from that time henceforth 
and forever." What! The Lord 
God at work? Yes — and I be- 
lieve that it is this work in which 
He is engaged that accounts for His 
greatness, and I do not mean to be 
sacrilegious in saying that. Oh! 
that every man who has a desire to 
withdraw from active duty in the 
Priesthood would read this verse 
and ponder it over in his heart. 
There are too many men who feel 
that the cares of this life should ab- 
solve them from active duty in the 
ministry. I believe, my brethren 
and sisters, that when a man asks 
for retirement, before the author- 
ities of this Church see fit to release 
him, it smacks too much of a sur- 
render — a surrender to indolence, a 
surrender to the wrong influence. I 
believe we should stand as firm as 
these granite mountains in the de- 
fense of truth. When the United 
States was at war with a certain na- 
tion one of her war vessels was 
commanded by a young man, and 
his name was Joseph. His father 
worked in the navy department. 
One day the message was flashed 
to the seat of government that Joe's 
vessel had struck its colors to the 
enemy. But the old man knew what 
his son was made of ; he had confi- 
dence in his integrity, and he bowed 
his head and wept, and in a voice 
broken with grief, he said: "Joe's 
dead, then." Sure enough, when 



the details of the battle were re- 
ceived the fact was disclosed that 
Joe had met his death in the dis- 
charge of his duties, before his ship 
was surrendered to the enemy. 

Now, what is this work in which 
God is engaged ? Let Deity himself 
answer. He said to Moses, as re- 
corded in the Pearl of Great Price, 
"And this is my work and my glory, 
to bring to pass the immortality, and 
the eternal life of man." Oh! it if 
enough to make our hearts burst 
with joy, to think that the great 
Creator is doing work to elevate you 
and me, to exalt us in his kingdom, 
by persuading us, in loving kind- 
ness, to do our duty. Then,, too, He 
has chosen his obedient children to 
do this glorious work, to work with 
Him as it were — for be it known 
unto all of us that God does use hu- 
manity to further His purposes in 
the earth. He uses men and women 
to preach the Gospel, and in the 
preaching of the Gospel we can ex- 
ercise this charity and show the 
love of God, that is in our hearts. 
Who will look at that glorious tem- 
ple, and the other temples in the val- 
leys of the mountains, and say that 
this people have not charity or the 
love of God in their hearts. Only a 
few weeks ago, an old man, a Lat- 
ter-day Saint, living in Mississippi, 
donated a thousand dollars for tem- 
ple work. He is living in the shadow 
of death, in the evening of life, but 
so filled is his heart with the love of 
God that he is willing to sacrifice for 
the good of those who will come af- 
ter him. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire 
to say unto you, for I believe it with 
all my heart, that the road to exal- . 
tation and eternal progression lies 
through sacrifice and work. Jesus 
said, "Be ye perfect, even as your 
Father which is in heaven is per- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feet." He did not limit the attain- 
ment of perfection to time, degree, 
or state. Eternal progression will 
be along the lines of orderly knowl- 
edge, and of law, because the Gospel 
will be in force in eternity as it is 
here. It is impossible for a being, 
mortal or immortal, to progress 
without a due regard for law and 
without obeying the mandates of the 
Almighty. "The heavens declare 
the glory of God." So does the his- 
tory of His Church the marvelous 
work it has accomplished and is ac- 
complishing demonstrate and de- 
clare that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. In the early days 
of the Church, in the midnight of 
its history, when the prophet Jos- 
eph declared that all the powers of 
the evil one were combined to over- 
throw the Church, God revealed to 
him, in Kirtland, that something 
must be done for the salvation of 
His Church. Did that mean for Jos- 
eph to sit down in idleness, or to 
lose heart ? No, never ! He organ- 
ized that great missionary expedi- 
tion to Great Britain. He sent He- 
ber i C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, and 
others to preach the Gospel to the 
people in England and 'm Europe. 
As a result of that expedition,count- 
less thousands have been converted 
to the truth. I am one individual 
among those countless thousands 
who bless God that Joseph the 
Prophet was inspired to send those 
missionaries over there — for they 
and the men who came after them 
converted my mother. My mother 
taught the Gospel to me, and she re- 
ceived it from the servants of God. 
I would like to mention one incident 
here. I like to acknowledge the 
goodness of the Lord. When 
President Joseph F. Smith was pre- 
siding over the European mission, I 
was a little child. I was very sick, 



so sick that the doctors had given 
me up; they had told mother there 
was no hope for me; but she was 
filled with faith ; she sent for Presi- 
dent Smith. He came and laid his 
hands upon my head and blessed 
me, and promised mother that I 
should live, and by the goodness of 
God I am here today — =the desires 
of my heart being that I may be of 
some little use in the kingdom of 
God. 

I bear you my testimony, my 
brethren and sisters, that President 
Smith is a prophet of God. Strong 
and convincing are the testimonies 
that people receive when they em- 
brace the work of God. Their hearts 
are turned to their fathers, and the 
hearts of the fathers are turned to 
the children. The gift of healing, 
the gift of prophecy, the gift of 
tongues are manifested among those 
who believe; and these gifts, and 
blessings,these testimonies could not 
come, through a counterfeit minis- 
try. The Elders go forth, and by 
the power of the Holy Ghost de- 
clare the word of God, and that 
power carries their words to the 
hearts of the children of men. I tes- 
tify unto you that the authorities of 
this Church are men of God, the 
right men in the right places; and 
when we build them up we build 
ourselves up. No wonder the devil 
is striking at them. It is no new 
thing. The infamous Clark at Far 
West said to the Latter-day Saints, 
"Do away with your presidents, do 
away with your apostles; do away 
with your bishops, and be like other 
people." But we cannot do that, 
brethren and sisters. The man who 
declares he has no faith in the 
Priesthood has no faith in the Gos- 
pel — because they are inseparable. I 
believe in the priesthood; I have 
faith in the servants of God ; and if

the Saints will uphold their hands, 
they will have more influence for 
good in their homes. The man or 
the woman who maligns the Church 
authorities, who- finds fault with"the 
president of their stake, or the 
bishop of their ward, that man and 
woman have not the influence with 
their children that they would have 
if they were loyal to their leaders, 
and thus please God. 

I bear testimony to the truth of 
the Gospel. It is my testimony that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, 
that the leaders of the Church are 
men of God, and that our prophet 
and leader today is a prophet of 
God; and I bear this testimony in 
the fear of the Lord, and in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

itone solo, "Conversion of St. Paul."

Responsibility of parents for conduct 
of children. — Evil effects of reading 
pernicious literature. — Importance 
of Church School education and in- 
fluence. — Benefits of practical train- 
ing in Religion Classes. 

Of the several themes spoken up- 
on by our president, in the opening 
session of this conference, intimat- 
ing that the same might be en- 
larged upon, during the succeeding 
sessions, by other speakers, there 
are none of more importance than 
that of the responsibility resting up- 
on the Latter-day Saints with re- 
spect to the proper bringing up of 
their children and the proper care 
of them. Next to our own salva- 
tion, of interest to us, is the salva- 
tion of our children. Psychologists 
have said that there are three im- 
portant means or agencies potent 



in the education of the child: the 
home, the school, and the church; 
the home first of importance. Na- 
ture has laid the responsibility upon 
parents to care for their offspring 
until they are able to care for them- 
selves ; the law also demands this of 
the citizens; and not the least im- 
portant, in the care which is ex- 
acted is that of the proper religious 
and moral education, as well as the 
secular education that should be 
given to the child. God our Fath- 
er has also exacted of us that we dq 
properly teach our children. He 
has said, in His revelations to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, as recorded 
in the 68th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

"Inasmuch as parents have children 
in Zion, or in any of her stakes which 
are organized, that teach them not to 
understand the doctrine of repentance, 
faith in Christ the Son of the living 
God, and of baptism and the gift of 
the Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands when eight years old, the sin be 
upon the heads of the parents." 

This is a law unto Zion forever; 
and we are commanded to teach our 
children to pray- and to walk up- 
rightly before God. This great re- 
sponsibility rests upon us, and the 
love which parents ought to have 
for their children of itself ought 
to be sufficient incentive and in- 
ducement for them to put forth 
their best endeavors, and use their 
influence with their children, and 
properly teach them in the way that 
they should go. Perhaps the most 
effective means at our command, 
as parents in Israel, for properly in- 
fluencing and bringing up our chil- 
dren, is that of example in the 
home. Children learn by imitation • 
that which they see, thev naturally 
undertake to imitate. Parents who 
know the Gospel is true, if we have 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



accepted it as a reality, we must 
know that it is calculated to make 
us what the Lord would have us 
be — Christ-like in every respect. If 
we are consistent Latter-day Saints, 
we are trying to live by the precepts 
of the Gospel ; and if we are doing 
this in our homes, our children will 
come up in the way they should go, 
without a great deal of preceptive 
teaching. At any rate, our exam- 
ple before our children should har- 
monize with our precepts. 
. A danger which confronts the 
children of the Latter-day Saints, 
I am impressed, is that of reading 
dime novels and literature of that 
caliber. I read, from a Salt Lake 
daily paper, a few days ago, an 
account of a band of boys, ranging 
from fifteen to seventeen years, who 
had been misled in this way. When 
they were discovered, and the place 
of their rendezvous was disclosed; 
it was found that the interior of the 
place was lined with arms and fur- 
nished with a library of dime novels. 
It was learned, by confession of these 
young boys, that they had broken 
into stores and residences on nu- < 
merous occasions, that they had 
stolen from their neighbors. One 
young boy admitted that they had 
contemplated robbing his mother, 
and when the question was asked, 
"What would you have done had 
she resisted?" the ready response 
was, "We would haye killed her." 
This, I take it, is largely the re- 
sult of reading such literature as 
was found in the dugout which they 
frequented. We are told in prov- 
erbs,' "As a man thinketh in his 
heart, so is he." James Allen, treat- 
ing this subject, tells us that "char- 
acter is the entire sum of our 
thoughts." I desire to read one or 
two of his sentiments along this 
line ; he says : 



"As the plant springs from and 
could not be without the seed, so 
every act of a man springs from the 
hidden seeds of thought, and could not 
have appeared without them. This 
applies equally to those acts called 
spontaneous and unpremeditated, as 
to those which are deliberately exe- 
cuted. Act is the blossom of thought, 
and joy and suffering are its fruits. 
Thus does a man garner in the sweet 
and bitter fruitage of his own hus- 
bandry. A noble and godlike charac- 
ter is not a thing of favor or chance, 
but is the natural result of continued 
effort in right thinking, the fruit of 
long cherished association with god- 
like thoughts." 

Brethren and sisters, I think it is 
of the utmost importance that we 
choose for our children the books 
which they read ; and that we choose 
for them as far as lies in our power 
the associations that they keep. 
The public schools, maintained as 
they are by public taxation, are by 
law forbidden teaching religion in 
those schools. The result is an ex- 
clusively secular education, an edu- 
cation godless in its character; and 
such an education is most imperfect. 
What, then, are the schools going 
to do for us in the proper education 
of our children ? Who has not 
looked upon his little boy or girl, 
five or six years of age, the child 
approaching the years when he or 
she will be expected to enter the 
district school, but experiences a 
great deal of concern and anxiety, 
fearing that the morals of that child 
may be weakened, instead of being 
stimulated and encouraged, by at- 
tendance at the district schools. The 
restrictive influence in the school- 
room is scarcely sufficient to over- 
come the unhallowed and unwhole- 
some environment often encoun- 
tered on the playground. The 
church, then, has something to do 
as also the home, for they are to 
supply the entire moral needs of the

child. The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints has undertak- 
en to do this mighty work for those 
who have gotten beyond the grades 
and have reached the high-school 
period. We have established Church 
schools throughout the land, some 
thirty in number, accommodating 
something like eight or ten thou- 
sand boys and girls, principally sons 
and daughters of the Latter-day 
Saints; there are some exceptions, 
and those schools are making con- 
verts of some of these exceptions. 
It was but a few days ago I learned 
of one young man here in Salt Lake 
being baptized into the Church as 
the result of his attendance at the 
Church school, having come from 
abroad and of non-Mormon par- 
entage. Such is the influence, in 
part, that these schools are exercis- 
ing upon those who attend them. 

At a recent convention of educa- 
tors, held in the East, Professor 
Horace H. Cummings, the superin- 
tendent of our Church schools, 
made a statement before that body 
that, of the four hundred teachers 
engaged in the Latter-day Saints' 
Church Schools, not one of them 
is a user of tobacco. Those edu- 
cators were staggered by this state- 
ment, but not so much, perhaps, as 
by the statement which followed 
that of the ten thousand students 
who are attending these academies 
and colleges of the Church school 
system, not above one per cent of 
them were using tobacco. This 
statement found its way into the 
Associated Press and has gone out 
to the world, and the whole educa- 
tional world wonders at conditions 
in Zion. What Brother Cummings 
said in regard to tobacco, I have no 
doubt, could be said with equal 
truth with respect to the use of 
alcoholic drinks of every form. 



They are practically eliminated 
from use by teachers and students ; 
and so many other virtues are 
taught and practiced in these 
schools, that we feel that those who 
have the opportunity of attending, 
and who do attend, are well looked 
after, and are receiving an educa- 
tion of which their parents may 
justly be proud. But there are a 
host yet who have not this opportu- 
nity, and as we have not sufficient 
funds to increase the number of 
schools, and place them where all 
our children of the high school 
grade can have access to them, we 
are extending the Religion Class 
work into some of those districts, 
teaching the advanced grades ; and 
we expect to do more in that line. 

But what about all those who are 
being taught in the grades of the 
district schools, who are numbered, 
perhaps, by hundreds of thousands ? 
What is the Church going to do for 
them? I answer that the Same in- 
spiration which has brought forth 
the Church school, which is doing 
such a mighty work among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, the fruits of it being 
seen on every hand, at home and in 
the mission field abroad, that same 
inspiration has established an or- 
ganization for small children, which 
I feel will be, eventually, as far 
reaching as are the present Church 
schools; I refer to the Religion 
Classes. It is designed, in the or- 
ganization of these classes, that 
there shall be a religion class taught 
at the conclusion of each day's dis- 
trict school work. At present we 
are advocating the holding of onlv 
one session a week. We will be 
glad when we have accomplished 
this in all the wards of Zion; it 
hasn't been fully accomplished yet. 
We desire the Bishops and their 
counselors, and the presidents of 



82

stakes, to join us in this very impor- 
tant labor. We feel that no presi- 
dency of a stake should be satisfied 
until every ward in the stake has a 
religion class, so that the children 
may have equal privileges with oth- 
ers throughout the land. When this 
is attained, we will all the time be 
working along the line of profici- 
ency, the best methods of prosecut- 
ing our work; we will be teach- 
ing, in our Church schools, educa- 
tors who will labor as instructors 
in the Religion classes. We will 
make steady progress, and the time 
will come when we will have a Re- 
ligion class, practically, in each of 
the organized wards of the Church, 
conducted five days of every week 
during the district school terms. 
This is our aim, our object, and pur- 
pose ; assuredly it is a laudable and 
praiseworthy one I do not see how 
any father or mother in Israel can 
help but see the necessity for this 
organization, and for their support- 
ing the same, placing their children 
where they can enjoy its benefits. 

We have other auxiliary organi- 
zations in the Church — the Primary 
association, which is of wider range 
at present than the Religion classes, 
and has greater numbers; and we 
have the Sunday School, which 
numbers many more. I desire to 
say ,to you that progress is being 
made in the Religion class work, 
and I think I would not be mis- 
taken in my assertion that during 
the past year our increase in per- 
centage of enrollment will exceed 
that of any other of the auxiliary 
associations of the Church. We are 
making headway. These other or- 
ganizations teach the theory, the- 
ology if you please, while the Re- 
ligion class teaches religion. Faith 
comes from hearing, but knowledge 
comes from doing, and in the Re- 



ligion classes we are teaching the 
children how to do. I heard one 
of the mission presidents state, in a 
meeting held with the members .of 
the Council of the Twelve, just re- 
cently, that our boys who go out in- 
to the mission field are not sufficient- 
ly familiar with the ordinances they 
have to perform. They need more 
training in the Religion classes and 
other organizations of the Church. 
That is the very work we are un- 
dertaking to do. We teach the chil- 
dren how to ask a blessing upon the 
food, how to pray in the family, 
how to open or close a meeting, 
to repeat the exact words that 
should be used in asking the bless- 
ing upon the bread and the water 
in the administration of the sacra- 
ment, and how to administer the or- 
dinance of baptism. These things 
are taught to them -practically, and 
we teach them to live the Gospel. 
I will read just two or three maxims 
from our outlines, showing the char- 
acter of the work that we design to 
do: 

"The aim and object of this work is 
not so much to teach pupils to know- 
as to lead them to do and to form 
proper habits of life; and there should 
be constantly in the mind of the teach- 
er this thought: Each of these lessons 
has for its purpose the forming of 
some religious habit. To encourage 
proper application of these lessons, re- 
view, at the beginning of each session, 
the assignment of outside work given 
at last meeting. All work outside of 
class should consist not in the prepar- 
ations of lessons but in the practical 
application of truths learned. Teach- 
ers remember that this course is a 
training in practical work and habits, 
and not merely the teaching of Gospel 
lessons. Training in practical religious 
habits is the work of the Religion 
class. Habits depend on many suc- 
cessive repetitions of the same act." 

There are other maxims that are 
beautiful and worthy the considera-

tion of the Latter-day Saints, but 
time will not permit me to read 
them on this occasion. I invite the 
support of the Latter-day Saints to 
this very important movement — 
the Religion classes — and bespeak 
your interest in the education of the 
right kind that is given to your chil- 
dren therein. May God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, and bless 
those who are engaged in the im- 
portant labor in this and all the oth- 
er organizations of the Church, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mis- 
sion.) 

Tf there is anything that would 
strengthen the testimony of an El- 
der in the Church, outside of the 
mission field, it would be to see this 
vast congregation here today. It is 
a testimony to me that the Lord 
knew what He was doing, when 
He delivered His message unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and that the 
time had fully arrived when the 
Gospel of His kingdom should be 
again established in the earth. 

In the mission field where I la- 
bor we are close to many places of 
interest, connected with the organ- 
ization of the Church and the early 
travels of the Saints, especially in 
the state of Missouri. We are on 
the ground where the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith once lived with the peo- 
ple, where he labored, and preached. 
Over there in the city of Inde- 
pendence, Missouri, I scarcely ever- 
pass the court house, but what 
I think of the time when he was 
brought down from Far West and 



exhibited, almost like a wild beast, 
for the people to look at who de- 
sired to see the Mormon prophet. 
I had the privilege of meeting a 
lady, once, whose father was one of 
those mobbers. She told me she re- 
membered that, when she was a 
child, her father carried out coals 
from the fire-place to light the ci- 
gars of those men who brought the 
Prophet Joseph from Far West. 
She also told me that her father 
was one of the men who tarred and 
feathered Bishop Partridge at In- 
dependence. We questioned her 
about this and asked her what she 
thought of such a proceeding. She 
said she did not think it was right, 
but that they were all excited over 
this new religion. It had caused 
more or less excitement, especially 
in the section where she lived. 

My testimony is the Lord did 
reveal unto the Prophet Joseph 
Smith the everlasting Gospel, as 
we read in the writings of Saint 
John: 

"I saw another angel fly through 
the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach unto them 
that dwell upon the earth, saying with 
a loud voice, Fear God and give glory 
to Him, for the hour of His judgment 
is come." 

My testimony is that that angel 
has flown, that the Gospel con- 
tained in the Book of Mormon is 
the Gospel that the angel delivered 
here on the earth; again, that the 
Gospel that was taught by Christ 
the Lord was restored to the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith, and is the same, in 
the Book of Mormon as in the New 
Testament. As a result of that 
teaching, many thousands of men 
and women have accepted the Gos- 
pel through the testimony pro- 
claimed by the Elders who -have 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



gone out and borne that testimony 
fearlessly among the children of 
men. Personally, there has been 
nothing that has ever given me so 
much joy and satisfaction, or paid 
me better, than the time I have 
expended in the mission field travel- 
ing among the people. There is 
nothing that could purchase that ex- 
perience. I have walked and car- 
ried my grip from house to house, 
in the mission field, visiting the peo- 
ple and bearing my testimony unto 
them, proving unto them that the 
Gospel is again on the earth, togeth- 
er with the power to teach it. When 
I have seen men and women, whom 
I personally visited, go down into 
the waters of baptism, and after- 
ward living the Gospel of Christ to 
the be.st of their ability, gathered to- 
gether in little bands,or in hundreds, 
teaching their children to observe 
the laws and commandments that 
were given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, it has paid me more than 
anything else I could have been en- 
gaged in. There is nothing to equal 
it upon the earth. 

I am thoroughly convinced that 
this is the Gospel of Christ. The 
Lord has revealed it unto me by the 
power of His Spirit. I know that 
He does live, and that His author- 
ity is here in the earth today. This 
authority has been with the people 
from the beginning. The Church 
which Joseph Smith, the Mormon 
Prophet, presided over, the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
is the Church of God. He never 
ordained, or set apart, or delegated 
any man in this dispensation to pre- 
side over any other Church than the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith died the president of it; he 
died the Prophet of the, Lord, the 



head of the institution that the Lord 
gave him the authority to organize. 
When a man finds the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
he finds the authority and Priest- 
hood of God on earth, a^id the pow- 
er to administer in the ordinances 
thereof. He will find this authority 
in no other j I know this is correct. 
This testimony that has been im- 
parted unto us has made us strong, 
and this strength and unity has 
made the world admire us. We do 
not now meet the prejudice today 
that prevailed just a few years ago, 
even in the beginning of my own 
experience. Men and women are 
beginning to look more favorably 
upon the principles of the Gospel 
that we proclaim. This constant 
work that is being carried on by 
the Latter-day Saints is having its 
effect upon the minds of the think- 
ing people of the world. Elders 
who travel here and there, two by 
two, canvassing in a systematic 
manner, visiting the people in their 
homes, in the cities and in the towns, 
in the country everywhere, bear 
their testimony, and it is having 
its effect upon the minds of the chil- 
dren of men. 

The Lord has said that this Gos- 
pel of the kingdom should be 
preached in all the world, as a wit- 
ness to all nations, before the end' 
shall come. The Gospel is the pow- 
er of God unto salvation. President 
Smith said that "Mormonism is the 
power of God unto salvation," and it 
is true, for the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and Mormonism are the 
same. I love the word; it gives 
prestige wherever I go; it is the big- 
gest thing in the world; there is 
nothing to equal it. I know that it 
is right, and I know that salvation 
is obtained by a continual observ-

ance of the principles and doctrines 
of Christ. A man can be saved no 
faster than he gains knowledge, Jos- 
eph Smith told us so, and it is cor- 
rect. It is my testimony that a man 
■ who serves the Lord will gain sal- 
vation, and that salvation will bring 
for him an inheritance in the king- 
dom of our God. I trust that the 
Latter-day Saints may be faithful; 
that their treasure shall be the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of Christ, that 
their hearts may be with that treas- 
ure ; and that we may value it suf- 
ficiently, for there is nothing to 
equal it under the sun. The man 
or woman who goes through this 
life without having a knowledge of 
the Gospel has missed an experi- 
ence that is priceless. We go 
through this life only once ; I never 
expect to travel this road in mortal- 
ity again. 

I trust that I shall be faithful all 
the days of my life; that I shall 
never utter a word that will cause 
a man younger or older than my- 
self to mistrust or criticize the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church, in 
the wards, in the stakes of Zion, 
or anywhere. I endorse, hearti- 
ly, the remarks of Brother Callis 
along this line. A man that will 
sustain his Bishop, that will go to 
him first and not go over his head, 
is one of the best men in that ward, 
his influence for good will be felt 
as he travels along in life. 

I pray the Lord to bless this body 
of people, to bless all Israel, to bless 
the missionaries in the world. I 
ask the prayers of the Saints upon 
the Elders of Israel, and I say unto 
you, write them good letters; fill 
them full of faith, and encourage 
them. You are able to do it. Many 
of them are boys, and they need 
your assistance : they need the as- 



sistance of every man and woman in 
the Church, to make them equal to 
the occasion. The Lord is the au- 
thor of this work ; He is behind it ; 
He is with those Elders, and He 
makes them strong ; but we can our- 
selves help them very materially by 
giving them good counsel from 
home. May the Lord bless us, I 
ask it, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

A gathering, not a scattering, dispen- 
sation. — Man's ways not God's ways. 
— The strength of Mormonism. 

Many years ago, on a hot and 
sleepy day, President Daniel H. 
Wells was speaking from this stand, 
and right behind him, fast asleep, 
sat President Heber C. Kimball. 
As soon as Brother Wells had con- 
cluded his discourse, President 
Young tapped Brother Kimball on 
the shoulder, woke him, and asked 
him to be the succeeding speaker. 
President Kimball arose, and the 
first words he uttered were : "I 
bear testimony to the truth of all 
that Brother Wells has said. I did 
not hear it, but I have full confi- 
dence in the man." 

I would not have you infer, breth- 
ren and sisters, that I have been 
asleep while others have been speak- 
ing ; I have not, but it fell to my lot 
on yesterday to take charge of an 
overflow meeting in the Assembly 
Hall. Consequently, I was not here 
to listen to the remarks made from 
this stand at that time, but I be- 
lieve they were all true, I have con- 
fidence in the men who spoke to you. 
I know we had a good time in the 
Assembly Hall, and T believe you 
had a good time here. 'In fact, noth- 
ing has been said during this confer- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ence that I cannot say amen to, and 
echo from the depths of my heart. 
From the opening address by Pres- 
ident Smith, my soul has been fed 
and benefited by what I have heard. 

I was particularly impressed with 
the remarks made by the President, 
wherein he reminded us that, this is 
a gathering not a scattering dispen- 
sation. There have been times in 
the history of the house of Israel, 
when it was necessary that God's 
people should be scattered. There 
was a divine purpose in their dis- 
persion. That nation was martyred 
for the sake of all other nations. 
But the scattering of Israel is an 
event of the past ; these are the days 
of the gathering of Israel. 

There is nothing so broad and 
comprehensive as the Gospel of 
Christ. My soul rejoices in the height 
and depth and breadth of the mission 
of the Savior. At the same time, I 
recognize that we must practice con- 
centration, or our work will be in 
vain. We cannot expect to save 
others unless our own feet are firm- 
ly planted on the rock. We cannot 
afford to spread abroad until we 
have the necessary numbers and 
strength to make such movements 
effective. It would defeat the pur- 
pose of this work if we were to scat- 
ter to the four winds and try to 
leaven at once the whole lump, 
while the lump is too large to be 
leavened, or we are too small to 
leaven it. Some things grow thin- 
ner and weaker the more they are 
spread, and concentration as well as 
comprehensiveness is necessary in 
the work of the Lord. Some may 
think the proper policy for the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to pursue is to scat- 
ter their forces, in order to fulfill 
their destiny. But the man at our 
head knows, and all Latter-day 
Saints ought to know, that these 



things must be done in wisdom and 
prudence, and according to the will 
of the Lord. 

Before the days of the great 
Napoleon, it was customary in mili- 
tary tactics to charge with lines 
drawn out, fronting the whole van 
of the enemy. Napoleon inaugurat- 
ed a change. He invented charg- 
ing in column; forming his troops 
into a mighty wedge and thrust- 
ing it irresistibly into the ranks of 
the foe, splitting them asunder, and 
then beating them in detail. I be- 
lieve that to be the proper method of 
fighting the adversary of all right- 
eousness — to make our ranks close 
and compact, form them into ia 
wedge to be driven against the. en- 
emy, instead of spreading too far, 
and allowing ourselves to be divided 
and scattered to the four winds. 

"As the heavens are higher than 
the earth, so the ways of God are 
above the ways of man." So said 
one of the ancient prophets, and the 
proverb has found many exemplifi- 
cations. The latest illustration of 
it to me came during a recent con- 
versation on a railroad train, in the 
state of Idaho. A gentleman, who 
had sat with me in the diner, and 
heard me say that I was a native of 
Salt Lake City, 'after I had resumed 
my seat in another part of the 
train, rejoined me, and said, "I in- 
fer that you are a Mormon." I an- 
swered in the affirmative. He then 
continued : "I have conversed with 
many of your people and with some 
of your leading men," and he men- 
tioned, particularly, Rulon S. Wells, 
with whom he had had business re- 
lations. He went on to say, "I have 
often thought I would like to bring 
to the attention of your leaders an 
idea that has occupied my mind for 
a long while. I am a student of 
sociological questions, and am much

interested in colonization work. I 
recognize that the Mormon people 
have been more successful in this 
direction than any other people I 
know of, and have often wondered, 
while witnessing your struggles, the 
hardships and privations of your 
people and your missionaries, why 
you did not get some of the wealthy 
philanthropists of America or other 
nations, to help you. There is Ba- 
ron Hirsch. He has been trying to 
colonize the poor Jews, the surplus 
population of large cities, upon 
farms. He has expended millions 
of dollars in this direction, and has 
measurably failed ; but you Mor- 
mons have succeeded without his 
millions. I have wondered why you 
did not form some sort of combina- 
tion with such men ; let them fur- 
nish the millions; you do the work, 
and make it a stipulation that these 
people whom you gather out from 
the cities and set to tilling the soil 
shall all become Mormons. In this 
manner you could build up your 
church much more rapidly than you 
are doing now." 

It reminded me of that scene in 
Shakespeare's "Merchant of Ven- 
ice," where the Jew, Shylock, con- 
victed of conspiring for the death 
of Antonio, finds himself confronted 
by the judgment, which takes half 
his property for the state, gives the 
other half to Antonio, and adds the 
sentence, that the Jew "shall pres- 
ently become a Christian." As if, 
forsooth, Christians could be made 
by judicial decree, or legislative en- 
actment. I thought it equally 
strange, — and yet, not strange, from 
the standpoint of this gentleman, — 
that it should be thought Mormons 
could be made in that manner, that 
we could manufacture converts by 
taking the surplus population of 
large cities, placing them upon 



farms, and exacting from them in 
return the promise that they would 
be Latter-day Saints. 

I answered the gentleman to this 
effect : "You remind me, Mr. Dav- 
enport" — for that was his name — 
"of a conversation I once had with 
a gentleman in the Eastern States. 
He had noticed just what you have 
observed, and wondered why we 
preached the Gospel to the poor and 
lowly. 'Why not fly for higher 
game,' he asked. 'Why not convert 
the leaders of , rociety ? Why not 
convert a Henry Ward Beecher? 
His whole congregation would fol- 
low him into the Church — and see. 
how you could augment your num- 
bers and increase your power?' I 
explained to him the dispersion and 
gathering of Israel, quoting the 
words of the ancient prophet: 
'Hear the word of the Lord, O ye 
nations, and declare it in the isles 
afar off, and say, He that scattered 
Israel will gather him and keep him 
as a shepherd doth his flock." "I will 
take you one of a city, and two of 
a family, and I will bring you to 
Zion and give you pastors after 
mine own heart." I expounded to 
him the Gospel of faith, repentance, 
baptism, and the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, showing that men and wom- 
en become Latter-day Saints, not to 
better their temporal condition, not 
for the wealth of the world, nor the 
honors of men, but for the love of 
God, the love of truth, and right- 
eousness ; that every man, woman, 
and child converted to Mormonism 
has a conviction that it is God's 
truth, God's work; and that this is 
the real strength of the Church. 
That we preach the Gospel to all 
men, rich and poor, high and low, 
and promise a personal testimony 
to all who will embrace it." 

I am not optimistic enough — if 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that is the right word to use— to 
imagine that a Gentile can take a 
Mormon view of this subject. Views 
differ according to the standpoint 
from which they are taken. Down 
here, among the mists and vapors of 
mortality, we cannot hope to see as 
clearly and fully as God sees, who 
sits upon the summit of wisdom and 
intelligence. We must not expect 
too much of the unenlightened 
world; but from those whom God 
has touched with His finger, upon 
whom He has conferred the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, — from them we 
may reasonably expect that they will 
take God's view, rather than man's. 

It is thought by the world that 
the strength of Mormonism, lies in 
the fact that a few shrewd and sa- 
gacious men have misled tens of 
thousands of poor, simple-minded 
people, having no minds of their 
own, who have come into the 
Church because they thought they 
could better their material condi- 
tion, or because of some influence, 
hypnotic or otherwise, that great 
minds exercise over small ones. 
This is a human view. It is a hu- 
man view that it would be better to 
convert holus bolus, on the flock- 
following-the-shepherd principle, in- 
stead of taking one of a city.two of 



a family, and bringing them to Zi- 
on in God's appointed way. The 
strength of this work does not con- 
sist in the fallacy that a few lead- 
ers, however shrewd and sagacious, 
tyrannize over the people, pushing 
and holding them together. That is 
not the cohesive power of Mormon- 
ism ; rather is it that in the heart of 
every man, woman, and child that 
has received the Gospel of Christ, 
there burns a personal individual 
testimony that this is God's work; 
and against this power, the rock- 
built principle of revelation the 
gates of hell cannot prevail. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith read 
an announcement concerning the 
approaching visits of the represen- 
tatives of the government among 
the people for the purpose of taking 
the census. He said the people 
should answer the questions of the 
authorized census takers,who would 
show their authority for doing the 
work. 

The choir sang the anthem/'From 
afar, gracious Lord, Thou didst 
gather Thy flock." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis Anderson. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a.m. Wednesday, April 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



Wednesday, April 6th, 10 a.m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, 
Feed us till the Savior comes. 

Prayer was offered by Elder L. 
W. Shurtliff. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O, say, what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 

And priceless the value of truth will 
be when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mis- 
sion.) 

One of the Apostles of the Sa- 
vior, who lived anciently, was cast 
upon a desolate island; and during 
the time of his banishment he was 
visited by a holy being, whom bp 
was about to worship, but this 
heavenly messenger spoke to him 
and reminded him that he should 
not worship this individual, as he 
was but one of his brethren, one 
of the prophets who had once lived 



upon the earth. He invited the 
Apostle to come up with him and 
a vision from the Father would be 
opened to his view, and he would 
have the privilege of looking down 
through the stream of time, witness- 
ing the events that should transpire 
in the future. Among other things 
he saw the time, near the close of 
this world's mortal history', at an 
hour when God's judgments were 
about to be poured out upon the in- 
habitants of the earth, when an an- 
gel would leave his place in heaven 
and bring back to the earth the ev- 
erlasting Gospel ; the same one that 
this Apostle was himself engaged 
in preaching. This body of peo- 
ple delight in singing hymns con- 
cerning the restoration of the Gos- 
pel. Among others, one of the fa- 
vorite hymns is : 

"What was witnessed in the heavens? 

Why, an angel, earthward bound. 
Had he something with him bringing? 

Yes — the Gospel — joyful sound! 
It was to be preached in power ' 

On the earth, the angel said, 
To all men, all tongues and nations 

That upon its face are spread." 

Then another favorite hymn 
starts in this way : 

"An angel from on high, 
The long, long silence broke 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words he spoke: 

Lo! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 

A sacred record lies concealed." 

Then again, we delight in sing- 
ing: 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"An angel came down from the man- 
sions of glory, 

And told that a record was hid in Cu- 
morah, 

Containing our Savior's most glorious 
Gospel— 

And also the cov'nant to gather His 
people 

O Israel! O Israel! in all your abid- 
ings, 

Prepare for your Lord, when you hear 
these glad tidings." 

I wonder if we fully appreciate 
the responsibility that rests upon us 
when we sing these hymns, and 
when our eyes rest upon this rec- 
ord, the Book of Mormon, which 
contains the fulness of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, as He delivered it 
to the ancient inhabitants of this 
part of the earth. Do we fully ap- 
preciate the fact that we are, in- 
deed, living in the day that was 
looked upon by John the Revelator, 
when he saw another angel flying 
through the midst of heaven, hav- 
ing the everlasting Gospel that was 
to be preached to every nation, 
every kindred, every tongue and 
every people that existed upon the 
earth. Where much is given, much 
is required. Those who have been 
warned have a responsibility resting 
upon them, they are commanded 
that they shall warn their neighbors. 
Those who have been born and 
reared within the pale of this 
Church should realize that they owe 
a debt of gratitude that must be 
paid to the children of the world, 
that they must perform the work of 
reciprocity in doing unto others 
what others have done unto them. 
Those who enjoy comfortable 
homes, who are surrounded with 
happiness, who have a desire to 
thank God, in their hearts, for the 
surroundings that they have, owe 
it all to the inspiration of this Book 
of Mormon, to the preaching of the 



Gospel that was delivered, as found 
in this record, by an angel that 
came from God and visited the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. The inspir- 
ation of this book has gone to every 
nation, every kindred, every tongue, 
and every people. It is that which 
has brought our fathers and our 
mothers to know each other; and 
there are a very few who are before 
me today who do not owe their very 
existence to the inspiration of this 
record. The promise is made here, 
that wherever it is read with ? 
prayerful heart, the Spirit of God 
will bear witness that it was 
brought forth by the inspiration of 
His power. 

Every individual should have an 
ambition to do something toward 
the spread of the information con- 
tained in this book, to others who 
at present are in ignorance of th~ 
precious truths contained within the 
lids of this divine record. There 
are a great many people who shu^ 
missionary work. I want to tell 
you that it should be the prayer of 
your hearts that God may open 
your way, that you may have a part 
in this glorious work, that you 
might be an instrument in the hands 
of God in pointing out the way for 
others to come, that they and their 
children after them might rise up 
and say, Blessed be the work of 
the Elders in the Church, who car- 
ried the Gospel to the doors of bur 
fathers. It was the work of men 
commonly known as the Mormon 
Elders that brought the Gospel to 
my father, who was born in Ken- 
tucky, — brought the Gospel to m 
mother, who was born in Illinois, — 
brought the Gospel to her parents, 
born in South Carolina. I want t~ 
tell you that it brought the Gospel 
to my father's parents — Kentuck- 
ians and Irish, and that tells you the 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



91 



story, that the best blood of this 
world is mixed up in these little 
veins of mine. (Laughter.) While 
a South Carolinan and a Kentucki- 
an and an Irish mixture may be a 
little warm at times, (laughter) I 
am proud of every drop of it. 

I thank God that I have had the 
privilege of bearing witness to the 
restoration of this Gospel, for 
many years, in the missionary field. 
I have performed missions under 
the presidency of John Taylor, Wil- 
ford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and 
President Joseph F. Smith ; and if I 
always feel as I feel now, and I 
hope that I will, I trust that I will 
continue to fulfill missions in the 
interest of the spread of the Gos- 
pel under every president of the 
Church until I am gathered home to 
my fathers. For ten years and a 
half I had the privilege of preaching 
this Gospel to the people . of the 
southland, and I desire to pay a 
compliment to those people. There 
is a great improvement in that 
country. When T went there, it was 
not nearly so bad the prejudice was 
not so deeply rooted as in the days 
of John Morgan, B. H. Roberts, 
Golden Kimball and others who had 
charge of the work during what 
was known as the "shot-gun pe- 
riod." During the early experi- 
ence of myself I became acquainted, 
noon more than one occasion, with 
these kinds of weapons, while sur- 
rounded with mobs armed to the 
teeth, I had other southerners come 
to me and offer their lives in my 
defense, although they were not 
members of the Church. While I 
was laboring in the South, I was 
in the habit of paying a tribute to 
the people of the South. I want to 
. nav a tribute to them now, as. the 
most God-fearing people, as a com- 
munity, that I ever did missionary 



work among. They love to hear a 
man preach from the word of God ; 
and the Lord prospered me while 
I was in that land. During the ten 
years and a half of my presidency 
we sold 25,000 Books of Mormon ; 
we sold 15,000 of Orson Pratt's 
Works, 160,000 Voice of Warn- 
ing, 150,000 Mr. Durant of Salt 
Lake City, 25,000 hymn books, 40,- 
000 miscellaneous books; distribut- 
ed 3,500,000 Gospel tracts, and 
there were 6,800 honest-hearted 
souls who walked down into the wa- 
ters of baptism, and were born of 
the water and of the spirit. 

I want to tell you that as good 
as this work has been done, I look 
forward to the time, in the terri- 
tory where I am now laboring, for 
it to be even greater. The Elders 
throughout the New England states 
and throughout the eastern states 
are received by the people kindly. 
Last summer 65 per cent of all the 
Elders in that mission traveled ab- 
solutely without money, and they 
were entertained by the sons and 
daughters of God. The work thev 
is growing. In the country where 
the Prophet and the Patriarch were 
both born, where the angel brought 
this book, where God the Father 
and the Son paid their visit to the 
young Prophet, where the Priest- 
hood of God was restored, where 
the Church was organized, there 
are thousands who are today hun- 
gry to hear the word of God. There 
is a great and a mighty field for 
work. We are in need of workers, 
and if you cannot help it in one 
way, you can help it in another. I 
want to pay a tribute to a little lady 
that lives across the road from the 
Temple block, on the west — Sister 
Watson. She hasn't a son, — but, 
God bless that little woman, for 
four years she has maintained a mis-

sionary who has labored in the mis- 
sionary field, calling him her boy. 
She has supported him, sending him 
monthly allowances, and in numer- 
ous ways helping to spread the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. I had an Elder 
come to me a short time ago, in 
New York, a man with very limit- 
ed education, but a heart burning 
with prayer to God, and anxious 
that every one of his sons should be 
in the missionary field, and he told 
Brother Levi Edgar Young and 
myself of the conditions. There 
were two men there — stalwarts in 
preaching the Gospel — but on ac- 
count of finance it was deemed wise 
to send them home, even against 
their will. This individual said, 
"Let me maintain these men, and 
one more, in the missionary field, 
while I go home and prepare my 
sons as I myself ought to have been 
prepared years ago." After praying 
and consulting over it, he went 
home, he has three able represen- 
tatives in the missionary field to- 
day. 

You can all do something. You 
owe it to your God. Some day we 
have got to give an account for 
every idle word spoken, and for all 
our acts upon the earth. We must 
do our share in preaching this Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, because we 
know it is true. Speaking person- 
ally about this work, I have figured 
it out, and I know it is true. No 
man has told me; I received it as 
Paul received his testimony, — not 
from man. I know as I know that 
I stand here, that God Almighty 
visited Joseph Smith, that he was a 
Prophet of God and is a Prophet of 
God, and will always stand at the 
head of the greatest dispensation 
that this world ever saw. I know, 
too, that his successors, after his 



martyrdom, as each man came, was 
the man that God wanted; and I 
know that the man who stands here 
today as the head of the Church, is 
the man that God wants, that He 
has chosen. It is the work of the 
adversary to try to creep in be- 
tween that individual and the peo- 
ple of God. That has always been 
the work of the evil one; and he 
holds out false promises to the peo- 
ple as an inducement to get them to 
turn their backs upon the prophet of 
Almighty God, just as he held out 
false promises to the Savior Himself 
when he took Him up on the top 
of the mountain and showed Him 
the glories of the world and prom.7 
ised to give them all to Him, if He 
would fall down and worship him. 
The old sinner never owned a foot 
of it. (Laughter). He is like a 
great many men — anxious and al- 
ways willing to give away things 
belonging to other people. But if 
you want a portion of this earth and 
the fulness thereof, you will have it 
by being true to your covenants, 
this will be your future inheritance 
— this earth and the fulness thereof 
will sometime be given to the Saints 
of the most high God, and they will 
possess it forever and forever. If 
you keep the faith, eternal heaven 
will be this globe from which your 
bodies were made, and it will be 
your Kolob forever and forever. 

May God bless this work; may 
God bless the prophets, seers, and 
revelators who rule over it. May 
we always love them, and let the 
world know that we do love them, 
and not be ashamed of it. I would 
rather take the counsel, and advice 
of President Joseph F. Smith than 
that of any man on this earth; and 
if some people don't like it, they can 
lump it. (Laughter.) Amen.

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

( President of Northern States Mis- 
sion.) 

In facing the Latter-day Saints 
here this morning, I was reminded 
of the 14th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, and wondered in my 
soul what the feelings of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith would be if he 
could be in attendance here, or if 
he had the privilege of living to see, 
in part, the promises of our Fath- 
er fulfilled that were made to him 
and the early Elders of the Church. 
I would like to read to you the first 
few verses of a revelation which 
was given June, 1829: 

"A ' great and marvelous work is 
about to come forth unto the children 
of men. 

"Behold, I am God, and give heed 
to my word, which is quick and pow- 
erful, sharper than a two-edged sword, 
to the dividing asunder of both joints 
and marrow; therefore give heed unto 
my word. 

"Behold, the field is white already 
to harvest, therefore, whoso desireth 
to reap let him thrust in his sickle 
with his might, and reap while the 
day lasts, that he may treasure up . for 
his soul everlasting salvation in the 
kingdom of God; 

"Yea, whosoever will thrust in his 
sickle and reap, the same is called of 
God; 

"Therefore, if you will ask of me 
you shall receive, if you will knock it 
shall be opened unto you. 

"Seek to bring forth and establish 



my Zion. Keep my commandments 
in all things; 

"And, if you keep my command- 
ments and endure to the end, you 
shall have eternal life, which gift is 
the greatest of all the gifts of God." 

Two weeks ago last Sunday, I 
stood on the spot where the last 
time the remains of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and his brother Hy- 
rum were known to rest. I was 
:n the company of two old men. I 
heard them tell the story of those 
who lived there after the Saints left 
the beautiful city of Nauvoo. My 
mind has rested upon the great 
work that was done by the Proph- 
et of the last century. How his 
heart would throb with joy, and 
what a satisfaction he would feel 
today, if he could view in life this 
great body of men and women gath- 
ered together as the result- of the 
work the Lore! did through him. 
I can hardly believe that in his 
early manhood he conceived the ex- 
tent of the great work that has been 
done in the last eighty years. How 
happy the six members who were 
instrumental in the organization of 
the Church would be if they could 
behold the hundreds of thousands 
of people who have received the 
same testimony that they received in 
listening to the word of the Lord 
through that humble instrument. I 
have met people in the east who 
once believed that Mormonism was 
a thing of a transitory nature. A 
certain , class of them believe that 
after the death of the Prophet, the 
Church was left in darkness for 
many years, in fact until the re-or- 
ganization received its tardy birth 
after sixteen years of dissolution. 
But this is not so, for God's proph- 
et told the truth when he declared 
that "in the days of, these kings 
shall the God of heaven set 



94

up a kingdom never more to be 
thrown down nor given to another 
people." The work that the Proph- 
et Joseph and those who labored 
with him did, under the direction of 
our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, 
was the work that was never more 
to be thrown down nor given to an- 
other people. In poverty these peo- 
ple, chosen to lay the foundation of 
God's work, began to build the city 
of Kirtland, on a most beautiful 
spot. Considering their financial 
condition it is awe-inspiring to vis- 
it it. This first temple, which still 
stands, gives evidence of perman- 
ency typical of the great work en- 
trusted to them. Again, the streets 
of old Nauvoo, together with those 
old homes bear evidence that all 
work done by our worthy parents 
was of a permanent character. 
While we did not stay and inhabit 
the cities that our parents struggled 
hard to build and beautify, yet we 
learn to build by building, we learn 
to beautify by doing that kind of 
work, and all of this has prepared 
the Saints of the Lord for the work 
required. The trees are now grown 
through the curb-stones, and many 
of the houses that were builded 
then have tumbled down, but those 
that remain bear silent testimony, 
which speaks volumes for the early 
Latter-day Saints, that everything 
they did was of a permanent nature 
and was done to the glory of our 
Father. The spirit that built Nau- 
voo was the spirit that carried the 
Saints across the plains, and the 
spirit that carried them on that long 
and weary journey, a pilgrimage 
that has been unequalled in the his- 
tory of this world, is the spirit that 
cleared the sage-brush, dug the can- 
als, planted the trees, ,md built tem- 
ples to the most high God. The 
spirit that built these temples, and 



these cities,, and redeemed the des- 
ert, is the spirit that has carried 
the missionaries to the ends of the 
earth to bear witness that the king- 
dom of God has been established in 
the earth, never more to be thrown 
down nor given to another people. 
The man who was selected of God 
to establish this work in the earth, 
was called to be an Apostle of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and ordained to 
that office by Peter, James, and 
John. Others were ordained through 
him, by command of the Lord, and 
through the apostleship this work 
has been carried on. 

During the last few weeks I have 
received about a dozen letters along 
this line of enquiry. "Is it possible 
for an Elder to ordain a Seventy? 
Is it possible for a Seventy to or- 
dain an Apostle ?" We knew the 
source of the first letter that came 
of that character, and we answered 
that it is not a question whether an 
Elder could ordain a Seventy, or 
whether a Seventy could ordain an 
Apostle, the question is, Has it ever 
been necessary for that to be done, 
since the Lord ordained the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith and Oliver .Cow- 
dery to the holy apostleship, and 
gave them commandments to call 
and ordain other men? We bore 
testimony to those enquirers that, 
since men were ordained to the 
apostleship in the earth, and given 
power to call and ordain other men, 
and "call and ordain all the other 
officers in the Church," it had never 
been necessary,— for this work has 
been established for the last time 
under the hands of God, and it has 
not ceased to roll since it was start- 
ed by our Father. 

I rejoice in this work. I re- 
joice in the spirit of permanency 
that has characterized it through all 
these years that the work has been 



ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH.

directed by our Father. I am glad, 
my brethren and sisters, to mingle 
with such a body of Latter-day 
Saints, with men and women who 
have the same testimony, who come 
here to worship the Lord, with the 
same spirit in them that permeates 
the hearts of our brethren the First 
Presidency and the Twelve. We 
have a testimony that this is the 
work of the Lord ; so has every oth- 
er man and every other woman who 
has kept the commandments of our 
Father; and so will every man and 
every woman receive this testimony 
who will hear and obey the voice of 
the Lord. The people in the world 
today, who hear the testimony of the 
Elders of the Church, and yield 
obedience to it, receive a testimony 
exactly the same as those who have 
labored in the Church for years, 
the same as those who heard the 
Prophet Joseph Smith declare, "If 
you will repent and be baptized ye 
shall know that I am called of God, 
and know it for yourselves." I am 
thankful to live in a day when this 
glorious revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith has been so 
greatly fulfilled. Surely a great and 
marvelous work did come forth in 
the earth. Who can- mingle with 
and know the Latter-day Saints and 
not be able to declare that it is truly 
a great and a marvelous work. The 
Latter-day Saints today are being 
gathered from every nation, and are 
being brought to dwell in harmony 
together to the glory of God. Had 
it not been for this work, as testified 
by the former speaker, our parents 
would never have known each oth- 
er, neither would their souls be 
filled with the joy or moved with 
the same songs or stirred with the 
same ambitions to do good to their 
fellow-man that fills their hearts to- 



day. Yet, this work has only be- 
gun. Another eighty years will 
produce greater results,' and it is 
my testimony that it will be even 
more glorious than it is today. The 
spirit of the Gospel will fill the 
hearts of those who are coming 
hither to be more loyal, true, and 
loving, more kind to one another, 
uphold each other, and not be 
ashamed of those who are called of 
God to guide and direct His people. 
I feel proud to honor them. 

I tell you, in all my wanderings 
and associations, I find no men who 
have the same spirit in their hearts 
as those of our brethren who pre- 
side over this Church. My testi- 
mony to the world has been and is 
that they are men of God. I would 
rather have one of them put his 
arms on my shoulders and say, 
"God bless you," or associate with 
them a few minutes, than anv oth- 
er men in the world, for thev are 
clean and pure, and God has' blest 
them. In their presence you can 
feel the spirit of righteousness, be- 
cause of the righteous lives that 
they are living in the earth. Re- 
cently one of our fellow members 
of the Church was in Chicago for 
a very serious operation, and as I 
visited him, from day to day, I was 
struck with the testimony of many 
medical men who came to see him, 
—a simple testimony yet beautiful,' 
This man is clean, clean as a babe 
morally." It was almost a revela- 
tion to them to find a man so clean 
and virtuous. So are thousands of 
our brethren who have been called 
of God to bear this great message 
to the world. To find and convert 
the clean men in the world is a part 
of the glorious work that has come 
forth, and it will become more glor- 
ious according to the lives and la-

bors, and earnest work, of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

I feel honored, my brethren and 
sisters, to labor with the Elders and 
Saints, and the honest in heart, 
among the people of the Northern 
States, the states surrounding the 
great city of Chicago. It is my tes- 
timony that the promises of God to 
the early Elders of the Church are 
just as sure of fulfilment today as 
they were then, when the Elders 
depend upon Him to the same de- 
gree. Our Father gave the prom- 
ise to the Elders of the Church, in 
the year 1832, that "whosoever re-, 
ceiveth you there I will be also, for 
I will go before your face; I will 
be on your right hand and on your 
left hand, and my spirit shall be in 
your hearts, and mine angels round 
about to bear you up." It is my 
testimony now, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the angels of our Father 
do go before the face of the Elders 
to prepare the hearts of the people to 
receive them ; and the Spirit of God 
is in the hearts of those who are la- 
boring to establish Zion in the earth. 
Those who labor honestly as mis- 
sionaries bear this witness that it is 
the happiest time of their lives, af- 
ter a hard day's work, to feel the 
presence of the Lord, the influence 
of His holy Spirit, and realize that 
the angels of our Father have borne 
witness and prepared the hearts of 
the people to receive them. I am 
grateful and thankful that the Spir- 
it of the Lord has thus been with 
us, and the spirit of this great work 
has softened the hearts of both 
great and small in the earth toward 
the truth and toward God's people. 

The spirit of prejudice is fast 
vanishing away, and tens of thou- 
sands of people are convinced that 
we have the greatest truth that has 



been delivered to the earth. While 
their hearts are not converted, their 
minds are convinced that we have 
a power back of us that no other 
people possess. When they are 
brought to realize what a great 
work our Elders are doing, they 
say, "Why can't we get our mis- 
sionaries to do the same as the mis- 
sionaries of the Church of Jesus 
Christ, or the Mormon Elders, are 
doing?" The only reason they can't 
get them to do it is because they 
have not got the testimony in their 
hearts that it is the work of God 
they are performing. They do not 
know their work is indeed the work 
of the Lord, but they are engaged 
in it because they have nothing bet- 
ter. They desire to do good, but 
know not how best to do it. Thou- 
sands would just as gladly do what 
we are doing if they knew, as we 
know, that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that He has restored 
the Gospel to the earth for the sal- 
vation of the children of men. 

I bear witness to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that this is the work 
of God, that our Father is direct- 
ing it, that He goes before our face, 
that His Spirit is in our hearts ; and 
this marvelous work will continue 
until the honest in heart have been 
gathered together from all nations, 
to the praise and glory of our Fath- 
er. The prayers of the faithful Lat- 
ter-day. Saints should continue to 
ascend to our Father for the speedy 
gathering of His people. May He 
bless and inspire, sustain and up- 
hold our worthy brethren who pre- 
side over us; and may the revela- 
tions of His mind and will be giv- 
en to them. May His Spirit ever 
be given to us to receive their coun- 
sel, advice, and revelation until our 
Father's name shall be glorified

through the faithful labors of His 
children in the earth, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

AUDITING COMMITTEE'S REPORT. 

Elder Heber J. Grant read the re- 
port of the Auditing Committee of 
the Church, as follows : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, 

April 1, 1910. 

President Jcseph F. Smith and 
Counselors: 

Dear Brethren: We, the un- 
dersigned, the auditing committee 
of the Church, beg leave to report 
that we have carefully examined 
the books and accounts of the 
Church as fully and thoroughly as 
the great mass of accounts would 
permit in the time at our disposal 
to perform this important labor. 

It gives us pleasure* to report that 
we have found everything in a very 
satisfactory condition both as to 
the method of keeping the accounts, 
and also as to the volume of receipts 
and expenditures of the Church in 
all . its varied activities ; and while 
perhaps it may not be within our 
purview either to criticise or com- 
mend the expendituies of the 
Church, yet we cannot refrain from 
expressing our gratification with 
the way these expenditures have 
been made on account of the various 
needs of the Church. 

We are pleased to say, as hereto- 
fore, that the accounting depart- 
ment is in good condition, and that 
the method of keeping the accounts 
improves from year to year, so that 
now there seems but very little more 
to be desired. Everything is done 
in an intelligent, systematic and 
business-like way and according to 



methods that save time and ex- 
pense. 

Very respectfully submitted. 
Your brethren, 

RUDGER CLAWSON, 
W. W. RlTER, 

August W. Carlson, 
Henry H. Rolapp, 
General Auditing Committee of the 
Church. 

ELDER WILLIAM W. RITER. 

(Chairman of Auditing Commit- 
tee.) 

My brothers and sisters, — I will 
brush aside all formalities and seek 
to say what I have to say as briefly 
and concisely as I can, for I know 
the time of the conference is too 
valuable to be wasted in unneces- 
sary words. 

The report of the Auditing Com- 
mittee of the Church, just read in 
your hearing, in a general way cov- 
ers the whole ground, and I can add 
nothing thereto ; but there are, per- 
haps, a few details that may be of 
interest to you, that it would be im- 
possible to embody in a general re- 
port without making it unnecessar- 
ily lengthy. 

First, let me say this : There is 
in the minds of some people — 
though I do not believe in the minds 
of the Latter-day Saints, to anv 
marked extent — a suspicion that the 
Auditing Committee, which you 
sustain at your conferences as the 
Auditing Committee of the Church, 
are dominated by the Church au- 
thorities to the extent that they 
would hardly make a report in any 
different form than that which has 
been presented to you. I will say, 
in order to dispel any suspicion of 
this kind, that it is wholly unfound- 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ed. The Auditing Committee never 
saw President Joseph F. Smith dur- 
ing the entire course of their la- 
bors, and were only brought face to 
face with him when they had com- 
pleted their labors and made their 
report. I believe, on one occasion 
only, President Lund passed 
through the room where we were 
at work, and. in a friendly way we 
shook hands with him. As you 
are well aware, President John R. 
Winder was lying upon his death- 
bed, and as a matter of course we 
could not and did not see him. So 
that no set of men could have been 
more free from any outside influ- 
ence acting upon their labors than 
were we. Every book and every 
source of information and every 
document which our judgment re- 
quired to be brought before us was 
furnished with alacrity, and there 
was no evidence whatever that any- 
thing whatever was being withheld. 

Now, you understand that in the 
world at large, the constitution of 
the Mormon Church is considered 
a very delicate and perfect piece 
of machinery, and I am inclined to 
think, , from my knowledge of the 
history and movement of mankind, 
that no more delicate and no more 
precise piece of machinery has ever 
been instituted upon the earth than 
that which constitutes the govern- 
ment, and exercise of authority, 
over the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Now, I say this 
in a religious capacity. We all un- 
derstand, running side by side with 
these matters, there must be other 
activities than those that are con- 
sidered strictly religious, that relate 
to our temporal affairs. I want to 
say that in this regard the machin- 
ery has been perfected from year to 
year, until now it is practically as 
perfect on the material side as it is 



on its religious side. I believe there 
are but few Lattei-day Saints who 
are aware of the magnitude of the 
activities of the Church in all di- 
rections. I will briefly call your at- 
tention to a few of the more impor- 
tant features in regard to our tem- 
poral matters, that came under our 
review as auditors. 

First, at the head, as a matter of 
course, is the presiding office of the 
Church, the office of the First Pres- 
idency, who have the care and di- 
rection of the matters pertaining to 
the office of the trustee-in-trust. 
The amount of business transacted 
in that department is very great. 
Next below that comes the office 
of the Presiding Bishopric who re- 
port, directly to their officers above 
them. The amount of labor per- 
formed in that office is something 
beyond the ordinary knowledge of 
the Latter-day Saints. The ac- 
counts of sixty stakes or there- 
about, and some six hundred wards, 
or thereabout, besides the missions 
in the various quarters of the earth, 
some twenty-one in number, are 
centered in that office; and so deli- 
cate is that machinery that I be- 
lieve if any half-naked Maori, or 
inhabitant of the South Seas pays 
a tithing of a nickel, his name and 
the record of that account may be 
found in that building across the 
way. (Referring to the Presiding 
Bishop's Office.) Under the very 
able management of the present 
Presiding Bishopric, matters have 
been brought up and crystalized in- 
to a business condition that is very 
gratifying indeed. And let me here 
remark, without any intention of 
making a personal reference, that 
all four of the committee who 
signed this report, I believe, are 
professional bookkeepers, or at least 
they have been at some time in their 



ELDER WILLIAM W. RITER.

lives, so they know what they are 
talking about when they speak in 
regard to these matters. 

Now, beside the Presiding Bish- 
opric, there are other institutions 
of the Church. There is the Land 
and Title Department that has the 
record of the titles of all the prop- 
erties of the Church. There is the 
Latter-day Saints' Hospital, a mag- 
nificent institution in its mission of 
mercy. I am sure if the Latter-day 
Saints could fully comprehend "the 
good that it is doing, it would be 
held near and dear to their hearts. 
Briefly, let me say that, if I re- 
member correctly, some twelve hun- 
dred surgical operations were per- 
formed there last year, and it is very 
fair to assume that six hundred of 
these operations were the means of 
saving life; and, yet, this hospitab 
is where people go who are in the 
last extremities of distress and dis- 
ease, notwithstanding that, the mor- 
tality in that hospital is less than the 
average mortality in other hospitals 
in the United States. 

Then we have the Deseret News, 
a large, flourishing, and ably man- 
aged institution performing a work 
for good that is almost beyond cal- 
culation. Also we have the Bureau 
of Information. We audited their 
accounts, and we cannot speak too 
highly in regard to their labors. 
Commencing a few years ago with 
a donation of $100.00, for capital, 
they invested that amount in books 
and pamphlets .to be used in con- 
nection with their mission, and so 
judiciously have they managed this 
matter that this one hundred dol- 
lars, without anv outside help, has 
grown now to be $9,000.00, which 
they have invested in books and 
pamphlets which they either sell or 
give away to all who ask for them. 
The number of strangers who call 



upon them and receive information 
as regards the Church, the State, 
the country in all their various func- 
tions, is very great. 

Now, I have mentioned only a 
few of the leading activities of the 
Church. There are a great number 
of others. Of course, you will un- 
derstand that in every stake, to a 
certain extent, they may have dupli- 
cates of some of these things, and 
also in the many wards, and all 
these center in the Presiding Bish- 
op's office. Besides taking care of 
the dollars and cents, the Presiding 
Bishop's office gathers a great mass 
of statistics in regard to other af- 
fairs of the Church, this, I be- 
lieve, the people as a whole are un- 
aware of, and which to me are very 
interesting. I want to call your at- 
tention to some of these and let you 
draw your own conclusions. But 
before reading any of these statis- 
tics, I want to disabuse the public 
mind, and especially that of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, of an impression 
which has gone out — I do not know 
to what extent, but I do not think 
to any great extent, but to whatever 
extent it may be, I believe this im- 
pression ought to be dispelled, and 
it is this: that it is unfair and un- 
just, in a sense, to gather the tithes 
and donations from the various 
wards and stakes in the outlying 
portions of the country and bring 
them to Salt Lake City, for the pur- 
pose of enriching Salt Lake and im- 
poverishing to the same extent the 
localities from whence these mon- 
eys have come. It may surprise you 
when I tell you that 51 per cent of 
all the tithes paid by the people last 
year in all the stakes of Zion was 
returned directly to them to be used 
for various needs in their own lo- 
calities. Now, you will readily un- 
derstand that this cannot be re- 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



turned in the same proportion that 
it has been received, because cir- 
cumstance and conditions vary. The 
wants of one stake or locality this 
year may be different from next 
year. One stake may need help and 
assistance in one direction this year, 
and it may be years again before 
they need help again. So a uniform 
return of the funds that you donate 
would be impossible. As an illus- 
tration, the needs and wants of one 
of the largest stakes, at some dis- 
tance from Salt Lake, this last year 
were such that 103 per cent of their 
tithes were returned to them, or, in 
other words, all that they paid was 
returned to them, plus 3 per cent 
more. I only hastily impressed 
some of these.figures upon my mind, 
but I remember that there was an- 
other stake where 80 per cent was 
returned, and so it runs with vary- 
ing proportions all down the line. 
When we consider the expenditures 
of a general character, that all are 
interested in, whatever the locality, 
in regard to certain general ex- 
penses of the Church, which must be 
met in some one locality, — when 
we consider the proportion that each 
should pay to defray these expenses 
—I haven't figured it out, but I ver- 
ily believe that the people of Salt 
Lake county, would have the right 
of jealousy and suspicion, if there 
were any cause, and that they do 
not receive the amount of money 
from the outside that they are en- 
titled to. Or, in other words, I be- 
lieve Salt Lake county, comprising 
the stakes which were once the Salt 
Lake stake, pays more into the gen- 
eral fund than they receive, so that 
they are at a disadvantage in this 
regard. If my memory serves me 
correctly, the various stakes now 
within the lines of the old Salt Lake 
stake, received only 40 per cent of 



their tithes last year in return for 
their wants, as against 51 per cent 
that was returned to the stakes as a 
whole. 

Now, it possibly may not be nec- 
essary to speak of a matter I have 
in mind, and yet I ki$>w some peo- 
ple discuss this phase of the ques- 
tion which I am going to bring be- 
fore you. There are a few peo- 
ple who are naturally suspicious, 
and our outside friends, too, are 
very suspicious, because they have 
an idea that this Church is a huge 
machine for making money — for a 
few people, for a few wise ones ! 
I remember, many years ago a cor- 
respondent of "The Dollar" news- 
paper, published in Philadelphia, 
described the tithing office as a place 
where they 'kept good things for 
the knowing ones. Now, if you 
will take my word, and I believe you 
will, I want to say that no undue 
amount of the funds donated by the 
Latter-day Saints goes into the 
hands of the presiding officers of 
the Church. The revenues of the 
Church, from certain directions, are 
sufficient to pay the expenses of the 
leading authorities, without trench- 
ing to the amount of a dollar upon 
the tithes of the Church, — so that 
every dollar that you pay in, in the 
matter of tithing may be and is used 
for the general wants and needs of 
the Church, according to the spir- 
it of inspiration in the minds of 
those who have the direction of 
these things. 

Now I am going to say some- 
thing that is a littL- embarrassing 
to me. I am inclined to think that 
of all men that are in this congre- 
gation, I am, perhaps, as little a 
man-worshiper as any amongst you, 
and it is distasteful to me to praise 
any man to his face. I would rather 
President Smith would not hear what 



ELDER WILLIAM W. RITER. 



101 



I say ; but I want to say this, that 
I can't conceive that any man could 
administer the financial affairs of 
the Church with a truer conscience 
or a firmer conviction that its funds 
are sacred funds, and that they are 
funds belonging to the great God 
who created this Church than does 
President Smith. With that view, 
he and those associated with him 
administer every dollar, and as stat- 
ed in our certificate, I believe, that 
every dollar has been expended 
wisely. As business men and book- 
keepers, we did not find any mon- 
ey going in any direction that we 
could disapprove of, and I believe 
if every one of you who are before 
me this day could see and have an 
insight into these matters, as we 
have had, you too would be perfect- 
ly willing to join in the certificate 
that has been read in your hearing. 

Now, there is this pleasing fea- 
ture that came to our attention, — 
the tithes and offerings of the 
Church showed a very gratifying in- 
crease over the previous year — quite 
a material increase. Well, how do 
you interpret that? I might also 
say that the tithes and revenues of 
the Church have shown a very ma- 
terial increase over the previous 
years. True, I understand that we 
are having years of increased fin- 
ancial prosperity. I understand 
that, but taking this into considera- 
tion, I believe that the people are 
paying their tithes and offerings 
out of proportion to the increased 
material prosperity of the country, 
and I account for it this way : The 
people as a whole have implicit con- 
fidence in the honesty, integrity and 
wisdom of those to whom they en- 
trust these sacred funds. There is 
something about an honest man that 
all people apprehend without it be- 
ing necessary for his friends to as- 



sert that he is honest, and without 
it being necessary for him to as- 
sert it. The -best evidence of this 
was the magnificent testimonial that 
was given in this building, a few 
days ago, to our departed brother, 
John R. Winder. I believe that it 
came from the very depths of the 
hearts of the people. The esteem 
they showed him sprang from the 
belief that he was a thoroughly hon- 
est and conscientious man ; and let 
me testify to you that after an as- 
sociation with him — civil, religious, 
and military — for something over 
fifty years, I know that to be the 
case; and after a close and intimate 
association of seventeen years in 
temple work, I am doubly assured 
of it. You know he was a man 
never on dress-parade, but he be- 
lieved that the people knew that 
he was honest ; and the people know 
that his confreres are honest, and 
this knowledge or belief is manifest- 
ed in the willingness with which 
they pay these increased revenues 
and donations. 

Now I believe I have said enough 
along these lines, and I am egotisti- 
cal enough to believe that you be- 
lieve what I say. 

As I have already remarked, there 
are some very interesting statistics 
kept in the Presiding Bishop's of- 
fice, and I believe that in the future 
they will gather in others that will 
be of interest as well as benefit to 
the Church. Let me call your at- 
tention to the fact that the birth- 
rate amongst the members of the 
Church, within the stakes of Zion 
— mind you I don't mean the birth- 
rate of the state of Utah, or any 
other state where the Saints are 
located, — but the birth-rate amongst 
the Latter-day Saints in the stakes 
of Zion, leaving out the missions m 
the world, was 39 per thousand. It 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



may be known to some of you that 
one thousand is used as the unit of 
measurement in vital' statistics, for 
the reason that a smaller unit would 
make disagreeable fractions. The 
birth-rate amongst the Latter-day 
Saints was 39 per 1,000 as against 
32 in the United States as a whole, 
or an advantage in our behalf of 
about 20 per cent. The death-rate 
was 9.9 or in other words, nine per- 
sons and 9-10 of a person died per 
thousand amongst the Latter-day 
Saints during the year 1909, against 
an average in the United States of 
about 17 per thousand, so that the 
death-rate among the Latter-day 
Saints was a little over half of the 
general average death-rate of the 
country. Brother Heber J. Grant, 
at one of our meetings called at- 
tention to the fact — he being an in- 
surance man — that the lowest death- 
rate amongst the life insurance com- 
panies, that he was aware of, had 
fallen but once or twice below ten. 
Ours is just a trifle below ten, and 
bear this in mind that the death- 
rate in insurance companies covers 
a class of people who are supposed 
to be physically perfect. They un- 
dergo an examination, or a physi- 
cal test, and their records are con- 
sidered, and their records for gen- 
erations before them, and all doubt- 
ful cases are eliminated ; and to but 
a very limited extent does it cover 
children ; and yet in the world at 
large their death-rate is equal to 
the Latter-day Saints that covers 
the aged, the infirm and little chil- 
dren, and we know it is the history 
of the world that mortality amongst 
children is much greater than it is 
among people of maturer age. Then 
there is this other thing that must 
be taken into consideration in get- 
ting ratios,— that the Latter-day 
Saints, have more children accord- 



ing to population, per thousand, 
than the people of the United States 
as a whole. These things must be 
taken into consideration in order to 
get a proper measure of this ques- 
tion. 

The marriage-rate amongst the 
Latter-day Saints, last year, was 
16.5 per thousand; that is, sixteen 
persons and a half were married 
out of every thousand. Of course, 
you can readily understand that that 
half person was not married, but 
that is the way we have for getting 
at these proportions and percent- 
ages. I have not the other per 
cent, but I am inclined to think our 
percentage is higher than is to be 
found elsewhere. 

There are 31 widows and widow- 
ers per thousand of population 
amongst the Latter-day Saints. 
These are, presumably, mostly eld- 
erly people. 

Here is one feature that may 
strike you as a little strange. (I 
am reminded that I ought to speak 
louder, but my voice is already 
breaking.) There are fifty persons 
per thousand over twenty-one years 
of age unmarried. The remedy for 
that is in your hands. (Laughter.) 

Here is a very important item. 
During the year 1909, there were 
2,748 persons married in the tem- 
ples. During the same time, there 
were forty-six persons, or twenty- 
three couples divorced, among those 
who had been married in the tem- 
ples — not necessarily among those 
who were married in the temples 
last year, but that figure represents 
the number of- divorces granted to 
members of the Church who had 
been married in the temples at any 
time. Figuring 46 divorces as about 
the average for a year, that would 
be 1.6 per cent of the number mar- 
ried in the temples. During the 



ELDER WILLIAM W. RITER. 



103 



same year 83 members were di- 
vorced who received civil marriages. 
Carried out into, percentages, the 
result would be 3.6 per cent of di- 
vorces among those who were mar- 
ried outside of the temples, as 
against 1.6 per cent for those who 
were married in the temples. In 
other words there is a factor of 
safety to married life, in behalf of 
temple marriages of about 2y 2 to 1. 

There were 2,065 missionaries in 
the field on the first day of January, 
1910, and it takes about $500,000.00 
a year, from their relatives and 
friends, to sustain them. This mon- 
ev is not counted in the financial 
statements of the Church, they are 
personal matters between the mis- 
sionaries and their relatives and 
friends. 

Forty-six per cent of the Church 
population are enrolled in the Sun- 
day Schools. Now, do not get the 
idea that 46 per cent of the popula- 
tion are children. It means the 
total of the persons engaged in Sun- 
day School work, the teachers as' 
well as the children. I think this 
is a marvelous showing, that 46 per 
cent of the people are engaged in 
Sunday School work, either as pu- 
pils or as teachers. They are en- 
gaged in teaching and learning the 
way of life and salvation. 

Nine and one-tenth per cent were 
enrolled in the Young Ladies' Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations ; 8.8 
per cent were enrolled in the Young 
Men's Mutual Improvement Asso- 
ciations ; 19 per cent were enrolled 
in the Primary associations, and 10 
per cent were enrolled in the Re- 
ligion classes. There are 41,586 
persons in the Church who hold the 
higher or Melchizedek Priesthood, 
and 33,357 who hold the lesser or 
Aaronic Priesthood. 

Now, in view of the preciousness 



of the time, I believe I have said 
enough. Perhaps I have said as 
much as most of you will remember 
about these matters. I may close 
by expressing ' the great pleasure 
and gratification that I have had in 
these labors. 

There is one thing, however, that 
comes to my mind, that I think I 
must speak of. You remember the 
days when the old tithing office or- 
der was largely current amongst us, 
and frequently it got into a condi- 
tion which some people regarded 
with contempt. Nevertheless, when 
the proposition came to do away 
with the system and do away with 
a tithing office here, and not re- 
ceive tithing in kind, I was rather 
opposed to it, for I was attached to 
those old tithing office orders, just 
as the people of the United States 
were attached to the old green- 
backs. You know the green-backs 
saved the nation during its hour of 
peril ; and the old tithing office or- 
ders were the means of bringing 
bread and meat to the mouths of a 
great many worthy and deserving 
people. I had a great veneration 
for the old system ; but in the march 
of events, and as this Church must 
grow and spread and increase in all 
directions along the lines of higher 
intelligence arid progress, it has 
been found necessary to abandon 
the old system, but I almost feel like 
saying, God bless the old tithing 
office order. (Laughter.) God 
bless you all, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Responsibility of all Saints to pro- 
claim the Gospel by word, and act. 
— '"Let us speak well of our home 
state," and people. — -Don't advertise 
existing evils, remove them. — The 
tongue should be controlled to de- 
clare truth only, and always. 

"If any man offend not in word, the 
same is a perfect man, and able also 
to bridle the whole body. 

"Behold, we put bits in the horses' 
mouths, that they may obey us; and 
we turn about their whole body. 

"Behold also the ships, which, 
though they be so great and are driven 
of fierce winds, yet are they turned 
about with a very small helm, whither- 
soever the governor listeth. 

"Even so the tongue is a little mem- 
ber, and boasteth great things. Be- 
hold, how great a matter a little fire 
• kindleth! 

"And the tongue is a fire, a world of 
iniquity: so is the tongue among our 
members, that it defileth the whole 
body, and setteth on fire the course of 
nature, and it is set on fire of hell. 

"For every kind of beasts, and of 
birds, and of serpents, and of things in 
the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed 
of mankind: 

"But the tongue can no man tame; 
it is an unruly evil, full of deadly 
poison. 

"Therewith bless we God, even the 
Father; and therewith curse we men, 
which are made after the similitude of 
God. 

"Out of the same mouth proceedeth 
blessing and cursing. My brethren, 
these things ought not so to be. 

"Doth a fountain send forth at the 
same place sweet water and bitter? 

"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear 
olive berries? either a vine, figs? So 
can no fountain both yield salt water 
and fresh.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Who is' a ivise man and endued with 
knowledge among you? let him show out 
of a good conversation his works with 
meekness of wisdom. 

"But if ye have bitter envying and 
strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie 
not against the truth. 

"This wisdom iescendeth not from 
above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 

"For where envying and strife is, there 
is confusion and every evil work. 

"But the wisdom that is from above 
is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and 
easy to be intreatcd, full of mercy and 
good fruits, without partiality, and with- 
out hypocrisy. 

"And the fruit of righteousness is 
sown in peace of them that make peace." 

So wrote the Apostle James, 
many hundred years ago. but I feel 
that, like all truth, that which he 
expresses in these lines is applicable 
today. The tongue is a little mem- 
ber ,and yet it is the means by which 
our thoughts are. given wings, it 
is one means of influencing one 
another. 

I thought, this morning, while 
listening to the presidents of mis- 
sions, as I have thought through- 
out this conference, of the great 
message that the Latter-day Saints 
have to proclaim to the world, not a 
message of strife but a message of 
peace, a message of good will. "The 
wisdom that is from above is first 
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and 
easy to be intreated. * * " I 
would like to read another passage 
that will give to us what I believe 
should be the keynote of all ex- 
pressions of the Latter-day Saints : 

"And there were in the same coun- 
try shepherds abiding in the field, 
keeping watch over their flock by 
night. 

"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came 
upon them, and the glory of the Lord 
shone round about them, and they 
were sore afraid. 

"And the angel said unto them, Fear 
not : for, behold T bring you good tid- 



ings of great joy, which shall be to all 
people. 

"For unto you is born this day, in 
the city of David, a Savior, which is 
Christ the Lord." 

"Good tidings of great joy" — 
The Gospel of Tesus Christ is that 
good tidings. The term "Gospel" 
means, literally, "good news," and 
such is the news that emanates 
from above. There have been but 
few men in the world's history who 
have been so in tune with the heav- 
ens that they could receive direct- 
ly from God the Father that good 
news ; but there has always been a 
time in the history of this world 
when that news came from above. 
There have always been, in every 
dispensation, opportunities for men 
to receive that good news, and these 
prophets who were in tune with the 
Infinite and who heard first and 
directly that good news, have had 
imposed upon them the responsi- 
bility to convey that good news to 
others of their fellow-men, that they 
who are concerned with the things 
of the world might receive the glad 
message and be brought back into 
the environment of peace, harmony, 
and good will. In this dispensa- 
tion, that same responsibility has 
been given to man. We have heard 
throughout this conference, repeat- 
edly, that the Latter-day Saints, are 
those upon whom rests the respon- 
sibility of carrying the good news 
to the children of the world. I 
sometimes think that we put off, in 
our minds, the responsibility of giv- 
ing that message, to some special 
calling in life. That is, if we are 
called as missionaries abroad, we 
feel it our duty to proclaim the glad 
message to the world. If we are 
called to preside in an organization, 
or in a branch, or in a quorum, then 
we feel it our duty to give the good 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



107 



news to those over whom we pre- 
side. We wait until some special 
opportunity is given to proclaim the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet the 
duty devolves upon us to proclaim 
that good news every day of our 
lives. We proclaim it in our .acts— 
in the home, in business, in social 
circles, in politics — everywhere that 
we mingle with men we have the 
responsibility resting upon us to 
give the good news to the people 
of the world. I do not mean that 
we must, necessarily, formally 
preach the doctrine under all these 
circumstances, but I do mean that 
in our lives, in our conversation, 
we can bear the good message to 
the children of the world. 

We have heard much, through- 
out this conference, about building 
up our state, remaining at home 
wherever the stakes are organized, 
and not to scatter abroad in new 
places. One of the best ways of 
building up our home, be it a dom- 
icile, a city, a >>tate, or a nation, 
is to speak well of that home, city, 
state, Or nation. Let the tongue be 
under control, and speak well of the 
home. I have rejoiced time and 
again, when visiting the different 
stakes surrounding Utah, to hear 
our brethren tell about the advan- 
tages of some particular town. 
"Why," they would say, for exam- 
ple, "we are blest with the purest 
air, we have the best water that can 
be found in the world ;" and they 
will enumerate, one after another, 
the benefits and blessings of that 
particular locality. I recall now 
how the brethren in Canada were 
eager to impress those who were 
with them with the resources of 
that country. Why, the advantages 
were innumerable. For example, 
when one visitor said, /'But you 
haven't the scenery we have in 



Utah." "Yes, we have," persisted 
President Wood • we have even bet- 
ter scenery than vou have in Utah." 
"Where?" "I will show you;" and 
then a ride forty miles from Cards- 
ton took us to one of the most beau- 
tiful mountain scenes in the world 
— the Switzerland of America. He 
felt that there was nothing that 
"could make him feel dissatisfied 
with his home there. "Even the 
winds in Canada," he said, "are 
blessing us, because they blow the 
snow off, so the cattle can eat the 
grass." (Laughter.) This is the 
point, — he could see good in every- 
thing. There was contentment — 
not a spirit of tearing down, finding 
fault, complaining. I believe it is 
a good lesson ; let us speak well of 
our home city; let us see the ad- 
vantages of it. 

On that hot July morning in 
1847, when the Prophet Brigham 
Young stood out here a few miles, 
and looked over this vast country, 
what did he see? Away down 
yonder in the distance, probably the 
smoke from an Indian's wigwam ; 
away out in the west, the lake 
sparkling in the sunshine; and be- 
tween him and that body of water, 
an alkali waste. All around him 
he saw sage brush; and from the 
distance came the howl of the 
coyote or the wolf. These are the 
things he saw in reality, but in his 
prophetic mind he beheld all the 
prosperity, the wealth, the prosper- 
ous towns, and the crowds of peo- 
ple that we now see here. All these 
things that we now behold with 
our natural eyes, and have experi- 
enced, he saw with his prophetic 
eye and pronounced it all good. 
"Here," he said, "we will build the 
temple of Almighty God." Surely 
with the reality of that prophetic 
vision before us, we can see that 



108

which is good, to speak about, to 
praise, and honor The Latter-day- 
Saints do this; and we want all to 
do it, because they can do it truth- 
fully. We have all that the heart 
desires ; we have a ' great, empire 
here in the West — every advantage, 
every surrounding, every environ- 
ment that the heart could desire. 
Let us speak well of our home state.* 
But we cannot speak well of the 
state unless we speak well of the 
men who have founded the state. 
There is no other state in the union 
that can boast of stronger, truer, 
more virtuous, upright, God-fearing 
citizens, and men of God than can 
the state of Utah. Let the young 
men throughout Zion realize this 
fact, and let their tongues proclaim 
it, and let them not encourage the 
company of those who would use 
this unruly member to vilify the 
men who founded this empire. I 
overheard a conversation the other 
day, in this city, which in effect 
was as follows : A prominent man 
and his wife, evidently, entertain- 
ing an eastern visitor who had been 
interested in the history and in dif- 
ferent places of Salt Lake City. I 
judged that he was profoundly im- 
pressed, as every honest thinking 
man is when he sees the results of 
the labor and industry of the pio- 
neers of our state. Among other 
things, he mentioned his going to 
church : "I was at church last Sun- 
day," I heard him say. "Oh, were 
you?" answered his host, followed 
by some remark that I did not 
catch ; "well, where did you go to 
church ?" At the Tabernacle." And 
the sneer on that woman's face 
made my blood boil. With the 
sneer came some remark about not 
dignifying the Tabernacle as a 
church. I saw the shadow of dis- 
appointment creep over that eastern 



visitor's face. He had dignified it, 
and ' he had been profoundly im- 
pressed, but when our own people, 
citizens of this state, though not 
members of the Church, spoke evil 
of something in our midst, the shad- 
ow of disappointment darkened his 
countenance. It will always be so. 
O ! let us speak well, when we can 
do it truthfully — and we can in this 
case. Let us speak well of our city 
and state, to all who come within 
our borders; let us speak of the 
advantages and growth of our state. 
Let us speak well of those within 
our Church. Brethren and sisters, 
Christians have the responsibility of 
giving good news to the world — not 
bad news. Latter-day Saints have 
the responsibility of carrying glad 
tidings to the world. Let us not 
watt until we go abroad to carry it ; 
let us give the good news today — 
good news of our neighbor, good 
news of our Bishops, good news 
of our stake workers, good news of 
all whom we meet and whose com- 
pany we may chance to be thrown 
into. If we cannot speak well of 
them, truthfully, let us refrain from 
speaking at all: 

"Nay, speak no ill, a kindly word 
Can never leave a sting behind; 
And, oh, to breathe each tale we've 
heard 

Is far below a noble mind. 

"Full oft' a better seed is sown 
By choosing thus the kinder plan, 

For if but little good is known, 
Still let us speak the best we can." 

"Give me the heart that fain would 
hide, 

Would fain another's faults efface; 
How can it please the human pride 
To prove humanity but base. 

"No, let us reach a higher mood, 
A nobler estimate of man; 

Be earnest in the search for good 
And speak of all the best we can. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 1(W 



"Then speak no ill, but lenient be 
To others' failings as your own; 

If you're the first a fault to see, 
Be not the first to make it known. 

"For life is but a passing day; 

No lip can tell how brief its span; 
Then, oh, the little time we stay, 

Let's speak of all the best we can." 

Then say you, would you not 
speak of evil conditions? Must we 
not raise our voice in denouncing 
conditions and men who are bring- 
ing evil upon us? Yes, speak of 
conditions ; but it is unnecessary to 
revile the character of men. We 
cannot do it as true Latter-day 
Saints ; we must rise above it. 
Though we are in the world, we 
must not be of the world. There is- 
a trait in the heart of the world to 
pick at their fellow-men. Emer- 
son says that so pronounced is this 
tendency that an accident cannot 
happen in the street without the by- 
standers become animated with a 
faint hope that the victim will die. 
We cannot encourage that ten- 
dency. As James says, it is from 
the earth — sensual, devilish. We 
must not pick out that which will 
tear down a brother's character, nor 
the character of the city, the state 
or nation. O, let. us be true to our 
nation ; there is reason to be true to 
it. That is the point. If we see a 
condition in a town that endangers 
the life of our fellow citizens, we 
meet that condition. Tf it is a wash- 
out, a cave, a hole in the roadway, 
there is a red lamp placed there at 
night to keep the travelers from 
falling into it, and the next day or 
as soon as possible the evil condi- 
tion is removed. That is proper. 

Now, there are evil conditions in 
society ; there are sunken roads that 
need to be filled. We shall see these 
in our towns, and as home-cleaners, 
if you please, as home-builders and 



home-improvers, we can remove 
those sunken places. One, for ex- 
ample, is the saloon. The people 
when advertising their city, do not 
speak of their saloons ; they tell 
about their churches, about their 
schools, about their side-walks, 
about their libraries, about their 
sewers, but they never tell you how 
many saloons th^y have. They are 
ashamed of them ; and when we 
have conditions of this kind, let us 
remove them without vilifying the 
men, without tearing down men's 
character; it isn't necessary. A 
saloon is an evil; it is a sunken 
road into which fall thousands an- 
nually. You will remember when 
Napoleon's cuirassiers made the 
fatal charge against Wellington, 
that there lay between them and the 
English soldiers a sunken road. 
Napoleon stood away off and could 
not see it. He had asked a man if 
there were any obstacles, and had 
received no as the answer; and 
trusting to that, he gave the com- 
mand for the brigade to charge. 
The Invincible Column rushed on, 
until they came, it is said.to a sunken 
road, and then horse and rider piled 
one upon another till the whale 
abyss was filled with a living de- 
bris that made a bridge of mingled 
flesh of horse and man. The oth- 
ers then rode over. There are, per- 
haps, sunken roads in our com- 
munities. Let us at home see them, 
and not stand off and say that they 
are all right when our young peo- 
ple by the score are rushing head- 
long down the road of intemper- 
ance to the sunken chasms of 
drunkenness. It is our duty to meet 
that condition, but let us do it calm- 
ly; let us do it determinedly, with- 
out vilifying those concerned, with- 
out tearing down character. Take 
the high stand of right; remem- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ber the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
one of good tidings. Preach it, live 
it in your acts. Avoid the danger 
of the saloon, tell your sons to avoid 
it. Let the men whom you appoint 
to represent you in your towns 
know that you desire the saloons 
closed before more human beings 
are piled in that interminable mass 
that whiskey and the saloon drag 
down to destruction. But, I repeat 
again, in meeting this condition, we 
can take the higher stand of truth, 
the stand of the Gospel. 

The Gospel is our anchor. We 
know what it stands for. If we 
live it, feel it, and speak well of 
the Gospel, of the Priesthood, of 
the authorities in it, speak well even 
of our enemies, we shall feel hap- 
pier ourselves, and we shall be 
preaching the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Everybody can do this. It 
is possible. God has not asked us 
to do it and then deprived us of 
the power of performing it. My 
brethren and sisters, let us go from 
this conference determined to con- 
trol our tongues. That isn't much, 
is it? And yet James says that he 
who can control that little member 
has control over his whole body. 
God has given Us the good tidings 
to proclaim to the world. Our 
whole stakes, from Canada in the 
north to Mexico in the south, form 
the bulwark in which are enclosed 
people upon whom rests the respon- 
sibility to give to the world, by their 
acts, by their words, the testimony 
that God has spoken again from 
the heavens, that His Son, the 
Savior of the world, appeared with 
the Father in person and gave the 
good news to Joseph Smith, the" boy 
prophet, that the Gospel has been 
restored to the earth with all the 
blessings and powers that mankind 
need to give them peace, happiness 



and eternal life. We accomplish 
these things by our daily acts. God 
grant that we may show by these 
that our wisdom does come from 
above, that it is a Church of peace, 
a Church of salvation, and that 
there are men and women who 
show by their fruit's that God is 
with them — I pray,' in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

Works of righteousness essential to 
salvation. — Intemperance and sex- 
ual sin menacing the nations. — Duty 
of Saints to discountenance and 
eradicate evil. 

"He that putteth his trust in me shall 
possess the land aVid shall inherit my 
holy mountain, and shall say, Prepare 
the way, take up the stumbling block out 
of the way of my people." 

We believe in God the Eternal 
Father and in His Sonjesus Christ, 
and in the Holy Ghost. This first 
article of faith of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
fundamental and indispensable to 
the belief of every Christian man 
and woman. We believe that with- 
out faith it is impossible to please 
God ; that we must believe in Him, 
must believe that He is. We must 
believe that He has control over our 
destinies, and that we owe allegi- 
ance and service to Him ; otherwise 
there would be no desire upon our 
part to find Him out or learn of His 
ways. This first article of our faith 
is accepted by very many people, so 
far as it applies to faith in our heav- 
enly Father, who reject the remain- 
der of it. Mohammed taught faith 
in God, and that doctrine today is 
the foundation of the Moslem re-

ill 



ligion. The Jews believe in the God 
of Abraham; but neither of these 
peoples acknowledge Jesus Christ 
as the Son of God, nor as the Savior 
of the world. The Latter-day 
Saints believe in thje divinity of 
Jesus Christ— not that He was sim- 
ply a reformer, a prophet of His 
time, one seeking to establish right- 
eousness, but that He is the Son of 
the living God and the Redeemer of 
the world. 

We believe in the Holy Ghost, 
which bears record of the Father 
and the Son, and which, when we 
are in possession of it, leads us into 
all truth. 

While we believe that these first 
doctrines of the Church are funda- 
mental and indispensable, we do not 
regard them as sufficient to assure 
exaltation to the presence of our 
Father in heaven.but that they must 
be accompanied by works; that we 
must do the will of the Father, keep 
the commandments which He has 
given us, in order that we may be 
brought back into His presence. 
This congregation is made up large- 
ly of Latter-day 'Saints, people who 
have accepted these first principles 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who 
have repented of their sins, gone 
down into the waters of baptism, 
and have received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands. You have come up here to 
the mountains of Ephraim, that you 
may learn the way of the Lord, that 
you may learn to walk in His paths. 
I am sure it is for that purpose that 
you are here this afternoon, that 
you may be taught the way of the 
Lord. This congregation, undoubt- 
edly, represents officially a great 
majority of the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. The, presiding author- 
ities of the Church are here ; presi- 



dents of stakes are here ; high coun- 
cilors are here ; bishops of wards, 
and men and women who preside 
over the auxiliary organizations of 
the Church — all are here this after- 
noon that you may learn better the 
way of the Lord and how to walk 
in His paths. You are watch-men 
upon the towers of Zion, and the 
Lord has said, "Except ye warn 
the wicked man of his wickedness, 
and he die in his iniquity, his blood 
will I require at your hands ; but if 
ye warn the wicked, and he repent 
not, you have delivered your soul." 
My brethren and sisters, I under- 
stand the Lord to mean by this, that 
we who profess to follow Him, we 
who have been called to feed the 
flock of Christ, are to be advocates 
of righteousness, that we are to 
teach the word of the Lord by pre- 
cept and by example, that we are to 
make plain that straight and narrow 
path in which He would have all of 
His children walk; in other words, 
that we are to remove the stumbling 
blocks from the way of the Lord, so 
far as it is in our power to do so. 
Where the stumbling blocks cannot 
be removed, they can at least be 
marked, that their existence may be 
known, in order that they may be 
avoided. 

I had been wondering what I 
should say to this congregation, be- 
cause I thought that, probably, I 
might be asked to speak to you, and 
I felt at a loss until a circumstance 
which occurred, a- short time ago, 
led me to a chain of thought and 
suggested a subject to which I shall 
briefly refer. I love to advocate 
the _ doctrines of the Gospel of 
Christ, because I believe in them 
with all my heart. I love to teach 
the way of redemption, which the 
Savior of mankind taught, because 
I know it to be the power of God

unto salvation ; and I do not believe 
that there is any other way under 
heaven by which men and women 
can be saved, or by which prower is 
given them over the sins of the work' 
except through obedience to the 
Gospel. I love to speak of and to 
think of the good that exists in the 
world. This is a good world which 
the Lord has given us; there are 
abundance of good things, in it — 
everything, in fact, that we could 
desire, to make us happy, if only 
utilized as our Father designed that 
they should be. I feel depressed 
when I think and talk of evils which 
exist. To place myself in conflict 
with existing conditions, when I 
know that by so doing I may be 
subject to criticism, that my words 
may be misinterpreted and misun- 
derstood ; to feel that I may be crit- 
icized and that my views may hot 
meet with the approbation of people 
whom I would desire to please, — 
does not make me happy; it never 
did make me happy to think of evil, 
nor to talk about it. Yet, when I 
see conditions existing in the coun- 
try — this God-given country of ours 
— which it seems to me are striking 
at the very foundation of society, 
conditions which have resulted in 
the downfall of nations, in times 
past, and which must inevitably re- 
sult in the downfall of nations, or 
communities, or individuals, wher- 
ever they continue, — when it seems 
to me that these conditions are sure- 
ly, if slowly, fastening themselves 
upon this country of ours, I feel 
constrained to raise my voice in 
warning to my brethren and sisters 
against them. T believe that I fully 
appreciate the value of care and 
wisdom in handling all great ques- 
tions, particularly where questions 
arise in which men and women may 
conscientiously differ in their opin- 



ion. I have never desired to be an 
extremist. I have never liked sen- 
sationalism. I have never liked of- 
fensive partisanship in anything. I 
do not like it, even in the advocacy 
of the word of the Lord, because I 
do not consider it necessary. But 
those things against which the Lord 
has spoken, which are fundamental- 
ly wrong, those things against 
which the servants of the Lord have 
always warned us, — to those things 
at least, it seems to me, I should feel 
justified in referring, even at the 
risk of being misunderstood. I do 
not expect that my views, nor the 
views of the Church, are going to be 
adopted by all people. I recognize 
the fact that in this country in 
which we live, majorities rule, and 
that minorities must be subject to 
them. This is all right, and I sub- 
mit to it; but I also submit that ma- 
jorities are not always right, and 
while I yield, I may still remain un- 
converted. 

Some little time ago, it was my 
pleasure to be in a great city, and I 
rode through its streets with a com- 
panion. I admired its beautiful res- 
idences ; I admired its public build- 
ings; I admired its parks, and the 
things which men had done to em- 
bellish it. As we passed down one 
of its. streets, I saw upon the wall of 
a dwelling a placard, just a yellow 
piece of cloth, which had "Small- 
pox" printed on it. I said to my- 
self, that means that there is some 
one sick there, and that placard, 
which has been put there by health 
officers, is a warning to other people 
that they should not go into that 
house during the period it is infect- 
ed with this disease ; and I said to 
myself, the people who live there, I 
suppose, are also restrained from 
going out. It is their own house ; 
they are unfortunately ill; why 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 113 



should the law lay its hand upon 
them and prevent them from going 
in and out of their own home, and 
their friends going to their assist- 
ance and going away again. I then 
reasoned, it is because the" infection 
that is there may be carried to other 
people, and they may become sick; 
and so I concluded that, after all, 
it was well within the province of 
the law to take control of that house 
. during the period of infection, and 
prevent people from^ither going in 
or coming out of it. I knew that 
after a while, if the patient recov- 
ered, that he would go out clean and 
without infection, and that neither 
he nor those with whom he came 
in contact would be in danger. We 
went on and turned into another 
street, and came to a great build- 
ing. I saw the door swinging to 
and fro, just a screen door that was 
there. I looked in and saw that the 
room was beautifully embellished. 
There were mirrors ; there was mu- 
sic. I heard the clink of glasses ; 
I heard the laughter of men .and 
women too, for as the door swung 
back and forth I saw that there were 
women there. My friend said, 
"That is a saloon ; we call it a sa- 
loon." Yes, and refreshments were 
served there, for I saw "Ice Cream" 
and "Refreshments" marked in 
great letters over the door ; and my 
companion said, "Just back of it, 
there in that group of buildings that 
you see, there are' lawless men and 
abandoned women; and there ri- 
baldry, and license and intemper- 
ance reign supreme." Then my 
mind reverted back to that other 
house. On thfs house there was no ' 
placard, nothing on the door to 
•warn people that it was a danger- 
ous place to go; yet I thought to 
myself of the two, the danger to 
society, the danger of infection, is 



far greater in this latter place than 
in the former. Why isn't there 
some warning there ? Why are not 
people given to understand the 
dangers of this place? Why are 
they, upon the contrary, invited in- 
to it? Why is this condition legal- 
ized and licensed here in this beauti- 
ful city ; then I , thought of some- 
thing else, and I am going to refer 
to it. I know that I am discussing 
a delicate question, but I thought 
of this; only a few days before I 
had read in one of the great maga- 
zines of the country, that they had 
taken the trouble to collect statistics, 
and that the medical fraternity of 
the United States had reported to 
them that 75 per cent of all the men 
in the great cities of this country, 
between the ages of 18 and 28 years 
were infected with disease that was 
almost incurable, as the result of 
their acquaintance with just such 
places as this to which I have re- 
ferred — not diseases that can be eas- 
ily eradicated, but that are handed 
down to the third and fourth gener- 
ations of those who forget God and 
neglect to keep His commandments. 
I said to myself, the one great evil 
that menaces this nation today, the 
one great evil which menaces the 
Church — for whatever menaces the 
nation is a menace to the Church; 
thank God, these things do not exist 
in the Church ; they are no part of 
it ; they never have been, and if the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ could prevail, 
there would be no such places in the 
world— but I said to myself, the 
greatest menace to this nation today, 
and the greatest menace or enemy 
which the Church of Christ has to 
combat is intemperance and sexual 
sin. I just wanted to say that word 
to my brethren here this afternoon. 
You men who preside over the des- 
tinies of this people — isn't it a 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



stumbling block that is in the path ? 
Every power that Satan can con- 
ceive of is exercised in defense of 
this evil, and all his forces are 
marshalled to support it, to pro- 
mote it, to protect it. Now, the way 
to combat these evils, if I were go- 
ing to suggest a plan, would be to 
fellow the policy suggested by 
Brother McKay. I do not want to 
advocate offensive measures. I on- 
ly want to say to my brethren and 
sisters that that which the law legit- 
imately and properly authorizes yOu 
and me to do, that much, at least, 
we are justified in doing; and, re- 
gardless of the law, it becomes our 
duty, every one of us, to make 
known to our children, to the chil- 
dren of our brethren and sisters, 
and to the children of our friends 
in the world, the existence of this 
deadly menace, in the hope that they 
may be persuaded to avoid it. When 
Rome adhered to her simple life, 
when the honor of her men and the 
virtue of her women were above 
reproach, she became the mistress of 
the world; but when these things, 
to which I have referred, gradually 
fastened themselves upon her, she 
went into dissolution. 

One of the things I was im- 
pressed with, when I first went to 
Mexico, a few years ago, was a very 
beautiful growth which I observed 
upon the trees there. It was in the 
winter that I went there, but, as I 
traveled up those streams, I noticed 
that here and there, along the 
way, there was an occasional tree 
that was dotted with green — some- 
times only one bunch, sometimes 
many bunches, all beautiful and 
green. I examined it and found it 
to be mistletoe. It seemed to be 
rather an embellishment to look at 
it, but after a while, as I went fur- 
ther up one of these canyons, one 



day, I observed a tree that was dy- 
ing. It was literally covered with 
mistletoe, this beautiful plant. The 
fact of the matter was that the plant 
had fastened itself upon the tree just 
as other parasites fasten themselves 
upon that which other people create, 
until it had sapped the last bit of 
life out of it, and the tree had died. 
This shrub does not grow from the 
earth, as other plants do, it does not 
struggle for existence, as God seems ■ 
to have designed that all good 
things shall struggle for their ex- 
istence, from infancy to old age ; but 
it just waits till the tree has grown, 
till the tree has made the struggle 
and has become vigorous, and then 
the first thing you know you will 
see a bunch of mistletoe sprout out 
on one of the branches. After a 
while it goes to another branch, and 
then to another, and if left, as I 
have said, it takes away the life of 
the tree. Well, I said, to myself, it 
would be better to cut it off, better 
to remove that single bunch that 
has appeared, — and I made it g 
practice to do that with my own 
trees thereafter, and I found that it 
was an easy matter to keep it down, 
but if left to itself, if kept there 
because of its beauty — and it is a 
thing of beauty — it became a thing 
of danger. So, my brethren and 
sisters, that which God has ordained 
for the good of man, that which 
makes men and women happy, that 
which makes men and women tem- 
perate, that which makes men and 
women virtuous, that which leads 
men and women to believe in God 
and Christ and to serve Them — that 
we cultivate, that we cherish, that 
we care for. But that which comes 
into our midst, when the tree has be- 
come strong, and fastens itself up- 
on us, with no other purpose in the 
world except to sap our life-blood, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS.

better cut it right off; better get 
rid of it, hadn't we ? I think so. So 
I want to say that any legitimate 
means which is in your power and 
mine we should exercise in the spir- 
it of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for 
the eradication of these things as 
they exist in the world, and to keep 
them out of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, that 
they may have no place in it. God 
bless you, my brethren and sisters, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Announcement of deaths of mission- 
aries.— Baptisms in 1909. — Prayer in. 
behalf of the erring. — Heaven's 
choice blessings invoked upon the 
faithful. 

An item of sad information to the 
congregation is the fact that Broth- 
er John H. Cartwright, of Beaver, 
Utah, died October 22nd, 1909, of 
typhoid fever, while laboring in the 
Western States mission ; Griffith E. 
Williams, of Thomas, Bingham 
county, Idaho, died September 25th, 
1909, of appendicitis, in the British 
Mission; and William Funk, of 
Claresholm, Canada, died December 
20, 1909,- of typhoid fever, in the 
Northwestern States Mission. 

I know that the sympathy and 
love of this vast congregation, as 
well as of all the Latter-day Saints, 
go out to the kindred and loved ones 
of these dear brethren who have 
laid down their lives in the ministry, 
while making their best effort to 
proclaim the Gospel of liberty and 
of life and salvation to the inhab- 
itants of the world. 

Another item of information that, 
may be of interest is this : During 



the year 1909, 9,143 persons were 
baptized in the stakes of Zion; and 
5,391 persons were baptized in the 
missions of the Church during the 
same period ; making a total of per- 
sons baptized, 14,534. 

I do not intend .to prolong the 
meeting. I wish merely to say that 
my heart is full of blessing for this 
people and for all people — for all 
mankind. I love the good, the up- 
right, the manly, the honorable, the 
pure in heart everywhere in the 
world ; and the foolish and unfortu- 
nate have my sympathy and my pity. 
I pray God the Eternal Father to 
help the erring to forsake the error 
of their ways, that He will help 
those that are in darkness, to come 
to the knowledge of the truth and 
into the light, that they may walk 
in the light as Christ is in the light, 
that they may have fellowship with 
Him and His people, and that He 
may cleanse them from all sin. 

May peace abide upon the people 
of God everywhere, upon the people 
of our state and upon the people of 
our glorious country. May the 
blessing of the Lord attend the ad- 
ministration of our Government; 
may 'His power and Spirit pervade 
the halls of Congress and enlighten 
the men who enact laws f or.the gov- 
ernment of our nation ; and may 
they acknowledge God in all things 
and seek to please Him,and to enact 
just laws, which may be executed in 
such a way that the purposes of God 
may be subserved and His will be 
accomplished in the earth. This is 
my earnest desire ; and, therefore, I 
say, again, God bless Israel in all 
your abidings, in your homes, in 
your fields and farms, in your flocks 
and your herds, and in all the labors 
of your minds and the labors of 
your hands; may peace dwell in 
your midst; may prosperity attend

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

GREETING 

I feel extremely grateful for the privilege of once more standing 
before such an audience as this assembled here at the opening session of 
our eighty-eighth semi-annual conference of the Church. I hope that I 
may have the Spirit of the Lord to assist me for a few moments to express 
my feelings and hopes, and my gratitude to the Lord for the inestimable 
privileges that we enjoy today. It is almost marvelous to me to look 
upon the vast sea of intelligent faces, beaming with joy and happiness, 
and with the consciousness of right, as I have the privilege of doing this 
morning in looking upon this vast congregation. I am sure that the Lord 
is well pleased with your presence here in honor of this semi-annual 
meeting of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I certainly 
feel very grateful for your presence, for it is an indication of the union 
of feeling and of heart pervading the Latter-day Saints, and the honor 
in which you hold the work in which we are engaged. It is an evidence 
that the Spirit of the Lord is with you, that the love of truth is in your 
hearts, that your faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ is not abated, and 
that you are here to honor your membership in the Church, and the posi- 
tions which many of you hold as presiding officers over the various 'or- 
ganizations of the Church. In this vast attendance at the opening session 
of this conference you have indicated your loyalty to the cause of Zion 
and your love for the work of the Lord, and your confidence in your 
brethren whom you have sustained, from time to time, as presiding offi- 
cers in the Church, and I welcome you, one and all, in your presence here 
this morning, and I sincerely pray that the Spirit of God may descend 
upon us during this session, and throughout the succeeding sessions of the 
conference, until we shall finish the work we have in hand to do. 

OUR HOPE OF SALVATION FOUNDED ON THE TRUTH 

I desire to say to my brethren and sisters what I have often said, 
and which is still true, that the work of the Lord is progressing on the 
earth, and there is no power beneath the Celestial kingdom that can pre- 
vent its progress ; for so the Almighty has decreed. I bear this testimony 
to you. I feel in every fiber of my soul that it is true; and, indeed, if it 
were not true — notwithstanding the hopes we have, notwithstanding the 
faith with which the Lord has blessed us, notwithstanding the 
prosperity that has attended us here in our labors in the valleys of these 
mountains, in harmony with the purposes of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints — if it were not true that the Almighty is at the helm, 
and has been at the helm from the beginning, and will continue to the 
end, our hopes and our anticipations for present and for future life would 
be in vain. This work is the power of God unto salvation, and nothing 
else will do, nothing else can compare with it. Even error, as it has been 
said by one, may become venerable with age, and may become popular by 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

the number of its votaries ; but neither error nor the popularity of num- 
bers will avail for the salvation and redemption and exaltation of the 
children of Almighty God. 

Our hope of salvation must be founded upon the truth, the whole , 
truth, and nothing but the truth, for we cannot build upon error and 
ascend into the courts of eternal truth and enjoy the glory and exaltation 
of the kingdom of our God. That cannot be done. 

Then I bear testimony again to you, my brethren and sisters, that the 
foundation of the cause in which we are engaged is the gospel truth, and 
it is a glorious thing to know that so many — and yet so few in comparison 
to the vast aggregation of humanity — have learned the truth, learned the 
fact that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation, 
and that it must of necessity be the truth, for God has never devised error 
for the redemption of his children, nor for their blessing and exaltation. 
He has never given to the children of men falsehood and error to lead 
them back into his presence. The Almighty, in the beginning, never de- 
vised a plan for the redemption of his childern that was not true, that 
was not efficacious, that would not be effectual in the accomplishment of 
his purpose to bring to pass the final exaltation into the kingdom and 
the enjoyment of his presence, of all his children who would obey his 
laws and keep his commandments. 

THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH 

I testify to you, as I know and feel that I live and move and have 
my being, that the Lord raised up the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, and 
endowed him with divine authority, and taught him those things which 
were necessary for him to know that he might have power to lay the 
foundation of God's Church and kingdom in the earth. Joseph Smith 
was true to the covenants that he made with the Lord, true to his mis- 
sion, and the Lord enabled him to accomplish his work, even to the seal- 
ing of his testimony with his shed blood. His testimony is now, and has 
been, in force among the children of men as verily as the blood of Jesus 
Christ is in force and a binding testimony upon all the world, and it has 
been from the day it was shed until now, and will continue until the wind- 
ing up scene. 

I bear my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, of the divinity 
of the mission and work that was accomplished by President Brigham 
Young and his associates in fleeing from the wrath that threatened in 
Illinois and Missouri and other places, into these peaceful vales, which 
was done by the will of heaven and by the guiding power of the Holy 
Spirit. President Young and the pioneers were enabled to lay the founda- 
tion of a commonwealth, the equal of which is scarcely to be found within 
the borders of our glorious land, and it was done, not by the wisdom of 
Brother Brigham, nor of Brother Heber C. Kimball, nor of any of their 
associates, grand men as they were, true servants of the living God as they 
were, faithful and true to their callings, grand as was their integrity to 
the cause of Zion — but back of them, behind them, above them and below, 
and all around them, was the power of God, leading and directing them,

and thus consummating his purposes through their instrumentality. We 
give the honor to our Father in heaven, and we also honor and bless the 
names of those great and good men whom the Lord chose to accomplish 
his purpose, and through whom he did accomplish his purpose without 
failure. 

I bear my testimony to the integrity of John Taylor as one of the 
purest men I ever knew in my life, a man clean from head to foot, clean 
in body and clean in spirit, free from every vulgar thing, so common 
among the children of men. I know whereof I speak, for I was with 
him day and night, month after month, and year after year, and I bear 
my testimony of his integrity. He was a martyr with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. He suffered more than death with Joseph and Hyrum, and the 
Lord preserved him and honored him by calling him to take charge of 
his work for a season in the earth, thus exalting him to that most glorious 
and most responsible position that any man could be called to occupy in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I bear my testimony to the faithfulness of Wilford Woodruff, a man 
in whom there was no guile, a man honest to the core, a man susceptible 
to the impressions of the Spirit of the Lord, a man guided by inspiration 
in the performance of his duty, far more than by any gift of wisdom or 
of judgment that he himself possessed. 

I bear my testimony to the work that was accomplished by President 
Lorenzo Snow, although it was brief, yet some of the things which were 
left for him to do were absolutely necessary in order to relieve his suc- 
cessor and others that may arise in time to come, from mistakes and 
errors that had crept in before. 

As to the present administration of the gospel and of the work of 
the Lord I have nothing to say. Let the work speak for itself, let the 
people and the voice of the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints say what is being done by the Lord, let it not be said by me, 
nor by my counselors and my associates. The Lord forbid that I should 
ever imagine for one moment that we are of any great importance in 
this great work of the Lord. Others may be raised up, and the Lord 
can shape their minds, he can qualify them and can humble them, if need 
be, to fit them for the duties and responsibilities that may be required at 
their hands. I believe that Zion is prospering, and that so far as our spir- 
itual life, our spiritual growth, and our faith are concerned, as well as our 
temporal condition, we are prosperous, a^id all is well in Zion today. 

BENEFITS OF VISITS BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

We made a short visit not long ago to some of our southern settle- 
ments. It is something that we should do oftener. I am conscious of it 
now, more so than I have been in times past. I am satisfied that the 
authorities of the Church should visit the people. It is not enough that 
the teachers in the wards should visit the Saints, and the stranger 
within our gates, and understake the work, or at least carry on the work 
of teaching the people the way of righteousness and of truth, and union, 
and love. That is not sufficient. It is not sufficient that the bishops should

visit the people of their wards and keep in touch with them and be- 
come acquainted with the people, and let the people know who is the father 
of the ward, — this is not enough. It is not quite sufficient that the presi- 
dencies of the stakes of Zion should visit the people, and should under- 
stand the necessities of those who dwell in their stakes, and be known 
of them. For it is also necessary that the Presidency of the Church, the 
Twelve Apostles, the Patriarchs, the Seven Presidents of Seventies, the 
Presiding Bishopric, in fact all the general authorities of the Church, 
should visit as far as possible, and see the people, and be seen of them. 
We want to keep in touch with and know one another. So far as I feel 
at present, I know of nothing that I would not like you to know con- 
cerning me. I want you to know what I am, what I am like, whether I 
am a man or not, whether I am trying to magnify my calling or not. I 
want you to look at me and know something of what I am doing; I 
want you to know me and I would like to know you. And so I can speak 
for my brethren. We have nothing that is not in common with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We know nothing, and we will preach nothing to the 
people except that which the Lord God has revealed, and we advise and 
counsel those who are in authority, and whose duty and business it is to 
teach and preach the principles of the gospel to the world and to the 
Latter-day Saints, to confine their teachings and their instructions to the 
word of God that has been revealed. There is a great deal that has been 
revealed that has not yet been lived up to, I assure you. There is a great 
deal yet remaining to be learned. There is a great deal that is yet to be 
taught in the spirit of instruction, and there is a great deal that has been 
revealed through the Prophet Joseph and his associates that the people 
have not yet received in their hearts, and have not yet become converted 
to as they should. When we obey and are capable of observing the 
precepts of the gospel and the laws of God and the requirements of 
heaven, which have already been revealed, we will be far better off and 
nearer the goal of perfection in wisdom, knowledge and power than we 
are today. When that time comes, then there are other things still 
greater yet to be revealed to the people of God. Until we do our duty, 
however, in that which we have received, until we are faithful over the 
things that are now committed into our hands, until we will live our re- 
ligion as we have it now. as the Lord has given it to us, to add command- 
ments, to add light and intelligence to us over that which we have already 
received, which we have not yet fully obeyed, would be to add condem- 
nation upon our heads. It is enough for us to live in the light of present 
inspiration and present revelation and for each individual member of the 
Church to keep the commandments of the Lord and labor in the Church 
as the Spirit may give him and her guidance in the performance of duty. 
Every soul of us is entitled to inspiration from God, to know what is our 
duty, and how we are to do it. We have not learned it yet, not all of us, 
but we are in a fair way to learn. The Lord is still patient : he is long- 
suffering ; he is full of love and graciousness towards all, and we are 
doing a little better all the time. I believe we are a little more faithful 
in the performance of our duties than we have been in the past; yet 
there is great room for improvement. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



IMPORTANT COMMANDMENTS TO BE KEPT 

One of the important commandments of God is to honor the Sabbath 
day and keep it holy. Many of our people neglect that commandment; 
they don't do it, and many of us permit our children to go loose on the 
Sabbath day, instead of curtailing, teaching, and curbing them within the 
boundary of the gospel requirements. The law of God is that we shall 
love one another. If we could learn to do that, then amen to bishops' 
trials and bishops' courts, or, to the necessity of them. If we only loved 
one another so that we would do good to others as we would have them 
do unto us, there would be no bickering, contention, quarreling, strife, bit- 
terness, or evil in the hearts of neighbor against neighbor, and all would 
be peace and happiness. If we loved God with all our hearts more than 
we love the world, our houses, our lands, our flocks, our herds, and our 
gold in the banks, I say, if we loved God with all our hearts and minds 
and strength, there would be no necessity for prisons, no necessity for 
courts of justice in the land. There would be no necessity for the occu- 
pation of lawyers and pettifoggers to dispute and contend over differences 
and disagreements among the people. All these things would be as things 
of the past, relegated to uselessness. Men would then know the truth, 
they would love it and would walk in its light which shines from the pres- 
ence of the glorious Father, because then we would show that we love 
him and are willing to keep his commandments. W e have much to learn, 
too, in relation to these things. 

SIMPLE BUT VITAL TEACHINGS TO BE OBSERVED 

The Lord has given us a little simple word, so simple that the weak- 
est of all that are or could be called Saints, should be able to observe and 
obey it, and yet some of the very strongest of us do not do it, but neglect 
to keep it. We have much to learn yet, in that simple little Word of 
Wisdom that the Lord has given to his Saints for their health, vitality 
and strength, but not all of us observe it. 

The Lord has given to us the law of tithing, by which we are to 
furnish, by our tithes and our' offerings, the revenue necessary to carry 
the gospel to the world, to gather the Saints, and to gather the elders 
after their missions are completed, from their mission field, and build 
temples and conduct the work that is necessary to be performed in the tem- 
ples for the living and for the dead. Not all of us observe that law. 
and yet. I am happy to say to you, that this year shows a very material 
increase in the fidelity of the Latter-day Saints in their observance of that 
law. Our tithes this year so far have been better than at any other time 
previously. That is a good indication, and yet it may be improved very 
materially. 

A YOUNG MAN IN AN OLD BODY 



Now, there are many other things, but I cannot tell them all to you. 
I begin to feel that T am geetins: to be an old man, or rather a young man 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

in an old body. I think I am just about as young as I ever was in my 
life in spirit. I love the truth today more than I ever did before in the 
world. I believe in it more firmly now than I ever did before, because 
T see it more clearly, I understand it better from day to day by the prompt- 
ings and inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord that is vouchsafed to me ; 
but my body gets tired, and I want to tell you, sometimes my poor old 
heart quivers considerably. 

I feel admonished now to bless you, and I bless you in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 

SOME HISTORICAL ITEMS 

I have just a few little items that I would like to announce : 
Since our last conference, the Tintic stake of Zion has been organ- 
ized, being a part taken from the Nebo stake, with E. Frank Birch, pres- 
ident. 

The following wards have been organized, an indication of what I 
have said to you that Zion is growing, increasing, progressing:

Spanish Fork, Second ward, Nebo stake ; John Stevenson, Diamondville 
ward, Woodruff stake ; Robert Heber Beesley, Sunset ward, North Davis 
stake ; Franklin L. Gunnell, Wellsville ward, Hyrum stake. 

The following brethren laboring in the mission field have passed 
away : 

Elder Peter Okelberry of Hazel, Idaho, died in the California mission, 
at Santa Anna, on May 22, 1917, of hemorrhage of the brain ; Elder 
Enoch Coleman Hunsaker, of Honeyville, Box Elder county, Utah, died 
September 27, in the Eastern States mission. 

There are now existing 797 wards of the Church and 38 independent 
branches, 74 stakes and 21 missions. 

RELIEF SOCIETY PENNY FUND 

In addition to these little items, I desire to mention the fact that 
some little time ago a number of the sisters of the General Relief Society 
Board inaugurated the idea of asking for a penny subscription per week 



s 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



or per month, as the case might be — I don't know exactly, but I think 
it was a penny a week — from the sisters of the Relief Society throughout 
the Church, a contribution to be used to assist in the erection of the two 
temples now under construction, one in Canada and one in the islands of 
the Pacific Ocean. In an almost incredibly short time this penny fund 
has accumulated a sum equal to twelve thousand seventy-four dollars 
and some cents. It has not been missed by any of the sisters, and it will 
just add about a little over $6,000 apiece to the two temples, to help pay 
for the workmen. This principle of the penny fund was inaugurated first 
in the City of Nauvoo, at the time the temple at Nauvoo was under con- 
struction. The suggestion came from Mary Smith, the wife of Hyrum 
Smith, and was seconded by her sister, Mercy Rachel Thompson. 
Through the sanction and permission of Hyrum Smith and the Prophet 
and others, they inaugurated this penny fund. The invitation to con- 
tribute was extended to all the branches of the Church then known in the 
United States and in Great Britain, and I only need to add that all the 
cash that was ecessary to pay for all the nails and the glass used in the 
temple at Nauvoo was furnished by this penny fund. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE GREAT LATTER-DAY WORK 

Now, the Lord bless you, and may the work of the Lord continue 
to grow in your hearts and in your love. There is not anything in the 
world, nor beneath the Celestial kingdom of God today that is of equal 
importance to this latter-day work that you are engaged in. Receive 
that from me as my testimony. It is not mine only; it is the testimony 
of the Lord, and his word that cannot and must not be broken, and will 
not fail, and, therefore, I repeat it unto you and admonish you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ, to keep the commandments 
and observe the laws of God, ' for they are the greatest things on earth 
to us. Amen. 

A solo, entitled, "Storm and Calm," was sung by Edna Godfrey. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

I am sure the testimony borne by our President this morning has 
touched every heart present, and he has given us the key-word for our 
acts and conduct of life, namely, to love God and one another, and show 
it by keeping the Lord's commandments, not neglecting those things 
that have been required of us. By following these instructions he said 
we will be blessed, and I bear test'mony to this. 

PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH, SPIRITUALLY AND TEMPORALLY 

The Church, since last we met, has made much progress. The peo- 
ple in Zion have been blessed this year with bounteous harvests. The 
Lord has promised that he will remember those who pay their tithes 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H.LUND.

and offerings, and the President has testified to this being fulfilled in 
temporal blessings that the Saints have received, and still more in the 
spiritual blessings bestowed upon them. 

On our trip south we enjoyed meeting the Saints and witnessing 
the spirit that they possessed and we were much gratified by seeing the 
love which they exhibited towards the President of the Church and h : s 
party. I believe also, as he said, that it would be good to do more of 
this visiting. 

TEMPLES AND TEMPLE WORK 

I would like to talk a little on the activities of the Church. You 
know the Presidency have the directing affairs as far as the Church in 
general is concerned. Temple building is going on. Our two temples, 
in Hawaii and Canada, are progressing towards completion. It will take 
some time yet before the Canada temple will be finished, but the Hawaiian 
temple is approaching its dedication very fast. Temple building is a char- 
acteristic of this .dispensation, and this will not be at an end by building 
these two additional temples. We look forward to the time when the land 
of Zion will be covered with temples, so that the great work may go on, 
both for the living and for the dead. I am pleased to state to this congre- 
gation that the Saints are alive in this work. Our temple here in Salt 
Lake City is filled almost to overflowing. They are doing a splendid 
work in Logan, and in the other temples, showing that the people of 
God are anxious to go to the temples to receive their blessings. We 
want to encourage them in this work. We know the faith-promoting 
influence it has upon the living when they are performing this un- 
* selfish labor, coming, at great expense to many, to the temple to do 
work for their forefathers, and hence we commend their efforts in this 
matter. It : s not that they expect any reward here, but their hearts are 
turned to their fathers, and they feel repaid for all that they are doing 
in coming to the temple, by getting spiritually refreshed, and their 
testimony strengthened. 

BUILDING MEETING HOUSES AND ATTENDING MEETINGS 

We are also continuing the work of building meeting houses. When 
the Lord has blessed the Saints with means, they ought to show, their 
gratitude in performing the different duties required of them, and 
one of these is to build houses of worship to God, so that both old and 
young can go there and receive instructions and blessings, both by hearing 
those who speak and by renewing their covenants in partaking of the 
sacrament. 

The President enjoined upon us to remember the Sabbath Day. 
We should all feel that it is our duty to attend meetings in the house 
of the Lord, to go there and listen to what is said, and with the rest 
enjoy the Spirit of God, and show this example to our children also, 
that they may look upon the Sabbath as a holy day that should be spent

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in visiting the house of the Lord and in meditation on the things that 
pertain to godliness. 

The Trustee-in-Trust has spent great sums of money to help our 
brethren to build meeting houses in different parts of Zion, also in the 
missions. He feels impressed with the necessity of doing this, and we 
are pleased that the Saints are responding so heartily in the matter of 
building good houses of worship. 

THE CHURCH HISTORIAN'S OFFICE AND RECORD KEEPING 

I am thankful that we have our new office quarters completed, and 
we would like you to come and see them. I am especially glad that 
we have had the Historian's office moved into a fire-proof building from 
the place where it has been so many years. I have often been anxious 
about the precious documents, letters and books that we have in the 
Historian's office. If we should have been unfortunate enough to have 
had a fire and to lose them we could never have restored the loss, and 
I am therefore happy now that we have these splendid collections of 
historical matters pertaining to the Church placed in a safe building. 
We would like you to visit that department also. 

You may not know what we are doing in the Historian's office, and 
yet a great work has been performed there. Record-keeping was rec- 
ommended by the Lord from the very beginning. On the 6th .day of 
April, 1830. a revelation was given in which the Lord commanded -that 
a record should be kept. We know the importance of records. When 
Lehi and his family left Jerusalem and through the commandment 
of the Lord were going to a strange country, he understood by the 
inspiration of the Lord how necessary it was to have with him the rec- • 
ords of the laws and prophecies then extant, or at least a copy of them, 
and Nephi and his brethren were sent back to Jerusalem to obtain them. 
They found that Laban who had these records in his possession was not 
willing to give them up. They offered to give him great wealth which 
they had left in Jerusalem if he would g've them the records that he 
possessed. Laban thirsted after their wealth, but was not willing to give 
them the records. Nephi at length obtained them and brought them back 
into the wilderness to Lehi, who was very much pleased.' He knew 
that if they had not the records of the Lord's hand-dealings in the past 
it would be much harder for his descendants to continue in the fa : th 
and to retain the knowledge of God and what he desired his children 
to do. Because of the loss of the records afterwards, we find that the 
people dwindled in darkness, ignorance and unbelief. Now the object 
of keeping records is that the people may know the commandments 
of the Lord and what he has done in former ages and in this age as 
well. 

THE CHURCH HISTORIANS 

Oliver Cowdery was the first h'storian of the Church. Afterwards 
the Lord, in revelation, appointed John Whitmer as the historian. John 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

Whitmer was one of the eight witnesses of the Book of Mormon. He 
was very zealous in helping the prophet. In the later days of the trans- 
lation of the Book of Mormon he acted as scribe, and afterwards he 
helped the prophet in preparing the revelations to be printed, and he 
went to Missouri for that purpose. He felt how important the work 
was that the Lord had commenced, and if he had only kept that spirit 
with him he would not have met the fate he did, that of being excom- 
municated from the Church. But love of worldly th : ngs took posses- 
sion of him and he left the Church. But I want to say this to his credit, 
that though he left the Church and was angry at the brethren, yet 
he never denied the testimony which he subscribed to when the Book 
of Mormon was printed. Once when he was in company with a lot 
of Missourians, enemies of the Church, they brought up the question 
of the Book of Mormon. He boldly .declared that he knew the contents 
of that book to be true, for he had seen the plates from wh : ch it was 
translated. And shortly before his death he testified to John C. Whit- 
mer, a nephew of his, that he knew the book to be true. Still he died 
outside of the Church, but what he had seen he could not deny, and the 
fear of men did not cause him to waver in his testimony. And we can 
say the same of all the witnesses of the Book of Mormon. Several 
of them were not faithful to the end, yet they were always ready to bear 
testimony to the truth of that to which they had subscribed their names 
as witnesses. 

John Whitmer was released to go to Missouri, in 1835, and we have 
Oliver Cowdery again as the Church historian, and in a short time af- 
terwards George W. Robinson, John Corrill and Elias H'gbee became 
Church historians. In 1841 Robert B. Thompson was appointed Church 
historian, and he did faithful work in the office, but his life was cut 
short. He died ten months after his appo : ntment. Brother James Sloan 
then took the place of historian, but he was called to go to Scotland, and 
Willard Richards became the General Recorder of the Church, in 1843 ; 
and in 1845 he became both the historian and general recorder, and 
kept this position until his death, in 1854. George A. Smith then became 
the General Church Historian and General Church Recorder, and ably 
conducted the affairs of these offices during a longer period of time than 
any other incumbent up to that time or since. In 1871, owing to his duties 
as one of the counselors of President Young and the Trustee of the 
Church, he was released from his pos : tion as Historian and Albert Car- 
rington took his place. Three years afterwards Orson Pratt became 
the Historian, and kept the office until his death in 1881, after which 
Brother Wilford Woodruff was sustained as Church Historian until 
1889, when he was chosen President of the Church. Franklin D. Rich- 
ards then became the Church Historian and remained in that position 
until his death, which occurred December 6, 1899. The double office 
of historian and general Church recorder was first bestowed upon Wil- 
lard Richards, and the double office has been kept ever since by the 
one that has been sustained as historian. There have been several breth- 
ren sustained as assistant historians in the Church. The first one was 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Wilford Woodruff; others were Albert Carrington, Franklin D. Rich- 
ards, John Jacques, Amos Milton Musser, Charles W. Penrose, Andrew 
Jenson, Brigham H. Roberts, Orson F. Whitney, Joseph F. Smith, Jr., 
and A. William Lund. President Joseph F. Smith also devoted much 
time in the Historian's office and did a splendid work. 

THE WORK OF THE HISTORIAN'S OFFICE 

Now, as to the work that has been done in the office. We have 
seven hundred manuscript books that contain a great deal of historical 
matter that has been collected during these many years. In fact you 
can find .something for every day in the years that have passed. They 
are chronologically inserted, in an elastic binding, so when we find more 
historical material it can be inserted without having to add other vol- 
umes, and information can be quickly found when we know about the 
time the event took place. The indexes of persons and events are very 
extensive also, enabling us to answer without difficulty inquiries made 
in regard to Church affairs in the stakes, wards and missions. 

Brother Roberts edited the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
or, as it : s called, the History of the Church. It was written by the 
Prophet, or under his direction, day by day, and Brother Roberts added 
elucidating notes as well as a very interesting introduction to each vol- 
ume, setting forth the main things treated of in the volume. I would 
advise the Latter-day Saints to obtain these books, as they are of great 
value, and are sold at cost in order to give all an opportunity to obtain 
them. 

Brother Roberts has also written a history of the Church which has 
been published in an eastern magazine, The Americana, which brings 
the history nearly up to our time. It has been an immense labor, and 
I hope that the Church will some time be enabled to publish it so that 
all can enjoy the contents of this work. 

Brother Andrew Jenson has also written a good many things of 
great value, and is continually giving his mind to the work of collat- 
ing and collecting data and facts concerning Church history. When he 
finds a new fact or a new date that he didn't know before, he feels as 
happy as the placer miner who finds a nugget of gold in the first pan 
that he washes out, and it is no wonder that Brother Jenson estimates 
the value of the Historian's office at a nr'llion dollars ! It is indeed a 
valuable collection, which cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. 
Brother Jenson has charge of the department of recording events of 
the nineteenth century, and hopes to finish that task. Joseph F. Smith, 
Jr., has charge of the department recording the events for the twentieth 
century, and the assistants in each of these departments are busily en- 
gaged in collecting, arranging and indexing historical facts. 

The history of the missions, of the stakes and of the wards is 
attended to, and you who want a history printed of your ward or city 
will not be able to make it complete unless you apply to the Historian's 
office, and you need not pay out h : g sums of money, as some have done, 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



1.3 



to get histories written of their cities, which after all are not complete 
and not entirely correct. We are trying to prove every date that we 
give. I want to .say concerning Jenson's Chronology, a work that has 
cost immense labor, that we would like to see the Saints buy these books. 
We have a large supply on hand, that belongs to the Historian's office, 
and the book should be useful in every family. If it cannot be bought by 
every family, I think that every association throughout Zion ought to 
have one for reference. 

But I am taking too much time. I want to bear my testimony to 
the truth of the gospel. I can say yes and amen to the testimonies borne 
by our President. Joseph Smith was sent of God to establish his work, 
and the gospel that we believe in is the gospel of salvation. Let no one 
shake your faith in it, but be steadfast, brethren and sisters, that you 
may obtain the blessings that the gospel promises. And may God bless 
you all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

I rejoice exceedingly in once more having the opportunity of meet- 
ing with the Latter-da}' Saints in general conference. I have never been 
present at any of the conferences, during the past thirty-five years, but 
what I have rejoiced exceedingly in the teachings of the servants of the 
Lord ; and I have been fed, as you no doubt have today, the bread of 
life by what we have heard. 

INTEGRITY OF THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH 

I endorse every word that has been spoken regarding the divinity of 
the mission of the men who have presided over this Church. Presi- 
dent Smith stated that he had nothing to say regarding the present ad- 
ministration, but appealed to the people for the : r verdict. It has fallen 
to my lot to labor now for thirty-five years, lacking a few days, with 
the Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles, and T can bear 
witness that I know, as I know that I live, that during all this time the 
inspiration of Almighty God has attended all of the men who have oc- 
cupied the positions in the Presidency of this Church. I bear witness 
that at no time within my knowledge has any President of the Church 
had more of the inspiration of Almighty God, and more .of the love 
of h : s associates in the Presidency and of members of the Council of 
the Twelve, than has President Joseph F. Smith. I bear witness to you 
that each and every man chosen to occupy a position in the Council of 
the Twelve during - the presidency of Joseph F. Smith has been chosen 
by the inspiration of Almighty God. I bear witness to you that from my 
knowledge in visiting among the people that there is a love and a faith 
and a determination to serve Cod existing today, the equal of any period 
during the past thirty-five years. 

I rejoice beyond expression in a knowledge that God lives, that 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, the Redeemer of mankind ; 
that he has spoken from the heavens ; that he has established 
upon the earth the plan of life and salvation, his gospel. I re- 
joice in knowing for myself that all the men who have succeeded 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, who stands at the head of this last 
dispensation, have possessed the inspiration of the office which they have 
held, and that they have in very deed been men of God, inspired of him. 

I rejoice in knowing that all the Latter-day Saints with whom I 
have come in contact for tlrrty-five years, who have been tithe-payers, 
who have been observers of the Word of Wisdom, who have attended 
their fast and sacrament meetings, who have attended to their prayers 
and have suplicated God for the guidance of his Spirit, have just as 
an abiding testimony and as firm a knowledge and conviction of the di- 
vinity of this work, and of the inspiration which has attended the men 
who have presided over it, as I possess. 

GIFTS AND GRACES ENJOYED BY THE SAINTS 

I rejoice in the fact that each Latter-day Saint who has embraced the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and who has kept the commandments of God, 
day by day, year by year, has grown, as our President says that he has 
grown, in a knowledge of the truth, in a testimony of it, and in a love 
for it. I know that there are no gifts, no graces, no author'ty, which 
were possessed in the days of the Savior by his apostles which are not 
possessed today by the people of God. I know that the gift of tongues 
and the interpretation thereof exist in this Church of Christ. I know that 
the. healing power of Almighty God is in this Church. I know that but 
for the healing power of God it would not be my privilege to stand here 
before you today. I know that there are living monuments of the heal- 
ing power of God among this people. If we had a record of all the 
wonderful blessings of the Lord which have come through the Priest- 
hood since the establishment of the Church upon the earth, it would be 
a record far larger than the New Testament. I know that those who go 
out to proclaim this gospel, who keep themselves sweet, clean and pure 
before God. who keep their bodies and their minds in such a shape of 
.purity that they are entitled to the revelations of the Spirit of God, I 
know that they do receive the revelations of the Spirit. 

THE STABILITY AND FAITH OF OL'R MISSIONARIES 

Men have proclaimed this gospel now for eighty long years, and 
during that period, although the world say we are mistaken, although 
they say Joseph Smith was a false prophet, the Book of Mormon is not 
true, and claim that the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants are 
not revelations of God. yet in e : ghty long years men have gone out to 
proclaim this gospel, and have come home to testify to you that God 
has given them an individual knowledge of the truth of the Book of 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



15 



Mormon, of the truths contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
he has given to them an individual knowledge that he lives, and that 
Jesus is the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith was in very 
'deed a prophet of God. During all these eighty years no single mission- 
ary has ever returned home to announce that he has found the truth in 
Scandinavia, or in some other part of Europe, or in South Africa, or in 
Canada, or in any of these United States, or in Mexico, or Central or 
South America, or upon the islands of the Pacific, Men and women by 
the hundreds, yes by the thousands and by the tens of thousands, have 
received the testimony of these missionaries during eighty years, and 
have borne witness that they know that they have had the truth to deliver 
to them, and yet all the wisdom of all the world, all the study of all 
the ministers of the various denominations claiming that they have the 
truth, have failed to give the ability to convert one of the missionaries 
who it was claimed was preaching error. Why, it is absolutely ridicu- 
lous, it is absurd, to think that men of honesty, men of integrity, men 
with prayerful and humble hearts, men living virtuous, upright lives, 
and bowing down dailv for eighty long years and supplicating God for 
the guidance of his Spirit, that the Lord would never show one of those 
Elders the error of his way and lead him to the true path of rectitude and 
right and the plan of life and salvation. Why, if we did not know that 
the gospel was true, do you think the Latter-day Saints would expend in 
money and in loss of time about two million dollars a year to proclaim 
it? Do you think that fathers and mothers would rejoice more in send- 
ing out their sons to proclaim the gospel than in having them make a 
fortune? Do you think for one minute that if there was any lack of 
faith, or a lack of knowledge on the part of the Latter-day Saints, that 
they would dare send out their boys to preach? Why, they would be 
frightened to death ; they would be afraid of losing their boys. Have 
we any fear that all the knowledge of all the world, that all the learning 
and study and all the doctrines of the world will convert one single, 
honest Latter-day Saint boy? Not a bit of it: not a bit of it! We 
know, as we know that we live, that they cannot convert our boys. Why? 
Because the boys have the truth to proclaim. Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigr'on told the truth when they sa : d: 

"Now. after the many testimonies which have been given of him. 
this is the testimony last of all which we give of him, that he lives, for 
we saw him even on the right hand of God. and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father ; that by h : m 
and through him and of him the worlds were created, and the inhabitants 
thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

The world may say, "We don't believe it." but it is a fact that these 
men did see the Savior. It is a fact that Oliver Cowdery and Joseph 
Smith, in the temple in Kirtland. did see the Savior, and that Moses and 
Elias and Elijah did appear, and that all the keys of the gospel of every 
dispensation were conferred upon them, and the fruits of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ have been enjoyed by those who have rendered obedience 
to its truths. The growth, the strength, the power of the gospel pro- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



claims the truth of these things. The failure of the wisdom of the 
world to turn away from the truth those who have received the witness 
and the testimony of the gospel from' our Heavenly Father, also bears 
strong witness to every thoughtful, intelligent man, of the growth and 
the power and the strength of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

REASONS AGAINST FURNISHING TOBACCO FOR OUR SOLDIERS 

I want to say just a word or two of counsel to the Latter-day Saints. 
There has been some agitation in the papers advocating that men and 
women show their generosity and their loyalty to the young men of 
Utah who have volunteered and offered their lives in defense of their 
country, by supplying those young men with tobacco ! They are arguing 
in the papers that it is not particularly harmful, that it is very mild, and 
so on ; that our tobacco is better and milder than the tobacco of France, 
etc., etc. As Latter-day Saints we have received a revelation from Al- 
mighty God not to use tobacco, and it behooves us each one to use his 
or her influence to the uttermost to see that our boys keep this command- 
ment of the Lord and pay no attention to the soph : stries and the ideas 
and the reasoning of men in favor of the use of tobacco. The end of 
all controversy has been reached for every true Latter-day Saint because 
the Lord has said, "Tobacco is not good for man." Tt is suggested that 
the tobacco sellers are advertising their wares. I want to read to you — 
and the book has opened at the place I want without my hunting for it — 
what the Lord promises if you and I will refrain from hot drinks (which 
the prophet of God said were tea and coffee), and from liquor and strong 
drinks of all kinds, and from tobacco. Fie says, "And all Saints who 
remember to keep and to do these sayings, walking in obedience to the 
commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their 
bones, and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even 
hidden treasures ; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and 
not faint ; and I, the Lord, give unto them a promise that the destroying 
angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

He might have added, "And I the Lord do not give a promise unto 
those who fail to obey these commandments, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them and not slay them." 

I find in this same book that when the Lord commands, and men 
obey not his commands, then they fail to get the blessing. Then men 
say that the promises of the Lord are not true and fulfilled ; but woe 
unto such, for their reward lurketh from beneath, and not from above. 

I find in this hook, among the revelations of the Lord to you and to 
me, that when we do the things that the Lord commands, he declares : 
"Then am I bound." As Latter-day Saints we want to set our faces as 
flint against any proposition or any propaganda of any kind which will 
so affect our children, if they follow that propaganda, that they will not 
he entitled to the promises and the blessings that come from keeping the 
commandments f the Lord. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



GRATITUDE FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL 

I thank the Lord again for a knowledge of the gospel, for a testi- 
mony of the divinity of it, for a love of the truth, for a desire to labor 
for it. There is no labor in all the world that has ever brought to me 
that same joy, that same happiness, that same exqui.s : te bliss as has 
come to me by being able to testifiy to all the world of my knowledge 
of a Redeemer, and of my knowledge that Joseph Smith was his prophet, 
the true and the living prophet of God, and that he did establish the 
truth, and that it will grow and increase and prosper and that it will 
triumph. The only fear that I have ever had has been that I might 
fail because men w'th greater knowledge, with far greater wisdom, with 
greater power and inspiration, who have had more testimonies and more 
wonderful manifestations given to them than I have ever had, or ever 
hope to have, through failure to live the gospel have fallen by the way- 
side. But I know that if you and I can be humble, prayerful, full of 
love of God and love of our fellows, that we shall stand firm and faith- 
ful, and shall endure to the end, which may God grant is my prayer, and 
I ask it in humility, and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : by President Frank Y. Taylor, of 

''We thank thee, O God, for a the Granite stake of Zion. 
prophet." Conference adjourned until 2 

The closing prayer was offered p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 



President Joseph F. Smith pre- 
sided, and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor 
labor fear." 

Prayer was offered by President 



Peter G. Johnston, of the Union 
stake, and member of the Church 
Auditing Committee. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "'How firm a founda- 
tion, ye Saints of the Lord." 



PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I believe I express the feeling and sentiment of all who were present 
at this morning's session of the conference, when I say that I was greatly 
delighted and blessed by listening to the instructions that were imparted, 
and I hope that: the good spirit which was present this morning in rich 
abundance may also be poured out upon us gathered here this afternoon. 

ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT SMITH'S OPENING ADDRESS 

I believe the Latter-day Saints have long been impressed with the 
feeling that unless the Spirit of God accompanies the word that is 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spoken it is net refreshing to us, we are not satisfied with simply hearing 
the principles that are enunciated. They are all divine, there is not a 
doctrine of the Church that has not come from a divine source, but when 
we listen to words spoken to us, unaccompanied by the inspiration that 
gave them orginally, we do not feel satisfied ; but no matter how simple 
may be the expressions that are used, and how often we have heard the 
doctrines of the Church explained, we need the accompanying Spirit to 
be present with them, and unless it is with the word, as I have said, we 
do not feel satisfied. I felt fully satisfied this morning. I was afraid that 
the President was going a little beyond the time he intended to occupy, 
because he did need to reserve his strength ; but to me it was just right. 
Everything that he said was right. And the time that he occupied was 
sufficient for us, although we are always eager to hear him, no matter 
how long he may feel inclined to speak. The words that were spoken 
to us this morning by the speakers were impressive and precious, and 
the Spirit of God was with them, and I rejoice that I had the pleasure 
of being here today. 

Now I desire that I may speak under the influence of the Holy 
Ghost, becaues I never feel satisfied in my soul when I am called upon to 
address a congregation, unless I can feel that the Spirit of God is with 
me. When I ,do know that, then I feel measurably satisfied, although 
I am occas'onally somewhat dissatisfied with myself when I sit down ; but 
when I realize that the Spirit of Gcd has been with me, and particularly 
when I feel that I was inspired to say the things that came to my mind, 
then I am satisfied, and I glorify and praise the Lord. 

CHOIR LEADERS AND CONGREGATIONAL SINGING 

While we were singing the first hymn I was thinking about a custom 
that was in vogue when I was a boy. It was a game called "Follow 
your leader." Generally there was a great deal of mischief attached to 
it. I don't want to attach that to my remarks now, but I do wish that 
the congregation would follow the leader in the singing. When we sing, 
"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear," there needs to be a 
kind of a vim to it. But when it is. "C-o-m-e, c-o-m-e, y-e S-a-i-n-t-s 
(Vnging slowly fn imitation], it is not very invigorating. I have heard 
hymns sung in some of our congregations in the wards, and the time was 
something like that which I tried to imitate just now. Follow your 
leader in the singing, and if he understands music anything like as well 
as Brother Tony Lund does, why, he will be right in the time as well as 
in the tune ; and the leaders might take a lesson from him by adapting 
the time to the sentiment. He is right ; he follows the music, and he 
understands the spirit of the hymn or song, he will lead you properly, 
and I hope that the leaders in the congregations of Israel — we have 
a good many fine musical men, men of talent in music — I hope that they 
will learn that lesson, adapting the time to the music, and when it needs 
a little stirring up. why, stir it up and then get the congregation to 
"follow the leader." 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

LEADERS IN ISRAEL 

We had a strong testimony this morning from President Smith 
concerning the great men who have been our leaders in Israel from the 
time of the Prophet Joseph Smith down to the time of our present ad- 
ministration. Of course he was too modest to say anything about his 
own, but Brother Grant made up for it somewhat, and I wish to add my 
testimony to Brother Grant's concerning the present leader in Israel. I 
have known him for many years, I have always known of him favorably. 
I know that he is a man of God, I know that his heart is set to do the 
will of God and to teach men so. He always has been in that mind 
ever since I first became acquainted with h : m, and in later years, when 
I have been intimately associated with him, I have learned more and 
more to admire him and to have confidence in him an.d in his word, and 
to regard him as a true leader, the presen-day leader of the Church 
of Christ on the earth, having all the authority, keys and powers be- 
stowed by the various ministers to the Prophet Joseph Smith who 
came to him from on high. They have been handed down intact and 
have remained in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
that was organized on the 6th day of April, in the year 1830, without 
a break, right down to the present day, and that authority revealed from 
heaven and those keys restored by heavenly messengers are : n the 
Church today, and our leader, Joseph F. Smith, holds the keys, the 
presidency therein, over all the priesthood and authority and membership 
in the Churcha and in saying tbat I mean I have full confidence in him 
in that capacity, as a man, as a servant of God. I believe this is shared 
by the people generally throughout the length and breadth of the land 
that we can call Zion. 

The land of Zion, the land on wtr'ch Zion shall be, extends from the 
extreme north to the extreme south of this continent, but Zion does 
not extend so far at present. Sometimes I think we can hardly call 
this Zion where we dwell, when we contemplate the mixture that we 
have, and the amount of evils that exist among us, not produced per- 
haps by the Latter-day Saints, except in a few instances, but we are a 
mixed people here now, and the Zion of God, so the Lord has revealed, 
is composed of the pure in heart. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for 
they shall see God" was one of the beatitudes uttered by Jesus of Naz- 
areth in that wonderful Sermon on the Mount. Today we can say, I 
think, that this assembly is Zion. Not that we are, anv of us, perfect 
or claiming to be perfect, but we are trying to be Saints of God in 
the full sense of the term, and if we will follow our leader, particularly 
in his instructions to us. like those we had this morning, we will be 
so indeed. I never hear him preach, but he speaks under the influence 
of the Lord, and gives afood counsel to the people, and everybody, 
whether members of the Church or not. who will hearken to his voice 
and be guided by him in the things that he teaches, will be led in the 
straight and narrow way that terminates in the presence of the Eternal 
Father. If we will follow h : m we will be all right, not the slightest 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



doubt of it in the world, and I bear my testimony, added to that of 
Brother Grant, that I know he is a servant of the Most High, and that 
his whole heart and desire are for the benefit and building up of the 
kingdom of God on the earth, and the glorification of our Heavenly 
Father, and the. testimony that Jesus is the Chrst, and that Joseph Smith 
was and is a prophet of the Most H'gh God, in that he is thoroughly 
and completely sincere, and his heart is set to proclaim this to the world, 
and has been ever since I have known him, and a long time before. 
And my desire is that he may remain many years on the earth to lead 
the people. That is in the hands of God, of course, but I feel that we 
need him, that Zion needs him, that Zion wants h : m, and that the people 
of this church desire in their hearts that he may be sustained with 
health and strength of body and mind, and that all things may work to- 
gether that he may remain among us and be our leader for many years 
to come. 

OUR DUTY TO ANCIENT AND LIVING LEADERS 

Now, there is an item or two connected with that that I feel I 
would like to say a word or two about to this congregation, and the 
point is this, that no matter what may have been taught in olden times 
in regard to the policy of the Church of God. no matter what command- 
ments have been given in regard to the administration of its affairs 
at other times, we are today under the direction of the living oracles. 
The living word of God comes to us through the man that stands at the 
head, in preference to anything that has been written aforet : me, or 
spoken in our own days. Circumstances change, and a change of in- 
structions becomes necessary. As the different circumstances arise dif- 
ferent policies have to be engaged in, and when the man that stands at 
the head leads out in any direction in regard to these matters, we will 
be perfectly safe in following him. 

OUR LEADERS AND THE WAR 

Some of our people, some that are very pacific become critical as 
to our war policy. I don't wonder that some of our sisters, our mothers 
in Israel, feel very tender-hearted just now, when they have to allow 
their dear ones, their sons, the boys of thier hearts, to go into the armies 
of the United States, with the' prospect of going abroad, perhaps, and 
being sent to the front, and being engaged practically in war. They 
'feel sad in their hearts and almost refuse to be comforted, and they 
want consolation, and a few of them feel rebellious in their hearts in 
regard to it, and think that there is fault in the leaders of the people 
in permitting and encouraging such things. Now I hope that such 
feelings will be entirely eradicated, and when the man who stands at the 
head of our affairs says, "This policy is right," let our boys go as the.'/ 
are called upon by their country, to defend the rights of the people, to 
establish liberty, to extend freedom among the nations of the earth, to

make potent abroad the principles that are so great and strong at home, 
that the nations of he earh may come to share in our freedom;" when 
he says that is the right thing to do, lets us all feel that we will follow 
our leader and will say, too, in our hearts, that is right, that is the word 
of the Lord unto us. It is written in the scriptures, "Thou shalt not 
kill," and yet on the back of that very often the Lord told his people to go 
forth in battle and slay all the people in certain places because of their 
corruption. He holds the power of life and of death, and what he says 
is right, and what he reveals through his servants the prophets, when 
they hold the keys that I have been talking about, and the prophets are 
led of him, what they say is right, no matter what we may think or 
feel. It is not r : ght for us to engage in the shedding of human blood, 
for vengeance or retaliation. But when the Lord commands or inspires 
his servants to counsel the sons and daughters of Israel to lend their 
aid in the work of righteous warfare, that is different. The Lord has 
told us what we may do in our own cases when our enemies come upon 
us, we are to forgive them if they repent. If they do not repent we are 
to forgive them two, three and even four times, but when they continue 
in their evil work we are not to submit, to allow ourselves and our 
liberties to be trampled under foot. We are to arise in our might and in 
our strength and go forth to victory ; not with a desire to shed blood, 
not with the desire to destroy our fellow creatures, but in self defense 
and because we do want to maintain and hand down to our posterity those 
sacred principles of liberty that have been revealed from on high. Let 
us look upon it in that l : ght, and we will have no fault to find, I think, 
with our brethren who advise them to enter the armies of the United 
States and obey the commanding officers that are placed over them, no 
matter what that may lead them to. 

It is gladdening to my heart that so many of our good boys are will- 
ing to stand up in the defense of their country, and in the defense of their 
homes, for that is what it amounts to doing. If we permit tyranny and 
oppression to go forth, rampant among the naf'ons, and overturn these 
great principles which have brought us so much liberty and so much power 
and influence in the earth, why, we shall be trodden under foot and these 
blessings that we enjoy and want to extend to the nations will be thrown 
down in the dust, and overcome by the powers of evil. The power of 
Satan is great in the earth today. It has been accumulating during the 
centuries that have passed, through the experiences that the evil powers 
have obtained in "ruling in the hearts of the children of disobedience." 
But the time is near at hand when that power will be cast down and Satan 
will be bound, and his hosts with him, in the place of banishment prepared 
for them, and the earth be delivered from that bondage that came and 
entered into the world when our first parents broke the commandment of 
God. The earth has had its experiences, too, and the time is coming when 
it will be delivered from thraldom, sp'iritually as well as physically, and 
be redeemed from bondage and darkness, and love and light and liberty 
will pervail over the face of all the globe, and Jesus Christ will be our 
leader and our king, and the only king that we will bow down to.

OUR GUIDES, THE TEACHINGS OF BOTH ANCIENT AND MODERN PROPHETS 

Now, brethren and sisters, that is quite important, and in regard to 
the scriptures — I believe in the scriptures, I believe that the holy book 
called the Bible — the Old Testament as well as the New Testament, 
contains the word of God. I don't think that everything that is written 
in it is the word of God, nor do any of us, I suppose, because in it are 
the words of the devil and the words of wicked men, and the wor-ds 
of wicked women ; but that which is revealed in it as the word 
of God is true, of course, and the fundamental principles revealed 
for the obedience of the human family are all true. They were 
so in the beginning, and are today, and will be forever. The doc- 
trines of faith in the living and true God and Jesus Christ whom 
he has sent, and of repentance from evil, turning away from 
evil to the good, and baptism for the remission of sins, to cleanse the 
repentant, believing sinner, and the laying on of hands for the imparting 
of the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the resurrection of the dead, and eter- 
nal judgment,' — these are among the first principles of the oracles of God 
as we are taught in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and they stand forever. 
They were so in the very beginning, were taught to our father Adam and 
our mother Eve, after they were driven from the garden for their dis- 
obedience, and were handed down right to the time when the people dem- 
onstrated that they would not receive them, and then the Lord added the 
law through Moses as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ, to the 
original principles of life and salvation. The children of Israel under 
Moses, so we read, were baptized "in the cloud and in the sea," and they 
partook of that spiritual rock that followed them, which rock was Christ. 
But through the hardness of their hearts and their disobedience to those 
higher principles, the Lord gave them the lesser law, which remained 
among them for a long time. And then Jesus our Redeemer came, as 
"the Only Begotten of the Father full of grace and truth," and reintro- 
duced the higher principles of salvation, and those who obeyed received 
the benefits thereof, as we read :n the New Testament. 

It is the same in these latter days, wherever this restored Gospel is 
preached, and people receive it and are obedient to it, and they receive the 
blessings that belong to it. We old missionaries have proved this by 
our experience in many lands. Wherever we have gone with the gospel 
and preached faith and repentance and baptism, and the power and gift 
of the Holy Ghost, and obedience to every word that comes from the 
mouth of God, and people have bowed down to that, no matter how well 
or how badly we preached, how simple we might be, how unlearned, un- 
lettered, we might be, when they received these principles, the power of 
God accompanied our administrations, the Holy Ghost was given to the 
repentant believers who were baptized, and the gifts of the gospel that 
we read about in the old scriptures followed them also ; the sick were 
healed; great and wonderful mairfestations of the power of God physic- 
ally and spiritually were given. I know it by my own experience. I 
don't want to take up the time relating details of these things, but I 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



23 



know that every gift and blessing and power spoken of in the old 
scriptures as following obedience to the gospel of Christ, has followed 
the preaching and obedience to it in these latter days, and we give 
the glory to God for the manifestations of his power and the divinity 
of th : s work. 

In the early Christian church there were many little things that had 
to be done that we do not have to do today, and there are many things in 
these latter days that we have to do which they knew nothing about then. 
But when we have a man, as we have now, and as we have had from the 
days of the Prophet Joseph down, to lead us and direct us, that is the 
thing to do, never mind whether it was done aforetime. For instance, 
Paul told the people in his day, when writing to Timothy, that a bishop 
was to be blameless ; he was to be the husband of one wife ; that is, we 
understand he meant that he was to at least have one wife. Sometimes 
we have bishops that do not have even one wife. Well, is it right to 
retain a man as bishop when he has not a wife at all? Yes, if the man at 
the head says that is right, that he is the right man. He will get a wife 
in good time — no doubt he will if he is "the right man in the right place." 
Now, is there any contradiction in that ? Not at all. Why? Because the 
man who stands at our head has all the authority and a little more than 
Paul had when he lived on the earth. So in regard to other little matters. 
Some of the critics ask sometimes, "why do you have young men, even 
boys, for deacons, when the New Testament teaches that a deacon should 
have one wife? How is it that you have deacons that don't have any 
wives, and perhaps are not old enough to marry?" Well, because that is 
the order today, and that is just as good as the order that was common 
formerly. Who gave the order? Why, a man that had authority in the 
Church in certain localities, and I suppose if we knew the c'rcumstances 
that existed then, we would understand exactly why that declaration was 
made. Today we are under other circumstances and it is a splendid, good, 
thing to have our young men and boys just emerging into manhood, to 
be trained in the Holy Priesthood, and so we give them that office in the 
Aaronic Priesthood which we call the Deacon. It is an office in the 
Aaronic Priesthood, and they are trained up in that, should be trained up 
in that, until they are prepared to receive the higher grades in that priest- 
hood, or be advanced to the Melchizedek Priesthood. 

These things have been revealed in greater plainness, in more detail, 
and with more power and authority and influence than the things that we 
read about in the Old Testament or in the New. And the Church is 
organized today by the gift and power of God, by revelations direct from 
on high, not taken out of books. And the power and authority are here, 
and we should follow our leader, and what he says is right ; he does not 
vary from the things that God has revealed. Now then, if you will just 
get that principle clear in your minds, brethren and sisters, or those few 
brethren and s : sters that do not see them, — I think most of you do, — that 
would do away with a good many difficulties that arise. Explanations 
are wanted very frequently that somebody has raised a question about in 
some of our classes. These classes that you have for reading the scrip- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tures, old and new— don't forget the new or latter-day scriptures. These 
classes should study the Bible and the New Testament and the Book of 
Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, they are to be sustained, they 
are all right; but, friends, don't raise questions to make controversy, to 
show how smart you are, because you can find discrepancy between some- 
thing that was said aforetime and something that has been said in latter 
times. My point is simply this : That this Church that we belong to is a 
new dispensation ; the "dispensation of the fulness of times," and that 
everything essential that was had in former dispensations is right here 
among us, and a little more. 

The Lord promised that he would reveal things kept hid from the 
foundation of the world. What are you going to do about that, if you 
want everything to conform to that which was in vogue aforetime? Now, 
don't think for a moment that I want to say anything against the scrip- 
tures. We believe in them ; I have quoted them freely. I have gained 
the day many, many times in disputes with people who were opposed, 
because I understood something about the scriptures. I believe in the 
Bible, I believe in the Old Testament and in the New, and I believe in the 
Book of Mormon, and I believe in the Doctrine and Covenants, and the 
Pearl of Great Price. I have read them and pondered upon them and 
prayed about them ; but the real, essential thing in these remarks is that 
the living oracles are in the Church today, and the man standing at the 
head as our leader has all the authority and the power, the keys and gifts, 
to lead the people, that was ever had on the earth in the Priesthood. Now 
let us be thankful for this and be guided by it. Some people want us to 
do today everything that the ancient apostles pointed out for their day. 
You know Paul wrote to Timothy and told him to "use a little wine for 
his stomach's sake and his often infirmities." He said, "use no longer 
water." Now, we don't say that. We use water; use it in the sacra- 
ment; use it for our meals; it is the best kind of element you can have 
for drink. Well, shall we use a little wine for our stomach's sake, and our 
often infirmities ? There was an old lady I used to see abroad quite often, 
and she used to keep a little wine — perhaps it was something a little 
stronger, I don't know. She used to take a little nip every now and then. 
"Why," I said, "Sister, what makes you do that?" "Why, Brother," she 
said, "I does it because Paul taught it, I does it for my 'fummities.' " She 
had thought she had all the infirmites and she called them her "fummi- 
ties." She took a little wine for those "fummities." Now, we are not 
obliged to do that because Paul advised Timothy to do it. A noted tee- 
totaler, when he was asked why he did not fellow the advice of Paul, 
answered, "Well, in the first place my name is not Timothy, and in the 
next place, I have not any infirmities," so he was willing to use water. 1 
merely speak of that by way of illustration. 

I remember a man raising a controversy over Paul saying to Tim- 
othy, "The cloak that I left at Troas, bring with thee." "Now," he says, 
"what does that mean, that cloak?" "Why," I said, "it means a cloak, I 
suppose ; Paul forgot his cloak, left it behind, with some parchments that 
he spoke about, and he told Timothy to bring it along with the documents. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



25 



We do not need to discuss anything now about his needing a cloak, or 
about bringing a parchment. I just mention this to show how silly it is 
for people to harp on some text in the New Testament or in the Old 
Testament, and try to make controversies over apparent contradictions or 
.present omissions. Every doctrine that is in the Bible we believe in. We 
believe in faith, we believe in hope,' we believe in charity, we believe in 
love, we believe in fidelity, we believe in honesty, we believe in truthful- 
ness, and everything that is good and true and moral, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches and inculcates, and our leader 
stands out preeminently in these things, and we can afford to follow him. 

Now, don't forget, we are in the Church — I was going to say our 
own — well, it is our Church, although it does not belong to us, we belong 
to it. The Church is Christ's Church, He made it, He revealed it, all the 
words of God to the people have come through him, and we look up to 
him as our living head. But our head on the earth here in the flesh is the 
man who now presides over us, and this Church is sui generis. It has 
something to impart of itself in its own age, and all that we want for our 
guidance and direction in it will come through living oracles. Their 
teachmgs are in conformity with the principles and doctrines, the ordi- 
nances and philosophy and things contained in the Old Testament and in 
the New ; but in regard to the policies, we may have to change, because 
circumstances change, that is another thing entirely. We live in the 
present and receive instructions suited to the present. 

WE STAND FOR LIBERTY AND FREEDOM FROM OPPRESSION 

Now, it is a good thing for us people here in Utah, being a part of 
this great government, to stand by it in the present conflict. It is the 
finest system of government on the earth, no matter about the defects of 
people that are in it and some of those that stand at the head of affairs in 
various localities, — there is no such a government on the earth, in its 
principles, and my belief is that they will go forth to all the world. I can 
see in this tumult occurring now that the purposes of God will be accom- 
plished in extending the principles of liberty and of freedom from oppres- 
sion, of true forms of government throughout the world. If it must be by 
war, why, it will have to come, that is all. Not that we love war or want 
to kill anybody, but we want to stand tip for our rghts, and the rights of 
our neighbors, and the riehts of our children and grandchildren, and those 
that shall come after us, that they mav enjoy all these Morions principles, 
and that they may go forth to every land, as I believe they will. What a 
blessing it is that the people here have and exhibit fidelity to the govern- 
ment under which they live! We believe in its prinrples, they are God- 
given. We want to stand up for them, no matter how circumstances may 
require us to do so, whether it be by devoting part of our money, our in- 
come, or by permitting our sons and our brothers and our fathers to go 
forth to serve in the armies of the nation, to defend it against its foes. 
Whatever it may be, and the man who stands at our head says it is right. 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we will stay by him, because we want to stay by the right. That is the 
idea. 

OUR WORK AND CALLING IN THE WORLD 

Now, remember this is the Church established in the last days, the 
beginning of the kingdom that all the prophets of Israel and all the seers 
and sages among the heathens, and the philosophers and poets of the 
world foresaw, when the nations of the earth should be bound together in 
one bond. That first all there would be wars and plagues and destruc- 
tion, and the wicked would slay the wicked, but the principles of liberty 
would ultimately prevail, and the kingdom of God should spread over all 
the earth, like Daniel saw in the vision, and the way be prepared for the 
coming of the rightful king, Jesus Christ, our Head. Those ancient 
worthies may not all have seen about Christ, but they did foresee the 
establishment of peace on the foundation of righteousness. And now 
our work in the earth, our calling, and what we are for, what we are here 
on the earth to do, is to build up righteousness, to establish truth, to send 
and carry the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth, and bring to- 
gether those that will love he Lord and keep his commandments, walk 
in his ways, be baptized with h : s baptism, and receive the Holy Ghost, 
which enlightens the soul and leads mankind to righteousness and obedi- 
ence to the commandments of God. That is our work and mission. 

OUR MISSION AMONG THE SAINTS AT HOME 

Among the Saints, it is to establish harmony and union, and not 
discord, not to raise up strife on little technicalities on old texts of scrip- 
ture, or modern texts of scripture, but receive the word of God in honest 
hearts and carry it out in our homes, in our families, in our neighbor- 
hoods, wherever we go, carrying with us this divine Spirit that is being 
poured out from on high. God will qualify us for every task. I know 
this in my own experience. I know that God does inspire his servants in 
the latter days to do the work which they are called upon to perforin, 
whatever it may be, and that his Spirit will go with them wherever they 
go on the face of the earth, if they keep themselves clean and unspotted 
from the world, and walk in his ways, and set a pattern worthy of im:- 
tation. 

But I am going beyond my time, so I will close my remarks. I am 
thankful to be here. I praise God from whom all blessings flow, that I 
have been able to be here today and to hear those inspired words given to 
us this morning, and may God help me and you to continue in the faith, 
to serve him, to build up his kingdom and aid in preparing the way for the 
coming of the Prince of Peace, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

are worthy and magnify their call-

My brethren and sisters: I am 
in full accord with the spirit of this 
conference, with the counsels and 
testiomny of our President this 
morning-, and of his brethren who 
have spoken. Their words have 
been very precious to me, and T re- 
joice in them. 

The Holy Being whom we have 
gathered in to worship this after- 
noon is no respecter of persons. 
This he has declared with his own 
voice, speaking through Joseph 
Smith to the peonle, in words 
something like the following: 

"Now therefore, be ye strong 
from henceforth. Fear not. for the 
kingdom is yours. And for your 
salvation, I give you a command- 
ment, for I have heard vour 
pravers, and the poor have com- 
olained before me, and the rich 
have T made, and all flesh is mine, 
and I am no respecter of persons." 

In view of the vast multitude of 
God's children who dwell upon the 
earth, this is a very remarkable 
statement, and the fact that God is 
absolutely impartial is not more 
clearly shown, I think, in any scrip- 
ture than in the glorious Priest- 
hood which we have received. The 
priesthood referred to is composed 
of two great heads or divisions. 
The one is called the Melchizedek, 
or Higher Priesthood, and the 



other the Aaronic or Lesser Priest- 
hood, but, as I understand it, it is 
all one priesthood, the lesser grow- 
ing out of the greater. Now, the 
scope and authority of the priest- 
hood is most clearly defined in a 
revelation given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in March, 1835, in 
Section 107 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, in these very direct and 
impressive words : 

"The power and authority of the 
Higher or Melchizedek Priesthood, is 
to hold the keys of all the spiritual 
blessings of the Church — 

"To have the privilege of receiving 
the mysteries of the kingdom of heav- 
en — to have the heavens opened unto 
them — to commune with the general 
assembly and Church of the first born, 
and to enjoy the communion and pres- 
ence of God the Father, and Jesus the 
Mediator of the new covenant. 

"The power and authoriy of the 
lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to 
hold the keys of the ministering of an- 
gels, and to administer in outward 
ordinances, the letter of the gospel-- 
the baptism of repentance for the re 
mission of sins, agreeable to he cove- 
nants and commandments." 

Now, we very well know that in 
these two great priesthoods there 
are various offices or callings, as for 
instance, in the Higher Priesthood, 
we have the offices of aoostle, high 
priest, seventv, and elder ; and in 
the Lesser Priesthood, that of bish- 
op, priest, teacher, and deacon ; and 
thus we see that the Lord has pro- 
vided these various offices for the 
benefit and blessing of the members 
of his Church. 

My brethren and sisters, it is 
every man's privilege in our Church 
to receive throueh his worthiness, 
the priesthood, and I misdat add it is 
his privilege bv rfeht divine because 
the priesthood of God comes with 
the pospel and belongs to the 
Church of God. We verv well know. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



loo, that there are means of growth 
and advancement in the priesthood, 
which is conferred upon men in an 
orderly way. First, we know that 
upon the young men of Israel, those 
who make themselves worthy, is 
conferred the office of deacon, 
which is the first step in the priest- 
hood. When a young man honors 
this calling, magnifies the office and 
shows himself in every way worthy, 
he may then be permitted to re- 
ceive the office of teacher, and from 
teacher to priest ; and usually when 
he has received and magnified the 
office of a priest he will have reach- 
ed his majority. He is then ready, 
through his experience, and by his 
faithfulness in the Lesser Priest- 
hood, to receive the High Priest- 
hood. The office of elder is con- 
ferred upon him, then the office of 
seventy, and then the great and 
glorious office of a high priest. 

Thus, in time, every young man 
in Israel, as he advances in life, has 
the opportunity to receive a fulness 
of the priesthood. Such is truly the 
case, my brethren and sisters — and 
I say sisters, because I take it that 
the sisters of the Church are equally 
interested with the brethren, in the 
priesthood, for they are to receive 
their blessings and exaltation and 
a^lory through the priesthood held 
by their fathers and husbands. God 
has so ordained it. Therefore, as a 
Church, we are interested in this 
vital subject. 

Now, I don't know whether we 
fully realize and have entered into 
the spirit of the priesthood. I do 
not know whether, in mortality, we 
can fully comprehend it, but this I 
do know, that it is a great and glo- 
rious doctrine. Some further lisfht, 
I mav say great light, is thrown 
upon this important subiect in one 
of the revelations of God to his 



prophet, and mark you, some great 
and glorious truths have come to us 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
truths that were entirely unknown 
to the world in our time, but they 
have come to us and we are familiar 
with them. I tell you it is good to 
be reminded of these things. I re- 
fer to section 84 in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, beginning with the 
thirty-third verse. I invite your 
close attention to these words. I 
would not attempt to repeat them, 
but I will read them carefully from 
the text: 

"For whoso is faithful unto the ob- 
taining these two Prieshoods of which 
I have spoken, and the magnifying 
their calling, are sanctified by the 
Spirit unto the renewing of then- 
bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses 
and of Aaron and the seed of Abra- 
ham, and the church and kingdom, and 
the elect of God; 

"And also all they who receive this 
Priesthood receivefh me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth 
my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath 
and covenant which belongeth to the 
Priesthood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive 
the Priesthood, receive this oath and 
covenant of mv Father, which he can- 
not break, neither can it be moved: 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant, 
after he hath received it, and alto- 
gether turneth therefrom, shall not 
have forgiveness of sins in this world 
nor in the world to come." 

You get some P'ea, by brethren 
and sisters, from this, how very im- 
portant, how extremely sacred is 
the Holy Priesthood, which is noth- 
ing more nor less than divine au- 
thority committed unto man, and 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

in the foregoing declaration is 
shown the absolute impartiality of 
our Father in heaven, for he says : 
"Whoso," (meaning any man and 
every man), "is faithful unto the 
obtaining these two priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the mag- 
nifying their calling," will enter into 
the possession of all things, for he 
will become a joint heir with Jesus 
Christ, the Lord, in such possession. 
Now, I ask you, what more could a 
faithful high priest receive than the 
promise of this blessing? Could he 
receive any more if he were an 
apostle ? Could he receive any more 
if he were a counselor in the Presi- 
dency of the Church? Could he re- 
ceive anything more if he were the 
President of the Church, than a 
promise which gives to him a joint 
heirship in all things ? No, he could 
not. And so it is with the faithful 
seventy, and so with the faithful 
elr'er in the Church. 

There is no need for envy. There 
is no need for overweening ambi- 
tion. There is no need to reach out 
and try to grasp that to which we 
are not entitled. The essential 
thing is that every man should see 
to it, that he obtains the High 
Priesthood. If he advances no 
further than the office of an elder 
but i.s faithful in the magnifying of 
his calling, he will enter into his 
glory and exaltation and will re- 
ceive the fulness of which the rec- 
ord speaks. 

And does this not show clearly, 
beautifully, that God indeed is no 
respecter of persons? And as we 
heard in the prayer that was offered 
this afternoon, God has made us 
eatial. Oh, I delight in this prin- 
ciple of enualitv in the Church, 
which is invariably determined by 
the principle of faithfulness, of 
worthiness. Nothing will be with- 



held from the man who is worthy 

and no blessing will be withheld 
from the woman who is faithful 
and true. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I call 
your attention to the fact — and I 
think it is in harmony with the text 
and with what I have said — that we 
have in the Church today a great 
army of priesthood: 11,835 high 
priests; 10,497 seventies; 30,017 
elders; 9,387 priests; 11,429 teach- 
ers; 23,623 deacons, making a total 
of 96,788 who bear the authority of 
the Holy Priesthood. 

Thus we see how this divine au- 
thority is distributed to the mem- 
bers of the Church. This responsi- 
bility reaches down to every faith- 
ful man. He is expected, he is re- 
quired to carry responsibility, and 
to exercise in some degree divine 
authority. It does not all rest upon 
the President of the Church, nor 
does it rest wholly upon the First 
Presidency. It does not rest alto- 
gether upon the twelve apostles, 
or the general authorities. It rests 
down upon the Church of Christ 
throughout all the stakes. Every- 
where you will meet this divine au- 
thority. I will tell you, brethren 
and sisters, wherever you do meet it 
in the stakes of Zion, or wards of 
Zion, or in the branches of the 
Church, it would be well for you to 
honor that authority, and not seek 
to override it, or go above it or be- 
yond it unnecessarily. Let every 
man respect the authority of those 
who preside over him, no matter 
where he is, because it is connected 
with this great and glorious priest- 
hood of which I have spoken. 

Let me remind you for a moment 
of the language of the revelation, 
which says that whoso succeeds in 
attaining to these two priesthoods 
and is faithful in magnifying his

calling, will receive the blessing. In 
order that the men of the priesthood 
might become worthy of it, and 
worthy of the blessing and the ex- 
altation that follow, it has pleased 
the Lord to inspire his servants of 
the First Presidency to appoint a 
committee to arrange courses of 
study for the priesthood. The com- 
mittee is composed of four members 
of the Council of the Twelve, three 
members of the First Council of 
Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric, 
two presidents of stakes, and five 
others. These brethren have been 
laboring in this line for about nine 
years. They have sought with due 
diligence, from time to time, to pre- 
pare manuals, or outlines, for the 
study of the priesthood, to be used 
by this great body of men, nearly 
one hundred thousand, that they 
might be more fully instructed in 
their duty, and in the glorious prin- 
ciples of the gospel. I feel that this 
is and has been a very great respon- 
sibility resting upon the committee. 

To give you some idea as to the 
manuals that have been prepared, I 
will just name a few : For the High 
Priesthood, manuals have been pre- 
pared on "Church Organization,'' 
"Divine Authority of the Book of 
Mormon," "History of the Gospel," 
"Duties and Principles from the 
Doctrine and Covenants," "Princi- 
ples of the Gospel," "Atonement," 
"Articles of Faith." "First and Sec- 
ond volumes of Church History," 
"Divine Imminence," "Gospel 
Themes," "Rational Theology," and 
"Jesus the Christ." And for the 
Leser Priesthood : "Restoration of 
the Gospel," "Church History," 
"Old Testament History," "Divine 
Mission of the Savior," "The Bool; 
of Mormon," "First Steps in 
Church Government," "The Apos- 
tolic Age," "The Latter-dav Proph- 



et," "What the Priest should Know 
and Do," "Experiences from the 
Lives of early Church Leaders and 
Members," and "Jesus the Christ." 

I submit to you, my brethren and 
sisters, whether or not these are im- 
portant subjects worthy of the at- 
tention and study of the priesthood. 
That is the purpose of it, and I 
point out to you that the oppor- 
tunity is open to every man in this 
Church to secure the benefit of these 
courses of study. He is invited by 
the authorities of the Church into 
these classes, urged to go into them 
and to study and master these sub- 
jects, thereby fitting and qualifying 
him, so far as possible, under the 
Spirit of the Lord, to magnify the 
priesthood. Yet out of this vast 
army of priesthood, while there are 
many faithful, active men, diligent 
and studious, there are also others 
who are careless and indifferent, 
and who neglect the opportunity 
that is before them ; but, mark you, 
biethren and sisters, any man who 
neglects his privileges and oppor- 
tunities, is the loser. He is not ad- 
vancing, he is not growing in faith 
and knowledge and good works as 
he should do. 

We urge the brethren of the 
priesthood to give this subject their 
careful, thoughtful and mast 
prayerful attention. We ask you, 
brethren and sisters, in the name of 
the authorities of the Church, who 
have sanctioned the movement, to 
take up this work and persuade 
those who are careless and indif- 
ferent to be a little more faithful 
and studious than heretofore. 

I bear testimony to you, in con- 
clusion, that this is the Church and 
kingdom of God. I know it is — I 
have always known it. I testify to 
you that our leaders, the Prophets 
— and it is a glorious galaxy of men

— six great leaders who have pre- 
sided over the Church up to this day 
— I testify to you that I do positive- 
ly know that they are true proph- 
ets of God, men of power, men of 
authority, men of counsel; and we 
would do well to give heed to their 
words and to follow their lead. 
There is safety in it. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a true prophet of 
God, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that he atoned for the sins of the 
world upon Mount Calvary. This 
is my testimony, and I bear it in 
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH. 

I am very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for this privilege of 
again raising my voice in the midst 
of the Latter-day Saints ; and I can 
testify that the Lord has blessed us 
during the last six months. He has 
blessed both the authorities and the 
members of the Church, and I for 
one feel to acknowledge his hand in 
the blessings that have come to us ; 
personally, for those that have come 
to me. I am very grateful to be 
here today, to hear the testimonies 
and the instructions that have been 
given in this conference, and I fully 
indorse them. My heart goes out 
in love and gratitude to our Presi- 
dent. My heart also goes out to 
him in prayer and in blessing, that 
he may live yet a goodly number of 
years with us, to bless us, and to 
teach us, and to guide us in the 
ways of the Lord. I know through 
my experience in the Church, and 
visiting among the people, that he 
has the prayers of the people, both 
young and old, and I join with them 
in praying for his life and mission, 
that he may live to lead and bless 



us yet a goodly number of years, 
and enjoy the blessings of God all 
his days. 

When President Penrose was 
speaking concerning the mothers 
having to part with their dear boys, 
who have gone into the army, or 
who are preparing to go, a little 
passage of modern scripture, in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, came to 
my mind, and if I may have the 
Spirit of the Lord, as it has dictated 
what has already been said in this 
conference, I should like to remind 
the good mothers of this passage 
for their comfort. It is found in 
the 101st section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, commencing at the 
77th verse. 

"According to the laws and con- 
stitution of the people which I have 
suffered to be established, and 
should be maintained for the rights 
and protection of all flesh, accord- 
ing to just and holy principles, 

"That every man may act in doc- 
trine and principles pertaining to 
futurity, according to the moral 
agency which I have given unto 
them, that every man may be ac- 
countable for his own sins in the 
day of judgment. 

"Therefore it is not right that 
any man should be in bondage one 
to another. 

"And for this purpose have I es- 
tablished the constitution of this 
land, by the hands of wise men 
whom I raised up unto this very 
purpose, and redeemed the land by 
the shedding of blood." 

Now, my object in reading this 
is by way of comfort to us as a peo- 
ple, and particularly to the fathers 
and mothers of the boys and men 
who may engage or who may go to 
prepare to engage in this great con- 
flict. T look upon it as being a mis- 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sion to every man who goes in hu- 
mility and in faith, trusting in the 
living God— the God who has es- 
tablished this land and this govern- 
ment; that it is our duty to work 
out the mission given us, that the 
time may come when no one shall 
be in bondage one to another, and 
that liberty and freedom shall come 
to all flesh. Now, I don't know, 
when this is going to come, nor how 
long it is going to take, but it ap- 
peals to me, that as a people, and es- 
pecially those who are called to en- 
gage in this conflict, who go out 
under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit, many of them bearing the 
holy Priesthood of which the breth- 
ren have spoken, servants of our 
Father in heaven, and our God, we 
have a most important mission to 
perform. God has given us this 
mission and commissioned us with 
divine authority to perform it. I 
say, many of our boys and men are 
going out with this authority, and 
it is my testimony, my brethren 
and .sisters, that if these men 
who go in this cause thus em- 
powered, that if they go in the spirit 
of faith and in the spirit of humil- 
ity, and will keep themselves in 
touch with the promptings of the 
Holy Spirit, which it is their right 
to enjoy, that they will be a force 
and a power for good in the earth, 
for the working out of the purposes 
of God, to hasten the time, if not 
to bring it about, when freedom 
and liberty shall come to all flesh, 
-when men shall not be in bondage 
one to another. It is my testimony 
that this is one of the purposes for 
which we as a people are called to 
engage in this great conflict. So I 
say to my brethren and sisters, es- 
pecially to the good mothers of 
these boys, let us continue to pray 



for them, to sustain them, that they 
may be pure and clean before the 
Lord, and magnify that priesthood 
which has been given them, that 
God may be enabled to work about 
his purposes and . to bring them to 
pass through his honored servants, 
those whom he has entrusted with 
his holy priesthood. I believe with 
all my heart that these men who 
are entrusted with this great power 
and authority in, the earth will have 
influence for good wherever they 
are called to go, whether it be in the 
training camps or whether it be in 
the very battles of the world. 
Among these boys and men are the 
choice sons of Israel ; many of them 
— I suppose the majority of them — 
are clean and pure and virtuous ; 
and they are the best of those 
among us, because the Government 
will not have those who are not the 
best. They must be physically pre- 
pared, perfect if possible, and so 
they are the very best of our young 
men who are entering this conflict, 
and we look to them for something 
to be done by way of bringing about 
the purposes of the Lord. We look 
to them to perform a great mission. 
Therefore let us pray for them, let 
us pray that the Lord will be with 
them and preserve them from the 
evils and wickedness, the sins, and 
the vices of the world, that they 
may return, if it be possible, clean 
and pure, to go on and magnify 
their priesthood and further bring 
about the purposes of the Lord. 

My prayers and blessings go 
with our boys. God bless them and 
bless their mothers and fathers, and 
bless us all, that we may each learn 
our part in life, fulfill our missions 
and live worthy lives before the 
Lord. I am quite sure that his 
blessings have attended us through- 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH.

out this land. In going through the 
country from time to time and 
from year to year I have never 
seen a more bounteous harvest, bet- 
ter grain, better fruit, or more of 
it. Let us return our gratitude to 
the Lord. We do not know how 
long these good things are going 
to last, but we hope that we will 
never lack nor suffer for the bless- 
ings of the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
rejoice in a testimony of the gospel. 
T know that we have the gospel of 
Jesus Christ and that it is the true 
plan of human redemption and ex- 
altation. I know that the Lord 
lives, and that he will hear and an- 
swer our prayers, that he will com- 
fort and sustain us in performing 
our duties, as long as we are hum- 
ble and prayerful and will keep 
ourselves in harmony with his 
work, and as President Penrose has 
said, "Follow our leader." 

Among the thousands of men 
who hold the priesthood about 
which Brother Clawson has been 
speaking, are about 200 men who 
hold the office of Patriarch, and I 
commend the service of these 
brethren to the Latter-day Saints. 

I am very gratified to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that there 
seems to be, during the last year, 
a greater desire on the part of the 
men or brethren to receive their 
blessings. Before the war the 
great majority of those who were 
seeking their blessings from the 
Lord, at the hands of the patri- 
archs, were the sisters of the 



Church; but during the last few 
months the men have been called to 
humble themselves and to think 
more seriously concerning the fu- 
ture and they too are seeking their 
blessings at the hands of the priest- 
hood. I think there is a provi- 
dence in this, and I trust that the 
brethren as well as the sisters will 
continue to seek and obtain their 
blessings at the hands of the pa- 
triarchs of the Church, and honor 
the Priesthood in so doing, and 
they will receive their blessings 
from the Lord at the hands of his 
servants. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
bless you all. My heart goes out in 
blessing to all Israel, to the faithful 
of the house of Israel wherever 
they are found, at home or abroad, 
and I pray that God will be with 
them all according to their right- 
eous needs, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Elder Hyrum M. Smith gave out 
notice of a public meeting in the 
Tabernacle this evening at 8:15 
o'clock, at which Hon. Franklin K. 
Lane, Secretary of the Interior, 
would speak and be the guest of 
honor, in behalf of the National 
Council of Defense. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Praise to the man who 
communed with Jehovah." 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday morning at 10 o'clock. 

Prayer was offered by President 
Joseph R. Shepherd, of the Bear 
Lake stake. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, Oc- 
tober 6, 1917, 10 a. m. 

The assembly was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"O ye mountains high." 

The opening prayer was offered 
by President James Wotherspoon, 
of the North Weber stake of Zion. 

The hymn, "Guide us, O thou 
great Jehovah," was sung by the 
choir and congregation. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Wisdom consists not only in know- 
ing, but also in doing— Where re- 
pentance is truly made former sins 
and wickedness are blotted out — 
Our prayer should be for under- 
standing hearts and wisdom to obey 
— Ancient and modern Israel alike 
in some respects — The exodus of 
each compared — Obedience to the 
servants of God and a study of the 
Holy Scriptures make for wisdom 
— Men of authority are among us 
who teach us to be wise unto eternal 
life — May we have understanding 
hearts to heed their counsel and so 
prove wise. 

I shall read a passage from the 
scriptures : 

"Praise ye the Lord. I will praise 
the Lord with my whole heart, in the 
assembly of the upright and in the 
congregation. 

"The words of the Lord are great, 
sought out of all them that have 
pleasure therein. 

"His work is honorable and glo- 
rious; and his righteousness endureth 
forever. 

"He hath made his wonderful 



works to be remembered; the Lord 
is gracious and full of compassion. 

"He hath given meat unto them 
that fear him; he will ever be mindful 
of his covenant. 

"He hath showed his people the 
power of his works, that he may give 
them the heritage of the heathen. 

"The works of his hands are verity 
and judgment; all his commandments 
are sure. 

"They stand fast forever and ever, 
and are done in truth and upright- 
ness. 

"He sent redemption unto his peo- 
ple; he hath commanded his cove- 
nant forever; holy and reverend is his 
name. 

"The fear of the Lord is the be- 
ginning of wisdom; a good under- 
standing have all they that do his 
commandments; his praise endureth 
forever." 

The Latter-day Saints are high- 
ly favored in that once more they 
have had an opportunity to hear his 
voice as uttered by the mouths of 
his anointed servants. We have lis- 
tened to the testimony of the Presi- 
dent of the Church, and from his 
lips have again received admoni- 
tion and have heard the gospel prin- 
ciples proclaimed. We have heard 
the testimony concerning the di- 
vinity of the great redeeming mis- 
sion of the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
of the divine appointment and call- 
ing of Joseph Smith the prophet, 
and of President Young, and the 
successors in the presidency of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
ray Saints. These testimonies and 
doctrines were declared unto us in 
power and in the demonstration of 
the Holy Spirit. There was not

lurking therein even a shadow of 
doubt or darkness, but they came 
to us with all the brilliance of a 
fire struck from the very chief cor- 
ner-stone of the foundation upon 
which this great latter-day work is 
built. 

Now, "the fear of the Lord is the 
beginning of wisdom, a good under- 
standing have all they that do his 
commandments." The Latter-day 
Saints were declared yesterday to 
be an intelligent people. They are 
an intelligent people. They ought 
to be as wise as they are intelligent, 
but I fear that in wisdom we some- 
times fall short. A wise people are 
a people who will do what they 
know to be right. The Lord has de- 
clared to us that which is right, he 
has given us intelligence to under- 
stand the difference between right 
and wrong, to distinguish between 
good and evil, between the true and 
the false, so that there can be no 
excuse really for the Latter-day 
Saints being unwise. But if the 
Lord has given us intelligence to 
understand the truth, and to know 
all his commandments and we do 
not keep his commandments, then 
we are not wise. There are many 
intelligent people in the world 
who are exceedingly foolish. 
There are many people who are 
termed educated, who are lack- 
ing in wisdom, and there are 
countless multitudes of men and 
women in our country, and in 
other Christian countries, who 
know to do right, and yet who 
do not do it, and consequently 
to them it is sin. The Lord has de- 
clared, through the prophet Ezek- 
iel, something to this effect, that 
the righteousness of the righteous 
will be forgotten if the righteous 
turn into wickedness, and the wick- 
edness of the wicked will be no 



more remembered jf the wicked 
turn from their wickedness unto 
righteousness. 

That great man Solomon offered 
a prayer unto the Lord which was 
eminently wise, and it was an- 
swered upon his head with a very 
great blessing. I should like to read 
a few words of it : 

"In Gideon the Lord appeared to 
Solomon in a dream by night; and 
God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 

"And Solomon said, Thou hast 
showed unto thy servant David, my 
father, great mercy, according as he 
walked before thee in truth, and in 
righteousness, and in uprightness of 
heart with thee; and thou hast kept 
for him this great kindness, that thou 
hast given him a son to sit on his 
throne, as it is this day. 

"And now, O Lord my God, thou 
hast made thy servant king instead of 
David my father; and I am but a little 
child; I know not how to go out or 
come in. 

"And thy servant is in the midst of 
thy people which thou hast chosen, a 
great people, that cannot be numbered 
nor. counted for multitude. 

"Give therefore thy servant an un- 
derstanding heart to judge thy people, 
that I may discern between good and 
bad; for who is able to judge this thy 
so great a people? 

"And the speech pleased the Lord, 
that Solomon had asked this thing. 

"And God said unto him, Because 
thou hast asked this thing, and hast 
not asked for thyself long life; neither 
hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast 
asked the life of thine enemies; but 
hast asked for thyself understanding 
to discern judgment; 

"Behold, I have done according to 
thy words; lo, I have given thee a 
wise and an understanding heart; so 
that there was none like thee before 
thee, neither after thee shall any arise 
like unto thee. 

"And I have also given thee that 
which thou hast not asked, both riches 
and honor; so that there shall not be 
any among the kings like unto thee 
all thy days." 

That should be the prayer that all 
Latter-day Saints should frequently 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



offer unto the Lord, that the Lord 
should give unto them understand- 
ing hearts, that they might under- 
stand the truth, and that they might 
have the wisdom to obey the truth. 

Hear another passage of scrip- 
ture. It contains the words of him 
who stood at the head of Israel in 
olden times, who was the mouth- 
piece of God, who led Israel out of 
their bondage in Egypt through the 
wilderness, and to the borders of 
the promised land. This passage, 
recorded in the Old Testament, was 
given to the people of Israel by the 
mouth of Moses the prophet. He 
was not permitted to enter into the 
Promised Land, but gave unto his 
people this admonition. The history 
of former-day Israel and latter-day 
Israel is similar at many points, and 
very dissimilar at others. The 
former-day Israel were not driven 
out of Egypt. It was the determina- 
tion of the king of Egypt to retain 
the children of Israel, that they 
might be his servants and his slaves, 
and it was with great pleading and 
repeated pouring out of plagues 
upon Egypt that the Lord induced 
the king to let them depart. Israel, 
too, left reluctantly, and during 
their journey towards the promised 
land frequently complained and 
longed to return to the flesh pots of 
Egypt. 

The Latter-day Saints were not 
thus favored by the people of our 
own country. We were not wanted 
among them. The Latter-day Saints 
were despised and hated, and were 
finally driven out from so-called civ- 
ilization — driven out into the wil- 
derness, in the hope that there they 
might perish. The Lord evidently 
knew that it would be difficult to 
persuade his people, even in the 
midst of their persecutions, to come 
out into a desert, to an unknown 



world. Therefore he permitted 
them to be driven forth, that he 
might make of them what he has 
made of them, and determined to 
make of them, a mighty people in 
this greatest Nation in the world; 
and these words that Moses spoke 
to ancient Israel may be read to 
modern Israel. They are just as 
true and just as applicable, if we 
will heed the admonitions today, 
and in fact, similar admonitions 
and cousels are frequently given 
to the Latter-day Saints in our day. 
Moses said : 

"Now therefore hearken, O Israel, 
unto the statutes and unto the judg- 
ments, which I teach you, for to do 
them, that ye may live, and go in and 
possess the land which the Lord God 
of your fathers giveth you. 

"Ye shall not add unto the word 
which I command you, neither shall 
ye diminish aught from it, that ye may 
keep the commandments of the Lord 
your God which I command you. 

"Your eyes have seen what the Lo,rd 
did because of Baal-peor; for all the 
men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord 
thy God hath destroyed them from 
among you. 

"But ye that did cleave unto the 
Lord your God are alive every one of 
you this day. 

"Behold, I have taught you statutes 
and judgments, even as the Lord my 
God commanded me, that ye should 
do so in the land whither ye go to 
possess it. 

"Keep therefore and do them : for 
this is your wisdom and your under- 
standing in the sight of the nations, 
which shall hear all these statutes, 
and say, Surely this great nation is a 
wise and understanding people. 

"For what nation is there so great, 
who hath God so nigh unto them, as 
the Lord our God is in all things that 
we call upon him for? 

"And what nation is there so great, 
that hath statutes and judgments so 
righteous as all this law, which I set 
before you this day? 

"Only take heed to thyself, and keep 
thy soul diligently, lest thou forget 
the things which thine eyes have seen, 
and lest they depart from thy heart

all the days of thy life; but teach them 
thy sons, and thy sons' sons." 

The Latter-day Saints, if they 
will look over the history of the 
Church, mav ask themselves the 
question : What has become of all 
those who remained behind, who 
refused to follow God and his ser- 
vants out into the wilderness? The 
answer will be : They are dead and 
gone, lost ; lost to the faith, lost to 
the love of the truth, and their chil- 
dren and their children's children 
are today grown up in ignorance, 
lacking in wisdom, having no un- 
derstanding' concerning the work of 
the Lord which he established 
through the Prophet Toseph. All 
those who followed the Lord and 
his servants to these valleys, and 
their children who have remained 
faithful are alive this day, and vou 
,see the Saints grown into a mighty 
people ; and those who were faith- 
ful and have gone bevond the veil, 
those mentioned by President Smith 
yesterday, and many others, verily 
thev are indeed alive, forevermore, 
and their children and their chil- 
dren's children are still in our midst. 
Those who have been faithful, those 
who are wise, those who sought for 
and received from God understand- 
ing hearts, are here today to reioice 
in the gospel and in the testimony 
thereof, and thev are willing to re- 
ceive and be led by the word of 
the Lord. 

Brothers and sisters, on this stand 
are men the Lord has called and 
anointed. We, I said in the be<rin- 
ninsr, were privileged to hear the 
voice of the Lord. The Lord has 
declared in latter-dav revelation, 
when his servant sneaks under the 
power and inspiration of the Ho1v 
Ghost, his words then become the 
words of the Lord, they are the 



voice of the Lord, and the mind of 
the Lord, and the will of the Lord, 
and as such we receive the words 
that are given to us by those whom 
the Lord has called to preside over 
us and to speak in his name. 

The very burden of the message 
delivered to the Latter-day Saints 
vesterday by the President of the 
Church was obedience to the prin- 
ciples and the commandments of 
God; that we should be wise and 
have understanding- hearts, and hav- 
ing understanding, demonstrate our 
wisdom in our obedience, that the 
whole world may see this people 
and recognize that there is no other 
oeople in the world to whom the 
Lord is so near, and that no other 
nation so great as that of which the 
Latter-day Saints form a part. The 
government of the United States is 
a nation established and founded by 
the Lord. Wise men were raised 
up by the Lord and inspired to lay 
the foundations of this government, 
and to give to the people correct 
doctrines and high and noble prin- 
ciples, the principles of liberty and 
peace. And this nation, if they will 
hearken unto those wise men and 
uphold the constitution established 
bv them, and obey the laws that 
have been and that shall be enacted 
in accord with the constitution by 
those who are called to enact laws 
for our government, we will be a 
wise people, we will be a people with 
understanding hearts, and all other 
nations will be compelled to sav that 
God is here, he is with these people 
and with this nation, to bless them 
and to make of them the saviors of 
mankind. 

President Lund vesterdav called 
attention to the work that is being 
done by the historians of the 
Church. I gathered this great les- 
son from his remarks, that as the 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



result of the Lord's wisdom and 
the people's obedience, we have in 
the Church a record, a history of 
the Church in latter-days as well as 
former days, and that out of these 
books, the history of the Church, 
the holy scriptures, ancient and 
modern, may be found the way of 
life eternal, and they are better than 
all other books ; and that we .should 
seek out of these books words of 
wisdom and understanding. Why, 
there is more to be learned in five 
minutes reading in the Holy Scrip- 
tures, more that is worthy of reten- 
tion in the memory, more that will 
be helpful if we remember and obey 
them, than we can find in reading 
all of the six best sellers in every 
month in the year. Here is the word 
of God, herein is the word of life, 
herein is the word of wisdom, here- 
in we may get understanding, and 
learn to discern good and evil, and 
gather the courage and the faith to 
do that which is right, and to reject 
that which is evil. 

But in addition to the Holy Scrip- 
tures and sacred and inspired rec- 
ords, and even of greater import- 
ance to the Latter-dav Saints, is the 
fact that the anointed living oracles 
of God are in our presence, as so 
forceably set forth by President 
Penrose yesterday. Through them 
the Lord speaks, counsels and com- 
mands this people daily. If we re- 
ceive and obey their instructions we 
will prove that we are wise and of 
good understanding. 

Now, I should like to conclude 
my remarks, my brethren and sis- 
ters, with another passage of scrip- 
ture, a passage of scripture that was 
given during the ministry of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. They are his 
words. He was the wisest of all. 
even wiser than Solomon, because 
he retained his wisdom and his un- 



derstanding even to the end, and 
did not depart in any measure or 
degree from righteousness, and I 
should like, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to impress this passage upon 
your mind.s. It is a familiar one, 
all are acquainted with it, but in 
the words of a great poet, I fear 
that it is a passage more "honored 
in the breach than the observance :" 

"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall 
know them. 

"Not every one that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the king- 
dom of heaven; but he that doeth the 
will of my Father which is in heaven. 

"Many will say to me in that day, 
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
in thy name? And in thy .name have 
cast out devils? and in thy name done 
many wonderful works? 

"And then will I profess unto them, 
I never knew you; depart from me, 
ye that work iniquity. 

"Therefore whosoever heareth these 
sayings of mine, and doeth them, I 
will liken him unto a wise man, which 
built his house upon a rock: 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell not, 
for it was founded upon a rock. 

"And every one that heareth these 
sayings of mine, and doeth them not. 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
which built his house upon the sand: 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house, and it fell : and 
great was the fall of it. 

"And it came to pass, when Jesus 
had ended these sayings, the people 
were astonished at his doctrine: 

"For he taught them as one having 
authority, and not as the scribes." 

I testify that here in this confer- 
ence yesterday, the Latter-day 
Saints heard men who spoke not as 
scribes and Pharisees, but as men 
having authority from the living 
God to preach the gospel, and to 
bear witness of the ministry and 
mission and redeeming power of 
his Only Begotten Son. I bear wit- 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

ness that if the Latter-day Saints 
will heed their admonitions and will 
do the Lord's statutes and judg- 
ments, and will keep his command- 
ments, that they will be wise even 
unto life eternal, they will have un- 
derstanding hearts, hearts to see 
and perceive and to know the truth, 
and by prayer and patience and hu- 
mility before God they will be given 
the power to do that which is right 
in the sight of the Lord, and to be 
worthy of salvation in the kingdom 
•of God. 

My brethren and sisters, no man 
can find forgiveness for one sin be- 
cause he is righteous in some other 
direction. In other words, the pay- 
ment of tithing will never com- 
pensate for the desecration of the 
Sabbath day. The faithful keeping 
of the Sabbath day will never make 
amends for the breaking of the 
Word of Wisdom. The refraining 
from murder, and adultery, will 
not satisfy the law which forbids 
bearing false witness against neigh- 
bors, or coveting their possessions. 
And the doing of good to men will 
never blot out the sin of blasphem- 
ing the name of the living God. We 
must keep the commandments, all 
of them, every one of them, every 
day of our lives, and then we will 
prove ourselves wise and of under- 
standing hearts. 

May the Lord give this people 
wisdom in addition to their intelli- 
gence ; may we have understanding, 
and may we keep the command- 
ments of the Lord as we know we 
ought to keep them, and never 
prove recreant. God bless his ser- 
vants, the Presidency, and those 
who are called to preside in Israel, 
the general authorities, the stake 
authorities, the ward authorities, 
those who preside over the auxiliary 
organizations, over the branches of 



the Church, and over the mission 
fields. God bless Israel, and God 
bless this country upon which he 
has gathered Israel. God bless those 
who stand at the head of the gov- 
ernment, and make them, even the 
President and his Cabinet and the 
Congress and the Supreme Court, 
wise like unto those wise men 
whom the Lord raised up in the 
beginning of our national govern- 
ment, to lay its foundations, that 
these men may adhere to that fun- 
damental law and enact only wise 
and righteous laws for the progress 
and advancement of this great land 
of Zion ; and may the children of 
Israel be indeed Zion, the pure in 
heart, to teach all the world how 
to come to the Lord, how to learn 
wisdom, how to have and retain 
understanding hearts, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

My mind has been illumined dur-

has been made to rejoice by the ex-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cellent instruction to which we have 
listened. The splendid attendance 
of the members of the Church at 
this general conference has inspired 
in me an appreciation of the oppor- 
tunity given to meet our brethren 
and sisters on such occasions. 

This morning I met a brother on 
the street who introduced himself 
to me. I recognized his face, but I 
could not call his name, and I did 
not know whence he came, until he 
informed me that I had met him 
at Wilmington, North Carolina, and 
he had come all the way with his 
wife and children, that he might be 
with the Saints in this worshiping 
assembly. While sitting here pon- 
dering over the effect that that 
might have upon him and his fam- 
ilv, I asked myself the question : 
Have I been careful to take ad- 
vantage of my opportunity and 
bring my wife and children into this 
splendid gathering, to enjoy the 
teachings of the servants of God? 
And the answer came back to me in 
this way : If I have not, I have lost 
for them a blessing, and likewise 
for myself, but the man who crossed 
the continent, came all the way 
from the Atlantic seaboard, paying 
his expenses and taking that long- 
ride, will certainlv be rewarded by 
the Lord, by an increase of 'faith, 
and so will his family. In this, as 
in all other cases, the blessings of 
God are predicated upon obedience 
to his requirements, and in this par- 
ticular our brother and his familv 
are fulfilling the requirement which 
entitles them to the blessings they 
will enjov at this conference. 

I am looking in the faces of 
presidents of .stakes, bishops of 
wards : and other faithful Latter- 
day Saints. Manly of you have 
made a sacrifice financially in order 
that you may be here, but really it 



is no sacrifice ; it is an investment 
in the blessings of our heavenly 
Father, "That will return to you 
good measure, pressed down, 
shaken together, and running over." 
I feel to suggest now and here that 
each of us enjoying these favors be 
not unmindful of our loved ones, 
not forgetful of our neighbors ; and 
at the time of stake conferences let 
us go about encouraging them, that 
they may desire to be present in 
those assemblies of the Saints. 

Yesterday I saw a number of peo- 
ple here with their children, and I 
felt from the depths of my soul to 
commend them, and I know the 
Lord will bless them and will bless 
their children, even though they be 
but young, because they are here in 
the service of the Lord, in the place 
appointed by him through his ser- 
vants. 

Brother Hyrum has been talking 
to us and reading this morning 
from the Bible, and it brings to my 
mind this particular scripture : 

"Search the scriptures, for in them 
ye think ye have eternal life, and they 
are they which testify of me." 

Another scripture came to mv 
mind along the same line, and it 
was to this effect, "that the Lord 
will do nothing but he revealeth his 
secrets to his servants, the proph- 
ets." From the time of Father 
Adam until the present the Lord has 
admonished the people through his 
servants. He has inspired them to 
better living when they have lis- 
tened to him, and from age to age, 
as his children have reauired it, he 
has sent holv men into the world, to 
impart instruction tending to hap- 
piness, has inspired them to teach 
the glorious truths that ennoble and 
enrich mankind, and few people

have been left with an excuse, but 
all have been left without excuse 
that have received the scriptures. 

In the days of Noah, when he 
went about warning the people, 1 
presume there were many who ig- 
nored his teachings, who disregard- 
ed him as a servant of God, but he 
was sent by the Father, and the in- 
structions that he gave the people 
were binding upon them ; and our 
Father in heaven, in his own due 
time, fulfilled the promises of his 
prophet. All who were saved from 
the flood were those who listened 
to Noah. On the plains of Mamre, 
when Abraham petitioned his Holy 
Visitor to spare Sodom and Go- 
morrah, he was told that even if ten 
righteous persons be found, a very 
small number, too, of the multi- 
tude, that the cities would be pre- 
served. But only Lot and his wife 
and two daughters were sufficiently 
righteous to merit preservation. 
The angels told them to leave the 
city, and fire rained down from 
heaven and consumed the people, 
who had been warned repeatedly by 
the servant of God that destruction 
would overtake them if they failed 
to repent. The Old Testament re- 
fers to the coming of the Redeemer 
of the world. Why did the world 
not know the Savior when he came ? 
It was because they had departed 
from the teachings of holy men. It 
was because they had chosen for 
themselves "teachers having itching 
ears, who preached for hire and 
who divined for money," who did 
not teach the people what the Lord 
desired, so they were led astray. 
The Savior himself taught the chil- 
dren of men what was necessary for 
them to do to obtain eternal life in 
the celestial kingdom of our Father, 
and the people rejected him, but his 
testimony is in force, and the time 



will come when those who rejected 
him and consented to his crucifixion 
will meet him and will answer for 
their crime. The Old and New 
Testaments contain the teachings of 
our heavenly Father. I admonish 
you, O Israel, search the scriptures ; 
read them in your homes ; teach 
your families what the Lord has 
said, and let us spend less of our 
time reading the unimportant and 
often harmful liteiature of the day, 
and go to the fountain of truth and 
read the word of the Lord. 

The Book of Mormon contains 
another evidence of the importance 
that our heavenly Father attaches 
to reading the scriptures. He sent 
the sons of Lehi back to Jerusalem 
to recover the Old Testament scrip- 
ture, in order that they might re- 
tain the teachings of the prophets. 
The Lord would not take them into 
a new country, without preserving 
to them the privilege of reading his 
teachings to their forefathers. 

The importance of having the ad- 
vice of the prophets of God is em- 
phasized in our day, in the bringing 
forth of the Book of Mormon. The 
plates from which it was translated 
were buried in the earth by a Ne- 
phite prophet. Centuries later the 
Lord directed Joseph Smith to se- 
cure and translate that record, in 
order that we might have the teach- 
ings of our Father to his children 
who dwelt upon this western land. 
We have the Old and the New Tes- 
taments, the Book of Mormon, and 
the Pearl of Great Price, also trans- 
lated by the gift and power of God, 
in addition new revelations through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

While only a youth the Lord ap- 
peared to him and later he was vis- 
ited by an angel who instructed him 
to prepare for his mission. That 
he might be a witness of the living 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God the Lord gave to him by reve- 
lation the contents of this record 
that I hold in my hand, (the Doc- 
trine and Covenants) containing 
over four hundred pages of instruc- 
tion to the children of men. How 
many of the Latter-day Saints have 
read the glorious revelations con- 
tained in this record? If we have 
not, we have lost an opportunity ; 
we have missed a blessing. Let me 
read what the Lord says with refer- 
ence to these latter days in the first 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants : 

•'Hearken, O ye people of my 
church, saith the voice of him who 
dwells on high, and whose eyes are 
upon all men; yea, verily I say, heark- 
en ye people from 'afar, and ye that 
are upon the islands of the sea, listen 
together. 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is 
unto all men, and there is none to es- 
cape, and there is no eye that shall 
not see, neither ear. that shall not hear, 
neither heart that shall not be pene- 
' trated. 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced 
with much sorrow, for their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the housetops, 
and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these 
last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none 
shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 

"Behold, this is mine authority, and 
the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my com- 
mandments, which I have given them 
to publish unto you, O inhabitans of 
the earth. 

"Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye 
people, for what I the Lord have de- 
creed in them shall be fulfilled. 

"And verily, I say unto you, that 
they who go forth, bearing these tid- 
ings unto the inhabitants of the earth, 
to them is power given to seal both 
on earth and in heaven, the unbeliev- 
ing and rebellious; 

"Yea, verily, to seal hem up unto 
the day when the wrath of God shall 



")e poured out upon the wicked with 
out measure; 

"Unto the day when the Lord shall 
come to recompense unto every man 
according to his work, and measure to 
every man according to the measure 
which he has measured to his fellow 
man. 

"Wherefore the voice of the Lord is 
unto the ends of the earth, that all 
that will hear may hear: 

"Prepare ye, prepare ye for that 
which is to come, for the Lord is nigh; 

"And the anger of the Lord is kin- 
dled, and his sword is bathed in heav- 
en, and it shall fall upon the inhabi- 
tans of the earth; 

"And the arm ,of the Lord shall be re- 
vealed; and the day cometh that they 
who will not hear the voice of the 
Lord, neither the voice of his servants, 
neither give heed to the words of the 
prophets and apostles, shall be cut off 
from among the people; 

"For they have strayed from mine 
ordinances, and have broken mine 
everlasting covenant; 

"They seek not the Lord to estab- 
lish his righteousness, but every man 
walketh in his own way, and after the 
image of his own God, whose image 
is in the likeness of the world, and 
whose substance is that of an idol, 
which waxeth old and shall perish in 
Babylon, even Babylon the great, 
which shall fall. 

"Wherefore I the Lord, knowing the 
calamity which should come upon the 
inhabitants of the earth, called upon 
my servant Joseph Smith, jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave 
him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to 
others, that they should proclaim these 
things unto the world; and all this 
that it might be fulfilled, which was 
written by the prophets; 

"The weak thigns of the world shall 
come forth and break down the 
mighty and strong ones, that man 
should not counsel his fellow man, 
neither trust in the arm of flesh. 

"But that every man might speak in 
the name of God the Lord, even the 
Savior of the world; 

"That faith also might increase in 
the earth; 

"That mine everlasting covenant 
might be established; 

"That the fullness of my gospel 
might be proclaimed by the weak and

the simple unto the ends of the world, 
and before kings and rulers. 

"Behold, I am God and have spoken 
it: these commandments are of me, 
and were given unto my servants in 
their weakness, after the manner of 
their language, that they might come 
to understanding, 

"And inasmuch as they erred it 
might be made known: 

"And inasmuch as they sought wis- 
dom they might be instructed: 

"And inasmuch as they sinned they 
might be chastened, that they might 
repent: 

"And inasmuch as they were hum- 
ble they might be made strong, and 
blessed from on high, and receive 
knowledge from time to time: 

"And after having received the rec- 
ord of the Nephites, yea, even my 
servant Joseph Smith, jun., might have 
power to translate through the mercy 
of God, by the power of God, the 
Book of Mormon; 

"And also those to whom these 
commandments were given, might 
have power to lay the foundation of 
this church, and to bring it forth out 
of obscurity and out of darkness, the 
only true and living church upon the 
face of the whole earth, with which I, 
the Lord, am well pleased, speaking 
unto the church collectively and not 
individually. 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon 
sin with the least degree of allowance; 

"Nevertheless, he that repents and 
does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

"And he that repents not, from him 
shall be taken even the light which he 
has received, for my Spirit shall not 
always strive with man, saith the Lord 
of Hosts. 

"And again, verily I say unto yo,u, O 
inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord 
am willing to make these thing known 
unto all flesh, 

"For I am no respecter of persons, 
and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh; the hour is 
not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 
peace shall be taken from the earth, 
and the devil shall have power over 
his own dominion; 

"And also the Lord shall have power 
over his saints, and shall reign in their 
midst, and shall come down in judg- 
ment upon Idumea, or the world. 

"Search these commandments for 



they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in 
them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I 
have spoken, and I excuse not myself: 
and though the heavens and the earth 
pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether 
by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same; 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is 
God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth 
abideth forever and ever. Amen." 

This preface is worthy your earn- 
est consideration. It is the admoni- 
tion of the Father of us all. It is 
the loving advice of a tender parent 
who knows what we require, as he 
said in the chapter just read that 
knowing what was about to come 
upon the inhabitants of the earth 
he gave these commandments. The 
Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine 
and Covenants, and Pearl of Great 
Price, do not contain the wisdom 
of men alone, but of God. While 
they do not find their way into the 
homes of many people, they contain 
the word of the Lord. What mat- 
tereth it though we understand 
Homer and Shakespeare and Mil- 
ton, and I might enumerate all the 
great writers of the world ; if we 
have failed to read the scriptures 
we have missed the better part of 
this world's literature. 

My brethren and sisters, all the 
truth that is advocated in all the 
teachings of men, necessary for our 
salvation, is contained within the 
lids of the books that I have already 
enumerated. We may not possess 
a library of two or three thousand 
volumes, but we may possess at 
small cost a priceless library that 
has cost the best blood that has ever 
been in this world. Will our Father 
hold us guiltless when we go home, 
if we have failed to teach our chil- 
dren the importance of these sacred 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



records? I think not. He called 
his sons one by one, and they gave 
their lives that we might have the 
Old Testament. He sent his only 
begotten Son into the world, and 
his life was sacrificed in order that 
we might have the teachings of the 
New Testament. The prophets of 
God recorded in the Book of Mor- 
mon laid down their lives and seal- 
ed their testimonies with their 
blood, in order that the children of 
men might know what the Father 
desired of them. He sent the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and he gave 
his life, together with his brother 
Hyrum, in order that we might 
have the truths contained in the sa- 
cred record known as the Doctrine 
and Covenants. Do you suppose 
that after the Lord has done all this 
for us, has given to this world the 
choicest and sweetest of men and 
women, whose lives have been dedi- 
cated to the blessing of mankind, 
many of them sealing their testi- 
mony with their blood, has place ! 
within our reach the excellent teach- 
ings contained in these holy rec- 
ords, that he will consider us appre- 
ciative if we fail to teach them to 
our families, and to impress them 
upon those with whom we come in 
contact ? 

Brethren and sisters, I desire to 
emphasize again the teaching of the 
Master ; "search the scriptures ;" 
read them prayerfully and faith- 
fully, teach them in your homes ; 
call your families around you and 
inspire in them a faith in the living 
God, by reading those things that 
have been revealed. They are the 
most precious of all the libraries in 
all the world. 

And now I would like to empha- 
size this fact, that in the Doctrine 
and Covenants we find the Lord's 
warning of the present condition of 



this world. We find there that the 
Saints were to inhabit this western 
land, and if they kept his command- 
ments, this should be Zion unto 
them. I will read a few paragraphs 
from the Doctrine and Covenants to 
emphasize our responsibility, be- 
cause sometimes we seem to think 
that because we are blessed of the 
Lord above all other people, we can 
do the things that we are tempted to 
do, even if they are not just right: 

"Therefore, verily, thus saith the 
Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion 
■ — the pure in heart; therefore, let Zion 
rejoice, while all the wicked shall 
mourn; 

"For behold, and lo, vengeance Com- 
eth speedily upon the ungodly as the 
whirlwind, and who shall escape it; 

"The Lord's scourge shall pass over 
by night and by day, and the report 
thereof shall vex all people; yet it 
shall not be stayed until the Lord 
comes." 

Now, if there is is any doubt in 
the minds of the people of this 
Church as to when peace shall come 
into the world again, I want to em- 
phasize by reading again the word 
of the Lord wherein he says : 

"The Lord's scourge shall pass over 
by might and by day, and the report 
thereof shall vex all people; yet it 
shall not be stayed until the Lord 
come. 

"For the indignation of he Lord is 
kindled against their abominations 
and all their wicked works; 

"Nevertheless Zion shall escape — " 

I have thought many times, Oh, 
what a comfortable thing it would 
be for us if that had been the end 
of that paragraph, but it is not. It 
reads in full as follows : 

"Nevertheless Zion shall escape, if 
she observe to do all things whatso- 
ever I have commanded her. 

"But if she observe not to do what- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 45 



ever I have commanded her, I will 
visit her according to all her works, 
with sore affliction, with pestilence, 
with plague, with sword, with ven- 
geance, with devouring fire." 

So we are in the same condition 
as our brethren and sisters in the 
world. In fact, I think we are 
worse off, because we have greater 
light, and the Lord will require 
more at our hands. 

So there is need for us to search 
the scriptures. There is need for 
us to put ourselves in tune with 
the Spirit of our Father. There is 
need for us to have thanksgiving 
in our hearts that we are led by- 
holy men who are inspired by our 
Father in heaven to teach us day 
by day, and oh, how grateful we 
ought to be for these great con- 
ferences that bring us together 
from the ends of the earth, and 
unite us as brethren and sisters 
with a determination that, "As for 
me and my house, we will serve the 
Lord." We believe in being sub- 
ject to kings, presidents, rulers and 
magistrates, in obeying, honoring 
and sustaining the law. So today 
in the midst of the difficulties that 
exist in the world, while there are 
transgressors of the laws of the 
land, and there are transgressors 
of the laws of God, in the midst of 
the conflict in which we are now 
engaged, this awful world war, it 
is a great joy and satisfaction to 
my soul that while there are those 
persons who are opposing this gov- 
ernment, set up by the power of 
God, there are no members of this 
Church in good standing but are 
sustaining the law arid order 
and the government of the United 
States, so far as it lies in their 
power. There is one Church upon 
the continent of America that has 
been taught by God that this gov- 



ernment has been raised up for the 
blessing of mankind. There is one 
Church whose members cannot re- 
main in good fellowship in it if 
they criticize and find fault and 
tear down and oppose the legal ac- 
tion of the constituted authorities 
of the land, with reference to going 
into this war; and why? Because 
we have been trained by the gospel 
in a knowledge of the purpose of 
this government. We have been 
taught by inspired men, who have 
pointed the way, and all Israel, to 
a man, comes forward in the crucial 
hour and says: "If I am needed, 
Lord, here am I." If my country 
requires it, my all is on the altar, 
and my life if need be. God help 
us to be worthy of our heritage, 
help us to sustain the government 
that has been so good to us, that 
has made it possible for the estab- 
lishment of this work. Let us sus- 
tain good men and great men every- 
where, and pray for them as we 
are told to do in this same record. 
Prav for the chief executive of the 
Nation and his associates, asking 
God to inspire them to labor for the 
good of humanity and the liberty 
of mankind. Let us so live, that, 
by and by, when our work is done, 
it will be truthfully said of us that 
this world is better for our having 
lived in it. May the Lord bestow 
his blessings upon you, my brethren 
and sisters, and upon all Israel, 
wherever they may be, and may the 
spirit of peace and the desire to do 
good in the world find lodgement in 
the hearts of the children of men. 
that repentance may come, that 
thev may turn from the wickedness 
that has been in the world, and in 
that way bring about the Millenium 
an'' the return to this earth of 
oeace, that our Father has said has 
been taken from it. God grant it,

is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS. 

I am very much surprised to be 
called upon to speak before this 
great congregation of Latter-day 
Saints, and desire that while I do 
stand before you I may have the in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, that 
what I shall say may be dictated 
by it. I rejoice with all my soul 
in the testimonies heard during this 
conference, respecting the ministry 
of the .servants of God, who have 
been raised up to establish his work 
on the earth in this Dispensation of 
the Fulness of Times. 

I have listened with interest to 
the testimonies concerning the in- 
spiration and power of the Holy 
Ghost that characterized the minis- 
try of Joseph Smith, the Prophet. 
I .did not know him, personally, 
though in the study of his life and 
ministry sometimes it has almost 
seemed to me that I did know him, 
and that I do know him ; for I have 
been reared from my childhood to 
love him, and to honor him, and to 
rejoice in his ministry, and in 
the fact that God called him. I 
did, however, know his successor 
in the presidency of the Church, 
President Brigham Young, from 
my infancy. I have sat upon his 
knees. He was a familiar guest at 
my mother's table. I have traveled 
from one end of the State of l T tah 
to the other with him, when he 
journeyed among the people, teach- 
ing and instructing them in the 
principles of life, in the principles 
of domestic economy, in the prin- 
ciples of correct government; how 
to establish a commonwealth, and 
to build up the people in accordance 
with the design of our Father in 



heaven, in these Rocky Mountains. 
I was called in my youth to go upon 
a foreign mission. He placed his 
hands upon my head and set me 
apart, and bestowed upon me a 
blessing, a prophetic blessing. To 
the extent that I have adhered to 
the admonition of that blessing, I 
have realized that he was a prophet 
of God ; that he foresaw and knew 
wherein I might be of service, and 
his words have been fulfilled upon 
me. I knew him to be a gentleman, 
a man of pure life, a man of great 
beneficence, charity, and loving 
kindness, and a man whom chil- 
dren loved. He was a man to be 
respected by those of his faith and 
those not of his faith, a command- 
ing character, a leader among men, 
a governor, a guide, a counselor, 
a friend, a father. At his direction 
I later undertook a mission among 
the youth of Zion, and established 
the Young Men's Mutual Improv- 
ment Associations. 

I knew his successor, President 
John Taylor, and I had a testimony 
given to me in this house, at the 
time that the quorums of the 
Priesthood were assembled to sus- 
tain him as president of the 
Church. There were things that 
caused my herat to tremble upon 
that occasion. But God gave to 
me a testimony and the power to 
stand up and raise my hand before 
God and my fellow men, to sus- 
tain him as president, as prophet, 
seer and revelator of this Church, 
and I did, and I do. I learned to 
honor him and to love him and to 
respect him, to recognize in him a 
servant of the true and living God ; 
the champion of liberty, a man who 
had an understanding heart, a man 
who knew government, who knew 
the law. and helped make it, who 
understood the comandments of the

47 



Lord Jesus Christ, and who minis- 
tered to this people in great power 
and in righteousness. I bear my 
testimony concerning him, that in 
the labor, which he asked me to 
continue, that I had been set apart 
to accomplish among the young 
men of Zion, he took me one day 
by the hand in his office, and he 
gave me counsel and advice, and 
bestowed upon me a blessing, the 
fulfilment of which I have lived to 
realize. It was prophetic, and I 
know, because of my personal re- 
lationship with that man in his min- 
istry, that he was a servant of God 
and a prophet, and spoke by the in- 
spiration and foresight of the Spirit 
of God. 

As to his successor, President 
Wilford Woodruff, who was the 
first General Superintendent of the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvment 
Associations, I was intimately as- 
sociated with him in that work. I 
have traveled with him and slept 
with him. I have listened by day 
and by night to his counsel. I have 
shown to him my heart, and he has 
read it through and through, and 
has said to me things that I would 
not dare and would not attempt to 
utter before my fellow men, that 
were full of comfort, that were full 
of help, that were full of encour- 
agement, full of kindness and love ; 
and I love the memory of Wilford 
Woodruff. There is one thing he 
went to the Lord for in our behalf, 
for which the youth of this people 
should hold him in high reverence 
forever and ever, and I will relate 
it. There was a time when through 
the slackness, through the careless- 
ness of the youth of this people, 
that their fathers had great con- 
cern as to whether they would qual- 
ify to succeed them in bearing off 
the responsibility of this work, in 



maintaining the testimony that the 
early apostles and pioneers, that the 
founders of the Church had es- 
tablished ; and sometimes this ap- 
prehension would be heard in the 
congregations of Israel ; men of 
the older time would rise and ex- 
press a fear that when they should 
pass away the work might suffer. 
President Woodruff, to a certain 
degree, not very fully, shared this 
apprehension. He went into the 
woods upon a certain occasion and 
prayed to God and asked him con- 
cerning the condition of the youth 
of his people, and God answered 
him and God revealed to him that: 
"I have tho.se already among the 
youth of my people who will main- 
tain this work and bear off the re- 
sponsibility of it forever. Concern 
thyself no more." President Wood- 
ruff told me that personally, and I 
heard him declare it in effect be- 
fore public congregations. 

There is a stimulation in that, 
young men, and encouragment in 
that. We no longer hear that ap- 
prehension expressed in the congre- 
gations of the people ; but there is 
faith, instead, there is confidence, 
there is assurance that no power 
can hinder the onward progress or 
development and growth of this 
work ; and that those of the youth 
today, who are succeeding their 
fathers in responsible places main- 
tain the faith, that they have the in- 
tegrity, they have the character and 
they have the blessing of God upon 
them, by which they shall uphold 
and sustain this work and bear it 
off faithfully and triumphantly to 
its ultimate destinv, when its influ- 
ence and power shall extend from 
the rivers to the ends of the earth. 
There is no influence and power 
that the world stands so much in 
need of this day as the influence 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and power of this people, of the 
priesthood that is among us, of the 
authority and power that exists 
among us to speak and administer 
in the name of the Lord our God. 

I was not so familiarly acquaint- 
ed with President Lorenzo Snow, 
though I knew him well, and was 
always greeted by him with the ut- 
most kindness and friendship. The 
form of his greeting usually was 
this, as he took me by the hand and 
saw some evidences, I suppose, of 
good health, he would shake and 
say : "Well, I suppose you are go- 
ing to live to be a hundred." I 
generally responded with the obser- 
vation that I guessed I should have 
to, if I ever did all the things that 
T would like to. I was away from 
home during much of the time of 
his administration as president of 
the Church, but he 'did entrust me 
with certain opportunities to serve 
the cause and the people in his ad- 
ministration, and I appreciated that 
trust, and did to the best of my en- 
deavor that which he asked of me. 

Now, in respect to his successor. 
President Joseph F. Smith, I feel 
honored today that I can stand here 
and testify before you that from 
the time he honored me with his 
friendship, and better acquaint- 
ance, his confidence and many ex- 
pressions of his love, that I have 
known him to be a man chosen of 
the Almighty, a man inspired of 
Ihe Lord, a man whose whole heart 
has been given to the service of 
God. He has seemed to me to per- 
sonify that Son of God who re- 
sponded to the commandment of 
the Lord, wherein he says : "Son. 
give me thy heart.'* If a man ever 
gave up and surrendered his whole 
heart to God, Joseph F. Smith is 
that man. Now. I am not declaring 
this to flatter him, but you know it, 



my brethren and sisters. No man 
nor woman who has come under the 
influence of his ministry in this 
commjunity, but who knows and 
feels, realizes that, this is the truth ; 
and that is why he is great, and 
whv he is successful, and why he 
will he successful and will accom- 
plish all that God requires at his 
hands. 

My testimony to you is, then, 
that these men whom I have named 
and whom I have personally known 
were men of God, were men of 
high character, and of ability. Thev 
were men who, among men of no 
faith or of other faiths, would have 
stood out as individual characters, 
commanding influence and respect. 
Thev were men who dedicated 
themselves without restraint, hold- 
in e nothing; back, to the whole ser- 
vice of God, the establishment of 
this work known as "Mormonism" 
in the world. This because of 
their conviction and testimony and 
knowledge that it was of God and 
is true, and that it must prevail on 
the earth. Thev accepted the mis- 
sion to declare it to mankind. They 
have transmitted that mission to us. 
Tt is our business to declare the 
truth to mankind, and God will not 
hold us euiltless if we fail to do so. 
but he will honor us in doing it. He 
will uphold us, no matter before 
whom we go, if we stand valiantly 
for what we know to be true. 

My testimony to you is that the 
Lord never fails to uphold and sus- 
tain those who will be true in their 
testimony concerning this work. 
May he help every one of us to be 
true, and to declare it, and to per- 
form our part, however humble or 
in whatever field of labor, for the 
Lord Jesus' sake. Amen. 

The congregation sang: "Do

what is right, the day dawn is 
breaking." 

Elder Andrew Kimball, President 
of the St. Joseph stake of Zion, of- 
fered the closing prayer. 
. Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

At 2 o'clock the conference was 
called to order by President Joseph 
F. Smith, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Redeemer of Israel, 
our only delight." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Jacob T. Tanner, First Counselor 
in the Presidency of the Beaver 
stake of Zion. 

Sister Shanna Tout .sang a solo : 
"O, rest in the Lord."

Purpose of prophecy — The supernat- 
ural discredited — Dead prophets pre- 
ferred to living ones — The modern 
Zion — Why not established — A 
Tempest of War foretold — The

"Surely the Lord God will do noth- 
ing, but he revealeth his secret unto 
his servants the prophets." — Amos 3:7. 

The words are those of a prophet 
of God who figured in the midst of 
the Hebrew nation about eight hun- 
dred years before the birth of the 
Savior. A more modern translation 
of the text might have rendered it 
thus : Surely the Lord God will do 
nothing, without first revealing it 
to his servants the prophets. But it 
is sufficiently plain in its present 



form. The meaning I understand 
to be this : The all-wise Dispenser 
of human affairs will neither cause 
nor permit any event to take place, 
affecting the weal or woe of the 
human family, until he has first 
communicated with his chosen ser- 
vants, his oracles among men, and 
given them due notice of its ap- 
proach, making them wise as to his 
purpose, that they in turn may make 
wise the people; the object being 
that some sort of preparation shall 
precede the event in question. The 
promised sending of Elijah the 
prophet, before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord, 
as foretold by Malachi, was in or- 
der that certain things might be 
done which, if left undone, would 
cause that coming to smite the earth 
with a curse. 

To prepare God's people, and 
through them the world at large, 
for changes that must come in the 
carrying out of the divine program, 
is the function of the prophet, who 
foretells the future; of the seer, 
who looks through time into eter- 
nity; of the revelator, who delivers 
the word and will of the Universal 
Father to his children. The aims 
of the prophets are high and noble. 
They desire the happiness and 
progress of the race ; yet almost in- 
variably they are misunderstood, 
ridiculed, opposed and persecuted. 

There is a proneness in human 
nature to discredit prophets and 
other divinely inspired men. The 
supernatural is nearly always dis- 
counted, if not derided, by ultra- 
practical minds. "The natural man 
is an enemy to God." All miracles 
are myths to modern pseudo-science 
and its arrogant handmaid, the so- 
called "Higher Criticism." To be- 
lieve in prophecies, visions and rev- 
elations, is "to live in haunted 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



houses." So one learned gentleman 
asserted in an educational address 
recently delivered in some of our 
western towns. Even those who 
revere the prophets of the past are 
tempted to ignore the prophets of 
the present. It seems natural to 
turn from What Is and bow down 
to What Has Been. 

"Seven cities claimed the birth oi 

Homer, dead, 
Through which the living Homer 

begged for bread." 

The Savior reproved the pious 
unbelievers of his generation for 
garnishing the sepulchres of the 
dead prophets and rejecting the liv- 
ing ones, as their fathers ha:l done 
before them. A professed rever- 
ence for Moses and the old-time 
servants of God was a prominent 
characteristic of those who spurned 
the greatest of all prophets, the 
very Son of God, concerning whom 
Moses and others had testified. And 
this same spirit, the spirit that cru- 
cified the Christ, brought about in 
the Nineteenth Century the mar- 
tyrdom of the prophet, revelator 
and seer, Joseph Smith. 

I want to read to you one of his 
predictions, of interest to us all. 
from the fact that it constitutes the 
reason why "Mormonism" came 
into the world. That reason was, in 
brief, that Israel might be gathered, 
that Zion might be brought forth, 
and the way prepared for the com- 
ing of the Lord in his glory. This 
revelation, only a part of which I 
will read, came to the Prophet in 
the month of March, 1831 : 

"Verily I say unto you, that great 
things await you. Ye hear of wars in 
foreign lands, but behold I say unto 
you, they are nigh, even at your doors, 
and not many years hence ye shall 
hear of wars in your own land. 



*' Vv herefore I the Lord have said, 
Gather ye out from the eastern lands, 
assemble ye yourselves together, ye 
elders of my church, go ye forth into 
the western countries, call upon the 
inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as 
they do repent build up churches unto 
me; [that is, branches of the Church] 

"And with one heart and with one 
mind gather up your riches, that ye 
may purchase an inheritance which 
shall hereafter be appointed unto you. 

"And it shall be called the New 
Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of 
refuge, a place of safety for the saints 
of the Most High God; 

"And the glory of the Lord shall 
be there, and the terror of the Lord 
also shall be there, insomuch that the 
wicked will not come unto it, and it 
shall be called Zion. 

"And it shall come to pass among 
the wicked, that every man that will 
not take his sword against his neigh- 
bor, must needs flee unto Zion for 
safety. 

"And there shall be gathered unto it 
out of every .nation under heaven; 
and it shall be the only people that 
shall not be at war one with another, 

"And it shall be said among the 
wicked, Let us not go up to battle 
against Zion, for the inhabitants of 
Zion are terrible, wherefore we cannot 
stand. 

"And it shall come to pass that the 
righteous shall be gathered out from 
among all nations, and shall come to 
Zion, singing with songs of everlast- 
ing joy" (Doctrine and Covenants 45: 
62-71). 

This Church was less than one 
year old when that revelation was 
given, and but little more than a 
year old when an attempt was made 
to carry out the divine instruction. 
The place for the City was revealed 
— Jackson County, Missouri — and 
the plan whereby Zion would be es- 
tablished was also made known. 
Then why — this being our mission 
— are we not engaged in it? Well, 
we are engaged in it. But why are 
we up here in the Rocky Mountains, 
instead of down in Missouri, build-

ing up Zion? Well, there are sev- 
eral reasons why the Latter-day 
Saints have not yet been able to 
completely carry out the terms of 
this prophecy. One reason was 
mentioned yesterday in the splendid 
address delivered by President 
Smith. The people who received 
these instructions had to "flee from 
the wrath to come." The mam rea- 
son, however, was selfishness on 
these instructions had to "flee 
sary unity. "There were jarrings 
and contentions and envyings and 
strifes and lustful and covetous de- 
sires among them ;" and because of 
these things the Lord permitted 
their enemies to come upon them 
and drive them from the goodly 
land. They were a good people, 
better than those who persecuted 
them, but not good enough to carry 
out the high and holy purposes of 
Deity. Had they been in all re- 
spects what the Lord wanted them 
to be, and what their .descendants 
will have to be in order to fulfil 
prophecy, Zion might have been re- 
deemed in their day. But they did 
not prove equal to the undertaking, 
and consequently a next-best course 
had to be pursued. 

A great storm-cloud was gather 
ing over this Nation and over the 
whole world, and on Christmas day. 
1832, the Prophet uttered a predic- 
tion concerning it. He said that 
war would be "poured out upon all 
nations," beginning at a certain 
place — South Carolina — and subse- 
quently be declared that the conflict 
would arise over the slave question. 
Twenty-eight years and a few 
months from that time, this predic- 
tion began to have its fulfilment, 
when the first gun was fired on Fort 
Sumter, April 12, 1861 ; an act 
precipitating the war between the 
North and the South. The greater 



part of the prophecy is, of course, 
in the future. 

Now, because of these events and 
their own unpreparedness, the 
Lord's people had to "wait for a 
little season for the redemption of 
Zion." They were told that they 
must first become mighty — not only 
in numbers and material influence, 
but by the power of God, descend- 
ing upon them as an endowment 
from on high. And meanwhile, as 
the President informed us, they had 
to "flee the wrath to come" — 
had to seek shelter from the tem- 
pest.which, when it burst, spent 
much of its fury upon those lands 
from which the Saints had been 
driven. Nearly twenty years before 
the Civil War the Prophet predicted 
the removal of the Saints to the 
Rocky Mountains, and four years 
later that removal besran. Here they 
were to become a mighty people, the 
prospective saviors of the Nation. 
Here they have founded stakes of 
Zion, preparatory to the redemption 
of Zion proper. That is why we 
are up here in the tops of the moun- 
tains, instead of down there in the 
State of Missouri. 

The tempest of war did not end 
with the strife between the North- 
ern and the Southern States. That 
was only the beginning of the 
storm. God's people were warned 
to keep out of the way until the ca- 
lamities foretold should have done 
their work and until the way should 
be prepared before them. The 
Prophet having been slain, his suc- 
cessor, President Brigham Young, 
led the people to these mountain 
fastnesses. He also was inspired 
by the spirit of prophecy and reve- 
lation ; and I testify that every man 
who has since occupied the same 
position and presided over this 



53 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church, has likewise been a prophet 
of the Most High God. 

I wish now to refer to one of 
these men and to certain predictions 
that he made. I heard President 
Wilford Woodruff, in April, 1893, 
when the Salt Lake Temple was 
dedicated, declare that from that 
time forth the Latter-day Saints 
would have more influence in the 
world and their representatives 
would be treated with greater re- 
spect and consideration by their fel- 
low men than ever before. In the 
autumn of that year I accompanied 
President Woodruff and his coun- 
selors, Presidents George O. Can- 
non and Joseph F. Smith, with the 
Tabernacle Choir, to the World's 
Fair at Chicago. Among the points 
visited en route was Independence, 
Jackson County, Missouri. Just 
sixty years before, our people had 
been ruthlessly driven from that 
part, and every form of indignity 
heaped upon them. Fiftv-eight 
years before, this same Wilford 
Woodruff, then a priest on his way 
to fill a mission in the Southern 
States, had passed through Jackson 
County, at a time when it was al- 
most as much a,s a "Mormon's" life 
was worth to be seen there. Be- 
cause of this hostile sentiment he 
had to conceal his identityand almost 
skulk through the county, to avoid 
the danger. But how was it in the 
autumn of 1893? Why, the whole 
town of Independence came out to 
preet the "Mormon" leader ; the 
Mavor delivered a speech of wel- 
come, and the people vied with each 
other in doing honor and showing 
courtesv to the head of the unpop- 
ular and hated Church. 

Here is another prediction, ut- 
tered bv President Woodruff the 
year after that visit to Jackson 
County. T will not read it all. for 



my time is limited. This was de- 
livered at Brigham City, in June, 
1894. The President said : 

"God has held the angels of de- 
struction for many 5'ears, lest they 
should reap down the wheat with the 
tares. I want to tell you now that 
these angels have left the portals of 
heaven, and they stand over this peo- 
ple and this nation now, and are hov- 
ering over the earth, waiting to pour 
out the judgments, and from this very 
day they shall be poured out. Calami- 
ties and troubles are increasing in the 
earth, and there is a meaning to these 
things. Remember this, and reflect 
upon these matters. If you do your 
duty, and I do my duty, we shall have 
protection and be shielded and pass 
vhrough the afflictions in peace and in 
safety. Read the scriptures and the 
revelations; they will tell you about 
all these things. Great changes are 
at our doors. The next twenty years 
will see mighty changes among the 
nations of the earth. You will live to 
see these things, whether I do or not. 
T have felt oppressed with the weight 
of these matters, and I felt I must 
speak of them here." 

It was just twenty years from 
the time these fateful words were 
spoken, when the great war broke 
out in Europe — a war that has 
caused many "mighty changes 
among the nations" and is evidently 
destined to cause many more. 

Just before the strife began, a 
learned gentleman from another 
state, a great and good man, stood 
no in this Tabernacle and expressed 
the positive conviction that there 
could not be another great war. He 
gave his reasons, and thev were 
most plausible. Others had done 
the same. Thev said the world had 
advanced too far ; the nations were 
too civilized, too cultured to permit 
of it : it simply could not be. The 
Savior said, two thousand years 
a?o, that such thines must be 
''Matthew 24 :6) — they were one of 
the signs of his second coming; and

God's prophet in latter days de- 
clared that war would be "poured 
out upon all nations." But this 
learned man maintained that such 
things were impossible. It was only 
a few days after he had so ex- 
pressed himself, when the greatest 
hell of conflict that this world has 
ever known broke out, and now 
threatens to wrap the world in 
flames. In the light of such devel- 
opments, which do you deem the 
more trustworthy, the theories of 
men, or the revelations of Almighty 
God? 

One frightful phase of the great 
conflict is the havoc wrought by the 
German U-boats, otherwise known 
as submarines. A revelation given 
through Joseph Smith in August, 
1831, connects closely with these 
fearful happenings. The Prophet, 
with a company of Elders, was re- 
turning from his first visit to Mis- 
souri. They had made their camp 
at a place called Mcllwair's Bend, 
on the Missouri River, where one 
of the party, William W. Phelps, 
had a vision of the destroyer riding 
in fury upon the waters. This inci- 
dent brought forth the revelation, 
a part of which ran as follows : 

"Behold, there are many dangers 
upon the waters, and more especially 
hereafter; 

"For I the Lord have decreed in 
mine anger, many destructions upon 
the waters: yea, and especially upon 
these waters; 

"Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine 
hand, and he that is faithful among 
you shall not perish by the waters. 
******* 

"Behold I, the Lord, in the begin- 
'iiing blessed the waters, but in the 
last days, by the mouth of my servant 
John, I cursed the waters: 

"Wherefore, the days will come that 
no flesh shall be safe upon the waters, 

"And it shall be said in days to 
come that none is able to go up to 



the land of Zion upo,n the waters, but 
he that is upright in heart. 

"And as I the Lord in the beginning 
cursed the land, even so in the last 
days have I blessed it, in its time, 
for the use of my saints, that they 
may partake the fatness thereof. 

"And now I give unto you a com- 
mandment that what I say unto one I 
say unto all, that you shall forewarn 
your brethren concerning these wa- 
ters, that they come not in journey- 
ing upon them, lest their faith fail 
and they are caught in her snares. 

"I the Lord have decreed, and the 
destroyer rideth upon the face thereof, 
and I revoke not the decree" (Doc. 
and Gov. 61:4-6, 14-19). 

"No flesh shall be safe upon the 
waters." Isn't that time almost 
here? Even upon the calm Pa- 
cific no ship dares to pursue con- 
secutively the same track twice. 
The companies operating the great 
ocean liners no longer announce the 
dates of departure from one port, 
or of expected arrival at another. 
They dare not. The destroyer is 
abroad, death is in the depths, and 
the spirit of dread broods upon the 
bosom of the waters. And this 
upon the comparatively peaceful 
Western Ocean. Upon the At- 
lantic, in the Mediterranean, and in 
the North Sea, the terrible submar- 
ine tells the tale of danger and dis- 
aster. 

Another phase of the gigantic 
struggle is the food question. Jos- 
eph Smith predicted famine, and 
President Brigham Young, many 
years ago, placed upon the sisters 
of the Relief Society a special mis- 
sion, that of gathering and storing 
grain against a time of scarcity. I 
well remember how lightly es- 
teemed by some were the labors of 
these devoted women. Some of 
them went to one of our bishops 
and asked him to build them a gran- 
ary. He smiled benignantly and told 
them to bring along their grain and 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he would store it for them in his 
barn, implying that they would not 
gather very much. The sentiment 
at that time, in certain places, was 
that there could not be another 
famine in this world. Too much of 
the acreage of the earth was under 
cultivation, and the means of rapid 
transit and communication were too 
plentiful. If a famine threatened 
any part of the planet, word of it 
could come in the twinkling of an 
eye, and millions on millions of tons 
of food-stuffs could be transported 
to the scene, staving off the strait- 
ness and rendering such a calamity 
impossible. 

Alas for those who put their 
trust in the arm of flesh ! How is it 
today? In spite of the great and 
ever-increasing productivity of the 
earth, in spite of railroads, steam- 
ships and telegraphs, this is a fam- 
ine-threatened world. Europe calls 
to America for food ; America re- 
sponds ; but as fast as she consigns 
her cargoes of grain and other 
food-stuffs to the needy nations, 
the merciless and devouring sub- 
marine sends them to the bottom 
of the sea. 

Eff orts have not been wanting to 
meet the situation and ward off the 
impending catastrophe. Six months 
ago President Smith, addressing a 
general priesthood meeting, with a 
view to encouraging a wider culti- 
vation of the soil, offered, as Trust- 
ee-in-Trust, cash premiums in gen- 
erous amounts for the best yields 
of agricultural products .resulting 
from the labors of various local or- 
ganizations. The Young Men's 
Mutual Improvement Association 
seconded this action of the Trust- 
ee-in-Trust, by furnishing and 
sending to the boys of Utah free 
seed for the raising of more 
abundant crops. The whole nation 



has been aroused to the necessity 
existing for the avoidance of waste 
and the conservation of food-stuffs ; 
and the entire civilized world has 
awakened to the same urgent call. 
The "Mormon" grain-storing move- 
ment is no longer a joke, subject 
for ridicule. God has vindicated 
the patient labors of the Sisters, 
and fulfilled the forebodings of 
prophecy. 

WHAT OF THE OUTCOME? 

What will be the outcome of the 
awful strife now raging? Will the 
world be "made safe for democ- 
racy," or will it be ground under 
the iron heel of an autocratic mil- 
itary despotism ? I cannot believe 
that such a calamity is in store. He 
who died to make man free, and 
whose gospel is "the perfect law of 
liberty," will never permit the en- 
slavement of the human race. He 
who in the beginning instituted 
laws for man's advancement will 
never tolerate such a turning back 
of the wheels of eternal progress. 
Having- decreed the world's eman- 
cipation from every form of mis- 
rule, he will never allow the en- 
thronement of universal tyranny. 

Nevertheless, He will accomplish 
in his own way the work that he 
has set his hand to do, and will 
use this people and all peoples in 
the process. His gospel must have 
free access into and among all na- 
tions, and the nation that fights 
against him will perish. All power 
is his, both in heaven and on earth, 
and he will never let his work be 
thwarted by any scheme for per- 
sonal or national aggrandizement. 
More to God is man's salvation 
than the perpetuity of any dy- 
nasty or the glory of any earthly 
empire.

A greater warfare is in progress 
than now shakes the shores of 
Europe — a warfare whose begin- 
ning was coeval with the foundation 
of the world. Far greater than any 
strife between man and man, is the 
world-old controversy between God 
and Satan, between freedom and 
oppression, between right and 
wrong. And right will triumph, 
and God will be glorified. The 
world will be made safe for democ- 
racy — safe for all righteous insti- 
tutions. Israel will be gathered, 
Zion redeemed, and the way pre- 
pared for the King of kings and the 
Millennial reign of universal free- 
dom and peace.

Economy and thrift, and a conserva- 
tion of material things, commenda- 
ble and pleasing to God — An appeal 
to the Saints to give more attention 
to the protection and conservation 
of youth, manhood and womanhood 
— The sacredness, sanctity and per- 
manence of family relationships — 
The gospel should be taught in 
every home for the protection of its 
inmates — The dangers arising from 
a neglect of prayer and from bad 
example — Tobacco, particularly the 
cigarette, is a menace to manhood; 
some illustrations — It is unpatriotic 
to send tobacco to our soldiers to 
sap their manhood and undermine 
their strength — Testimony. 

The burden of the message to 
the Latter-day Saints during this 
conference has been a heart-felt 
admonition to keep the command- 



ments of God, to live .in harmony 
with his priesthood. I wish in my 
soul that every man, woman and 
child in the Church might have 
heard those appeals from the ser- 
vants of God to Israel to keep his 
commandments. There is one com- 
mandment which I feel impressed 
to read this afternoon : 

"And again, inasmuch as parents 
have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes, which are organized, and they 
teach them not to understand the doc- 
trines of repentance, faith in Christ, 
the Son of the living God, and in bap- 
tism and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands when eight 
years old, the sin be upon the heads 
of the parents, for this shall be a law 
unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in 
any of her stakes which are organ- 
ized." 

We have heard, during the last 
year, a great deal about the neces- 
sity of conservation. We have been 
admonished from pulpits and by the 
press to conserve our resources, 
and in a measure the people have 
responded nobly to that appeal. On 
every hand you can see evidences 
of the desire on the part of the peo- 
ple to conserve the products of the 
earth, and to utilize them for the 
blessing of the people who are in 
distress. There is more care taken 
on the farm to reap the harvest with 
which God has blessed the people ; 
there is more thought given in the 
kitchen, and the food stuff is being 
conserved and more economically 
used, perhaps, than ever before ; 
and yet economy and thrift are 
fundamentals in the social organiza- 
tion and in the teachings of this 
Church. But the war has brought 
the necessity of it home to us, as 
nothing else perhaps in the world 
has done. 

At noon today some of us saw a 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wonderful display of the result of 
one phase of this conservation and 
service. I refer to the exhibit which 
the General Board of Primary As- 
sociations has on display in the 
Bishop's building. Hundreds of 
useful products — the result of dili- 
gence on the part of your little 
boys and girls — made out of old 
clothes, discarded suits, and other 
material, are now placed in the 
hands of the General Board to be 
sent to the Red Cross Association, 
for the benefit and relief of the 
soldiers at the front. I approve of 
it as a most commendable example 
of what may be accomplished by or- 
ganized, and well-directed effort. 

This conservation and care is in 
keeping with the example which 
Jesus gave his disciples. You re- 
member on one occasion he fed the 
multitude and commanded them to 
sit on the grass, and with five barley 
loaves and two fishes fed the five 
thousand, after which he said, now 
"Gather up the fragments that re- 
main, that nothing may be lost." 

All this conservation of material 
things, I say, is most commendable 
and pleasing to God, but the great- 
est conservation that mankind can 
engage in is the conservation of 
youth, the conservation of man- 
hood and the protection of wom- 
anhood. I appeal to the Latter- 
day Saints today to give more 
thought to the protection, to the 
consideration, of the dearest pos- 
session you have — your sons and 
daughters. The day after Christ 
gave the lesson of economy in tak- 
ing care of things of the earth, he 
said to some of the same multitude 
who gathered around him in Caper- 
naum : "Ye seek me not because ye 
saw the miracles, but because ye ate 
of the loaves and were filled. Labor 
not for the meat which perisheth. 



but for that meat which endureth 
unto everlasting life, which the Son 
of Man shall give unto you." And 
they said, "What is that?'" in sub- 
stance, "Master, where shall we 
get this?" And he said, "This is 
the work of God that ye believe on 
him whom he hath sent." Faith in 
Christ is one of the principles which 
we should teach our boys and girls. 
The Prophet Joseph Smith,through 
revelation, received the admonition, 
and he has given it to the world, 
and it is now a standing law in 
the stakes, that it is the duty of 
fathers and mothers to teach the 
principles of life and salvation, 
based upon the faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, to their children, and 
those who do not have the respon- 
sibility placed upon their shoulders. 

Oh, I praise God for the instruc- 
tions he has given his people re- 
garding the sacredness, the sanc- 
tity, and permanence of the family 
relationship. Let us impress these 
instructions upon our children. 
First let us teach them that the 
proper place to begin the family 
relationship is in the House of God, 
kneeling at his sacred altar worth- 
ily. This means that the young 
man is just as pure and sweet in his 
life, and that he has been during his 
teens and early manhood, as she 
whose hand he holds in his, and 
who gives to him a life of purity 
and virtue, worthy of motherhood, 
worthy of one who in the holy of- 
fice of motherhood joins with the 
Creator in bringing to the earth 
eternal souls. We are not conserv- 
ing that which will perish in time 
when we protect and guide eternal 
spirits from God. "The stars may 
fade away," the poet says, "the sun 
himself grow dim with age, and na- 
ture sink in years, but man shall 
flourish in immortal youth, un-

hurt amidst the war of elements, 
the wreck of matter, and the crash 
of worlds." 

The little babe comes to the home 
as an eternal part of it, when the 
father and the mother plight each 
other's troth, for time and all eter- 
nity. Let us teach the youth, then, 
that the marriage relation is one 
of the most sacred obligations 
known to man, or that man can 
make. Teach them that the family 
is the first institution ordained of 
God, and instituted among men. 
If every couple sensed the sacred- 
ness of this obligation, there would 
be fewer homes broken up by dis- 
agreements that lead to divorces. 
The safety, the perpetuity of our 
government, or of any republican 
form of government, depends up- 
on the safety and permanency of 
the home. Herein we get a glimpse 
of one thing in which this people 
may be the saviors, in a way, of this 
great nation. The home is the 
place where the perpetuation of the 
principles of liberty as well as the 
instructions in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ should be given to the chil- 
dren. When the home breaks up. 
then begin the children to wander 
off into sin. Then the law must 
reach out to bring them back and 
try to teach them some principles 
of service, and principles of true 
government; but oh, how helpless, 
how helpless the state, when the 
home has failed ! 

I have here,, through the kind- 
' ness of a state parole officers, a re- 
port of some of these unfortunate 
boys and girls whose lives have not 
been conserved properly, and it is 
instructive to note the causes of the 
delinquency found among them. 
They are not naturally bad. I be- 
lieve that boys and girls are not 
naturally wicked. We are prone to 



do evil, it is true, but we are also 
prone to do right, and the children 
of Latter-day Saint? are entitled to 
that proneness to do right even 
nore than any other children in the 
world, particularly if the parents 
have radiated in the home, from 
babyhood and through childhood 
and manhood, the spirit of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, as the revela- 
tion here requires. 

In our Industrial School, in the 
month of November, 1910, there 
were enrolled 110 boys. Sixty per 
cent of those boys came from 
broken homes, 7 per cent of that 
60 per cent came from homes 
where parents were divorced ; 18 
per cent, where the fathers were 
dead ; 10 per cent, where the moth- 
ers were dead ; 7 per cent, where 
both parents were dead ; 8 per cent, 
of the children deserted by one or 
both of the parents. Of the re- 
maining 40 per cent of boys, home 
conditions were blasted by the use 
of liquor as follows : fathers ad- 
dicted to the use of liquor, 22 per 
cent ; mothers addicted, 4 per cent. 

The inspiration of God is seen 
in requiring the Latter-day Saints 
to keep their homes intact, and to 
teach their children the principles of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Now, 
T do not mean by that that we 
should make such teaching formal 
or in any way distasteful. I mean 
that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
should radiate in every home ; that 
the prayer night and morning 
should be offered up in sincerity ; 
that the children daily would real- 
ize that we desire in our home the 
presence of God. If we can invite 
the Savior there, we may know that 
the angels will be not only willing 
but eager to protect our boys and 
girls. I believe that in most homes 
boys and girls are taught to pray 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



before retiring for the night. I be- 
lieve, however, that, too generally, 
the morning prayers are neglected. 
When we come to think of it, 
though, it is during the waking 
hours that our boys and girls need 
the protection of God, and the guid- 
ance of his Holy Spirit, more even 
than when they are asleep. The 
dangers surrounding our boys and 
girls today are the dangers that 
come to them out in society, out in 
the. darkness of the night, when 
they are away from the parental in- 
fluence. I plead with the parents 
of the Church to know where your 
boys and girls are at night, between 
the hour of sunset and the hour of 
retiring. I plead with you to know- 
where they are during the day. 
Keep your minds upon them. Let 
your thoughts go with them. La- 
bor not so much for that which will 
perish, but for that which endures 
eternally, for the lives which God 
has given you to protect in this 
world; that the sin of their failing, 
the sin of their degradation, it may- 
be, may not rest upon your shoul- 
ders. 

Homes are made permanent 
through love. Oh, then, let love 
abound. If you feel that you have 
not the love of those little boys and 
girls, study to get it. Though you 
neglect some of the cattle, though 
you fail to produce good crops, 
even, study to hold your children's 
love. Loyalty is another element of 
the permanent home. The loyalty 
you afterwards want them to show 
to the Priesthood of God should be 
manifest in the home — love, loy- 
alty, virtue. Cherish these princi- 
ples, as you cherish and treasure 
your life. Set children the proper 
example. It is folly to tell a boy 
not to smoke, when you take your 
pipe out of your own mouth to tell 



him. Latter-day Saints, let us keep 
the commandments of God. Let us 
try to teach the children those com- 
mandments. The auxiliary associ- 
ations are doing much to help us. 
The Church in all its organizations 
is putting forth an effort to make 
ideal men in ideal communities ; but 
after all, the responsibility of mak- 
ing those ideal men, those ideal 
boys and girls, rests with the par- 
ents, and next with the older broth- 
ers and sisters. The responsibility 
is with the family, God's unit in 
the social fabric of humanity. We 
shall never get away from it. 

In speaking of the necessity of 
guiding youth and conserving their 
strength, I wish to commend most 
highly the closing admonition of 
President Grant, when he referred 
to the appeal that is being made 
to the people here in the west, to 
send tobacco to our soldier boys. 
The nation today needs manhood, 
and any appeal or action which will 
tend to deteriorate manhood must 
be looked upon as unpatriotic. The 
nation today has appointed medical 
men everywhere to test the physical 
strength and mental strength of 
your sons and brothers, before they 
are entitled to enter the army. To- 
bacco, the cigarette particularly, is 
a menace to manhood. It under- 
mines manhood. It weakens the 
body. It unnerves men, where they 
need to have steady nerves. God 
forbid that our boys who have en- 
listed in one of the noblest causes 
that ever a nation sought to serve, 
may ever have it reported truthfully 
of them that any of them were unfit 
to serve their country because of 
their indulgence in these pernicious 
habits, or indulgence in passion. 
God forbid that it can ever be said 
truthfully of our boys who are go- 
ing to the front, as it has been re- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



59 



ported of men in the battle line now 
that one-third of them have been 
made unfit for service because they 
have been untrue to the ideals of 
life ! Such an accusation surely can 
never be made truthfully of a Lat- 
ter-day Saint soldier. I have faith in 
our boys, because most of them are 
going out from homes radiating the 
principles of life and salvation. 
Boys who hitherto have been some- 
what indifferent before they enlist- 
ed have said, "Father, I am going 
to get a blessing from the Patri- 
arch," thus filling the father's heart 
with joy, for he knew that in that 
blessing the admonition would be 
renewed for him to conserve his 
manhood by keeping the words of 
wisdom, and by keeping his body 
unstained by grosser evils. Why, 
isn't it folly, when you think of it, 
for men to be starting a campaign 
to send out tobacco to our soldiers, 
when in 1900, the nation of Japan 
passed a law prohibiting the use of 
tobacco among the young people, 
principally because America had 
proved its injurious effects upon 
youth? Why did the parliament at 
Tokio pass such a law and send it 
as a decree from the emperor ? Be- 
cause about twelve years preceding 
that, Professor Seaner of Yale Uni- 
versity had made some interesting 
examinations among his students. 
He had measured their height 
when they came; he had measured 
their chest girth, and taken their 
weight. He asked their age, and 
found out, best of all, how many 
of them used tobacco, and how 
many did not. Then he watched 
their development, and after nine 
years he published the results. In 
the first place he learned that the 
smokers were about fifteen months 
older than the non-smokers. Sec- 
ond, notwithstanding that older age, 



the average height of the non-smok- 
ers was about one-third of an inch 
more than the smokers. Then at 
the end of nine years he tabulated 
the following, based upon his obser- 
vations among three classes : ( 1 ) 
The smokers who had smoked one 
year or more, (2) those who had 
smoked irregularly, and (3) those 
who had not used tobacco. In 
weight, those who had not used to- 
bacco were 10.4 per cent more than 
those who had used it a year or 
more ; 6.6 per cent more than those 
who had used it irregularly ; in 
height, the non-smokers had gained 
24 per cent over those who smoked 
one year or more; 11 per cent over 
those who smoked irregularly. In 
girth, 26.7 per cent more than 
those who smoked a year or more ; 
22 per cent more than those who 
smoked irregularly. The lung ca- 
pacity, 77 per cent increase over 
those who smoked a year or more ; 
49 per cent over those who smoked 
irregularly. Such were the phys- 
ical gains. In intellectual gain he 
discovered that out of every one 
hundred of the students who had 
stood at the head of their classes, 
only five were smokers, ninety-five, 
non-smokers, although 60 out of 
every hundred used tobacco. That 
is in keeping with the tests made 
in Harvard, where the examination 
of the records for fifty years proved 
that during those fifty years, not 
one smoker had stood at the head 
of his class, although 83 per cent 
of the boys who entered Harvard 
were indulging in the use of tobac- 
co. Eighty-three per cent in the 
smoking group, and 17 per cent in 
the non-smoking group, and during 
that fifty years the heads of the 
classes were chosen from the 17 per 
cent group. 

Such facts were sufficient to in- 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fluence the members of the Parlia- 
ment of Japan to pass a law, in 
March, 1900, to be effective April 
1, 1900, as follows: "The smoking 
of tobacco by minors under the age 
of twenty is prohibited." 

One of the gentlemen, speaking 
to this bill, said : "I wanted to keep 
silence, but as I heard the gentle- 
man speaking against this bill, I felt 
I must say a few words in its favor. 
I heard from an American gentle- 
man that in his country a large 
number of volunteers for the army 
service were rejected on account 
of the weakness of their hearts, and 
the chief reason assigned for this 
defect was their habitual use of to- 
bacco. I do not need to say any 
more from the educational stand- 
point, but if our youths are to be- 
come unfit for military service by 
the use of tobacco, it is alarming. 
By all means, let us stop the use of 
tobacco by young persons." 

Now, some are asking us to send 
out to our soldiers, who need their 
strength, who need their nerve, who 
need their intelligence, as they have 
never needed it before, that which 
is going to sap their manhood and 
undermine their strength. I tell 
you it is not patriotic. Our nation 
needs men, true men, who will stand 
and fight for the glorious principles 
of liberty for which this nation 
stands. 

God help us to conserve the pow- 
ers of our boys and girls. God help 
us to implant in their hearts the 
principles of life and salvation. May 
they have an undying testimony of 
the truth of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I know it is true. I know 
that the principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ are the principles of 
eternal life. I bear you my testi- 
mony that the men who have stood 
at the head of this Church have 



been prophets of God; that Joseph 
F. Smith is a prophet of God ; that 
his counselors are* inspired, ,and 
that the unity among the authori- 
ties of the Church today, so far as 
I know, through reading and hear- 
ing the testimony of older men, is 
superior to what it has ever been 
in the history of the Church. I 
believe that this oneness is charac- 
teristic of the Priesthood. I love 
these presidents of stakes here, who 
preside over the Saints. They are 
one for the truth, and they would 
give their lives for it. God help us 
to instil into the hearts of the young 
that same desire, and to keep our 
girls free and unspotted from the 
association of men who have worse 
than murder in their hearts, and 
who would deprive those girls and 
those boys of the ideals of purity 
of "Mormonism," in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo, "Ever safe with 
God," was sung by James Moncarr. 

ELDER BALDWIN WATTS. 

President Joseph F. Smith intro- 
duced the speaker, saying that 
Elder Watts had been a faithful 
missionary with him many years 
ago. Elder Watts said : 

My brethren and sisters: I re- 
joice in the privilege of attending 
this conference and, as President 
Smith has said, I labored with him 
the greater part of two years in 
the British mission. I learned to 
love him as dearly as I ever loved 
any man in my life, and I have 
never seen one moment that I felt 
to slacken that love. I proved 
when I was in that mission that he 
was a man who has the interest of 
the human family at heart. I

think no man that ever lived has a 
greater interest in the human fam- 
ily than has President Smith to- 
day. I have been acquainted with 
all the presidents who ever stood 
at the head of the Church of God, 
from the Prophet Joseph SSmith 
down to the present time, and i 
know, brethren and sisters, that 
they are men of God. I have been 
personally acquainted with all, I 
have listened to their talk from time 
to time and, as Jesus says, "My 
sheep know my voice and a 
stranger they will not follow." 

We have had the voice of the 
Lord, the voice of the true shep- 
herd, delivered unto us during this 
conference, and I bear testimony to 
it. When I heard one of the breth- 
ren here speak in regard to the 
character of those of our brethren 
who have stood at the head of the 
kingdom of God here upon the 
earth, it stirred within me a desire 
to say something on this occasion, 
and I want to refer more especially 
to our president at the present time, 
because the Lord revealed to me, 
through most unmistakable terms, 
that he would be the man to stand 
at the head of this Church. I had 
a desire for many years to see him 
come to the head of the Church, 
because I could see in him the in- 
tegrity of the Prophet Joseph; but 
when he was chosen out of the 
Twelve to become one of the coun- 
selors to President Taylor, I 
thought my hopes were blasted and 
that he would never get there, be- 
cause I had noticed that when a 
president died, the counselors re- 
turned to their positions in the 
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 
I made it a matter of prayer, breth- 
ren and sisters, on a good many 
different occasions, that the Lord 
would show me, and one day the 



Lord revealed it to me. The Spirit 
of the Lord spoke to me in an au- 
dible voice and said: "When the 
time comes that he should stand at 
the head of the Twelve, he will be 
the president of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 
This was the testimony that was 
given to me through the inspiration 
of the Almighty, and I bear it to 
you truthfully before high heaven. 
I know that he is the man. I do not 
say this because he is here to hear 
it. I have said it many times be- 
fore among people where I have 
spoken in different parts of this 
.state, or to this people. 

We are here, my brethren and 
sisters, in fulfilment of prophecy, 
and we are just what the Prophet 
Joseph said we would be. We have 
become a great and mighty people, 
and the people of the world are 
coming to us. They will continue 
to come to us, and we will become 
the head and not the tail. 

May God bless us, brethren and 
sisters, and bless the Presidency of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and every one who 
has to take an active part in the 
building up of the kingdom of God, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

A FEARLESS DEFENDER OF THE FAITH 

Brother Watts was an older man 
than I was when we were on our 
mission together. I always found 
him to be a very staunch and fear- 
less defender of the faith, and I 
was only too pleased to grant his 
desire to say a few words at this 
conference. He is a goo', true 
man.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



A MESSAGE FROM SENATOR SMOOT 

I have received the following 
telegram : 

"Washington, D. C, Oct. 6, 1917. 
President Joseph F. Smith, etc.: 

"Nothing but national duty 
would prevent me from attending 
the conference. Am over-worked 
but otherwise feeling well. Extend 
my best wishes and love to the peo- 
ple. May Go.d's choicest blessings 
attend them and may his Holy 
Spirit direct his people in the fut- 
ure as in the past. — Reed Smoot." 

A CAUTION TO VISITORS 

I have in my hand a notice, a lit- 
tle paper, which reads as follows : 

"Would it not be a proper thing 
to caution our country folks not to 
allow their daughters to visit in- 
discriminately about the city and 
at the Fort, without proper escort? 
The officers say many of them are 
doing so." 

I hope that our country visitors 
will pay attention to that caution, it 
is a very proper caution, in my 
opinion. 

I thank the Lord for the most 
excellent spirit and the very fitting' 
subjects that have been dwelt upon 
by our brethren today in this con- 
ference. I am gratified with the 
careful attention and interest that 
has been manifested by the Latter- 



day Saints to those who have ad- 
dressed them, and I do sincerely 
hope that the sentiments that have 
been expressed, instructions that 
have been given and the admoni- 
tion, the counsel and the advice of 
the brethren and the doctrines 
which have been promulgated by. 
them will sink deeply into the 
hearts of the Latter-day Saints ; 
and if such a thing be possible, 
that the same may touch the hearts, 
the calloused hearts, the thought- 
less hearts and minds of those who 
are indifferent to the duties of men 
toward their fellow men, and es- 
pecially those who are indifferent as 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints to the 
duties that devolve upon them, or 
should devolve upon them as mem- 
bers of the Church. 

God bless you ; peace and pros- 
perity abide with you in your out- 
going and in your in-coming, in 
your business and in the perform- 
ance of your religious duty and in 
every vocation and avocation of 
life in which you are engaged, that 
you may prosper therein, and in all 
things give thanks to God and 
glorify the name of the Giver of 
every good and perfect gift. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the Doxology. 

The closing prayer was pro- 
nounced by President Joseph Eck- 
ersley, of the Wayne stake of Zion, 
a^d conference was adjourned until 
Sunday morning at 10 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the Tab- 
ernacle at 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, 
October 7, 1917, President Joseph 
F. Smith, presiding. 

President Smith announced over- 
flow meetings to be held in tne as- 
sembly Hall this morning, under 
direction of President Seymour B. 
Young, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty; also an open air meeting a* 
the Bureau of Information, under 
direction of Elder Benjamin God,- 
dard of the Bureau of Information ; 
and this afternoon, under direction 
of Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, of 
the First Council of Seventy, and 
Elder Benjamin Goddard, respec- 
tively, both for the accommodation 
of people who could not find room 
in the overcrowded Tabernacle 
where every seat and all available 
space was occupied. 

The Tabernacle choir sang: 
"Hear me, O Lord." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Alonzo A. Hinckley, President of 
the Deseret stake of Zion. 

Eveline Thomas sang a sacred 
contralto solo: "Eye hath not 
seen."

Faith, devotion and good works of 
the Saints in general — A few are 
filled with doubt and disbelief — ■ 
These, like Korihor, follow doc-

Some observations on the theory

Church contrasted — l 'ow far we be-

things left to chance to dissolve, de-

through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

"Now it came to pass that there 
were many of the rising generation 
that could not understand the words 
of king Benjamin, being little children 
at the time he spake unto his people; 
and they did not believe the traditions 
of their fathers. 

"They did not believe what had 
been said concerning the resurrection 
of the dead, neither did they believe 
concerning the coming of Christ. 

"And now because of their unbelief 
they could not understand the word 
of God; and their hearts were hard- 
ened. 

"And they would not be baptized; 
neither would they join the Church. 
And they were a separate people as 
to their faith, and remained so ever 
after, even in their carnal and sinful 
state; for they would not call upon 
the Lord their God." 

Since the last general conference 
of the Church, in April, I have vis- 
ited many of the organized stakes 
of Zion. I have been in Canada on 
the north, and to the extreme lim- 
its of this state in the south, and it , 
affords me great pleasure and sin- 
cere satisfaction to testify before 
this large congregation of Latter- 
day Saints to the faith, the devo- 
tion and good works of the great 
majority of the Latter-day Saints 
wherever I have been. I have 
found, however, in all of these dif- 
ferent localities people who aopear 
to lack faith, who are indifferent 
to the doctrines of the gospel as 
taught by the Church, they do not

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



believe, or least doubt, that the 
spirit of man existed before com- 
ing to this world, that it lives after 
leaving it, or that there will be a 
re-union of the spirit and body in 
the resurrection from the dead. To 
them this life is all there is of hu- 
man existence. In searching for 
the cause which led up to the un- 
belief of these young people among 
the Nephites, to whom the scrip- 
ture which I have read refers, I 
discovered, to use the words of 
those who kept their records, that 
there appeared among them men 
of cunning device and flattering 
words, teaching doctrines which 
were destructive of faith in Go:l. 
Prominent among such men was 
Korihor, from whose words I now 
wish to read : 

"Oh, ye that are bound down under 
a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye 
yoke yourselves with such foolish 
things? Why do ye look for a Christ? 
For no man can know of any thing 
which is to come. 

"Behold, these things which ye call 
prophecies, which ye say are handed 
down by holy prophets, behold, they 
are foolish traditions of your fathers. 

"How do ye know of their surety? 
Behold, ye cannot know of things 
which ye do not see; therefore ye can- 
not know that there shall be a Christ. 

"Ye look forward and say that ye 
see a remission of your sins. But, be- 
hold, it is the effect of a frenzied 
mind; and this derangement of your 
minds comes because of the traditions 
of your fathers, which lead you away 
into a belief ,of things which are not 
so. 

"And many more such things did he 
say unto them, telling them that there 
could be no atonement made for the 
sins of men, but that every man fared 
in this life according to the manage- 
ment of the creature; therefore every 
man prospered according to his gen- 
ius, and that every man conquered ac- 
cording to his strength: and whatso- 
ever a man did was no crime. 

"And thus did he preach unto them, 
leading away the hearts of many, 



causing them to lift up their heads in 
their wickedness; * * * telling 
them that when a man was dead, that 
was the end thereof." 

As I read and reflected upon 
these words, I thought how like the 
past the present is, when applied to 
this question. Recently, in one of 
the stakes of Zion which I visited, 
a man professing great learning, 
before a public gathering, with 
cunning device and flattering 
words declared to those to whom 
his remarks were addressed that 
their ancestors hung from the 
branches of the forest trees by 
their tales. With boldness he ad- 
vocated the theory that man had 
gradually evolved, without con- 
scious effort, from the lowest type 
of created life to what he now is, 
and that as his past had been a con- 
tinued process of change so is his 
future to be. 

In this, I thought, he is at least 
consistent, for if man was not al- 
ways what he is now, if it is true 
that he has gradually come up from 
the lower order of created things, 
what changes may not the future 
ages bring to him ! I took occasion 
to question the theory advocated by 
this man, to point out what ap- 
peared to me to be its inconsisten- 
cies, with the result that a request 
was made that I read certain books 
which treated the subject of evo- 
lution ; some of them, it was said, 
were in very general use in our 
common schools. I did so, with the 
result that my conclusions, long 
since arrived at, were more strong- 
ly confirmed than ever before, and 
my faith in the revealed word of 
the Lord strengthened, if that were 
possible. 

The doctrine taught in these 
books takes you into the realm of 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



65 



doubt, teaches that this earth and 
all things wich are upon it are the 
result of chance, it leaves you be- 
wildered regarding- the past, un- 
certain of the present, and without 
hope in the future. The truth, as 
revealed from heaven, teaches the 
plan of an infinitely wise creator, 
designed for the accomplishment 
of a divine purpose. 

I know it will be claimed that I 
am not capable of discussing this 
question, that I am not a learned 
man, that I have no college degree, 
and consequently am incapable of 
rendering intelligent judgment. I 
admit that I have not passed my 
life behind closed doors, reading 
books written by uninspired men, 
and accepting their conclusions 
without reserve. I have not passe 1 
it in an effort to produce, by cross 
breeding, a new species of guinea 
pig, or by selection and intensive 
cultivation a new variety of pea ; 
but I have read some books, have 
been in close contact with nature, 
unspoiled by the hand of man, 
have been an observer and student 
of my surroundings, until I have 
reached conclusions which satisfy 
me, and seem to justify my faith, 
and so I am, going to assume to 
tread upon this ground made sac- 
red to men of so called learning, 
and express to this congregation 
the result of some of my observa- 
tions. 

This modern theory of evolution 
suggests that at a period in the past, 
so remote that it is almost beyond 
conception, by some spontaneous 
action, the earth came into exist- 
ence. By degrees life appeared 
upon it ; it gradually changed under 
some natural process until what in 
the beginning was a very inferior 
form of vegetable and animal life 
evolved into what the world now is, 



with man representing its highest 
development. 

I take it for granted that if this 
theory is admitted it must logically 
follow that this evolution from an 
inferior condition is still in process 
of development, and that just as 
man at present has no association 
or affinity with the source from 
which he is said to have sprung, so 
as the ages pass he will be as unlike 
what he now is, as he is now unlike 
what he once was. 

In contrast to this theory we 
have the doctrine taught by the 
Church that the earth, and all that 
is upon it, were created by God's 
fiat, or decree. That the earth, the 
vegetation, and all life were created 
in successive periods, and lastly 
man, in the image of God created 
he him, male and female created he 
them. The only created thing 
which was in the image of God, 
the only created thing endowed with 
reason, and in a degree with the in- 
telligence of the Creator. And God 
gave to man dominion over the 
fishes of the sea, the fowls of the 
air, and every other created thing. 
Because of transgression a curse 
came upon the earth, and it was de- 
creed that thorns and tistles should 
be its spontaneous product, that the 
natural tendency of all created 
things should be toward decay and 
dissolution, and that redemption 
from these untoward conditions 
could only come through the appli- 
cation of the intelligence with 
which man had been endowed, and 
the effort which he put forth to sub- 
due the earth and redeem it until 
it should be restored to its para- 
disiacal glory. 

I desire to ask advocates of this 
theory of evolution without con- 
scious effort, to point me to a single 
instance where, within the known 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



history of the world, any living 
thing- has, without application of the 
intelligent effort of man, which is 
the application of the intelligence 
of God, changed from what it was 
to somthing else, where a thing has 
come up from an inferior to a su- 
perior condition. On the other 
hand my own observation has 
taught me that the moment the 
most highly developed thing is 
left to itself, left to chance, with- 
out the intelligent application of the 
intelligence of man, it immediately 
reverts from what it is to an infe- 
rior condition, just as the Lord de- 
creed it should. 

I am a believer in evolution. I 
can very readily believe that my 
ancestors may have lived in a cave 
or in the rudest kind of habita- 
tion, whereas, today they live in 
palaces. I can very readily under- 
stand that these primitive, simple 
homes may have been warmed and 
lighted by fire that was produced 
by the rubbing together of sticks, 
where today it is produced by the 
application of those scientific means 
which have been revealed to man 
through the Spirit of God by which 
they have been enabled to apply to 
their convenience the elements with 
which they are surrounded. I can 
very readily believe that whereas 
they cultivated the earth with the 
most primitive agricultural imple- 
ments and fought their battles with 
weapons made of stone, they now 
cultivate the earth by the applica- 
tion of the most scientific methods 
and that their battles are fought 
by processes unthought of an:l un- 
known to primitive man. I can 
readily understand that they gath- 
ered from the beds of the rivers 
and chisled from the rock the na- 
tive metal which they hammered 
into ornaments and used perhaps 



as circulating medium, whereas 
now the ores are mined and the 
metals extracted by the most intri- 
cate chemical process. In this I see 
the most marvelous progress, the 
most wonderful evolution ; but I see 
in it all, my brethren and sisters, 
not the result of chance, but the de- 
velopment of the mind of man, 
which is after the order of the mind 
of God; that, as he grew, his ob- 
servation taught him that there 
were better ways of doing things 
than the way in which he was doing 
them, and that as he reflected and 
thought and studied, God gave him 
wisdom to go on and to thus per- 
fect the primitive thought which he 
originally had. I have seen the 
most beautiful things in the vege- 
table world that the hand of man 
and the wisdom of all these ages 
has created, left to itself "for a 
short time, left to chance, almost 
immediately revert to wild condi- 
tion. I have seen horses and cattle 
bred up to the very highest stand- 
ard left only for a short period of 
time to themselves, become degen- 
erated, illustrating just what God's 
word declared, that the natural ten- 
dency of all that pertains to this 
earth is towards decline, towards 
'dissolution, not to go on and on 
without intelligent effort until per- 
fection is reached. But one of these 
learned men said to me when I il- 
lustrated my though in this way, 
"Why, that is natural, that is be- 
cause of environment ; those horses 
degenerated and became mustangs 
because that was the very best con- 
dition that they could be in to adapt 
themselves to their surroundings." 
That may be true, but the argument 
does not hold good, because I took 
those very same horses, eating the 
same grass, drinking the same 
water, exposed to the same storm

and sunshine, and by the applica- 
tion of my own intelligence, my 
own judgment, I began to bring 
them back to the condition in which 
they formerly were, but that did not 
occur to those which man had neg- 
lected and to which he had given 
no attention. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I 
have reached this conclusion, and 
that is the thought which I desire 
to leave in your minds, that what- 
ever of development there is in the 
world, whatever of evolution has 
come, leading from lesser to 
greater things, from worse to better 
conditions, are the results of the in- 
telligence of God, as it is repre- 
sented in the only created thing that 
stands in his image in the world. 

' Desiring at one time in my life to 
know something of the rocks, of 
the earth upon which we live, as 
its conditions have been determined 
by scientific research, I went to a 
book store and purchased this little 
book, "Steele's Series in the Na- 
tural Sciences, Geology," a work 
written by J. Dorman Steele, au- 
thor of works in chemistry, physics, 
zoology, botany, astronomy, physi- 
ology and geology, a simple exposi- 
tion of the scientific truths known 
to the world at that time, a book 
which has been used in thousands 
of schools, a book with which many 
of my hearers will be more familiar 
than I, because I have never stud- 
ied it under the direction of a 
teacher, but I read and studied it 
with very great interest by myself. 
I did not expect at the conclusion 
to find what I discovered. I shall 
never forget the impression that the 
words of this man made upon my 
mind in his conclusion of this little 
work, and I want to read them to 
you because they are entitled to 
weight, coming as they do from a 



man of profound thought and great 
learning : 

"We have traced in the dim light of 
the past the history of our earth and 
its inhabitants. Everywhere we have 
found a Divine Hand shaping and 
moulding to accomplish a Divine 
ideal. 'In the beginning God.' We 
can add nothing to the old Hebrew 
declaration. We have gone back to 
the origin of man, and there, too, we 
have rested on that sublime truth, 'In 
the beginning God.' We have winged 
our imagination backward to the time 
when our earth was 'without form 
and void,' and here again we have felt 
the force of that same statement, 'In 
the beginning God.' 

"Was man created directly by God's 
fiat, ,or by some intermediate process 
of secondary causes? 'Alas for the 
impotence of science and the scope of 
our finite intelligence!' We bring the 
subtlest agencies to the accomplish- 
ment of our designs — heat, light, elec- 
tricity — but when we seek to develop 
from them even the intangible forces 
which clothe the decaying rock with 
verdure, or mantle the stagnant pool 
with slime, failure inevitably waits up- 
on us. In vain do we seek to as- 
sociate vital manifestation with elec- 
trical action, we may resolve the vital 
organism into cells and granules and 
nuclei, but the life eludes our proud- 
est philosophy. If, under certain 
conditions, inorganic matter assumes 
organic form, those conditions and 
the laws which govern them are alike 
unknown to us. And so we pause on 
the threshold of created life, and, 
standing reverently aside, lay humbly 
down our little wisdom as we recog- 
nize the unfathomable greatness of 
the one all-wise Creator." 

My brethren and sisters, the 
thought which I wish to leave with 
you is this, in your search after 
knowledge, in your desire to be- 
come profound, in your study of 
philosophy, do not lose sight of this 
one thought that God, the Creator 
of heaven and earth is the author of 
intelligence and all the light, and 
knowledge, and wisdom which has 
come to man or which will ever 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



come to him emanates from that 
source. Do not allow yourselves, 
because of the words of men, of 
cunning device and flattering words 
— they are here just as they were 
among the Nephites, to delude you 
and lead you away from the eternal 
truth, that we must recognize God 
our Father, who is the author of 
all things, the Creator of heaven 
and earth, to whom all men owe 
.deference, and allegiance, and 
service, whether they render it or 
not. Do not deny the atonement 
wrought out by his only begotten 
son. Do not become obscessed with 
the thought that this life is all there 
is to human existence, because it 
is a fallacy. I bear witness of it 
to you in all humility. I have tried 
to understand, I have studied, I 
have sought the Lord from my 
youth until the present time when 1 
am growing old. I find from my 
own observation, my own study, 
and the testimony which God has 
given me, the eternal truth of 
these things growing stronger and 
stronger, if that were possible. He 
has restored the truth to the earth 
through the agency of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith ; the fulness of the 
gospel is here; it is the power of 
God unto salvation and has in it 
everlasting life to all of those who 
believe and obey. 

May the Lord preserve us from 
delusions which are abroad in the 
land, fix faith firmly in our hearts 
that we may hold fast to the iron 
rod which is the word of God, and 
it will bear us safely through, until 
we find our way back into the pres- 
ence of our Creator, and then we 
will understand. Yes, there has 
been evolution, evolution will con- 
tinue until we shall become like him, 
knowing as we are known, seeing 
as we are seen, and comprehending 



that in all these wonderful works 
that are around us, the wisdom of 
God is manifest and that the laws 
by which they have been ac- 
complished are simple, and will be 
simple to us when we come to un- 
derstand them. 

The Lord preserve us all in the 
truth, keep us from the delusive 
snares of the adversary, I pray 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

went up into the Temple to Pray,"

knoweth no man, but the Spirit of 
God. 

"Now we have received, not the 
spirit of the world, but the Spirit 
which is of God; that we might know 
the things that are freely given to us 
of God. 

"Which things also we speak, not in 
the words which man's wisdom teach- 
eth, but which the Holy Ghost teach-

eth; comparing spiritual things with 
spiritual" (I Cor. 2:9-13). 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
suppose I also belong to that class 
of individuals to which Brother 
Ivins belongs, and perhaps it will 
be considered, by those who think 
they know, that I also am incapable 
of expressing intelligent thought in 
regard to that same subject, the 
origin of man. However, I have 
great confidence in the word of the 
Lord and I accept, without reserva- 
tion, these passages of scripture 
which I have read. I have also con- 
cluded that one can learn more and 
get nearer to the truth by heeding 
the testimony of the servants of the 
Lord and hearkening to the teach- 
ings of the Spirit of the Lord, than 
one can possibly clo by following 
the commandments and the teach- 
ings of men who have received their 
understanding and their learning in 
the spirit and in the wisdom of 
man. Therefore, I put my trust in 
the Lord, and what I speak I be- 
lieve I speak bv the Spirit of God, 
comparing spiritual things with 
spiritual. I believe that man is the 
offspring of God, that he was cre- 
ated in the beginning in the image 
of God and is in very deed his son, 
so far. at least, as the spirit is con- 
cerned. I wish to read in connec- 
tion with this which I have iust 
read, a few verses from the Pearl 
of Great Price on this same subject : 

"And behold, the glory of the Lord 
was upon Moses, so that Moses stood 
in the presence of God, and talked 
with him face to face. And the Lord 
God said unto Moses: For mine own 
purpose have I made these things. 
Here is wisdom, and it remaineth in 
me. 

"And by the word of my power, 
have I created them, which is mine 
Only Begotten Son. who is full of 
grace and truth. 



"And worlds without number have 
I created; and I also created them 
for mine own purpose; and by the 
Son I created them, which is mine 
Only Begotten. 

"And the first man ,of all men have 
I called Adam, which is many. 

"But only an account of this earth, 
and the inhabitants thereof, give I 
unto you. For behold, there are many 
worlds that have passed away by the 
word of my power. And there are 
many that now stand, and innumer- 
able are they unto man; but all things 
are numbered unto me, for they are 
mine and I know them. 

"And it came to pass that Moses 
spake unto the Lord, saying: Be mer- 
ciful unto thy servant, God, and tell 
me concerning this earth, and the in- 
habitants thereof, and also the heav- 
ens, and then thy servant will be con- 
tent. 

"And the Lord God spake unto 
Moses, saying: The heavens, they are 
many, and they cannot be numbered 
unto man; but they are numbered unto 
me, for they are mine. 

"And as one earth shall pass away, 
and the heavens thereof, even so shall 
another come and there is no end to 
my works, neither to my words." 

From this we learn that there has 
never been a time when worlds 
were not created and when heavens 
did not exist. And, furthermore, 
that the creation of heavens and 
earths by our eternal Father from 
the beginning, whatever that may 
mean, and throughout eternity, has 
been and is for the one grand pur- 
pose which is explained in the next 
verse following this which I have 
just read : "For behold, this is my 
work and my glory — to bring to 
r>ass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." 

There never was a time when 
there was not a world ; there never 
was a time when that world was not 
peopled with beings who were cre- 
ated in the image of God — his chil- 
dren fashioned after his own like- 
ness. Life is not spontaneous upon

this earth. It did not have its origin 
here ; it was planted here in its 
varied forms. This idea that every- 
thing commenced from a small be- 
ginning, from the scum upon the 
surface of the sea, and has grad- 
ually developed until all forms of 
life, the beasts of the field, the 
fowls of the air, the fishes of the 
sea, and the plants upon the face 
of the earth, have all sprung from 
that one source, is a falsehood abso- 
lutely. There is no truth in it, for 
God has given us his word by which 
we may know, and all who are led 
by the Spirit of God can under- 
stand through that Holy Spirit, the 
truth of these things. We know, 
for our Father in heaven has re- 
vealed these things unto us, that 
life has always existed. Tt existed 
long before it was planted here, and 
this earth, we understand, is pass- 
ing through a probation such as 
other worlds have passed through, 
and when it completes its earthly 
mission and fills the measure of its 
present creation, for it keeps the 
law that was given to it, it shall be 
sanctified and exalted. When that 
time comes it will be removed out 
of its present place as other worlds 
have been removed when they have 
filled the measure of their creation, 
and then another world will come 
and take its place. This procession 
will sro on, worlds without end ; so 
I understand from the reading of 
these scriptures. 

How foolish, how narrow, how 
contemptible it is for men profess- 
ing to be men of intelligence and 
possessing scientific knowledge and 
wisdom, to declare that all life upon 
this earth is spontaneous, and to 
confess that they know nothing of 
any life upon any other world. 
Moreover, to declare that the life 
here has all developed from the 



same single, simple source. It is 
true that all life does come from 
the same source, but that is not the 
scum of the sea, a jellyfish or a 
pollywog. God, our Father, is the 
creator of life and he placed life on 
this earth in varied forms, and also 
on other worlds. He will continue 
his work on this earth and upon 
other planets, or worlds, which will 
take the place of this earth when it 
has been exalted and gone on to its 
celestial glory. He will continue 
to bring to pass his purposes by 
peopling worlds and bringing to 
nass the immortality and eternal 
life of his children. Now I think 
this is a noble thought. I think it 
is something that will enlighten th° 
minds of men and buoy them up. Tt 
will strengthen our faith and give 
us encouragement to continue on in 
well doing, because it gives us hone 
of better things, even immortality 
and eternal life as the sons an 1 
^daughters of God. But this false 
theory, which prevails in the world 
so extensively, is one that is debas- 
ing and not ennobling nor uplifting. 

Here is another passage of scrip- 
ture I wish to read from the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, section 76, 
known as tbe vision — a vision given 
to Joseph Smith and Sidney Ri^don 
on the 16th day of February, 1832 : 

"And we beheld the glory of the 
Son, on the right hand of the Father, 
and received of his fulness; and saw 
the holy angels, and they who are 
sanctified before his throne, worship- 
ing God, and the Lamb, who worship 
him for ever and ever. And now. 
after the manv testimonies which have 
been given of him, this is the testi- 
mony last of all, which we give of 
him, that he lives: for we saw him. 
even on the right hand of God. and 
we heard the voice bearing record 
that he is the Onlv Begotten of the 
Father — That by him and through 
him, and of him the worlds are and 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

were created, and the inhabitants 
thereof are begotten sons and . daugh- 
ters unto God." 

This they beheld in vision, and it 
was revealed unto them that all man- 
kind upon the face of this earth and 
other worlds are the offspring- of 
God in the .spirit, but that Jesus 
Christ is his Only Begotten Son in 
the flesh. Now, this to me is con- 
sistent, it is reasonable; it is logical 
and it is true. The first life created 
for this world was not placed upon 
it at the time it was created. Let 
me read again ; this same thought 
is found in the account in Genesis 
in the Bible, but not ,so clearly ex- 
pressed as it is here, therefore, I 
will read from the Pearl of Great 
Price : 

"And now, behold, I say unto you, 
that these are the generations of the 
heaven and of the earth, when they 
were created, in the day that I, the 
Lord God, made the heaven and the 
earth. 

"And every plant of the field before 
it was in the earth, and every herb of 
the field before it grew. For I, the 
Lord God, created all things, of which 
I have spoken, spiritually, before they 
were naturally upon the face of the 
earth. For I, the Lord God, had not 
caused it to rain upon the face of the 
earth. And I, the Lord God, had 
created all the children of men; and 
not yet a man to till the ground; for in 
heaven created I them; and there was 
not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in 
the water, neither in the air." 

Now, I could continue to read — I 
shall not take the time — and show 
you that the creation that was made 
spiritually was in the same likeness 
of the creation that was later made 
temporally, when man, beast and 
plant were placed upon the earth. 
All were created before the founda- 
tion of this world was prepare' — 
created spiritually— and existed in 
the kingdom of God. When the 



earth was formed and ready to re- 
ceive them they were clothed with 
bodies that were physical and thus 
not only man, but the animals and 
the plants upon the face of the 
earth, became living souls, because 
they were composed of the spirit 
and the body combined. I like to 
believe this. 1 know it is true. It 
appeals to my reason, it appeals to 
my spirit, I accept it as the truth 
which God has revealed, and I re- 
joice in the knowledge that I have 
received regarding it. There is no 
theory in the world that can com- 
pare with it. These ideas of men, 
their foolish doctrines regarding 
the origin of life which are taught 
in many of the schools and against 
our protest very largely — and I am 
sorry to say, in too many cases 
without our protest, for I believe 
we ought to protest against these 
things — constitute the wisdom of 
uninspired men an r l must perish. I 
do not believe that the falsely called 
scientific theory of man's origin has 
any more right to a place in the 
public schools than the principles of 
the gospel of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ have — and not half as 
much ! 

Now, it may be true, and it is 
true, that Abraham as he sat in his 
tent, coukl not receive the news 
of the world published in the daily 
press and have it delivered to him 
at his door ; he could not push a 
button and turn on the electric light, 
but is that saying that Abraham 
was less intelligent than men are 
who dwell on the earth today? The 
truth of the matter is that these 
things were not intended for Abra- 
ham's day, and they would not be 
known and utilized today if the 
Lord had not revealed them to men 
and had not inspired men to make 
the discoveries which have been 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made, by which we are able to re- 
ceive the news as it is gathered 
from the telegraph and from wire- 
less telegraphy and have it printed 
by machinery which is run by elec- 
tricity. We can sit in our com- 
fortable homes and turn on the 
light by pressing a button ; we can 
read the public prints, and we will 
know what is going on today in all 
the world ; but does that prove 
that we today are more intelligent, 
or that we have greater under- 
standing than Abraham, than 
Moses, than Elijah, or any of 
the prophets of those early times, 
pertaining to those things which 
are most essential to the salvation 
of mankind? Not by any means ! I 
read in the scriptures, if I under- 
stand them correctly, that many of 
the prophets of old had opened to 
their vision scenes pertaining to the 
history of the children of men down 
to the end of time, and the Lord 
revealed unto them the conditions 
that would prevail in the earth in 
this generation. They saw, if I un- 
derstand the matter correctly, our 
automobiles, our railroad trains ; 
they saw, very probably, the com- 
munication that was taking place 
upon the face of the earth so won- 
derfully by wireless communica- 
tion, or by means of wires by which 
news is conveyed. They saw, I be- 
lieve, the airplanes flying in the 
midst of the heavens, because we 
can read in the prophecies of these 
ancient scriptures many things that 
indicate that these things were re- 
vealed unto those ancient prophets. 
But these wonderful discoveries and 
conveniences were not intended for 
their day. They could not sit in an 
automobile and travel from city to 
city, or in a railroad train, and ride 
comfortably, nor could they ride 
in a modern carriage drawn by 



horses, but upon the back of an ass 
would they journey from place to 
place, or walking by the side of 
their beast of burden they would 
travel a few miles each day and call 
it a day's journey. 

And yet the prophets saw the 
time in the latter days when an 
ensign should be lifted up that those 
gathering to Zion should come with 
speed swiftly; they should not be 
weary, neither should they be under 
the necessity of slumber, nor the 
loosing of their girdle or the shoes 
from off their feet. But these ad- 
vantages were not for their times 
and the customs and conditions 
which prevail now were held in re- 
serve, not because we are any better 
or more worthy than the Saints of 
former tim.es, nor because we have 
greater intelligence, but because we 
are living in the Dispensation of 
the Fulness of Times, when the 
Lord is gathering all things in one 
and preparing the earth for the 
»reat millennial reign, and, it is 
necessary now that all these dis- 
coveries, these wonderful inven- 
tions and conveniences should be 
made known to the children of men. 

Those who make these discov- 
eries are inspired of God or they 
would never make them. The Lord 
gave inspiration to Edison, to 
Franklin, to Morse, to Whitney and 
to all of the inventors and discov- 
erers, and through their inspiration 
they obtained the necessary knowl- 
edge and were able to manufacture 
and invent as they have done for 
the benefit of the world. Without 
the help of the Lord they would 
have been just as helpless as the 
people were in other ages. Abra- 
ham knew far more in his day re- 
garding the planets and the great 
fixed stars out in space than the 
greatest astronomer knows today.

How did he get his knowledge? 
Not through the telescope ; not 
through the spectroscope ; but 
through the opening of his vision 
by the Spirit of God. He was 
taught by the Lord himself who re- 
vealed unto him all these things and 
explained the great heavenly bodies 
and their workings, also the earth, 
in a manner that never has been ap- 
proached and cannot be approached 
by the scientific man with all his 
instruments to aid him and inspired 
by worldly learning, and don't yon 
forget it ! These ancient seers and 
saints were just as intelligent as we 
are. They were just as full of in- 
spiration. They had the Spirit of 
the Lord to guide them and were 
directed by it. They hearkened 
unto those things which God taught 
and they understood the truth and 
knew far more of that which is es- 
sential, in a minute, than some of 
these so-called scientists, who de- 
clare that life is spontaneous and 
commenced upon this earth, know 
in a year. 

Now this is my testimony. They 
may say I am incompetent. What 
do I care, as long as I know I have 
the truth, as long as I know that 
God has revealed unto me that these 
things which I have declared are 
true! What do I care what they 
teach, so far as my knowledge is 
concerned? I do care so far as the 
poisoning of the minds of the youth 
of Israel is concerned, and I protest 
against it. I have protested from 
this stand, and I expect to continue 
to protest, whether it does any good 
or not, at least with the desire to 
stir up the Latter-day Saints ; and 
I want to say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that it is your duty to 
seek for the light and the truth 
and the wisdom and the inspiration 
that come through contact with the 



Spirit of the Lord, that you may 
understand and know the things 
pertaining to the kingdom of God, 
and see things spiritually and com- 
pare spiritual things with spiritual. 
By so doing we may* understand all 
things which our Father in heaven 
has reserved for those who obey 
him. 

May God bless you, and all Israel 
and help us to walk in the light and 
seek the knowledge that we may 
lay a foundation in truth which 
cannot be overturned by the follies 
and theories of men, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

Three practical sermons — Save enough 
wheat for food and seed — Avoid 
speculators and invest your surplus 
in Liberty Bonds — Congregational 
singing, and selecting suitable 
songs. 

I have enjoyed the spirit of this 
conference more, I think, than any 
previous conference that I have 
ever attended. There are two or 
three items that I would like to 
briefly touch upon. 

We have been blessed with seed 
time and harvest and the earth has 
yielded in rich abundance, which is 
now being gathered by the farmers 
of our land. The Government has 
fixed the price at which wheat shall 
be sold. The Government has also 
issued instructions that no great 
amount of wheat shall he stored to 
be held for future use. But I be- 
lieve it is the part of wisdom that 
our people should be counseled that 
they .should not dispose of all the 
wheat they have, but save at least 
enough for seed for the fall and 
spring planting and also sufficient 
quantity for bread, at least until an- 
other harvest. If we are not care- 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ful, pretty much all of the wheat 
that we have raised will be shipped 
out of the country, and before next 
fall we will probably be importing 
flour from Minneapolis — if we can 
get it. So, my brethren and sis- 
ters, see to it that you retain enough 
of the wheat you have raised, for 
seed, and for food, that not only 
you yourselves may be fed by it, 
but that you may have sufficient to 
feed the communities in which you 
reside ; so that if you have an extra 
loaf or an extra pound or two of 
wheat more than you yourselves 
need, it will provide food for the 
poor, or for people who have to buy 
from you, and I feel sure the Gov- 
ernment would not wish you to do 
otherwise than to care for those of 
your own household and of your 
own community. Probably that will 
do for one sermon. 

One other point. People this 
year, in every activity, whether on 
the farm or the ranch, in sheep or 
cattle or who are merchandising, 
have been blessed with unexampled 
prosperity in a temporal way. 
Brother George Albert Smith called 
attention to that fact last night in 
the priesthood .meeting, and very 
wisely advised the people to take 
care of what the Lord is now giving 
them, that which he is putting into 
their hands, and not allow it to be 
wasted in foolish speculations. He 
called attention to the fact that 
speculators would be after you in 
great number with every sort of 
scheme to allure you to investing 
money whereby you are sure to get 
rich quick. The oil man will show 
vou where there are great fortunes 
in oil, and the coal man will make 
you rich from coal, and the rubber 
man has got fortunes for you in 
rubber, if you will only listen to 
him, and the gas man can prove 



there are millions in natural gas ; 
and it is a fact that that kind of a 
promoter usually has a good flow 
of natural gas himself. So there 
are fortunes for you everywhere if 
you will only invest in these wild 
schemes, part with your money and 
get rich quickly. We read that the 
fellow who parts quickly with his 
money is not very wise. 'The fool 
and his money do not stick together 
very long; they are soon parted, 
and all these promoters, so many 
of them coming around now in this 
year of your greatest prosperity, 
to separate you from your money. 
Well, don't you let them do it. And 
you sisters take my advice — as the 
phrase is, "take it from me" — don't 
allow your husbands to separate 
themselves from their money and 
put it into something they don't 
know anything about. But if you 
have a little surplus money — and 
you will have it with the prices now 
paid for grain and hay and potatoes 
and sheep and cattle and wool, and 
for all products of the soil, you will 
have considerable surplus — let me 
tell you what to do with it. If you 
have $100 surplus, buy a Liberty 
Bond. You can't lose on that. That 
is good for all time, and if you 
want to go to a bank you can bor- 
row money on it more than you can 
in proportion on your own farm, 
because on your farms the insur- 
ance companies and other loaning 
companies, including the banks, will 
not loan more than about 50 per 
cent, of the land's value. But if 
you have a little surplus money and 
put it into Liberty Bonds, the banks 
will advance you a much larger per- 
centage than they will on your land. 
So I repeat the good words of ad- 
vice offered by Elder George Albert 
Smith last night. Don't allow these 
men to separate you from your 



BISHOP CHARLES IV. NIRLEY. 



75 



money. Hang on to it. Put it into 
something- that you know will do 
you some good. Put it into some- 
thing that you yourselves know 
something about. That is another 
sermon. 

Now just one minute more. I 
would like to encourage the idea in 
our wards and stakes of this 
Church, and also outside of the 
Church, of that which is being en- 
couraged in the east very exten- 
sively, and that is community sing- 
ing, congregational singing. I do 
not object to solos. We had some 
here this morning — never any bet- 
ter anywhere in the world. They 
were very fine. I love to hear them. 
But solos may be overdone. As a 
rule people love to sing. There is 
something in the spirit of song 
when you can get the people to join 
in it, even though some of us can't 
sing so well, that gives forth an in- 
spiration which cannot be otherwise 
found. When we all sing together 
there is a spirit, an influence and 
a power— an inspirational power — 
that goes with it, that fires the soul 
in a way that it can't otherwise be 
touched or fired. So this spirit of 
comradeship, which the war is very 
largely responsible for in the east, 
has taken hold of the people, and 
they are getting together all classes 
of nationalities, blending together 
their voices and singing patriotic 
songs and other songs. 

Especially in our congregations 
of the Saints, we .should have more 
of congregational singing. We 
should bring our hymn books to 
meeting with us and then sing, have 
everybody sing, and .everybody will 
feel the better for it. And let me 
advise our leaders of choirs — if I 
may presume that much — to try 
when they do have selections in 
"Mormon" meetings, that they 



choose such selections as fit the oc- 
casion. A number of the leading 
brethren attended a meeting some 
time ago, at which meeting I was 
present, and the brother who was 
presiding had a slip of paper in his 
hand. I happened to sit next to 
him. There were these prominent 
brethren of the Church at a Latter- 
day Saint meeting, although there 
were quite a number present who 
were not Latter-day Saints, but it 
was a "Mormon" meeting for 
"Mormon" purposes. I looked over 
his list of songs on the paper that 
he held in his hand, which had been 
handed to him by the choir leader, 
and not one of them had the least 
reference to "Mormon" thought, 
"Mormon" ideas, or "Mormon" 
anything about it. Well, I don't 
believe that is just right. 

I have seen, too, some of our 
brethren, leaders of choirs, select a 
soloist who will come forward — 
someone with a good voice, who is 
capable of good singing — who will 
get up in a "Mormon" meeting and 
commence to sing "My Rosary." 
Well now, "My Rosary" is fine 
music and a good song for a Cath- 
olic meeting, but it is entirely out of 
place in a "Mormon" meeting. That 
song recites how "I count my beads 
and kiss my cross," and all that so.rt 
of thing. Well, I don't do either, I 
don't believe in doing either, and 
you don't believe in it. So a song 
like that is entirely out of place in a 
"Mormon" meeting, as much so, I 
think, as it would be to sing "We 
thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
to guide us in these Latter days," 
in a Catholic meeting. 

Then I have heard a soloist 
brought in who would sing a song 
entirely at variance from our re- 
ligious thought. Perhaps it would 
be the song "Without One Stain," 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the idea being that "Jesus has done 
everything; he has cleansed me; I 
haven't done anything myself, but 
I am going right up without one 
stain." I have thought: Yes, you 
will! Not if He knows it, you 
won't. There are too many stains 
on people who have not by sincere 
and heartfelt repentance cleansed 
themselves from stains. Such a 
song, therefore, is entirely out of 
place in a "Mormon" meeting. And 
you will hear, as one of the brethren 
suggests, the song about "The 
Beautiful Isle of Somewhere." 
Well, yes, that is in line with the 
same thought. They do not belong 
and should not have place in our 
meetings. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
my time is up, I see, and this is my 
third sermon. Let us have more 
of community singing, congrega- 
tional singing. Let us sing songs of 
Zion. They carry with them a spirit 
and an influence, not only in "Mor- 
mon" meetings, but in others, 
that cannot be found anywhere else, 
and they thrill the soul as nothing 
else will touch it and thrill it. In- 
vite our neighbors to our meetings 
that they also may enjoy the spirit 
of song with us. God bless you. 
Amen.

PRIMARY EXHIBIT 

I am reminded that the Presi- 
dency and the Twelve were invited, 
yesterday, by the Presidency of the 
Primary Association, to visit the 
exhibit of the handiwork of the lit- 
tle children for the benefit of af- 
flicted soldiers. The exhibit is 
placed in the upper, large room of 
the Bishop's building, and I am sure 
Sister Felt and her associates will 
be pleased to have any of the breth- 



ren and sisters who desire to see 
what is being done by the children, 
in the Primary work, to call and 
visit them. 

A duet and chorus was sung by 
Sarah Hood and James H. Neilson 
and the Tabernacle choir, entitled, 
"I waited for the Lord." 

The closing prayer was pro- 
nounced by President Richard W. 
Young of the Ensign stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 
2 p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting of the con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., presided over by President 
Seymour B. Young, of the First 
Council of Seventy. The singing 
was by the Jordan stake choir. 

The choir sang, "The morning 
breaks, the shadows flee." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Soren Rasmussen, of the Jordan 
.stake presidency. 

The choir then sang the anthem, 
"Come let us sing unto the Lord," 

ELDER S. E. WOOLLEY. 

(President of the Hawaiian Mission.) 

I rejoice in meeting with you 
this morning. And I bring greet- 
ing from the Saints in Hawaii to 
the Saints gathered here in confer- 
ence. They are very much inter- 
ested in the work here, as they are 
there. And they love to get the 
reports of conference and to know 
the mind and will of the Lord given 
out in these assemblies for our 
guide. They love to read the .ser- 
mons when they are published, to 
keep in touch with the work as it

progresses in the earth. I rejoice 
with them in having the privilege 
of meeting in this conference, and 
listening to the servants of the 
Lord, his anointed, give us that 
bread of life that all Latter-day 
Saints should hunger and thirst for. 
For we read in the scriptures that 
faith cometh through hearing the 
word of the Lord, and that is the 
object of our meeting together from 
time to time, that our faith may be 
renewed and strengthened. 

I have rejoiced from the begin- 
ning of this conference up to the 
present moment in the testimonies 
that have been borne. This to me 
has been a wonderful conference 
because of so many faithful, hum- 
ble, honest testimonies borne. I be- 
lieve that we need more testimony 
in the Church. I believe that our 
young people need the testimony of 
those who have had more experi- 
ence. I have noticed in my experi- 
ence for a number of years that 
when teaching classes, and we fail 
to get the attention of the class, if 
we will turn and bear testimony to 
that which we know, we get the at- 
tention of the class, because when 
we bear testimony, under the guid- 
ance of the Spirit of the Lord, it 
enters into the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men. 

It has been my good fortune to 
labor most of my days among the 
Hawaiian people. I went to Hawaii 
in December, 1880, under the in- 
struction and call of President John 
Taylor. I remember well Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith set' me apart 
to that mission, and among other 
things he promised me that I should 
learn the language, and that the 
food of our people in that land 
would be sweet to me. And should 
I tell you that when I went to Ha- 
waii, just turned 21 years of age, 



I weighed 119 pounds, and now, 
nearly another hundred above that? 
The food of that land has been 
sweet to me, so you that have boys 
and girls, young men and young 
women called to that mission, do not 
worry about the food. It is good 
and wholesome. I wish we had 
some of it in this land. 

I have labored among the Ha- 
waiians mostly since 1880. I have 
presided over the Hawaiian mission 
a little over twenty-two years, and 
I feel that I am in a position to 
speak of that nation or people. I 
know them and they know me, and 
I love them because of their in- 
tegrity, their love for the truth, 
their honesty of purpose, their faith 
and devotion ; and oftentimes I en- 
vy some of our local elders in their 
prayers, both in the family prayer 
and in their devotional exercises, 
because I feel that they get near 
unto the Lord in prayer. They 
are a prayerful people; they wor- 
ship the Lord. It is true that there 
are many who are weak, as we find 
in all other nations ; but as a nation 
they are a God-fearing people. And 
they believe in God ; they believe in 
prayer, and they are devotional in 
their natures, sweet and lovable, 
and I love them, too, because God 
loves them. 

We may go back to the history of 
that mission to when President 
Young sent a company of elders 
there, in 1850, only a short time 
after they came to the Valleys of 
the Mountains. Among them was 
George O. Cannon, the boy of the 
company. The Lord raised him up 
and made him mighty in that land, 
and the people of today speak of 
him as one of the mighty men, be- 
cause of the work that" he did in 
that land in that early day. The 
Lord through him gave that people 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the history of their forefathers, the 
Book of Mormon. We find among 
the different nations where the 
Lord has raised up men to translate 
the Book of Mormon, under the gift 
and power of God, while others 
have been allowed to translate the 
Bible. The Book of Mormon was 
brought forth through the power of 
God by Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
who when young was made equal 
to that task of translating and giv- 
ing that book in English. The 
translation of the Book of Mormon 
from English to Hawaiian is almost 
as perfect. The translation is per- 
fect, but there are a few typograph- 
ical errors in part of it, but very, 
very few indeed, not nearly so many 
as we find in the Bible, showinsr the 
care taken in handing that book 
down through the 'different nations 
of people. It is wonderful to me 
how the Lord has raised up men to 
do this work. President Cannon re- 
ceived the language so that he could 
sneak fluently to the people within 
.three weeks or thereabouts after 
arriving. President Smith was able 
to talk Hawaiian, administer the 
c acrament, conduct meetings, bao- 
tize. confirm and oHaiti. and preach 
to the people within ninetv davs. 
p"d about two weeks out of that 
time he was sick in bed with a 
fever. Men in that nation as well 
as in other nations have been raised 
no to preach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

When President Cannon first 
went to Hawaii a dissatisfaction 
had arisen among: most of the 
eh'ers. Thev had thought that they 
were eoine; to an English-sneaking 
people, but thev found so few for- 
eigners the President of the mis- 
sion decided to vacate and to sro on 
to some other land, which he and 
other elders did. The president 



wrote to Elder Cannon, who was 
then upon Maui, one of the islands 
of the group. In going to those 
islands, in passing that island of 
Maui, he said in his heart, "I hope 
I am assigned to that island," and 
when they drew lots he drew Maui ; 
and upon that island, at the little 
village of Lahani, he received the 
letter of the president of the mis- 
sion saying he might return. He 
went up into the woods back of 
the home where he was living, and 
he poured out his soul unto the 
Lord, to know what to do. He felt 
g-rieved in spirit to think of return- 
ing or leaving the land when the 
President of the Church had called 
him to go there. While thus pray- 
in? the voice of the Lord came to 
him. and spoke to him as one man 
soeaketh to another, and told him 
that if he would remain and be 
faithful the Lord would lead him 
to a people who would receive his 
testimony. The next day he went 
around on the west side of the 
island, a long journev on foot ( there 
were no horses in those davs upon 
the islands, or verv fewL and as he 
neared the town of Wailahu he fell 
into the stream. Those of you who 
knew President Cannon knew him 
as a bashful man, and I presume 
verv bashful when a younar man. 
And he felt so ashamed to think he 
was all wet that he decided to re- 
turn to Lahani. and as he went out 
of the stream that same voice told 
him to keep on his fournev, and not 
return, that the Lord would lead 
him to those who would receive his 
testimony. And he went, after drv- 
ine his clothes in the sun : and as 
he came into the village of Wailahu 
a voting ladv was crossing the 
street, and she said in Hawaiian. 
"Here is a foreigner." or "Here 
comes a foreigner." It was no un- 



ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 



79 



common thing to see foreigners 
then because that was headquarters 
for the whalers of the north, where 
they put in for winter, and it was 
remarkable that she should single 
him out and call to her father, 
"Here comes a foreigner.'' And it 
brought the father, who was a high 
chief, and his two attendants out 
to the gateway. And when Presi- 
dent Cannon saw those three men. 
he knew them ; they were the three 
men he had seen in vision, and who, 
the Lord had shown, would receive 
his testimony. And then began the 
work in the Hawaiian mission. 
President Cannon informed the 
president of the mission that he 
could return if he wished to, but 
he. President Cannon, would re- 
main and do his duty, which he did. 
And at the home of this young 
man, Nefele, (who was the first 
Hawaiian that ever came to Utah 
and received the blessings in the 
Endowment House, went back and 
died there, a good, faithful Latter- 
day Saint), the work began in that 
land. The Lord opened the way, 
and the Lord was desirous that 
President Cannon, the youngest of 
the company, should be the instru- 
ment in his hands of opening the 
mission in that land in that early 
day. Since that time there have 
been converts made by the thou- 
sands and tens of thousands. Presi- 
dent Smith, who has been interest- 
ed in that mission always, went 
there when he was a young boy, 
and performed his first mission ; 
learned the language and earned 
the confidence, love and respect of 
the people. 

In the administration, too, of 
President Joseph F. Smith, the 
Lord moved upon him to build a 
temple in that land, as you have 
already heard. Now that temple is 



nearing completion, and I believe it 
is in fulfilment of the promise that 
the Lord made to Lehi who, as you 
will read in the Book of Mormon, 
in blessing his son Joseph, promised 
him that all of his seed would not 
be lost. I believe the Lord led a 
part of the Nephite people, or a 
colony of them, to those islands. 
When some of the Nephites were 
migrating to the north under Ha- 
goth, the great Nephite ship-build- 
er, some of their vessels were lost, 
he reported. They may have been 
swallowed up in the deep or they 
may have drifted out to other lands, 
but were never heard of since. Now 
T believe the Hawaiian people were 
a part of that colony of Nephites 
that were migrating to the north, 
and the vessels became disabled and 
the natural current of the ocean 
carried them to Hawaii. Then we 
have the tradition of the Samoans 
that they came from Hawaii to New 
Zealand. So I believe that the Lord 
hid. them up there, and in his own 
due time he sent his servants there 
in an early day in our history, be- 
cause he loved them, and to fulfil 
his promises, which he always does. 

We feel very grateful that the 
Lord has moved upon his servant, 
the President of the Church, to 
build a temple in that land, and that 
is a fulfilment of prophecy, because 
when that land was chosen and de- 
cided upon as a gathering place for 
that people of Hawaii there was a 
committee chosen consisting; of 
President Joseph F. Smith, William 
W. Cluff and Alma Smith, and they 
reported favorably upon the island 
of Laie. However, as Brother Cluff 
was walking down the seashore 
early one morning; while upon that 
mission, the Prophet Brigham 
Young appeared to him and said to 
him, "This is the place, and upon 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



this land we will build a temple 
unto our God." That was away 
back in 1864. I am thankful that 
that temple is now nearing comple- 
tion. I am thankful that I have 
been called to labor there so long, 
and that through our carefulness 
we have been able to build that tem- 
ple out of the funds that we have 
gathered from time to time. I want 
to say in favor of the good people 
of Hawaii that they have now 
raised over $30,000 toward the erec- 
tion of that building; and at the 
headquarters at Laie — most of the 
people think it is a city, it is only 
a little village, about 450 all told — 
in that village alone the little Pri- 
mary organization which numbers 
a little over 100 has raised over 
$1,000 toward the temple so far, 
and the Relief Society has raised 
over $1,250 — between that and $1,- 
300. Organizations of the other 
branches have done well. The 
branch of Honolulu has raised per- 
haps between $4,000 and $5,000. 
Thus the spirit of this work is mov- 
ing upon the people, and notwith- 
standing this large amount of 
money that they have collected for 
the building of the temple the tith- 
ing has increased about 30 per cent 
during the last nine months, and 
they have met every other obliga- 
tion. And they dress just as well 
as you dress, and they appear just 
as well, and they are progressing. 
They love the truth, and I hope 
when that temple is finished and 
dedicated and accepted of the Lord 
that they will be prepared to go in 
' and receive their blessings. W e are 
trying to teach them along these 
lines, and they are growing in wis- 
dom, in faith and in the knowledge 
of the truth, and therefore we love 
them for their integrity. 

Now I want to say to the fathers 



and mothers who have boys and 
girls there upon missions, Don't 
worry about them, they are in a 
good land and among a good peo- 
ple. Rumors get out sometimes of 
little isolated happenings, and the 
people imagine that they are a com- 
mon thing, while they are not. You 
know some people like to publish 
things that are uncommon, and for- 
get all about those things that are 
common. I was talking with 
Brother Jenson just before meeting 
about some of these things. If there 
is an accident we notice it; we 
never think of the tens of thousands 
of people who never have an acci- 
dent. Tf we are sick a day, we ever 
remember it, but we forget those 
days in which we enjoy health and 
strength. These little things are 
impressed on our minds, and I can 
say that sometimes people in writ- 
ing about those things that are not 
common occasion a wrong impres- 
sion. Any way, the Hawaiian peo- 
ple are a hospitable people, and 
have given the elders the best they 
have, and they have a warm soul 
that makes you feel welcome. They 
are kind hearted in the extreme. 
Therefore your missionary boys 
and girls are all right, and their 
parents here do not need to worry 
about them. We are trying to take 
?ood care of them, and guard their 
health, and instruct them how to 
live so that they will be efficient and 
be able to accomplish their labors. 

I rejoice in the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I rejoice in the testi- 
mony that I have. I am not tired 
of the work. I expect to go back 
to Hawaii, and continue there as 
long as the brethren want me. I 
started out that way when I was a 
little boy, and I hope I will have the 
integrity and faith to continue. It 
is the desire of my heart to keep 



ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 



81 



the commandments of God. I know 
they are true. They came from 
God. They are for us or they never 
would have been revealed in this 
dispensation. It is for us to keep 
the commandments of God, to walk 
in the path of virtue and righteous- 
ness, and to uphold and sustain the 
principles of the gospel, because 
they are the power of God unto 
salvation. There is no other way, 
no other road, to eternal lives ex- 
cept the road that the Lord has 
marked out; and when he says, 
"Come, follow me," it means that 
you and I should follow him, not 
only in faith, not only in repentance 
or in baptism, but in all other things 
that we are called upon to do, even 
if we are called upon to lay down 
our lives. If we give our lives to 
the service of the Lord, we are fol- 
lowing the Christ, the Lord. That 
is what I want to do. We should 
be faithful and true and honest be- 
fore God that we can look one an- 
other in the face without being 
ashamed. 

I believe that we are gaining 
ground in Hawaii. We are gain- 
ing prestige as in every other part 
of the world. This work is going 
on; no power can stop it. It will 
continue to go on until it fills the 
whole earth, and we ought to be 
satisfied in our stations. If we are 
called to go to Hawaii, let us go 
and be faithful and true. Some say 
it is an awful sacrifice that we are 
making. I do not feel that way. I 
feel that it is a grand blessing. I 
appreciate it. I appreciate the con- 
fidence of those who have called 
me. I appreciate the support of 
President Smith, which he has al- 
ways given me since he set me 
apart to that mission, and to every 
mission that I have been called to 
fill so far, J rejoice that I have tried 



to do my duty, and I rejoice that 
we are doing so well in Hawaii, and 
I hope that the Lord will continue 
his blessings with the pgople of 
Hawaii as well as all other peoples. 
The Lord is no respecter of per- 
sons. We have some Chinese who 
have joined the Church, who are 
good and faithful and true. They 
are just as lovable as any other peo- 
ple. We have a few Japanese also 
who have become members of the 
Church, and they are true and faith- 
ful. We have many half castes, 
half Chinese and half Hawaiian, 
who seem to be among our very 
best, faithful and true; and I fee! 
that we are doing a good work. We 
have a number of Japanese em- 
ployed upon the plantation at Laie, 
and their children are attending the 
Sunday school, the Primary and 
other organizations. Some of them 
have been baptized, and are true 
and faithful, and they weep to think 
that their fathers and mothers can- 
not see the truth; but there will 
come a time when these little chil- 
dren who have joined the Primary, 
and finally have coaxed their par- 
ents who were out of the Church to 
consent to their baptism ; and after 
a while they will bring their 
fathers and mothers to be baptized, 
fulfilling the scriptures that "a lit- 
tle child shall lead them." So we 
rejoice in getting the people's chil- 
dren into the organizations, because 
after a while their hearts will be 
converted. There was a time in 
in Hawaii when the wealthier chil- 
dren, and those of the old "mission- 
ary" stock were very sarcastic, and 
they used to turn away from us ; 
they would hardly speak to me. 
These people take their hats off to 
me now, and say, "How is your 
work progressing? How is the 
temple getting along?" 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Wherever we have built a tem- 
ple in the Church it has softened 
the hearts of the people, and it is 
so in Hawaii, and I look for an in- 
crease of conversions in the near 
future, because people are becom- 
ing more favorable, and they want 
to know, as they put it, "What do 
you, people believe in ?" We have 
gone along quietly. A few years 
ago we were building some perma- 
nent improvements. One promi- 
nent man, with whom I had done 
considerable business, came along 
and said : "Mr. Woolley, it looks 
like you are preparing to stay." I 
told him, "We will be here after 
you are all gone." He said, "It 
looks liks it." It is true, the Church 
lias come to stay. The Lord has 
promised it. It is his work, and. it 
will go on forever and ever. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, and 
bless all, help us to be faithful and 
'urn our hearts towards the truth, 
that we may all live the truth. I 
want to bear my testimony to you 
that the people of Hawaii are of 
the pure blood of Israel, and they 
ire a good, faithful, pure people, 
and when you hear any other thing 
said of them, don't believe it. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful and true, I ask in the name of 
jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

This has been one of the most in- 
teresting conferences to me that I 
ever attended. Perhaps I can con- 
sistently assign as a reason for this 
that so many historical events have 
been alluded to and so much has 
been said concerning record-keep- 
insr that has appealed to me ; and I 
feel impressed, after listening to the 



historical and interesting discourse 
of President Samuel E. Woolley of 
the Hawaiian mission, to say a few 
words in regard to history-making 
and record-keeping, and explain 
briefly, if I can, how we all are in- 
debted to history for what we know 
concerning God, our eternal Father, 
and his dealings with mankind in 
times that have passed. 

I hold in my hand one of the 
standard works of the Church 
called The Pearl of Great Price, 
and I find that this little book gives 
us some important historical infor- 
mation concerning the creation of 
the world and other things, in ad 'i- 
tion to that which is containe'1 in 
the Bible. In the second chapter, 
(in the Book of Moses), I read 
concerning- the creation of the 
world the following : "And it came 
to pass that the Lord spake unto 
Moses, saying, Behold I reveal unto 
you concerning this heaven and this 
earth ; write the words which T 
speak." The Lord then proceeded 
to reveal to Moses the history of 
the earth upon which we live, and 
Moses wrote it. Bv this means not 
only Moses, but all of us who are 
permitted to read the words that 
Moses wrote after the dictation of 
the Lord himself, came to an under- 
standing of how the earth was 
formed or created, and later on why 
it was formed. It tells us that we 
were intelligences or spirits living 
with God our Father, and that the 
Lord looked out into space and 
said : "We will go clown, for there 
is .space there, and we will take of 
these materials, and we will make 
an earth whereon these [God's chil- 
dren] may dwell ; and we will prove 
them herewith to see if they will do 
all things whatsoever the Lord their 
God shall command them" (Book 
of Abraham 3:24, 25). That was 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



83 



the beginning of the earth on which 
we live. 

Take the Bible, both the New and 
the Old Testaments, and you will 
find that it is the historical part of 
it that makes us wise unto salvation, 
as much so, perhaps, as that which 
we call the Prophets or the Psalms, 
or anything else contained in the 
books : for this reason, that if we 
were not posted historically, and 
did not know under what circum- 
stances these sayings were made, 
we would never comprehend them, 
and they would consequently do us 
but very little good. Through read- 
ing Bible history we learn some- 
thing about the children of Israel, 
how they spent forty years in the 
wilderness, and how they finally 
crossed the Jordan and reached the 
promised land. Reading further, 
we learn something about the stat- 
utes and commandments which the 
Lord gave unto ' the children of 
Israel, and how they prospered for 
a season in the promised land. Thus 
knowing their history we under- 
stand the meaning of the predic- 
tions of their prophets and their 
fulfilment. 

Next we may consider the Book 
of Mormon. Here we find that the 
very first line written in that sacre ' 
volume is history commencing as 
follows : "I Nephi having been 
born of goodly parents," etc. And 
so Nephi commences to tell about 
his parentage and the beautiful his- 
tory of his father Lehi who had 
"'dwelt in Jerusalem all his davs," 
and how Lehi was commanded by 
the Lord to lead his family to this 
land (America), whence even the 
Hawaiians have come, of which we 
have heard something todav. The 
historians among the Nephites were 
very diligent' in keeping records. 
Yet, on a certain occasion Christ 



himself drew attention to an im- 
portant omission in their records. 
I will read the following from the 
Rook of Mormon (3 Nephi, 23, 7 
to 13 inclusive) : 

"And it came to pass that he [Jesus] 
said unto Nephi, Bring forth the rec- 
ord which ye have kept. 

"And when Nephi had brought forth 
the records, and laid them before him, 
he cast his eyes upon them and said, 

"Verily I say unto you I com- 
manded my servant Samuel, the La- 
manite, that he should testify unto 
this people, that at the day that the 
Father should glorify his name in me. 
that there were many saints who 
should arise from the dead, and 
should appear unto many, and should 
minister unto them. And he said unto 
them, were it not so? 

"And his disciples answered him 
and said, Yea, Lord, Samuel did 
prophesy according to thy words, and 
they were all fulfilled. 

"And Jesus said unto them, How be 
it that ye have not written this thing, 
that many saints did arise and appear 
unto many, and did minister unto 
them ? 

"And it came to pass that Nephi re- 
membered that this thing had not 
been written. 

"And it came to pass that Jesus 
commanded that it should be' written; 
therefore it was written according as 
he commanded." 

Referring to modern revelation 
given in our own time we learn that 
when the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was organized, on 
the 6th day of April. 1830, with six 
members, the very first thing God 
told his servants after the organiza- 
tion was the following: "Behold, 
there shall be a record kept among 
you" (Doc. and Cov. 21:130). The 
Lord did not neglect the importance 
of record-keeping. I have some- 
times thought that on that occasion 
he remembered the important his- 
tory of the past, and the apparent 
neglect in recording events at the 
time they took place in the days of 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Savior. We cannot, of course, 
tell exactly what was originally 
written by those who were asso- 
ciated with the Christ in his minis- 
try in Galilee, Samaria and Judea, 
but this much we do know, that 
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John 
did not write the histories or gos- 
pels attributed to them until forty 
or fifty years after the events nar- 
rated by them had occurred ; and 
for good and sufficient reasons 
learned men in the Christian world 
have during the past eighteen hun- 
dred years been trying to harmon- 
ize these four gospels, which in 
quite a number of instances seem to 
be more or less contradictory or in- 
accurate. The narratives were ap- 
parently written from memory 
many years after the events record- 
ed took place. Consequently there is 
in the gospels mentioned a lack of 
important dates in relation to the 
ministry of the Savior and the early 
events connected with the Christian 
Church. In opening the Dispensa- 
tion of the Fulness of Times in our 
day the Lord seems to guard 
against the repetition of what was 
an apparent neglect centuries be- 
fore, for the very first command- 
ment the Lord gave to his Church 
as an organized body in our day 
was, as stated, in regard to record- 
keeping, and Oliver Cowdery was 
appointed to be the first recorder of 
that Church which by divine com- 
mand and authority was established 
upon the earth through the instru- 
mentality of Joseph Smith the 
Prophet. When Oliver Cowdery 
subsequently was called to another 
work, a special revelation was given 
through Toseph the Prophet calling 
John Whitmer. one of the eight 
witnesses to the Book of Mormon, 
t.i be a regular Church historian. 
He was commanded to write and 



keep a regular history and assist 
Joseph Smith in transcribing "all 
things which shall be given you" 
(Doc. and Cov. 47:1-4). And the 
Lord said further: "And again I 
say unto you that it shall be ap- 
pointed unto him to keep the 
Church records and history contin- 
ually."- Had this not been a matter 
of great importance, the Lord, it 
seems to me, would not have com- 
manded it. 

If it were not for records and 
historians, we would have no Bible, 
we would have no account of the 
ministry of John the Baptist or of 
Jesus Christ. We would have no 
Acts of the Apostles. We would 
have nothing except vague tradition 
in regard to Christianity as it was 
established upon the earth 1800 
years ago. If it were not for his- 
torians, we would never have had 
the Book of Mormon. We would 
not have known much that could be 
relied on as truth about Joseph the 
Prophet. We would have had some- 
thing handed down to us in a more 
or less vague and unreliable form. 
With all respect to our old veterans 
with their grey hairs, and their un- 
questioned honesty — those who try 
to relate interesting narratives con- 
cerning Joseph the Prophet and the 
early days of the Church — -can not. 
with all their endeavors relate facts 
iust as they happened : they find it 
impossible to do so correctly, when 
it comes to details. Their memory 
does not permit them to tell the 
perfect, accurate story. But we 
can use their stories by comparing 
them with the records of the 
Church written by Oliver Cowdery.

also in our day an apparent neglect 
in record-keeping. Interest seems 
to have been lost to a great extent 
at present in regard to the history 
of this most wonderful people, the 
Latter-day Saints. Let me here in- 
terpolate that there has never been 
another such a people upon the 
earth since it was first created. I 
make no exception to this far-reach- 
ing assertion. We have read about 
the Israelites in the Old Testament, 
the early Christians in the New 
Testament, the Nephites upon this 
continent in the Book of Mormon, 
and many other peoples who have 
dwelt upon the face of the earth in 
various ages. All these people had 
their experiences in their day and 
generations, but they are no more 
in existence ; history tells us that 
their activities at length came to an 
end. But the dispensation to which 
we belong will, according to prom- 
ise, he continued forever. We shall 
as an organization remain in exist- 
ence throughout all time to come, 
and it will be just as President 
Woolley has said that we shall be 
here after every other religious de- 
nomination shall have ceased to ex- 
ist. Earth itself may pass away, 
or undergo a radical change, when 
cleansed by fire, but the Church of 
Jesus Christ shall no more pass out 
of existence, for out of this Church 
organization shall eventually grow 
the kingdom of God, over which 
Christ shall reign as the King of 
kings and Lord of lords. 

And now I desire to say a few 
words in regard to the labors per- 
formed of late years at the His- 
torian's Office, and give a little ad- 
ditional information on the matter 
which President Anthon H. Lund 
alluded to in his address delivered 
in the first session of this general 
conference. We have been very 



busy at the Historian's Office, and 
also on the outside, gathering to- 
gether and putting into shape that 
which will form the basis of the 
authentic history of the Church. 
Some of us have traveled in all 
parts of the world gathering his- 
torical information for that pur- 
pose, and during these journeys 
most important data have been 
collected and thousands of records 
have been perused. Records have 
been kept from the beginning both 
at Church headquarters, in the dif- 
ferent missionary fields, and in the 
stakes of Zion, but in many in- 
stances they have been kept imper- 
fectly. Even John Whitmer, the 
first Church historian, was not 
faithful in his special calling very 
long. He apostatized and when he 
left the Church he refused to give 
up the records he had kept to the 
proper Church authorities ; hence 
for a number of years we did not 
have the full records concerning the 
days of Kirtland and Missouri. On 
one of my special missions to the 
East I was prompted to go to a 
certain place in Missouri, where I 
found the old Whitmer record. I 
succeeded in obtaining a complete 
copy of the same which contains 
some important data in addition to 
that which the Church already had. 
The Whitmer record is not very 
lengthy, but it covers a period of 
Church history of which we cannot 
learn too much. I may here add 
that we have obtained from other 
odd sources of information many 
things of a historical nature which 
ha^e since proved to be of great 
value. For this I feel truly thank- 
ful, because the sources of such in- 
formation are now in some in- 
stances closed. Many of those who 
were alive forty or fifty years ago, 
and who could give us valuable in- 



86

formation then, are with us no 
more, and in other instances records 
from which we made gleanings a 
long time ago have since been de- 
stroyed or lost. 

We have endeavored to go back 
to the beginning. We have live! 
long enough and labored long 
enough to be convinced of this fact, 
that events which originally seemed 
trivial and unimportant at the time 
they happened have, as years rolled 
on, become matters of the greatest 
importance, owing to the great re- 
sults that in many instances came 
from small beginnings. Referring 
to the beginning, for instance, there 
wasn't much stir in the Unite 1 
States when six men quietly assem- 
bled in the attic story of Father 
Peter Whitmer's log house in the 
little obscure village of Fayette, 
Seneca county, New York, on that 
now memorable day, April 6, 1830 ; 
but look at that event now in the 
light of history. How many thou- 
sands of people are not now deeply 
interested in that little meeting in 
which the Church to which we be- 
long was first organized ? When 
the Church was very small, even its 
early members did not pay much at- 
tention to a number of common- 
place incidents that happened. 
When Brigham Young became a 
convert to the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph, no one except those 
immediately concerned paid any at- 
tention to it, but as the Church grew 
and President Brigham Young be- 
came one of the greatest pioneers 
and leaders that the world has ever 
known, then we began to look' at 
President Brigham Young's conver- 
sion to "Mormonism" as a matter 
of unusual importance, and so with 
many other things because of the 
great results that followed. Conse- 



quently we historians of a later day 
naturally go into the history of the 
Church deeper than those historians 
who have preceded us. We have 
gone over the same ground that 
was covered by Willard Richards, 
George A. Smith, and other his- 
torians, and have added a great 
many details that had been over- 
looked by them, or considered mat- 
ters of so little importance that they 
were given no place in Church his- 
tory. Thus we have, from the ear- 
lier records kept in the different 
branches and organizations of the 
Church and from thousands of let- 
ters and documents on file, culled a 
vast amount of historical informa- 
tion that had not hitherto been con- 
sidered worthy of record. We have 
gone over some of these old rec- 
ords repeatedly and have also en- 
tered into the study of the records 
kept in the various organizations 
and branches of the Church in its 
missionary fields, throughout the 
entire world, and in some instances 
we have had to lay the very founda- 
tion historically for some of our 
missions. For instance, when I vis- 
ited Hawaii, in 1895, I did not find 
anything at all in the shape of of- 
ficial documents pertaining to that 
mission for the first ten years of its 
existence. All the public records 
which had been kept prior to the 
Gibson episode had been lost, but 
with much patience and labor we 
went to work gathering from old 
letters, and the files of the Deseret 
News, material which, when put to- 
gether, forms a very acceptable rec- 
ord pertaining to the founding of 
the Hawaiian Mission. We have at 
the Historian's Office already up- 
wards of 700 large volumes, of 
manuscript history completed. We 
do not expect any one of you ever 
to read all of these lengthy manu- 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



87 



script histories, but they are all very 
important as works of reference. 
These volumes and the many that 
hereafter will be added may con- 
sistently be termed the "fathers" of 
the new dispensation, and be classed 
with the so-called "fathers" of the 
early Christian Church. We have 
recorded nearly everything that has 
happened since the organization of 
the Church, in 1830, under proper 
date; and we are still recording- 
events as they occur daily, just as 
regularly as the sun rises and sets, 
and as the Church is now repre- 
sented in nearly all parts of the 
world it may be said that we his- 
torians make a journey around the 
world once in twenty-four hours, 
not physically, of course, but in our 
minds, and in our researches. This 
compilation of historical events is 
what we call the Journal History of 
the Church. 

In addition to that we have gone 
into the great world-field, as it were, 
and have undertaken to write a sep- 
arate history of every mission that 
has been established in any part of 
the world, together with its con- 
ferences and branches. This has 
meant for me personally two com- 
plete trips around the world. Once 
I went west and returned from the 
east and thus lost a day of my short 
span of life; and when I had occa- 
sion to go around the globe a sec- 
ond time I started east and came 
back from the west thereby regain- 
ing the day I had lost on my first 
tour of circumnavigation. My jour- 
neyings were chiefly in the interest 
of Church history. Following in the 
wake of the missionaries who had 
preceded me, I succeeded in obtain- 
ing much valuable information 
from many different sources, and in 
addition to that I gathered up thou- 
sands of records which had accu- 



mulated in the various missionary 
fields and sent them to Church head- 
quarters, where they are now safely 
stored in the Historian's Office. 
Many of these records are in my 
estimation worth their weight in 
gold to the historians and also to 
the Church at large. 

We have also gone into the dif- 
ferent stakes of Zion for historical 
purposes, and we have gathered 
material for and written the history 
of every stake more or less com- 
pletely, commencing with the or- 
ganization of the stake at Kirtland, 
Ohio, the stake in Missouri, the 
stake in Nauvoo, Illinois, etc., and 
we have continued this work down 
to the present time, but more par- 
ticularly to the close of the Nine- 
teenth Century. Even all the stakes 
of Zion as they are now organized 
have had attention. And we have 
done more than that. We have 
gone into the details of every bish- 
op's ward in the Church, and as we 
now have about eight hundred such 
organized wards in the different 
stakes of Zion, the work is im- 
mense, and we have paid attention 
to all of them, particularly the older 
ones. Thus we have written the 
history of every settlement of the 
Saints in the Rocky Mountain coun- 
try, extending as they do from 
Mexico on the south to Canada on 
the north. We have visited every 
nook and corner in the mountains 
and have gathered and written 
something in the shape of history of 
everything that has an existence 
within the meaning of Church or- 
ganizations. I believe I can say 
truthfully that no organization dat- 
ing back to the Nineteenth century 
has been entirely neglected, though 
in some instances we have been en- 
abled to write much better histories 
than in other cases, owing to the 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



difference in the sources from 
which we have obtained informa- 
tion. 

In most of the wards we have 
also written histories of the Relief 
Societies, Sunday Schools, Young 
Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Associations, Primary' 
Association, Religion Classes, etc., 
not to speak of the various quorums 
of the Priesthood, bringing the his- 
torical thread down to the close of 
the century. Thus we have been en- 
abled to give proper credit to the 
faithful members of the Church 
who have labored in the different 
quorums and auxiliary associations 
from the beginning. In doing this 
vast labor our chief aim has been to 
obtain accurate data and write his- 
tories that are absolutely true and 
reliable in all their details. But we 
shall not be satisfied with our labors 
until we have made one more visit 
to all the stakes and wards through- 
out the Church for the purpose of 
reading to the old settlers, and all 
others who are interested, that 
which we have written, in order to 
insure accuracy and correct all pos- 
sible errors that may have crept in. 
In this our next visit we look for a 
full-hearted response and co-opera- 
tion on the part of all the people. 
Let no one, no matter how busy 
they may be with other things, let 
the opportunity pass, but meet with 
us and become convinced, so far as 
they are able, to lend aid and assist- 
ance, that the histories made con- 
cerning them and their settlements 
are correct. 

In our work of revision we de- 
sire to guard particularly against 
errors in names. I have frequently 
said that my hair turned grey be- 
cause of the difficulties I met with 
in my historical labors in finding 
out the correct names of the breth- 



ren and sisters concerned in the his- 
tories that I was writing. My hair 
from my childhood days being 
somewhat flaxen in color, I did not 
anticipate that it would ever turn 
silver grey, but it did, and I think 
it was partly due to the fact that I 
met so many people in my travels, 
— intelligent people, too — who did 
not seem to know their own names. 

Let me explain further. The 
whole history of the Church is as a 
matter of course based upon the ac- 
tions and experiences of men and 
women who have taken more or less 
active parts in public matters, both 
at home and abroad. We have tried 
to give these faithful men and wom- 
en due credit in their own names, 
and have endeavored to rule out 
nick names, pet names, abbreviated 
names or initials, misspelled names, 
and names of foreigners who on 
their arrival in this country have 
anglicized their original names and 
thus have become known as differ- 
ent individuals. The changing and 
corruption of names have been a 
matter of much annoyance to the 
historians, as we often have met 
with men who while filling missions 
abroad would be known by one 
name and while filling positions at 
home in the wards and stakes of 
Zion would be known by some other 
name. Now, this is all wrong. A 
person should endeavor to have 
everything he does in the interest 
of his own as well as the public 
good credited up to his own name, 
and not alienate himself from the 
works of his life by giving credit 
to some myth or to something that 
cannot be identified. Let me sug- 
gest to you, brethren, when you fill 
a mission, that you fill it in your 
own name. When you pay your 
tithing or donations, pay it in your 
own name, and when you fill any

89 



office or position of any kind what- 
ever, see that your own name is 
given the credit for the same. We 
may need all the credit we can get 
when we appear before the right- 
eous judge of all. There should not 
be the least deviation in the writing 
of names for historical purposes, 
and let me say to all : Do not go 
through the world with a pet name 
or a nick name ; use your real name 
invariably, especially for public pur- 
poses — the name you had given you 
when you were blessed by the elders 
of the Church as little children, 
which name at that time undoubt- 
edly became a matter of record. 
This means more to you than you 
perhaps imagine, though you may 
think it is merely a technical mat- 
ter ; but let me assure you that it 
means your very identity as an in- 
dividual, historically. If you insist 
to go through life with false or cor- 
rupted names, you will undoubtedly 
regret it. For historical purposes 
"Harry" should never be substitued 
for "Henry," nor "Lizzie" for 
"Elizabeth," "Bob" for "Robert," 
"Dick" for "Richard," "Polly" for 
"Mary," etc., and family names 
should be scrupulously guarded. We 
do not like to see the beautiful 
Swedish name of "Soborg" changed 
to "Seamountain" nor "Jorgensen" 
to "Yorgason." Natives of Ger- 
many, Scandinavia, Holland and 
other foreign countries should re- 
tain the original way of spelling 
their names, and also, if possible, 
the pronunciation ; otherwise their 
identity may become lost and be 
ruled out of history altogether. No 
matter how many positions you 
have filled in the Church, or how 
much good you have done in life, 
it will not count to your credit in 
the records kept in mortality, un- 



less you do what you do in your 
own name. We cannot afford to 
falsify the records. Yet in some in- 
stances this has been done to such 
an extent that I sometimes wonder 
if the angels themselves will know 
who we are. 

In conclusion I desire to impress 
you with the importance of keeping 
individual records. The public 
records are in many instances well 
kept and preserved, but in other in- 
stances they are imperfectly kept 
and not preserved at all. In such 
instances the parties interested may 
lose their credit, unless they have 
kept individual records, to which 
reference can be made. If we have 
been called by the Lord to labor in 
his vineyard, and thus been priv- 
ileged to take part in this great Lat- 
ter-day work, it is but proper and 
right that history should give us 
credit. I therefore suggest to you 
all, brethren and sisters, that you 
be not afraid or be too modest to 
make records of your own. In say- 
ing this I appeal to all of you who 
are old enough to understand what 
I say. Remember the old saying, 
"that what you do yourselves is 
sure, but what you trust to others 
may prove disappointing;" also "if 
life is worth living, its deeds are 
worth recording." So let us keep 
individual records. If you cannot 
keep a daily journal, like some of 
us, who have kept journals nearly 
all through life, then write at least 
some of the most important events 
of your lives. Some of you old 
veterans that I now see before me 
will, like myself, pass away before 
very long, but before going to the 
great beyond write down some of 
the experiences you have had in 
your life with good ink and on good 
paper, that it may be left for your 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



posterity. This will serve a better 
purpose to perpetuate your memory 
than a costly stone monument, and 
by doing this it may be said of you, 
as was said of Abel of old, "though 
dead, he yet speaketh." 

Among our many other 'duties, 
brethren and sisters, let us therefore 
remember this essential duty of rec- 
ord-keeping. In the midst of our 
busy lives do not let us be too mod- 
est nor too negligent, to record 
some of the things the Lord has 
permitted us to do in connection 
with his great latter-day work. I 
believe it would be perfectly right 
for us to overcome our modesty or 
negligence to such an extent that 
we record something about our- 
selves, and not rely altogther upon 
the angels above us "who are silent 
notes taking of every action," re- 
membering that we mortals do not 
have access to the records made 
above. 

Joseph Smith the Prophet, in one 
of his letters to the Church, said : 
"Whatsoever you record on earth 
shall be recorded in heaven ; and 
whatsoever you do not record on 
earth shall not be recorded in heav- 
en" (Doc. and Cov. 128:8). While 
this was written originally in ref- 
erence to baptism for the dead, it 
can apply, I think, to record-keep- 
ing altogether. 

Then, brethren and sisters, en- 
deavor to make records for your- 
selves, and aim to become true and 
accurate historians at the same time, 
not forgetting that we should all 
live lives and perforin deeds worthy 
of recording. God bless you. 
Amen.

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of the Eastern States 
Mission) 

To be privileged to attend this 
conference has been the opportu- 
nity of my life, I am so thankful 
for the spiritual blessings that have 
been poured out in the instructions 
that we have received during this 
conference. When I left New York 
1 thought, Well, I am going to the 
service station now where my spir- 
itual batteries shall be recharged. 
I think of all features associated 
with these gatherings, the most 
important and essential is the spirit 
of which we partake, and which we 
are expected to take, not only to 
the stakes and wards of Zion, but 
out to the frontier, in the missions 
of the Church. 

It is not enough to draw inspira- 
tion from the congregations who 
have gathered together; but I sin- 
cerely ask an interest in your faith 
and prayers, that if the Lord has 
any message to deliver to you 
through me, his humble servant, 
that we shall not be disappointed. 
I feel incorhpetent to occupy this 
position by virtue of the innate sta- 
bility which I may possess, but 
rather I feel like Joseph, that son 
of Jacob who, when he was taken 
from the dungeon to interpret 
Pharaoh's dream, bowed his head 
in meekness before his Maker and 
before King Pharaoh, and said, 
"It is not in me, yet God will give 
Pharaoh an answer of peace." 1 
find in holy writ accounts of great 
men whom we regard as having 
lived very close to their heavenly 
Father, men who have enjoyed the 
abundance of inspiration from God 
our Father. They, too, have felt 
the weakness which I sense this

morning. Jeremiah, that great 
prophet whose record has been 
handed down to us in the Old Tes- 
tament, prayed thus : "O Lord, 1 
know the way of man is not in him- 
self. It is not in man that walketh, 
to guide his steps aright." I also 
find Enoch, who was very faithful 
before the Lord at all times, utter- 
ing these words after he had been' 
called to a very important ministry : 

"A,nd when Enoch had heard these 
words he bowed himself to the earh 
before the Lord, saying, Why is it 
that I have found favor in thy sight, 
and am but a lad, and all the people 
hate me; for I am slow of speech, 
wherefore am I thy servant? And 
the Lord said unto Enoch, Go forth 
and do as I have commanded thee, 
and no man shall pierce thee. Open 
thy mouth and it shall be filled, and 
I will give thee utterance, for all flesh 
is in my hands, and I will do as seem- 
eth me good. Say unto this people, 
choose ye this day to serve the Lord 
who made you. My spirit is upon 
you, wherefore all my words will I 
justify; and the mountains shall flee 
before you, and the rivers shall turn 
from their course, and thou shalt 
abide in me, and I in you, therefore 
walk before me. And the Lord spake 
unto Enoch, and said unto him, 
Anoint thine eyes with clay, and wash 
them, and thou shalt see. And he did 
so. And he beheld spirits that God 
had created; and he beheld also things 
which were not visible to the natural 
eyes; and from thenceforth came the 
saying abroad in the land, a S-eer hath 
the Lord raised up unto his people." 

It was, perhaps, this same feel- 
ing which possessed the boy whom 
we have learned to regard no longer 
as a "boy prophet," but rather the 
great American Prophet Joseph 
Smith, when, before he was fifteen 
years of age, he felt his incapabil- 
ity to serve God in and of himself. 
Retiring to a wood not far distant 
from his father's home, looking 
around him to make sure that he 



was unobserved by curious eyes, he 
knelt down and for the first time 
in his life uttered a solemn though 
simple prayer to God for light. His 
soul had been stirred by religious 
sentiment through attending revival 
meetings which were carried on in 
his neighborhood. And as he knelt 
and prayed to God, the power of 
darkness attacked him. He was 
thrown violently to the earth until 
he despaired of his own life. By 
superhuman, aye, that spiritual, 
power which was accentuated by 
the assistance of his heavenly 
Father, he prayed that the powers 
of darkness might be dispelled. 
And so it was, for he saw at noon- 
day, coining through the trees of 
that sacred grove, a light surpass- 
ing the brilliancy of the sun, in 
which shaft of light he saw God the 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ. 
Then, with a childlike appeal, he 
said, "Which of all the churches 
and denominations shall I join?" 
The Father of the spirits of all men, 
pointing to the younger personage, 
said, "This is my beloved Son ; 
hear him." Such was the command 
given by God at the scene of trans- 
figuration when, through spiritual 
ecstasy, those who accompanied the 
Master in the mountain, said : "Let 
us build three temples, one for thee, 
and one for Moses and one for 
Elias." The voice of God spoke 
and said : "This is my beloved Son 
in whom I am well pleased ; hear 
ye him." If the world would heed 
that injunction of God the eternal 
Father there would be but one 
Church upon the earth today. They 
are not hearing Jesus Christ, but 
they are prating about "believe in 
the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and 
thy house shalt be saved." 

Isolated texts have been taken

creedal religions have been based, 
while the greater part of the scrip- 
tures have been brushed aside as 
being worthless, and only parts of 
the religion of Jesu/s Christ Ire- 
tained. We, too, believe and hold 
that sincere belief in the Lord Jesus 
Christ is essential, but if that is all 
that is essential, as many aver, then 
1 ask our Protestant friends, Where 
is the excuse for your existence as 
a Church? because I understand it 
has been an essential teaching of 
the Catholic church that belief in 
the Lord Jesus Christ is necessary, 
and if that is all that is necessary 
all of the added ceremonies, the 
,>omp and show of the Catholic 
church which became so heavy that 
it broke of its own weight, is atoned 
for in the acknowledgment of Jesus 
Christ. But something else is 
needful. Those who claim that be- 
lief in the Lord Jesus Christ is all 
that is necessary, are making a 
claim which I am prone to believe 
they do not believe themselves. 
Martin Luther broke from the rule 
of the Catholic church because of 
a difference in something else than 
belief in the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
yet we have various sects and de- 
nominations claiming that belief in 
the Lord Jesus Christ is all that is 
necessary. What would you poli- 
ticians, if there are any here, you 
Democrats, what would you think 
of a member of your persuasion 
who says, "I believe in the princi- 
ples of democracy," and yet who 
refuses to give his support to the 
party by going to the polls and vot- 
ing? What would you Republicans 
think of such a man who has no 
more faith and devotion to his party 
than to say, "I believe these prin- 
ciples are the true principles of 
civil government, but I refuse to 
vote"? 



We believe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ as no other people upon the 
earth believe in him. He himself 
proclaimed the utter uselessness of 
that individual who said, "Lord, 
Lord," and did not the things which 
he said. 

How shall we apply that princi- 
ple of belief in the Lord Jesus 
Christ? How do you say that it is 
essential? It is the measurement, 
not the thing measured. It is the 
schedule, but it is not the train. It 
is the formula, but it is not the 
mixture. For example : Questions 
arise respecting baptism, one say- 
ing that sprinkling is baptism, an- 
other that pouring is baptism, an- 
other, that one must be baptized 
three times kneeling in the water, 
and going down face foremost ; and 
another, that baptism by immer- 
sion, both standing in the water, is 
baptism. Now in this maelstrom of 
contention which shall we believe? 
Athenasius, the father of the Ath- 
enasian creed, John Wesley, the 
father of the Methodist church, 
John Calvin, the organizer of the 
Presbyterian church, Henry VIII, 
the founder of the Episcopal church 
— which are we to believe? 

Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
what he says of it, and you shall 
be saved. When Paul and Silas 
were miraculously delivered from 
that Philippian jail, and the jailer 
was about to commit suicide, fear- 
ing that he had lost his charge and 
would be censurable before the 
king, told what he must do after 
earnest inquiry, to be saved ; he 
had his own philosophy, the pagan 
philosophy. He was worshiping 
false gods, and when he fell at Paul 
and Silas' feet, and was about to 
worship them, he was enjoined to 
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, 



ELDER WALTER P. M ON SON.

not upon Paul or Silas, not upon 
pagan philosophies. 

Let that be the beginning — the 
rule by which all disputes shall be 
settled, believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and not make it the end 
of our faith. Make it the rule by 
which we shall measure our faith 
and integrity to heaven and heav- 
en's law. When the word came 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
"This is my beloved Son, hear him," 
it spoke volumes as to what should 
come. God is the God of revela- 
tion, and that he speaks by the 
voice of truth, and that men and 
women whose lives are ever actu- 
ated by that Spirit of God which 
has been so abundantly poured out 
in this conference, that they, too, 
shall have the revelation of the 
Lord. 

The world look upon us Latter- 
day Saints as being children led by 
a Pied Piper to destruction, and 
that we have not minds to think 
for ourselves. I want to tell you 
that there is no people upon the 
face of this earth with whom I 
have come in contact in all my eight 
and a half years of missionary work 
who are as free to think and act 
for themselves as are the Latter- 
day Saints. I really believe there 
is a shiver runs through the nether 
regions when some of our Christian 
brethren begin to think for them- 
selves. 

Instead of being led astray by 
creeds and by man-made religions, 
let them stand upon their dignity 
and hear what Jesus Christ says. 1 
maintain that the spirit of revela- 
tion is to be enjoyed not only by 
the prophet, seer and revelator of 
the Church, but by all faithful mem- 
bers also. Inasmuch as revelation 
comes by the Spirit of God — by the 
Holy Ghost that was to testify of 



Jesus Christ, and that Spirit is in 
the hearts of all the faithful chil- 
dren of God, if they are faithful, 
and if actuated by that Spirit of 
revelation which directs the life of 
the prophet, seer and revelator of 
the Church, they, too, will have the 
authority to give the word of reve- 
lation in things pertaining to their 
charge. 

When the President of the 
Church speaks, revelation comes to 
us, our souls are surcharged with 
that Spirit, and we say amen to 
whatsoever the Lord speaks. 

My soul is glad in the opportu- 
nity that I have in attending this 
conference, and of mingling my tes- 
timony with such grand, good men 
as those who stand at the head of 
this Church. I know, too, that they 
are men who are upheld and sus- 
tained by the power of the true and 
living God, and that those who crit- 
icize them can compare in no meas- 
ure with the lives of those who 
stand at the head of this dispensa- 
tion. I used to think, when a child, 
what a pleasure it would have been 
to associate with the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, with Brigham Young! 
I had the pleasure when a child of 
meeting President John Taylor, 
and have been acquainted with ev- 
ery president of the Church since. 
To be associated with this great 
missionary movement and feel that 
I am willing to give my life for it, 
if need be, along with such men as 
President Joseph F. Smith, and 
President Anthon H. Lund and 
President Charles W. Penrose with 
whom I stood shoulder to shoulder 
and preached the gospel in Great 
Britain, I assure you is an unspeak- 
able pleasure to me. I wonder if 
my children will be appreciative of 
their father's association with these 
men who have presided over the 



«4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church when the greatest advance- 
ment of this people have been 
achieved. 

I bear you my testimony that I 
know as I know who is my father 
and mother, that the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is true. I know that 
they are my father and mother be- 
cause of the fatherly and motherly 
love that they have extended to- 
ward me in my childhood and all 
through my life, the wholesome 
counsel and advice that they have 
given me, as I also know that the 
gospel is true because of the appli- 
cation of the laws and the saving- 
promises made through obedience 
to the gospel, by which I have been 
brought to know more and more of 
the transcendent joys brought to 
my heart, than even those that have 
come through my earthly father 
and mother. To prove my love for 
God's work I am willing to leave 
father and mother, houses and 
lands, wife and children for the 
kingdom of God's sake. 

I hope that the youth of Zion 
may realize the responsibility that 
rests upon them in carrying the 
gospel to the nations of the earth, 
for there are thousands who are 
praying, Cornelius-like, for the 
truth. 

My experience in the Eastern 
States mission has led me to be- 
lieve, and I bring this to you, that 
there are thousands of men in gov- 
ernmental affairs, as well as men in 
financial and other prominent posi- 
tions of trust who are thoroughly 
converted to the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I count them among 
my dearest friends, and when T 
have needed friends, they have ex- 
tended their hands to me and said, 
Brother, I will help you. 

May you carry the spirit of this 



conference into your homes. May 
we all rejoice in being permitted to 
be born in this day and age of the 
world when the cornucopia of heav- 
en has been poured out and the 
blessings of heaven both temporal 
and spiritual, have been showered 
down upon us all. 

May the blessings of the Lord be 
upon us, and in our hearts. May 
our greatest sermons be spoken in 
our daily lives. God bless you all, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(Late President of the Mexican Mis- 
sion.) 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
that the time is far past, and I 
merely desire to bear testimony to 
the fact that I know that the gospel 
is true ; I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God. 

I testify to you that I know that 
Joseph F. Smith is inspired of the 
Lord for the work that he has to do. 

May the Lord help us follow the 
counsel of our leaders, these men 
of God, and to live according to the 
gospel, and have a burning testi- 
mony of it always in their hearts, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem, 
'Mighty Jehovah." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Rey L. Pratt. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

An open air meeting was held in

ELDER JOHN W. HART. 

(President of the Rigby Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters and 
friends: To say that I am sur- 
prised to be called upon to occupy 
this position this morning, I assure 
you is putting it very mildly. I am 
here because I was sent, and I be- 
lieve that it is the duty of every 
Latter-day Saint to do their bit in 
the furtherance of the cause of this 
great Church to which we belong, 
just as it is for us to do our bit 
when we are calle 1 upon to defend 
the Nation in which we live when 
it is in trouble. 

I trust that I may be strength- 
ened by the Spirit of the Lord. I 
can assure you that I feel fortified 
with the knowledge of those of my 
brethren who are here to assist in 
this service this morning, and I 
know that the Lord will bless them 
and us all, and that we will feel that 
our coming together has not been 
a failure, even if we are called upon 
to hold our services in the open air. 

I was impressed with the opening 
address of the President of our 
Church, at our conference, and the 
addresses of our brethren who fol- 
lowed. The theme advance! by 
them has been in my mind for some 
time, that we should pay our re- 
spects, show our loyalty, extend our 
appreciation to those whom the 



Lord has placed in authority over 
his Church and over his people in 
the dispensation in which we live. 
I am thankful for the great men 
who preside over the Church now. 
I am grateful for the President, for 
his Counselors, for the Twelve, for 
the Presiding Bishopric, for the 
Presidents of Seventies, and all 
good men who have spent so much 
of their time in the interests of hu- 
manity ; I know that it is fitting and 
right that we should express our 
feelings and our minds along this 
line while those brethren are with 
us, and not wait until they have 
passed beyond. Therefore, I bear 
my testimony to the goodness of 
these men, to the efficient admini- 
stration that they are giving this 
great Church and the people of the 
Lord who have embraced this gos- 
pel. 

I come from the Rigby stake of 
Zion, a stake situated in southern 
Idaho. When I went there some 
twenty-one years ago, I found a 
wilderness, a desert. Practically on 
the very spot that was desert at that 
time, three weeks ago it was our 
pleasure to have with us President 
Smith, President Lund, President 
Grant, and Bishop Nibley, to assist 
in dedicating a new stake tabernacle 
that we built last year. This build- 
ing seated, and we had present at 
our afternoon session, 2,755 people, 
where 25 years ago was nothing but 
sagebrush. I mention this, my 
brethren and sisters, that you may 
know that Zion is growing and 
spreading ; and this is only one of 
the stakes out of probably 15 others 
so organized in that great state of 
Idaho, adjoining Utah on the north. 

I am proud to be a Latter-day 
Saint, I am proud that the Lord has 
blessed me with sufficient courage

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and faith to be true to its principles, 
to be true to the cause. I have al- 
ways taken great pleasure, and have 
been delighted whenever an oppor- 
tunity has presented itself to me to 
explain unto my fellow men the 
principles of life and salvation that 
have been revealed to us in this dis- 
pensation. 

It was only a short time ago, 
while visiting in the state capital in 
the state of Idaho, that a very 
prominent man came up to my 
room, one with whom I had the op- 
portunity and privilege of serving 
in the state senate in Idaho, a man 
highly educated. He came up to 
my office, not with a view of talk- 
ing religion, but I presume he came 
to talk politics. We had not pro- 
ceeded very long until our conver- 
sation drifted upon those topics, 
and the first thing he said to me 
was, "Senator, don't you know that 
there is now being a persisent ef- 
fort put forth in this state by a cer- 
tain religious organization to con- 
trol its politics?" I said, "Sena- 
tor, I am surprised to hear that 
statement ; I thought the only fear 
that was contained in the hearts of 
the citizens of Idaho of any Church 
controling the politics of our state 
was the 'Mormon' Church." "O," 
he said, "you are mistaken." 

That opened the conversation. I 
asked him what religion he pro- 
fessed. He said he was a member 
of the Christian Science Church. I 
told him I was gald to know that, 
that I knew a great many people 
who were broad-minded who were 
members of that church, and I was 
glad to know that he belonged to 
that organization. 

He told me what a wonderful 
lecturer appeared in the capital city 
last year, and he explained the God 
they worship, and he said, "I took 



one of your members up and intro- 
duced him to him after the services 
were over, and he said he thought 
the talk was very nice, but he did 
not understand the kind of God 
that had been portrayed to them 
during that service." I said, "No, 
he would not understand that, be- 
cause you believe in an immaterial 
being as your God. A,s Latter-day 
Saints — 'Mormons,' as we are 
known — we believe that God is a 
material being, an exalted, im 
mortal man. He was once as we 
are, and it is possible for us to at- 
tain to the heights that he has now 
attained ; and we base our faith on 
the circumstance that transpired in 
the death, crucifixion, and resur- 
rection of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ. When he came forth, 
there were evidently people on the 
earth, his followers, who did not 
have a correct understanding of 
this being we call God, and before 
Jesus left, it was his will, that his 
■disciples should know what kind of 
a being God was, that when Christ 
should leave them he might leave 
them united with regard to this 
great principle, because we are told 
that in order to obtain eternal life 
we must know Jesus Christ the Son 
of the Living God,' and we must 
know God the Father, before we 
can intelligently and consistently 
worship him. I turned to the Bible, 
and, by the way, I always carry my 
Bible and other Church works with 
me, I have them in the hotel 
now, though I don't always 
read them. T always feel forti- 
fied when I have them with me. 
I got my Bible, and I read to him 
where the Savior appeared to his 
disciples, and told them to bring 
meat and give him something to 
eat; and he did eat and drink with 
them, and invited them to come for-

ward and put their fingers in the 
holes in his hands, saying, "Handle 
me, because a spirit hath not flesh 
and bones as ye see me have." 

"Now," I said, "you may see 
that there were evidently people 
then, even in the days of Christ, 
who were with him personally, who 
entertained the same views errone- 
ously, as you and a great many oth- 
er conscientious people do, concern- 
ing the kind of being that God is. 
Thomas was not present, and rfe 
was not satisfied to accept the testi- 
mony of the other disciples, hence it 
was necessary that the Savior come 
and present himself to Thomas 
that he might also understand. 

And when I finished with him, he 
turned to me and said, "I am sur- 
prised. I never knew there was 
anything like that in the Bible. You 
certainly have some substantial evi- 
dence on which to base your the- 
ory." 

He asked me what I thought 
about the incident of Christ upon 
the cross, when the thief acknowl- 
edged him and Christ promised 
him, "Today shalt thou be with me 
in paradise." 

"How do you explain it?" he 
said. I said, "Let the Apostle 
Peter explain that to you." The 
thief did not go to heaven as mod- 
ern Christians claim that he did, 
but to a place of departed spirits, 
as the Savior did during the three 
days that his spirit was separated 
from his body. 

I referred to several other things, 
but he was called away before we 
finished our conversation. About 
three weeks after, I received a let- 
ter from him something like this : 
"My dear Mr. Hart, The little con- 
versation that we had on topics in 
the hotel during your visit in Boise 



has made one of the greatest im- 
pressions upon my mind of any- 
thing I have known in the religious 
line yet, and I am anxious to know 
more about your gospel and doc- 
trine." 

1 mention this, my brethren an 1 
sisters, to show that it is our duty to 
be alert at all times, ready to defend 
this great cause, because the Lord 
lias entrusted it to our care, and 
placed the responsibility on our 
shoulders. I want to testify to you 
that I have never lost anything in 
this way, in any shape or form. I 
have never lost my standing among 
my non-"Mormon" friends on ac- 
count of defending at all times the 
Church to which we belong. I 
want to say to you that you never 
will. May the Lord bless us in this. 
This is my testimony to you, and in 
it I have always taken great pleas- 
ure. 

I pray the Lord to bless us that 
we may be valiant in the cause, that 
we may be brave and willing to 
meet all people, and defend this 
cause in which we have enlisted, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 

(President of the Bear Lake Stake.) 

This is certainly a very inspiring 
audience assembled in the open air 
at this meeting, and I pray, for the 
few moments that I stand before 
you, that T may enjoy the inspira- 
tion of our heavenly Father. 

At every conference of the 
Church there seems to me to be 
some special message to the Saints, 
and at this conference, the thought 
that has come to me is this, that in 
our day we have prophets of God. 
who speak the mind and will of 
God to the people, and that we 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should hearken unto them. We 
read in the ancient scriptures that 
one, a very wise man, said that a 
prophet is not without honor save 
in his own country. How true this 
is! It is as true today as it v/as 
when it was first spoken. When I 
heard the testimonies of our leading 
brethren, concerning the prophets 
of this dispensation and their min- 
istry, this thought came to me, that 
now, when some of the modern 
prophets are dead, we are begin- 
ning to look to their words and 
take heed, while probably in the day 
in which they were spoken, they 
were not heeded to such an extent. 

Tt is a very strange thing that in 
order that we shall pay respect an'! 
reverence for the prophets of God, 
that they must be ancient or must 
have lived hundreds of years ago. 
We will go to the scriptures and 
read what the prophets have said 
thousands of years ago, and ponder 
over their words and try to under- 
tand what was meant by what they 
said ; and yet today, when the 
prophets speak to us, we do not 
take that same care, and we do not 
pay that same reverence to their 
words. This is a human failing, 
and I take it that the word of the 
Lord to the people today is this, 
"Hearken unto the words of the 
prophets of God who are among 
you. Listen to their warning voice, 
for they speak the word of God 
just as truly as did the prophets of 
old." 

The Latter-day Saints today are 
reading the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants probably to a greater ex- 
tent than it has ever been read. 
Why? Because they are just be- 
ginning to find out that God re- 
vealed to his servant, the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, many things pertain- 



ing to this world and to the condi- 
tion of the world, and the things 
that were about to come upon the 
rations of the earth. We read it 
before, but we paid little attention 
to it. We did not attach the im- 
portance to it some years ago that 
wcdo today, and when I heard in 
the tabernacle yesterday extracts 
from the Book of Doctrine and 
Coveants, I was impressed how lit- 
erally the words of the Lord, 
through his servant the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, are being fulfilled 
right in our day. We know it, we 
testify to it, awl the half has not 
yet been told. 

Search the scriptures, modern 
scriptures as well as ancient, and 
there you will find food that will 
be profitable for you to digest, and 
to profit thereby. Hear the words 
of the Lord as they are given to 
you through his servants, and then 
you will be prepared for the things 
that are about to come to you and 
to the nations of the earth. My 
testimony to you today, my breth- 
ren and .sisters and those who may 
not be members of the Church, is 
that there are today men who are 
prophets of God, just as much as 
any who have lived formerly upon 
the face of this earth, and they 
speak the word of God to you. 
Their words are full of meaning, 
full of light, and if you take the 
same care and patience, and have 
the same faith in what they say, 
as we exercise in what has been 
said thousands of years ago, we will 
be profited thereby. Hear the 
words of the Lord through his 
servants, and you will be blessed. 
I bear my testimony of these things 
to you, and I pray God to make us 
faithful, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN

ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN. 

(President of the Bingham Stake) 

I assure you, my brethren and 
sisters, that it is a very trying or- 
deal for me to follow such men as 
President Hart and President Shep- 
herd, who have had so much expe- 
rience in public life. I trust I shall 
be able to say a few words, by the 
aid and assistance of the Spirit of 
the Lord. I bear testimony to the 
truths that have been spoken by 
these men. 

I learn that the keynote of this 
conference, to the Latter-day Saints 
is that they shall keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord; that they 
shall be obedient unto those things 
that we have been called to and 
have accepted. 

In the Mutual Improvement 
meeting this morning, we were dis- 
cussing, in addition to this, some of 
our duties as citizens of this great 
nation of which we form a part; 
and I was impressed with the de- 
sire of the leaders of the Church 
to stimulate loyalty in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints, to our Na- 
tion in this day of our tribulations. 
Our special attention was called, 
my friends, to the purchasing of 
Liberty Bonds, this second issue of 
Liberty Bonds now being placed 
before the American people for 
purchase. A resolution was passed 
there this morning that we would 
all do our uttermost in the pur- 
chase of these bonds. We would 
not only advise our friends and 
neighbors, but we would purchase 
ourselves, and would show our loy- 
alty by our actions. We have al- 
ways believed, and it has always 
been the doctrine of the Latter-day 
Saints, that "Mormonism" should 
be reflected in the lives of its peo- 
ple. 



Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
am delighted with the growth and 
development of this Church, with 
the testimony of our brethren con- 
cerning increased desires for right- 
eousness and good works. 

I, too, come from the north, and 
I am a neighbor of President Hart 
and President Shepherd, and I 
want to testify to the truthfulness 
of President Hart's words concern- 
ing the growth and development of 
the Latter-day work in that coun- 
try. We have today in the sixteen 
stakes of Zion in Idaho, 80,000 Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Nearly all of them 
have gone there and have grown up 
there in the last twenty or twenty- 
five years. We are endeavoring to 
do our part to wield an influence 
among those people, that shall be 
calculated to place the Latter-day 
Saints in their proper light; and 
,ve are successful, we are laboring 
and living in peace and quietude 
with our neighbors. There is no 
contention, the old anti-"Mormon" 
feeling that used to exist a few 
years ago is all passed away and we 
hear nothing of it any more. We 
are pleased at this condition, we rec- 
ognize the hand of the Lord in it, 
and we recognize that the Lord has 
brought our opposers to a better 
understanding of the motives of the 
Latter-day Saints ; and when our 
motives are understood by those not 
of us, they will judge us righteous- 
ly and give us the credit due us. 

You know, my brethren and sis- 
ters, what "Mormonism" stands for 
— for the ideal type of citizenship, 
for the ideal type of good living, 
better living, the proper rearing of 
our children, that we may make 
not only consistent Latter-day 
Saints of our boys and girls, but the 
most ideal citizens, loyal to our 
land, our flag, and able and willing 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to defend the country. We of all 
other people believe in the divin- 
ity of the Constitution of the Unit- 
ed States. There is no other peo- 
ple who believe that the Lord in- 
spired men to write the Constitu- 
tion of the United States as do the 
Latter-day Saints ; and we believe 
that this great instrument shall be 
perpetuated, and that the liberties 
of the people of this country shall 
always be maintained. We believe 
that this is a land preserved by the 
Lord until this day and generation 
when he should re-establish his 
work. With these ideals, we could 
not do anything else than right, i 
shall give way because you are all 
waiting to hear Major Roberts talk 
to you. God bless you. Amen. 

A solo was sung by a member of 
the choir, entitled, "Kind words are 
sweet tones of the heart." 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters: I am 
indeed happy to have this opportu- 
nity of meeting you and addressing 
you on this occasion. 

We are living in times that are 
the most trying through which the 
world has ever passed ; but also, we 
are living in the most splendid time 
that the world has ever seen. I do 
not envy the ancient patriarchs 
named in the Bible, as belonging 
to the Patriarchal period of our 
world's history ; I do not envy the 
people who lived in the classic 
lands, and in the heroic times of 
Greece or Rome, at the height of 
their splendor. I do not envy the 
men who lived in the clays of chiv- 
alry, in the Middle Ages, when the 
individual man, and his prowess 
counted for so much. None of those 



periods of time was as splendid as 
the period in which we live; and 
the opportunities of those ages 
were not equal to the opportunities 
of today. 

I do not know how it comes 
about, but every day thrills me with 
emotions of gratitude that I am liv- 
ing now, and that in a very small 
and humble way I have the oppor- 
tunity of doing the things that are 
appointed unto me to do, and 1 
think that that can be true of the 
humblest citizen of this great re- 
public — for there are none so hum- 
ble in life that they are deprived of 
participating in the greatness and • 
in tiie glory of these days. And yet, 
I recognize the fact that we live in 
a day when destructive forces are 
in operation, when men's minds are 
troubled because of the things which 
apparently are coming upon the 
earth. I realize that it is a day of 
great sacrifice, when the people are 
called upon to lay upon the altar 
of their country the richest gifts 
that God has given to them ; and as 
I have witnessed the sorrows of 
mothers who feel that they are sac- 
rificing their sons, dearer to them . 
than all the wealth of the world, 
I have sympathized with them, but 
I have also congratulated them in 
my heart upon the opportunities 
that have come to them to give ex- 
pression to the nobility of their 
souls by the sacrifices they make. 

We are in a period in the world's 
history of very great disturbance, 
when action is intense, when change 
is continuous. I glory in that, be- 
cause I believe that action means 
purification. The Prophet Joseph 
in one of his revelations to the 
Church, asks this question, or at 
least the Lord asks it through him • 
"How long can rolling waters re- 
main impure?" It is the stagnant

waters that breed miasmas, and 
that become dangerous to the 
health of communities. The glo- 
rious stream that dashes 'down 
the mountain gorge and flows over 
precipices in waterfalls, and then 
sjoes rushing down the rapids, 
broken into spray, kissed by the sun- 
light and purified by its exposure 
to the air, in its great race for the 
ocean — such waters quickly purify 
themselves ; and so do peoples, so 
does a world in commotion, in in- 
tense action. It means for the 
world cleansing, purification : it 
means a march of progress. And 
we want to keep this in mind, that 
back of all the turmoil and com- 
motion that comes with this war 
period in which we live. God stands, 
and his law obtains. We want to 
nossess our souls in absolute con- 
fidence that we live under law, and 
that law operates in the midst of 
destructive forces as well as in the 
operation of constructive forces. In 
my own reflections, I have come to 
a verv hapny state of mind. In 
*he midst of all this strife, I have 
learned to remember that God lives 
in his universe, that he is every- 
where present with widely diffused 
influence and power, upholding all 
things, and that destructive forces 
will not go beyond what his wis- 
dom shall decree to be their bounds. 

On this subject I think there is a 
fine, even a sublime, passage in one 
of our revelations, that I would like 
to read to you : 

"All kingdoms have a law given: 
and there are many kingdoms; for 
there is no space in the which there is 
no kingdom; and there is no kingdom 
in which there is no space, either a 
greater or a lesser kingdom. And un- 
to every kingdom is given a law; and 
unto every law there are certain 
hounds also and conditions." 



This revelation joins most admir- 
ably in a deduction made by a prom- 
inent writer, the author of Natural 
Law in the Spiritual World — 
Henry Drummond. In that work, 
the author says, "There is no finer 
generalization made than this, that 
even law is governed by law." In 
other words, as it is expressed here 
in the revelation I just read, "Unto 
every law there are certain bounds 
also and conditions." And back of 
the law always is the Lawgiver, 
greater than the law, since it has its 
source from him. 

"All beings who abide not in those 
conditions [prescribed by law] are 
not justified; 

"For intelligence cleaveth unto in- 
telligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; 
truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth 
virtue; light cleaveth unto light; 
mercy hath compassion on mercy, 
and claimeth her own: justice contin- 
ueth its course, and claimeth its own; 
judgment goeth before the face of 
him who sitteth upon the throne, and 
governeth and executeth all things: 

"Fie comprehendeth all things, and 
•ill things are before him, and all 
tlr'ngs are round about him: and he 
is above all things, and in all things, 
and is through all things, and is round 
about all things; and all things are by 
him, and of him, even God, for ever 
and ever. 

"And aga'n, verily I say unto you, 
he hath given a law unto all things 
by which they move In their times 
and their seasons; 

"And their courses are fixed; even 
the courses of the heavens and the 
earth, which comprehend the earth 
and all the planets; 

"And they give light to each other in 
their times and in their seasons, in 
their minutes, in their hours, in their 
days, in their weeks, in their months, 
in their years: all these are one year 
with God, but not with man. 

"The earth rolls upon her wings, 
and the sun giveth his light by day, 
and the moon giveth her light by 
night, and the stars also giveth their 
light, as they roll upon their wings

in their glory, in the midst of the 
power of God. * * * 

"And again, verily I say unto you, 
that which is governed by law is also 
preserved by law, and perfected and 
sanctified by the same." 

I 

That conveys to us the splendid 
thought, I think, that we live under 
the reign of law. Nothing is go- 
ing to happen in this world but 
what shall be under the dominion 
of law. Even the destructive forces 
themselves have their bounds and 
limitations fixed by the decree of 
God — the law. 

The astronomers tell us that 
away off in the dim distance, so far 
away in the space depths that we 
may form no comprehension of the 
distance, they have the evidence 
that here and there a world seems 
sometimes to be blotted out of ex- 
istence, and that which was appar- 
ent to their vision has disappeared 
— destroyed. So that, fixed as seem 
to be the stars above in the night 
time, regular as they move in their 
courses, holding so far as man 
knows, from age to age, still there 
come changes in those vast crea- 
tions and they are broken up and 
destroyed. 

This, too, is spoken of in one of 
our revelations in the Pearl of 
Great Price. Listen to it: 

"Behold there are many worlds that 
have passed away by the word of my 
power * * * and there are many 
which now stand * * * the heav- 
ens are many, and they cannot be 
numbered unto me, for they are mine, 
and as one earth shall pass away, and 
the heavens thereof, even so shall an- 
other come; and there is no .end to 
my works, neither to my words. For 
behold this is my work and my glory, 
to bring to pass the immortality and 
eternal, life of man." 

The Lord has revealed, then, that 
worlds pass away. In this same 



passage it is written that there are 
many worlds that now stand and 
that there are many that have 
passed away. In other words, de- 
structive forces are in operation as 
well as constructive and maintain- 
ing forces. What I want to im- 
press upon your minds here and 
now is that these destructive forces 
are under the dominion of law, and 
that the whole scheme of things is 
under the hand and rule and au- 
thority and power of God ; that 
there are no destructive forces op- 
erating but what contain in them- 
selves the prophecy of reconstruc- 
tion — that when a world in a cer- 
tain course of its development has 
reached the highest attainment that 
can be hoped for it under condi- 
tions that have prevailed, behold 
this condition shall pass away — de- 
struction comes, but only to use 
these materials in reconstructing 
better, and for the attainment ot 
higher and nobler purposes. 

I have said this much because 
we may consider ourselves just now 
as standing in the midst of a de- 
structive period in the world's his- 
tory. So indeed we are, but I am not 
afraid of those destructive forces, 
because I have this faith, that these 
destructive forces are under the con- 
trol of God, and that they mean the 
reconstruction of better things for 
the world; and out of this mael- 
strom of war and famine and waste 
— waste of human life, waste of 
human treasure, waste apparently 
of the accumulations of civilization 
through many ages, there shall 
come even greater and higher 
things. There shall come larger 
liberty to the inhabitants of the 
earth ; there shall come a more pro- 
found security and joy of life, of 
liberty, and the pursuit of happi- 
ness. There shall come a better 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



distribution of the wealth that is 
created by a combinaiton of the ef- 
forts of men, by their daily toil and 
the supply of the capital that makes 
possible the labors of men's hands. 
And so I look forward to better 
times, to improved conditions, and 
out of this crucible through which 
the world is passing and being tried 
as gold seven times tried in the fire 
— I anticipate the development of 
larger opportunities and greater 
blessings than the world has yet 
known. 

Do we not sing sometimes, "Sac- 
rifice brings forth the blessings of 
heaven" ? And do ' you know, I 
have got it in my mind that there is 
some proportion between the bless- 
ings that are to come and the sac- 
rifices that are made for those bless- 
ings. Isn't that a reasonable con- 
clusion? Well, if it is a reasonable 
conclusion, and if the promises are 
true, then from that view point what 
may not the world hope for in the 
matter of blessings in the presence 
of the enormous sacrifices now be- 
ing made by the children of men? 
If the blessings to come shall be 
somewhat commensurate with the 
sacrifices that have been made by 
the nations of the earth during the 
last three years of strife and war 
and sacrifice, it seems to me that 
the earth itself will not be able to 
contain the blessings that God is de- 
signing for the inhabitants of the 
earth after they shall be cleansed 
by this maelstrom of sacrifice and 
judgment that is passing over the 
world. 

And so, I am happy, happy to 
live in this day of the purification 
of the nations of the earth, happy 
to live in the days that shall see a 
further purification of our own na- 
tion and people. I am well satisfied 
with our nation. No nation in the 



history of this world ever drew the 
sword in a more righteous cause 
and in a more unselfish spirit, and 
with greater desire to benefit hu- 
manity, than our nation has done in 
the present instance. If there ever 
was a holy war in this world, you 
may account the war that the Unit- 
ed States is waging against the Im- 
perial Government of Germany as 
the most righteous and holy of 
wars. We have not entered it for 
conquest, we have not entered it for 
the purpose of enlarging our bor- 
ders and appropriating the lands or 
wealth of other people. In advance, 
the present administration of the 
government of the United States 
declared we wanted no indemnities. 
We asked for none of the territory 
of other nations, we did not wage 
this war in the spirit of revenge for 
injuries inflicted upon our citizen- 
ship, or upon our rights upon the 
high seas. We simply drew the 
sword in this case, that the nations 
of the earth should be free from 
the terror of militarism, from the 
tyranny of would-be masters of the 
world; we simply desire to see the 
nations put in the way of living 
their own lives without fear, the 
weakest as well as the strongest. 
We drew the sword of war against 
war itself. We fight not that war 
might be perpetuated, but that war 
might eternally cease upon the face 
of the earth, and that men might 
be free and live their lives uninter- 
rupted by fear of the oppressor. 
Can you name a more righteous war 
than that ? And shall we not be de- 
voted to our country and to this 
cause of freedom? 

Here in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants is a statement that I have read 
I reckon five hundred times, and 
yet I think the truth of it never en- 
tirely came to me until recently.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



When the Latter-day Saints were 
in exile, driven from Jackson coun- 
ty, Missouri, and were bivouacked 
out on the Missouri bottoms with 
no covering but the canopy of 
heaven, and exposed in an inclem- 
ent season of the year to the rigors 
of the winter season of that land, 
the Lord, giving instructions as to 
how they should proceed, said in 
the course of that instruction : 

"Again I say unto you that those 
who have been scattered by their en- 
emies, it is my will that they should 
continue to importune for redress and 
redemption by the hands of those 
who are placed as rulers and are in 
authority over you, according to the 
laws and constitution of the people 
which I have suffered to be estab- 
lished, and should be maintained for 
s e rights and protection of all flesh, 
according to just and holy — inci- 
ples." 

I have to confess to you that 
in times past when I read that, I 
thought the Lord was concerning 
himself chiefly with those who were 
living under our Constitution and 
the laws that have been enacted in 
harmony with it; but behold, here 
is a larger vision of it, and one be- 
comes astonished that he did not see 
it before. Not only are the 
people blessed to inhabit this 
land, not only are they to en- 
joy these privileges guaranteed to 
us under this Constitution which 
God founded by inspiring the wise 
men of that time to construct it, 
not only are these principles of lib- 
erty for them, but as stated here, 
"they should be maintained for the 
rights and protection of all flesh." 
I invoke here and now the very 
word of God in this dispensation to 
the righteousness and holiness of 
extending these American princi- 
ples of liberty so that they shall in- 
clude all the inhabitants of the 
earth. 



We did a noble thing away back 
yonder in President Monroe's ad- 
ministration, in 1823, when our 
government then served notice up- 
on the European powers that the 
republics in this Western Hemi- 
sphere were no longer to be re- 
garded as spheres wherein Euro- 
pean systems of government might 
be forced upon the people contrary 
to their will ; that those republics 
having declared and maintained 
their independence as our repub- 
lic had, they were not again to be 
oppressed by the nations of Eu- 
rope. That we called the Monroe 
Doctrine, and 'in announcing it, we 
simply stood for the right of self- 
government within the republics of 
this western world. Europe, in 
other words, should not be permit- 
ted to coerce the republics of the 
western world, they should not im- 
pose European systems upon them. 
And in taking that position, the 
government of the United States 
stood for the great principle of 
Democracy, in the western world, 
viz., that governments derive their 
just powers from the consent of 
the governed ; that the people of 
all America had the right of self- 
government, and we would help to 
maintain them in the possession 
and maintenance of that right, for 
we said at that time that any at- 
tempt to coerce or oppress any of 
those governments would be re- 
garded as an unfriendly act against 
the United States. And that was 
the polite way — that was the diplo- 
matic way of saying, "If you at- 
tempt to coerce any of these Amer- 
ican governments, it means 'war 
with the United States." And so 
European powers let up at that time 
on their efforts to coerce the repub- 
lics of the western world. 

What do we say now? We say 



ELDER BRIGHAM If. ROBERTS 



105 



now, "All the nations of the earth 
shall govern themselves ; there shall 
arise no power, however wonderful 
the genius of its people may be, 
however confident they may feel of 
their ability to govern the world 
better than anybody else, to forbid 
such freedom. We simply serve 
notice upon the Imperial Govern- 
ment of Germany and her allies 
that the principle of self-govern- 
ment among the nations of the earth 
is going to be world wide, the right 
of every nation, the very weakest 
as well as the very strongest, to 
govern itself will be insisted upon 
and maintained. So it is a world- 
wide application of the old Monroe 
Doctrine that America is about, and 
there is to be no desertion of the 
Monroe Doctrine at all. 

Since our cause is righteous, 
may we not hope that the God of 
battles will maintain our cause by 
strengthening our hands, by mak- 
ing stout our hearts? By making 
invincible our armies whatever 
they may have to sacrifice in the 
struggle that they shall engage in? 
The only thing that I am con- 
cerned about is simply this, whether 
we will prove ourselves to be 
worthy of the help and support of 
God. Shall we feel his strength 
and power enabling us to accom- 
plish the high purposes that we 
have declared to be ours in connec- 
tion with our entrance into this 
great world struggle? I am con- 
fident that the people will respond 
to the righteousness of our cause, 
and the admonitions of the presi- 
dent of these United States. 

These reflections indicate to us, 1 
hope, a little why it is I feel so hap- 
py in this day in which we live ; and 
we pray that God will so help us 
that we shall receive renewed man- 
ifestations of his goodness and his 



mercies and his guiding hand in the 
affairs of this nation, and of this 
world ; which world is God's by 
right of proprietorship, having cre- 
ated it, having sustained it, having 
appointed to it its courses, for he 
has decreed from the beginning 
what shall be the far-off end of 
this world and the salvation and 
glory of the inhabitants thereof. 

God help us to appreciate the day 
in which we live, and to cause our 
spirits to rise to the high level of 
these times, and the opportunities 
they afford, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have been very greatly im- 
pressed by the remarks of Elder 
Roberts, with the grandeur, the 
greatness, and the majesty of God. 
He was quoting from this good 
book which I hold in my hand, The 
Pearl of Great Price. The closing 
part of his quotation reads as fol- 
lows : "For behold this is my work 
and my glory, to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of 
man." What is the work of God? 
is so well answered in these few 
words that I hardly need make 
further comment ; and yet we were 
also impressed with this thought, in 
regard to the work of God, when 
Elder Roberts pointed out to us the 
splendors of the universe, these 
heavenly bodies which we behold 
every night of our lives when we 
look out into the universe, each one 
performing its regular functions in 
its respective orbit, and when we 
behold the sun at noonday, and ad- 
mire its splendor and grandeur, and 
all these creations above us, as well 
as beneath us : the earth upon which 
we stand : "All these are also a part 



106 



G EN ERA L CONFERENCE. 



of the work of God." Yet great 
and glorious as are these splendid 
creations around and about us. 
above us and beneath us, the great- 
ness of the work of God is this, "to 
bring to pass the immortality and 
the eternal life of man." 

What ? you mean to say that that 
is a greater work than the creation 
of the heavens and the .earth? By 
far, my brethren and sisters ; 
greater than the making of a world, 
greater than the creation of the uni- 
verse, is the bringing to pass of the 
immortality and eternal life of our 
Father's children ; for it was to this 
end that these heavenly planets 
were created, a preliminary to the 
accomplishment of God's great 
work. It was essential that they 
should he made to become the dwell- 
ing places of our Father's children ; 
and their habitations, their dwell- 
ings, their abode is not greater 
than the children themselves; and 
to bring to pass their immortality 
and their eternal life, is greater than 
all the rest. The one is but a pre- 
liminary arrangement for the ac- 
complishment of that greater pur- 
pose. When we dwelt in the 
presence of the Father, in that 
primeval day when the morning 
stars sang for joy and all the sons 
of God shouted together — it was 
then that the proclamation was 
made that the Lord would save his 
children through obedience to the 
gospel, and give unto them their 
freedom, their free-agency, indi- 
cating God's purpose that his chil- 
dren should be free, free to chose 
the right or wrong as they might 
elect for themselves. In the exer- 
cise of that freedom, granted unto 
all, the Lord proposed to bring to 
pass their immortality and their 
eternal life. 

What is the difference between 



immortality and eternal life? To 
bring to pass the immortality of 
man what is needful? All men are 
subject to death. You cannot ac- 
complish the immortality of your 
own soul, but that has been brought 
to pass through the atonement of 
Christ, for he said, "Here am I, 
send me." And the Lord sent his 
Only Begotten Son into the world, 
who gave his life that we might live 
again. He overcame death and the 
grave ; and through that atonement 
was brought to pass that great part 
of God's work which we call the 
immortality of man. 

There is .still something other 
than immortality — it is to bring to 
pass the immortality and the eternal 
life of man. Well, what is immor- 
tality, says one? Is not that to live 
on eternally? Indeed it is. And 
eternal life? Does that not mean 
immortality? Yes, eternal life means 
all that is included in immortality, 
but immortality does not include 
all that is meant in eternal life, and 
when we speak of eternal life and 
immortality, they are two separate 
things. To bring to pass the im- 
mortality of man has been accom- 
plished by the atonement of Christ 
without any effort upon our part; 
but if we are to obtain eternal life, 
then we must co-operate with God 
and he will bring to pass that eter- 
nal life in his presence. To live not 
only as immortal beings, living con- 
tinually, but to live with him in his 
celestial kingdom, that is eternal 
life, and can only be accomplished 
through obedience to the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Thereby will 
God accomplish this, his great work, 
through bringing to pass the im- 
mortality of his children and their 
eternal life, for which the worlds 
were created, and for which we 
have come down in these mortal

tabernacles and are commanded to 
yield obedience to the will of God, 
obedience to his glorious gospel, the 
perfect law of liberty which is in- 
deed the power of God unto salva- 
tion. 

God help us to appreciate that 
glorious gospel and that great work 
of our Father which he has insti- 
tuted in his great universe for the 
salvation, the exaltation, the eternal 
life of his children. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang :

Jacob F. Gates. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
p. m., Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, 
of the First Council of Seventy, 
presiding. Music was furnished by 
the Jordan Stake choir. 

The hymn, "The Mighty God 
appearing," was sung. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Peter L. Bronson. 

An anthem, "In our Redeemer's 
name," was sung by the choir. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

I observe unrest in the world, 
among the most learned men who 
themselves are nevertheless deeply 
concerned in trying to find out God 
and his ways. It is illustrated in 
some publications that have ap- 
peared during the .present year, and 
that are attracting wide attention, 
such books as God, the Invisible 
King, written by Mr. H. G. Wells, 



one of England's foremost writers, 
a book attacking the old sectarian 
notions of God, and seeking to find 
out a new kind of being, arguing in 
favor of a personal God, and yet 
eliminating from the godhead both 
God the Son and God the Holy 
Ghost. When I observe this unrest 
and witness such exhibitions on the 
part of learned men, my heart 
swells with deep gratitude for the 
testimony that I have of the true 
and living God and the knowledge 
that I have concerning his ways and 
his requirements. And when I look 
at this pathetic scene, I feel more 
thankful for this testimony than for 
anything else in the world. To me 
it is above all price. I realize that 
I must exhibit a sympathy towards 
men and women of this character 
who have not been as fortunate as 
I have, and I am sur.e that God will 
extend to them mercy if they are 
honest in their searches for truth. 
All who seek in earnestness for 
truth will ultimately be led to dis- 
cover it. 

I find not only in the world, but 
to quite an extent among us Latter- 
day Saints, a disposition to live only 
in part the teachings of the wonder- 
ful system which we thoroughly be- 
lieve to be true. We have not the 
courage nor faith to adopt all, but 
live up to that part of the gospel 
which pleases us, or that part which 
we adopt. We have an idea that 
if we are faithful in one or two of 
the principles of the gospel it will 
suffice. Frequently it is said that 
all roads lead to heaven, and 
whether you are a good Methodist, 
or a good "Mormon" or a good 
Jew, it makes little difference, but 
as long as you do good you are 
along that road, and that ultimately 
all these roads lead to the same 
goal.

( ; /•; .V E R. 1 1. ( 'ON EE RENCE . 



Now it is true that every man 
who does good, so far he is led 
towards the kingdom of God ; but 
the difficulty is that some of us will 
only be able to get about a third 
of the way there, some will only get 
half way, and a great many will 
only get two-thirds. How many 
will get all the way to the kingdom 
of God? For whosoever enters in 
will have come up by the straight 
and narrow way, and they will be 
those who come up to the complete 
requirements of the law and comply 
with that law in its fullest extent, 
for they, and they alone will enter 
in; for, as I say, "straight is the 
gate and narrow is the way that 
leadeth to eternal life, and few 
there be that find it." The gospel 
is, nevertheless, very broad in its 
provisions, for it can care for all 
of those several classes. Even 
those who go a part of the distance 
will be provided for. You Latter- 
day Saints will recall Paul's descrip- 
tion of the kingdoms that the 
Father hath provided for all his 
children of various grades ; and in 
that wonderful vision to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord has 
made it plain to us just what are 
those great divisions about which 
Paul speaks. The Latter-day 
Saints will recall that there is one 
glorious place, the highest of all, to 
which all souls may possibly attain, 
the celestial kingdom, where God 
and Christ live, whose glory Paul 
has said was like unto the glory of 
the sun. Now we are informed in 
the revelations of the Lord todav 
that whosoever shall attain unto this 
glory must keep all the command- 
ments of God. You remember the 
advice which Peter gave concerning 
what, in addition to repentance, 
baptism and the laying on of hands, 
should be necessary ; that men 



should add unto their faith virtue 
and godliness, and brotherly kind- 
ness, and charity, and so on. All 
these requirements were essential, 
ft does not mean that a man who is 
baptized into this Church has any 
sure guaranty that he is going to 
the celestial kingdom of God. Not 
at all. 

A man who is honest with his 
neighbor and with the Lord and 
with his fellows, has .done well so 
far ; and yet his honesty will not 
take him all the way. Likewise a 
man who has been baptized and has 
repented of his sins, and is dishon- 
est, after he has repented ; he will 
never come into the kingdom of 
God until he is honest to the very 
core, heart and soul. A man who 
goes to meeting and says long 
prayers and yet returns home to lose 
his temper and abuse his wife and 
berate his loved ones will never get 
into the kingdom of God until he 
learns to control his unruly temper. 
The very best of us will need a 
probationary state to finish the work 
of preparation to go into the pres- 
ence of the Father. If we do not do 
it here, just as sure as we live we 
will have to do it hereafter, and 
man)' of us may lose the chanct 
and the opportunity of doing it 
hereafter. 1 don't interpret the 
parable of the Savior to mean that 
the men who came in the eleventh 
hour was to get the identical privi- 
leges and blessings with the man 
who came the first hour, only pro- 
vided that he who appeared at the 
eleventh hour was accepting his 
first chance, his first opportunity. 
He did not come around the first 
hour, and go away, and say, 1 will 
come back after a while and see if 
there is still a job for me. No, 
when he appeared at the eleventh 
hour, it was his first opportunity, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



109 



and he seized it, and the Lord could 
not other than give him the privi- 
leges that the man who came the 
first hour received. And yet, the 
man who went in at the first hour 
would be a more experienced gar- 
dener than the man who went in at 
the eleventh hour. The man who 
goes in at the eleventh hour would 
have a disadvantage so far as op- 
portunities are concerned over the 
man who from childhood had kept 
the commandments and grown up to 
the opportunities of the gospel all 
his life. He will stand far in the 
lead of those who are so unfortun- 
ate as not to find the door until they 
are old. And yet, the way is open to 
them to come, even in old age, and 
attain unto all the privileges of the 
gospel. They must follow in the 
wake of those who preceded them. 
I don't understand that the "Mor- 
mon" doctrine, announced by Pres- 
ident Lorenzo Snow, and so often 
quoted by us : "As God is man may 
become, and as man is God once 
was," means that all men are going 
to become what God is, not by any 
manner of means. It is possible 
they may become ; yes, when men 
keep and obey the fulness of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I understand, my brethren and 
sisters, this great scheme of our 
Father contemplates that the privi- 
lege of gaining celestial glory has 
been extended to nearly all of his 
children. There are a very few 
in the world who are barred from 
all the privileges. Evidently ac- 
cording to the revelations of the 
Lord, those races and divisions ex- 
isting among us now, existed be- 
fore we came into this world, and 
some had failed to carry out the will 
of God and to conform to his plans 
in their former life to prove them- 
selves worthy to receive the highest 



of privileges, namely, salvation in 
the celestial kingdom of our God. 
But the great majority of our 
Father's children have yet re- 
served unto them the right, if they 
live the principles, to gain an ex- 
altation, with its glories and privi- 
leges. But I am satisfied of the fact 
that those only who gain a celestial 
"lory will ever become what God 
is, for there are privileges that be- 
long to that glory and exaltation 
that do not belong to any other. 
We are advised that there are those 
who, failing to reach the celestial 
kingdom, will find themselves only 
fitted and qualified and prepared to 
enter into the terrestrial glory, 
which glory Paul has described as 
like unto the moon ; and then still 
others who, failing in that, those 
who lie, and steal, and who commit 
adultery, and who repent not of it in 
this life and who fail to fulfil their 
privileges in this life — even they in 
the world to come, through repent- 
ance, may find a place in the telestial 
glory, which is likened unto the 
glory of the stars. And only a few 
indeed, the sons of perdition, shall 
be lost and be without some king- 
dom of God, and be turned over to 
so out with the devil and his angels. 
When the Lord wanted to punish 
Cain, he put a mark upon him, and 
said. Whosoever will look upon you 
will say, Here is the murderer of 
his brother. He would not shut him 
up in some den or cave of the earth, 
and shield him from the gaze of his 
fellows. And when Cain realized 
the torture of his sentence, he said, 
"My punishment is greater than I 
can bear." When the sons of per- 
dition shall be turned over to the 
''evil and his angels, to mingle with 
the billions of spirits, for there will 
be billions of them, what a dis- 
tinguishing mark for those who are 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



participators in that punishment, to 
go out among the devil and his an- 
gels, with resurrected bodies, to be 
a laughing stock and by-vvord in 
that realm of the damned. Talk 
about hell, the meanest punishment 
imaginable will be that which will 
come to them who will have to bear 
the shame and the contempt which 
will be heaped upon them. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
what is your aim ? To which place 
do you desire to go? How earnest 
are you in this struggle? How 
much are you willing to live of 
this precious gospel ? Is your mark 
fixed for the celestial glory, or the 
telestial glory, the lowest place ? Is 
that your ambition ? Do you imag- 
ine that by living a terrestrial law 
you will attain the celestial glory? 
Some of my brethren and sisters 
find it very difficult to understand 
the words of the prophet, wherein 
he said that those who gain a lower 
place of glory than a celestial king- 
dom cannot come where those who 
gain the highest, dwell, worlds 
without end. And there is an imag- 
ination on the part of some of us 
that we could do our work over 
again, that we could catch up, and 
finally get into the celestial king- 
dom. Now to help you to ,see it. 1 
ask you if three men were started 
on an endless race, and one given a 
handicap of a mile and still another 
of two miles, and each man could 
run as fast as the other, would one 
ever catch the other? No. But 
there is a big difference here. 
Those who live the laws and attain 
unto the glory of the celestial shall 
have a body whose very fineness 
and texture, the composition of it, 
the quality of flesh shall be supe- 
rior, for the Lord has said, "there 
is a celestial body, and celestial 
flesh, and there shall be telestial 



bodies, and their flesh will not be 
so refined nor so pure, nor the body 
so capable of .progress and enjoy- 
ment and exaltation which shall be 
enjoyed by those who gain a ce- 
lestial body." So there will be a 
handicap. Those who gain the 
highest place provided shall have 
a very superior physical equipment, 
capable of more intense and rapid 
growth, they shall be associated 
with the very fountain head, and 
those who inherit a lesser degree of 
glory shall learn from those who 
attain unto the highest places, and 
so they will go on, and there will 
come knowledge and .progress to 
them of an infinite character. Do 
we realize that all these advantages 
can be obtained through our wil- 
lingness and faithfulness in this 
short life, in keeping the command- 
ments of God ? That those who 
keep the celestial law are pursuing 
a path that leads on to where God 
is. and what God is now they may 
become? Latter-day Saints do not 
need to sing the "Beautiful Isle of 
Somewhere," and wonder where it 
; s. for the Lord has revealed that 
this earth is keeping the celestial 
law, and that we expect to live in 
a sanctified and redeemed condition 
on this earth, and all of it is going 
;o be celestial. There is not going 
to be one-third of it celestial and 
another third terrestrial, and an- 
other telestial, but it will be ce- 
lestial, all of it, and it will shine as 
the sun. "No longer will it have 
need," as John said in his revela- 
tion, "to have sun to shine by day 
and stars by night," but it will be 
a creator of light itself, or out 
from it will go light, and it will 
"rise to its place" in that great 
gathering and galaxy of worlds 
that shine above, redeemed and 
sanctified. It shall shine respend- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



Ill 



ent in its place, a sun, a celestial 
orb, and only those who keep the 
celestial law will enter upon it, those 
who have bodies that are telestial 
will not be able to endure the glory 
and the majesty of the kingdom 
where our Father in heaven shall 
dwell. I presume that the Lord is 
.preparing some other place, maybe 
Jupiter, a larger place, no doubt, 
than the world whereon we now 
live, for his other groups who are 
not going to find themselves worthy 
in the justice of God to go into the 
celestial kingdom. Now then how 
are we going to feel if we through 
our own selfishness and unworthi- 
ness to attain unto the highest find 
ourselves upon some terrestrial or 
telestial world, away distant from 
this earth? We could all say: "I 
was born there on that place, and 
entitled to all the blessings and 
privileges that are theirs ; I was 
entitled as a royal son to inherit 
a celestial glory, but I sold my 
right, I lost it, I frittered away 
the time during the chance I had, 
and I am debarred forever from 
that glorious privilege and place." 
We will realize the full meaning of 
those words of the poet Whittier, 

"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, 
The saddest are these, it might have 
been." 

My brethren and sisters, when 
the day comes that we will seek to 
justify ourselves for our neglect, 
our carlessness, our indifference, 
because we do not keep fully the 
commandments of the Lord, we 
will be ashamed of our excuses. 
On the other hand, the joy and the 
privileges of the righteous will be 
beyond the power of expression to 
tell you. It is not a myth. 

I know that these revelations of 



the Lord are true. I know the 
glory that awaits the redeemed and 
sanctified. The Lord in his great 
mercy and kindness has given me 
some little foretaste of that which 
is to come. 

I had an experience a few months 
ago, while laboring on the Indian 
reservation, in Northern Montana, 
among my Lamanite brethren and 
sisters, and we had some new prob- 
lems, and calling upon the Lord 
and seeking him very earnestly to 
know if we were doing the right 
thing, and what to do, and desir- 
ous of receiving strength and light 
from him, I received to me a most 
glorious manifestation from the 
Lord. I was carried away in the 
dreams of the night to this glorious 
building that stands on this block, 
and received what fully satisfied 
my heart and soul in blessings and 
privileges that came to me there. 
And when I was about to leave I 
was informed that there was one 
other privilege which shoul 1 be 
mine, and I was taken into the most 
splendid room in that building. 
Seated on a raised platform was 
one of the most beautiful and ex- 
alted beings I had ever beheld, and 
I was informed that I might be in- 
troduced to him, and I came for- 
ward, and as I did so he arose and 
descended to meet me, and the 
smile he extended towards me I 
shall never forget through all the 
ages that are to come, and as he 
took me in his arms and kissed me 
and hug-ged me to his bosom and 
yave me a blessing that made the 
marrow in my bones to melt, and 
as I kissed his f eet. I saw the prints 
of the nails. The feeling that came 
to me then was one that I cannot 
'■escribe other than to say that I 
felt unworthy of that privilege. I 
felt, oh, how little I have done to 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



receive such distinguished privi- 
leges as these. If the day will ever 
come that I may have that privi- 
lege I would be willing to give all 
that 1 ever may and ever hope to 
he. 1 f 1 can only obtain that which 
I have felt and know as the joy 
and the privilege of faithful Lat- 
ter-day Saints. It is no myth. 1 
know it as I live, and it is worth 
giving everything for. These days 
when your faith may be tried, 
waver not. be true and faithful 
towards the word of the Lord. I 
testify to you that it is true, and 
every promise and blessing that has 
been sealed upon your heads you 
will realize. When you do, it will 
be beyond anything you have con- 
templated in this life. 

God give us the strength to he- 
live it, to live for it, and have burn- 
ing in our hearts a desire to keep 
his commandments in the fullest 
sense, not in part, but in the fullest 
sense, and in the end obtain that 
sdorious place and privilege which 
is reserved for the faithful, which 
may God grant, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

Brother Ballard has eloquently 
presented to us some of the spirit- 
ual ideals of the Church. I rejoice 
in the fact that the gospel is very 
broad in its scope, that it reaches 
the highest spiritual ideals and at 
the same time deals with the practi- 
cal affairs of life. Some young 
people have a notion that religion is 
for the old — those who are ap- 
proachin-4 their graves, and that it 
js not for the young and vigorous. 



The truth is that the gospel is the 
philosophy of true living, for the 
young as well as the old. 

Our religion is of a practical na- 
ture. It has within it the power to 
grapple with the every day prob- 
lems of life, no matter how they 
may be thrown upon us, and to cor- 
rectly solve these problems. We 
have had within the last six months 
an illustration of this. On the his- 
torical 6th of April, the official dec- 
laration was made that a state of 
war existed between the Imperial 
Government of Germany and the 
United States, and on that very day 
the prophet of the Lord, his coun- 
selors, and the Twelve, assembled 
in general conference, struck the 
key-note of the situation so accur- 
ately that up to the present time it 
can not be improved upon. Some 
ten days before the President of the 
United States issued his food pro- 
duction and conservation message, 
a great state paper, President Smith 
and the brethren had given sub- 
stantially the same advice to their 
people. Before President Wilson 
set apart a certain Sabbath day for 
the Sunday school children of this 
nation to make contributions to the 
Ped Cross, President Smith and. his 
associates had already set apart that 
identical Sunday for subscriptions 
bv the children of this Church. 
While President Heber T. Grant an- 
nounced in advance bv way of 
nromi.se. that $5,000 would be given 
bv our Sunday school children : 
more than twice that amount was 
contributed by them. 

The Secretary of the Interior, 
Mr. Lane, in his talk in the Taber- 
nacle the other night gave words 
of encouraement to the people of 
Utah. PTe saul the people on the 
sidewalks and all the throng who 
came to see the parade of our sol- 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



113 



dier boys were happy, eager and en- 
thusiastic to look at. He saw no 
tears, no sad faces. They were all 
in .sympathy with the spirit of the 
soldiers who were parading. Every- 
where were smiling faces, showing 
a determination to win and to 
stand behind the boys. He said 
further "With your great develop- 
ment of these fruitful valleys in the 
establishment of this great state, 
you have built up a community of 
rarely satisfied people." He did not 
mean by that word "rarely," seldom, 
but he meant unusually. "Just why 
that is so I don't know, but it is a 
fact, and one for which we are to be 
profoundly glad, and it makes for 
untold wealth of the people ; and 
more than any other one thing is 
this spirit on the part of your peo- 
ple precious. From Utah we have 
had less complaint in Washington 
about the use of the money that 
Uncle Sam is handling than from 
any other western state. That is an 
expression on the part of the people, 
and a thing that stands out plainest 
and show.s patriotism and a fine 
spirit is that they are willing to 
give." Mr. Lane did not quite un- 
derstand how it was that this peo- 
ple were so rarely satisfied and were 
demeaning themselves as they are 
in this great crisis in our country. 
Those of you who understand "Mor- 
monism" and the teachings of the 
Church can comprehend it. You 
who have been taught that this land, 
North and South America, is the 
land of Zion, the land of Joseph, 
concerning which we read in the 
49th chapter of Genesis and the 
33rd chapter of Deuteronomy, and 
made yet plainer by certain chan- 
ters of the Book of Mormon ; and 
those who have read the 10th chan- 
ter of IT Nenhi in reference to the 
destiny of this country can under- 



stand what we are contending for 
in this great world engagement, 
when the Lord said that there 
should be no kingcraft upon this 
favored land of Zion, and that he 
would defend it against all other 
nations. And then, as the Patriarch 
of the Church read to us yester- 
day, the ideals for which we are 
contending are God-given ideals. 
He read from the 101st section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, com- 
mencing about the 79th verse, in 
reference to the free agency of 
man, and that wise men were raised 
up to form the constitution of the 
United Statest in order to establish 
these principles, the principles of 
freedom, and that it was not good 
for one man to be in bondage to 
another. The history of the mak- 
ing of the constitution of the 
United States and its development 
is supported by the word of the 
Lord, that it was divinely inspired. 

When the constitution of the 
United States was being made, 
those delegates whom the Prophet 
tells us were raised up for that pur- 
pose, realized that they needed help 
of the Lord in that emergency. 
There can be no question of that. 
Benjamin Franklin, a man not 
noted for his piety, a wise states- 
man but not an over-zealous relig- 
ionist, the man who while in France 
had taken his own sons to Voltaire, 
the atheist, to be blessed of him, 
realized when a deadlock existed 
for a considerable time in the great 
constitutional convention, that it 
was necessary for them to have Di- 
vine aid. You will remember the 
difficulty between the small states 
and the large states as to what rep- 
resentation each should have, and 
when it appeared no compromise 
could be effected, Beniamin Frank- 
lin arose and said : "I have lived 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a long time (he was then over 80 
years of age), and the longer I live 
the more convincing proofs I see of 
this truth, that God governs the 
affairs of men ; and if a spar- 
row cannot fall to the ground 
without his notice, it is impos- 
sible an empire can rise without 
his aid." And so he proposed that 
they have prayers ; and while they 
did not have formal prayers, I am 
persuaded that there were many 
earnest prayers from the heart that 
did not remain unanswered, and, 
from the nature of the work that 
they did, that it was more than 
man's wisdom that prevailed. You 
remember what Gladstone, the 
great English premier, said (and 
he was competent to pass upon a 
question of that sort, and certainly 
not biased in our favor) that it was 
the greatest instrument ever given 
off at a given time by the brain and 
purpose of man. One jurist has 
said, not just in the language of the 
revelation, that wise men were 
raised up for the purpose of fram- 
ing that constitution, but the equiv- 
alent of it, that "the makers of the 
constitution of the United States 
were the goodliest fellowship of 
lawgivers whereof this world has 
record." They were entering upon 
a great work, because they were 
declaring some new principles in 
p'overnment. they were establishing 
that very principle, that great prin- 
ciple that is now at issue in the 
world, that "governments derive 
their just powers from the consent 
of the governed." That is the same 
thing that is mentioned in different 
kingnaee in the 101st section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that gov- 
ernments are organized by men for 
men, deriving their powers from 
men, to be exercised for their ben- 
efit and good. And that is one of 



the great issues involved today in 
the great world war. Mr. Bryce, 
also an Englishman, who knows 
more of our constitution than 
almost any other man not an Amer- 
ican (and only a very few stand 
higher as an authority than Lord 
Bryce) said, speaking in regard to 
the workings of the American com- 
monwealth, after explaining the 
new things and the old things in 
the constitution, that "after all de- 
ductions, it ranks above every other 
constitution for the intrinsic ex- 
cellence of its scheme, its adapta- 
tion to the circumstances of the 
people, the simplicity, brevity and 
precision of its language, its judi- 
cious mixture and definiteness of 
principle, with elasticity in detail." 
That is the commendation of a very 
learned and impartial judge upon 
this same constitution that the boy 
prophet was giving information 
concerning. 

Just the other day, a distinguish- 
ed American citizen, an ex-presi- 
dent of the United States, made a 
declaration in forecasting what 
would be demanded by the differ- 
ent governments when peace is es- 
tablished. He named one thing 
that the United States would de- 
mand and secure, and that is the 
perpetuation of the Monroe Doc- 
trine. And what is that but a coun- 
terpart of the doctrine expressed in 
the 10th chapter of fl Nephi, to 
the effect that kingcraft shall not 
prevail upon this- land. That is 
what the Monroe Doctrine has stood 
for, that we could regulate our own 
affairs here without interference 
from monarchies or empires on the 
other side of the waters. And so 
those who understand these ideas 
that have been taught to the Latter- 
<-1ay Saints, from the Bible and the 
Book of Mormon and the Doctrine

and Covenants, can understand why 
it is that this people should not be 
easily moved in times of stress 
when religions are being tested and 
criticized, as referred to by Elder 
Ballard in the particular work of 
Mr. H. G. Wells. By the way, in 
the same class is a book by the 
same author, entitled, Italy, 
France and England at War, m 
which he passes strictures upon 
representatives of the great 
churches of those lands, because 
they do not rise to the occasion. I 
believe we can the better appre- 
ciate the attitude of the leaders of 
our people, of President Smith and 
his associates in this emergency, by 
comparing it with the conduct of 
some representatives of other 
churches. I have in mind now a 
young man, highly educated, bril- 
liant in his natural attainments, 
having the ripest scholastic training 
that could start him in his ministry, 
who came to Utah as a reformer, 
and sought to win away our young 
men. He sought to undermine the 
Church by reaching our young men 
and alluring them into the smok- 
ing room and the billiard room at- 
tached to his church. But all his 
learning and training were not suf- 
ficient to keep him right in this 
emergency, and he is now being 
justly rebuked by his countrymen 
including the members of his own 
church. So I say I rejoice in the 
fact that the gospel is of a practical 
nature, because it enables the 
Church to grapple with all the prac- 
tical problems as they arise, and 
give a correct solution of them. 

There has been advice during 
this conference, to turn to the 
scriptures, and it is very timely — 
timely for our boys who are going 
into the ranks and soon into the 
trenches. Let them turn to Joshua. 



One great writer has said that of 
all chapters in the Bible, the one 
that influenced him most was the 
first chapter of Joshua, on account 
of the lesson in courage that it 
taught: "Be strong and of good 
courage, for unto this people shalt 
thou divide for an inheritance the 
land, which I swear unto their 
fathers to give them." This is the 
word of the Lord to the children 
of Israel, and particularly to Joshua 
their leader, just before they are to 
cross Jordan and take those strong- 
ly fortified cities such as Jericho. 
It continues : "Only be thou strong 
and very courageous that thou 
mayst observe to do according to 
all the law, which Moses my ser- 
vant commanded thee : turn not 
from it to the right hand or to the 
left, that thou mayest prosper whith- 
ersoever thou goest. * * * * 
Have not I commanded thee? Be 
strong and of a good courage ; be 
not afraid, neither be thou dis- 
mayed, for the Lord thy God is 
with thee whithersoever thou goest. 
And they answered Joshua, saying, 
All that thou commandest us we 
will do, and whithersoever thou 
sendest us we will go. According 
as we hearkened unto Moses in all 
things, so will we hearken .unto 
thee ; only the Lord thy God be 
with thee, as he was with Moses." 
And then for the closing words of 
this chapter we have the echo again, 
the sublime refrain : "Only be 
strong and of a good courage." To 
understand the significance of this 
admonition, you have to go back 
into the history of Israel and call 
to mind the twelve men who were 
sent down to spy out the land of 
promise. Caleb and Joshua were 
among them. When they returned 
there were only these two out of 
the twelve who were willing to 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



comply with the wishes of Moses 
and Aaron in taking possession of 
the land. What a disappointment it 
must have been to those great lead- 
ers to realize that they were leading 
men lacking in courage who would 
not face the enemy, and who re- 
ported that they had met "men of 
great stature, which come of the 
giants," the sons of Anak. They 
said, "We were in our own sight 
as grasshoppers and so were we in 
their sight." They were not willing 
to go up. But Caleb and Joshua 
were willing to go up at once. And 
Moses and Aaron were so disap- 
pointed that they fell upon their 
faces, and they pleaded with the 
Lord not to utterly destroy the peo- 
ple. But the fate of those who 
were not courageous enough to go 
in and take possession of the land 
when they had the privilege of en- 
tering, was that their carcasses 
should fall in the desert, that only 
the brave or the younger genera- 
tion, those under 20 years of age, 
and Caleb and Joshua of those 
above that age should enter. Caleb, 
"because he had another spirit with 
him," and because he had followed 
after the Lord, after the lapse of 
forty years, was permitted to enter 
the promised land. He was then 
four score and five years of age, but 
still he was willing to have his pos- 
sessions assigned to him among the 
fortified cities. He still had good 
courage, and was willing, with the 
help of the Lord, to make battle 
for the possession that should be 
assigned unto him. So likewise 
manv valuable lessons in courage 
can be learned by the young from 
the splendid life of David, and of 
Gi r 'eon. Gideon was willing with 
300 followers to face untold thou- 
sands of the enemy and was able to 
put them to rout. 



1 rejoice in the teachings of this 
conference, in the practical advice 
(hat has been given, and in the abil- 
ity of the gospel to help solve all of 
the practical problems of life, no 
matter how multitudinous they may 
be, nor how suddenly they may be 
thrown upon us, if we have but a 
knowledge of the word and the 
Spirit of the Lord. 

May the Lord help us to profit by 
his word, I ask in the name of 
!o sus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

( President of the California Mission.) 

I bring you greetings, my breth- 
ren and sisters, from California, 
from your .soldier boys, for there 
are a great many of them now 
gathered in that part of the United 
States. I am proud to say that 
those who have received the proper 
training at home are to be found 
with us whenever opportunity af- 
fords, renewing their covenants at 
the communion table, singing the 
songs of Zion, and praying that 
they may bear with honor the 
names of the fathers who have 
begotten and the mothers who have 
given them birth. I know the 
hearts of the mothers are wrung 
with fear and concern, not so much 
that their sons may lose their lives, 
but that they might be sullied, and 
lose their virtue by contact with 
the world. I want to ,say that I 
have no fears for those who have 
been trained aright, for set deep in 
their hearts is a love for God and 
godliness that will secure them in 
the truth. I have found in the 
world a sobering of the thought^ 
of men ; I mean, they are thinking 
less of the pleasures of the world, 
as a whole, than they were inclined 
to do two or three years ago ; men

who would have blushed at one 
time to acknowledge the hand of 
God in their every day lives now 
express a belief in him and his di- 
vine providence; they pay homage 
to him, where once they would rail, 
were cynical or without belief. 

The wonderful testimonies that 
have been uttered at this confer- 
ence, the words of admonition 
that we have received, have sunk 
deep into my soul. When I heard 
read, by Elder Hart, the remarks 
of the Secretary of the Interior, 
Franklin K. Lane, of California, as 
I heard them from his own lips the 
other night, I thought how won- 
drous after all are the children of 
our God, and some words of the 
Psalmist came to my mind, and I 
want to read them to you : 

"O Lord, how excellent is thy name 
in all the earth, who hast set thy 
glory above the heavens. 

"Out of the mouths of babes and 
sucklings hast thou ordained strength 
because of thine enemies, that thou 
mightest still the enemy and the 
avenger. 

"When I consider thy heavens, the 
work of thy fingers, the moon, the 
stars, which thou hast ordained; 

"What is man that thou art mindful 
of him? and the son of man that thou 
visitest him? 

"For thou hast made him a little 
lower than the angels, and hast 
crowned him with glory and honor. 

"Thou madest him to have dominion 
over the works of thy hands; thou 
hast put all things under his feet; 

"All sheep and oxen, yea, and the 
beasts of the field; 

"The fowl of the air and the fish of 
the sea and whatsoever passeth 
through the paths of the seas. 

"O Lord, how excellent is thy name 
in all the earth!" 

And I contrasted these words of 
David with the remarks made this 
morning by Elders Ivins and Joseph 
F. Smith, Jr., in speaking of the 



vain philosophy of men, wherein 
they would have us not born of God 
but come out of the "lower proto- 
plasm'' of life, drag ourselves up 
out of the sea, dry ourselves in the 
sand, clamber up into a tree, and 
then, after some ages have passed, 
drop down, stand erect and become 
a man. I thought of what Mr. 
Lane said the other night when vis- 
ited by the ambassadors from 
abroad, and they laid before the 
Cabinet and the President of our 
nation some of the great things that 
concerned us in the world's war, 
how they admonished these gentle- 
men, our leaders, how many years 
it would take to perfect an engine 
for an aeroplane, how many years 
it would be necessary to provide the 
needed munitions of war, raise the 
men, drill them, and build the ships 
which are necessary. Mr. Lane re- 
ported they said of the engine for 
our aeroplane, "It is too heavy and 
that it would take at least a year 
to make such an engine as would 
be needed." He said, "to show the 
unification and co-operation of this 
great land of ours," we called 
upon the workmen of the east and 
the middle west and the western 
seaboard for their assistance. We 
locked up two expert engine men in 
a room at Washington and asked 
them to give us the benefit of the 
best products of their combined 
skill in an aero-motor ; and in thirty 
days was mobilized from all parts 
of this Union the new, well-built 
engine, perfect in all its details and 
surpassing those of the old world in 
every point, so we are advised." 

How great is the ingenuity of 
man, when God gives him wisdom, 
even in works for the destruction of 
the human family. How I would 
that they would turn their won- 
drous powers to the industry and 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the peace of the world ! And they 
will, as sure as the 'day follows the 
night, when this madness that has 
blinded the vision of the rulers of 
the earth has passed away, and they 
recognize that the Redeemer is the 
only king of the earth, and they ac- 
cept him and his rule, and obey his 
word. 

But, to the thought that I had in 
my mind. To think, not only in 
connection with this wonderful inci- 
dent I have mentioned, but with the 
other and greater obligations that 
rest upon the Nation, its powers 
and the intelligence of its citizens 
if bent upon this one end, that we 
shall lead in the cause of right. So 
we have demonstrated what man 
may be and what he can do when he 
has an incentive for doing. Truly 
the Lord God hath "made him a 
little lower than the angels." He 
hath set his feet upon the nether- 
most parts of the earth. There is 
no land nor clime unknown to him 
today, nor creature, nor denizen of 
the seas. He has harnessed up the 
silent forces of the universe to do 
his bidding. He flies, as Isaiah said 
that he should, "as a dove to his 
cote." 

Think you, then, that all these 
wonderful powers and possibilities, 
God-given, shall find an end with 
this mean and rude existence, rude 
because it lacks perfection? Think 
you that there shall be no recom- 
pense for the mothers' travail, for 
her sacrifices and for her tears ; that 
there shall be no reward for the 
father's labors, for his toil, for the 
burdens that he has borne and for 
the battles that he has fought ? that 
the fond ideals and hopes that we 
entertain for our boys and girls 
shall come to naught, and all shall 
be vanity of vanity, as declared by 
Solomon, who in his old age went 



after false gods and strange women, 
and perverted the way of truth? 
Think you that our soldier boys, 
who have gone to the front, shall 
find an end to their activities should 
they lay down their lives for their 
country ? No, it is not so. They 
are not of the low and the mean of 
the earth. They reach out in their 
aspirations and ideals and purposes 
into infinitude, and infinite love and 
eternal life alone can bring to them 
a full fruition. 

In all creation, aside from hu- 
mankind, everything seems to come 
to a fulness of its creation here. 
The whole earth, with its rocks, its 
crystals, its metals, and its flowers 
that bud and blow, its trees that live 
and bear, and all the brute creation, 
the fowls of the air and the fishes 
of the deep, all answer the end of 
their creation here ; they meet their 
complement, they have their com- 
panions, they arc provided for in 
their habitat, and need and have no 
care nor thought of the morrow. 
But man, "created in the image of 
God, though he come from the cave 
man and through the stone and the 
iron age," if he does not come to 
his fulness here and may not, in this 
narrow vale, make a complement of 
all his attributes, the very longing 
set in his soul, the very yearning 
for eternal life, the very capabili- 
ties within him that are of divine 
parentage and birth, means that 
there shall yet be some other sphere 
for him to function in, that he may 
become fairly and fully what God 
hath ordained he should, through 
faithfulness, — a creator himself. 

So, men of the world who know 
not the gospel revealed to us, and 
who do not know of the restored 
priesthood of the Son of God, in 
their research by the scalpel and the 
knife, in the chemist's smelting pot, 



ELDER JOSEPH Li. ROBINSON.

in their deep searching of the soul's 
emotions, have tried to .determine, 
and have satisfied themselves that 
life goes on forever. Bottomley, 
one of England's greatest editors 
and writers, briefly speaking of the 
soldier, along with Oliver Lodge, 
who is perhaps accepted as the 
greatest psychologist living, and 
who has lost a boy "somewhere in 
France," — each in turn have said 
that they know that England's boys 
who went to the front, are alive, 
and are active even in that other 
sphere ; that their eyes are fixed 
upon the battle fields at the front, 
that their hearts yearn for their 
companions, and for the cause of 
universal autonomy, and honor and 
freedom among the sons of men. 
This from those men, who have had 
no testimony such as the lowliest of 
the Latter-day Saints have received. 
One of the great testimonies that 
has come to me in the mission field 
is the fact that God reveals the truth 
to the lowliest of his children, to 
those whom we may look upon as 
not even as intelligent as the ma- 
jority of their fellows — even as 
wayfaring men and foolish, yet 
they know the truth where the 
savant, the scholar or the scientist 
falls short because of the latter's 
egotism and the dogmatism of men. 
What great cause there is in this 
for us to rejoice. Just as I read 
unto you here, "Out of the mouths 
of babes and suklings Go ! hath or- 
dained strength.'' And God hath 
.not chosen many of the great and 
mighty ones of the earth. He hath 
revealed his secrets unto babes and 
sucklings. Praise God, brethren 
and sisters, that you know the 
truth ; that you are in touch with 
the powers of heaven; that you 
know that God hears and answers 
prayers ; that you know that Jesus 



Christ is the Redeemer of man- 
kind, our Mediator with the Father ; 
that God so loved us that he gave 
his Son, a precious gift, that by him 
and through him we might learn to 
live and, if needs be, die; that we 
are joint heirs with Christ to the 
glories of our Father's kingdom, if 
we but keep the faith, il we but 
love God with all of our heart and 
soul and mind. Thank God that 
we are among those babes and 
sucklings, or the "wayfaring'' to 
whom this wonderful secret, these 
precious words of truth, have come, 
yet men in the world, in their ego- 
tism and in their vain and vague 
philosophies, have shut themselves 
away from God just as the poet 
Holland has said in a beautiful 
poem : 

"So, with reason's hand 
1 closed the adamantine gates, 
Which faith alone unlocks, and shut 
Myself away from God, the warder 
Of a horde of passions that in 
Darkness groaned and fought, 
Or upon each other gnawed 
For the nourishment 1 desired." 

That is the state of the unbe- 
liever, his feelings and emotions 
God-given nevertheless. Not any 
of the lower creatures of the earth 
reach out for immortality. Man 
alone reaches out for eternity and 
demands a hereafter and an uplift 
to all of -the children of men. But 
man in the world has stultified him- 
self and shut himself away from 
God, and how happy even he is 
when again, through faith, suffer- 
ing, and chastisement he finds the 
Lord, when again he has found 
himself and become what is called 
in the earth, a "Christian." 

May the blessings of heaven be 
with you, you mothers of men who 
have given of your heart's best love 
to maintain the honor of our coun-

try and its sacred liberty and name, 
that neither kingcraft nor any king 
shall find place here, and that right- 
eousness and truth shall be defend- 
ed and protected in every land and 
clime, until all nations shall recog- 
nize their King and their God in 
Christ. Bless you, you fathers, 
who maintain our boys in the mis- 
sion field, and enable them to lift 
up the voice as with a trump to 
those who sit in darkness and know 
not the truth. Bless you, my breth- 
ren and sisters. May we come to a 
realization of what God has de- 
signed us eventually to be, and 
shine as the stars in the firmament 
of heaven, I pray in the name of 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem enti- 
tled, "Daughters of Zion." 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION. 

(President of the Central States Mis- 
sion.) 

I greet you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, this afternoon with a realiza- 
tion in my heart of the great re- 
sponsibility that rests upon a 
speaker on an occasion of this kind. 
I ask an interest in your faith and 
prayers, that I may be able to say 
such things as will be for our good. 

I have been reminded during this 
coference of the custom of the Lord 
since the beginning, according to 
scripture, of gathering together his 
saints from time to time that they 
might be instructed as to their duty, 
and have their faith increased. 
Yesterday, when I listened to Pres- 
ident Smith tell of his laboring so 
many years in this Church, and 
heard him give such excellent ad- 
vice, as a result of his experience, 
to his brethren and sisters, to those 
who believe in the same God that he 



does, I was reminded of that pas- 
sage of scripture in the Book of 
Mormon wherein Nephi makes this 
statement : 

''And blessed are they who shall 
seek to bring forth my Zion at 
that day, for they shall have the 
gift and the power of the Holy Ghost: 
and if they endure unto the end. 
they shall be lifted up at the last day, 
and shall be saved in the everlasting 
kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso 
shall publish peace, yea, tidings of 
great joy, how beautiful upon the 
mountains shall they be" (Nephi 
13:32). 

No greater character, I think, 
lives in mortality than President 
Joseph F. Smith. I wonder how 
many among us take into consider- 
ation the number of times Presi- 
dent Smith and his counselors are 
called together in a day in con- 
sultation in their office, answering 
questions and attending to this 
great work of the Lord upon the 
earth. I wonder if we are as mind- 
ful of them as we should be. I 
have learned to love President 
Smith, knowing him by experience 
to be a man of God, and a man 
whom the Lord has chosen for this 
work in these last days. I believe 
that he was chosen in the council 
that was held before the world was. 
You will read in the Book of Abra- 
ham as f ollows : 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, 
Abraham, the intelligences that were 
organized before the world was; and 
among all these there were many of 
the noble and great ones; 

And God saw these souls that they 
were good, and he stood in the midst 
of them, and he said: These I will 
make my rulers; for he stood among 
those that were spirits, and he saw 
that they were good; and he said 
unto me: Abraham, thou art one of 
them; thou wast chosen before thou 
wast born (Abraham 3:22, 23). 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



121 



He said unto Jeremiah; "Before 
I formed thee in the belly I knew 
thee ; and before thou earnest forth 
out of the womb I sanctified thee, 
and I ordained thee a prophet unto 
the nations (Jei\ 1-5). I believe 
that Joseph Smith the Prophet 
stood among those spirits that the 
Lord showed unto Abraham. I be- 
lieve that the Lord knew him be- 
fore he ever came here, and I be- 
lieve that when Joseph F. Smith 
was born in Missouri that God 
knew him, and I believe that Luci- 
fer, the "son of the morning," 
knew him, and that he, the adver- 
sary of all good, sought to destroy 
him. Perhaps it is not generally 
known, but Lucifer knows it, that, 
at Far West, Missouri, in the fall 
of 1838, when he was but a few- 
weeks old the mob tried to destroy 
him. The leader of that mob, a 
minister of the gospel, in ransack- 
ing the home of the mother of 
President Smith and trying to find 
valuables for which he sought, 
found the child lying upon a bed, a 
helpless infant, and threw the bed- 
ding over him, and the infant, now 
our President, was nearly smoth- 
ered when he was discovered. I 
believe that he was recognized by 
Lucifer, that he was to become a 
great leader in Israel. 

T know beyond a question of a 
doubt that God lives, and that his 
priesthood is here upon the earth 
for the good and for the salvation 
of men. If it were not for the 
authority of Jesus the inhabitants 
of this earth would destroy each 
other. The wicked would slay the 
wicked as they are doing until total 
destruction would occur. But from 
among the children of men scat- 
tered in all parts of the world shall 
come the honest in heart, and they 
shall come unto a knowledge of the 



truth. They shall come from the 
four corners of the world. Do you 
think that this great conflict that is 
now being waged throughout the 
world is not for a purpose? It is to 
destroy the wicked so that the gos- 
pel of the Son of Man can be pro- 
claimed with freedom, that liberty 
of conscience may be enjoyed by 
the honest in heart in all the world. 

God moved Columbus to come to 
this land, and he labored with those 
who ruled over him to give him an 
apportunity to come here and dis- 
cover this continent, and this was 
done that a great land of liberty 
might be populated by a people who 
love liberty and the truth. The 
Lord is using men in various parts 
of the earth at the present time to 
accomplish his purposes. They 
may not be preaching the gospel of 
Christ, but they are assisting in the 
establishment of a democracy that 
will give men and women liberty 
to act and move as the power of the 
Spirit of God shall move upon 
them. I have in mind one individ- 
ual who 1 am sure is performing 
a great work, preparing the way 
for a .democracy that will permit 
the spreading of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ where it has not been heard 
because of tyranny and oppression. 
He has been called to Russia as an 
ambassador of the United States 
of America. He is not a member 
of the Church, by any means, but 
he is a character who has become 
well known in this land, a states- 
man, a diplomat, and a gentleman, 
a man who is able to understand 
the conditions and the needs of the 
people of that land, and who carries 
with him the spirit of liberty and of 
the democracy which we enjoy. 1 
speak of the Hon. David R.' Fran- 
cis, of St. Louis, Mo., who was at 
one time president of the world's

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fair at St. Louis, another time Gov- 
ernor of the great state of Mis- 
souri, and another time a member 
of Grover Cleveland's cabinet, a 
gentleman who has had ample ex- 
perience that qualifies him for the 
work. I believe men like him are 
doing God's work in the world, 
and that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
may be carried into may lands of 
darkness, after the way has been 
opened by the establishment of 
good governments. 

We think that we are doing a 
great and a mighty work, and we 
are, in sending the gospel to the 
world and in enduring hardships 
in many ways. But there will come 
a time when every man and woman 
will be tried, for the gospel of 
Jesus Christ must be preached unto 
the children of men as long as flesh 
shall remain upon the earth, and 
the men who practice what they 
preach shall be the instruments in 
God's hands to gather the honest in 
heart that they may enjoy such 
sweets as we are enjoying today. 
For there are men and women in 
the world ready to receive the gos- 
pel; but because of wickedness, the 
preaching of the gospel has been 
curtailed. Hence the necessity of 
establishing a government which 
will allow its people to worship God 
according to the dictates of their 
own conscience. In many portions 
of the world the preaching of the 
gospel of Christ has never been tol- 
erated, and those countries must be 
opened up, for the Savior said : 

"This gospel of the kingdom shall 
be preached in all the world for a 
witness unto all nations; and then 
shall the end come" (Matt. 24:14). 

Christ shall come to the earth as 
decreed, in a moment, without 



warning. The go,spel must be car- 
ried forward unto the uttermost 
ends of this earth, and the people 
gathered together in these moun- 
tains are the ones who shall be 
called upon to bear the burden and 
the responsibility of gathering out 
from bondage the honest in heart 
in all the world. 

This western land has been 
blessed. In all my travels through- 
out the country this year I have 
never .seen a land that has been 
blessed like the country in this in- 
termountain region. We have been 
favored of the Lord, and the Lord 
will undoubtedly call upon us, for 
he has given us wealth and means 
to provide for the future, that we 
might be able to carry on his work 
and his purposes, for they cannot 
fail. The heavens and the earth 
may pass away but the words of 
God shall not pass away, and men 
and women will have the oppor- 
tunity of knowing the truth if they 
desire it, for the gospel is in the 
earth never more to be taken away 
or given unto another people. His 
priesthood which has been estab- 
lished will he the power by which 
people may receive the truth, and 
those who have been prospered and 
cared for as sons and daughters 
growing up as "calves in the stall" 
shall be called to use their strength. 
And the day will come, and not far 
distant, when thousands of men and 
women shall be baptized into this 
Church. The purposes of the Al- 
mighty shall be fulfilled. The gos- 
pel of the Redeemer of the world 
will go into all the world. The 
Jew shall be placed back in the land 
from which he came, and this coun- 
try in which we live and of which 
we are a part will play an important 
part in the establishment of God's 
purposes with regard to the Jews, 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION. 



123 



and in the fulfilment of his prom- 
ises to them. The men and women 
who live up to the requirements 
made of God shall recognize his 
power by the Holy Ghost, which is 
given unto every man and unto 
every woman and unto every child 
when they are baptized. They are 
entitled to that Spirit and power 
and gift. 

May the peace of heaven rest 
upon us, I pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

The time allotted for this meet- 
ing has almost expired. I think 
there must be a feeling in every 
heart that we have had a profitable 
time not only in this meeting, but 
that we have also had a profitable 
and a happy time, throughout all 
the meetings of this general confer- 
ence. I hope there is a disposition 
on the part of every person who is 
present, to believe in the testimo- 
nies that have been delivered con- 
cerning the divinity of the work to 
which we have set our hands, and 
that there is an assurance that di- 
vine authority has come to the Pres- 
ident of the Church. We all should 
know, that he is the representative 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, in direct- 
ing and managing, in connection 
with his brethren, the affairs of the 
Church of Christ. When brethren 
speak highly of President Smith, or 
of the presiding authorities in the 
Church, it is not because there is 
any disposition in the minds of 
those members of the Church to 
worship men. We do not worship 
men; we rejoice in the noble char- 
acter of men. But we recognize 
and honor above all else the author- 



ity that has been conferred upon 
them by our father in heaven, 1 
trust that we all partake of the 
spirit of gooaly reverence that, 1 
understand, was made manifest in 
the days of Joseph Smith by Dr. 
tiernhisel. The good man, after 
coming to Utah, was at one time 
representative in Congress from 
the Territory of Utah, i have been 
informed that although Dr. Bern- 
hisel was a college man, a man of 
superior education, that he invar- 
iably rose to his feet when the 
Prophet came into any room where 
he was sitting, and he would remain 
standing upon his feet until the 
prophet himself would sit down. 
The prophet was embarrassed be- 
cause of the very great deference 
that was shown him by Dr. Bern- 
hisel, and remonstrated with him. 
The answer made by Dr. Bern- 
hisel when the prophet mentioned 
the matter to him was, "I delight 
to honor the man whom God hath 
honored." I think we all should 
have this same disposition to 
honor heavenly authority. We are 
not making any mistake when we 
honor the man that God has hon- 
ored, and in whom he has reposed 
his authority, and to whom he has 
given the power of the holy Apostle- 
ship, and whom he upholds and sus- 
tains as his mouthpiece and seer. 

I had the very great privilege and 
honor to accompany President 
Smith and his party, on the journey 
that was recently made through the 
settlements to the south, as far as 
St. George. It was wonderful to 
see how easily President Smith 
could be approached. Why, it only 
needed the lifting of the hands of 
the little children in the roadway 
as the president traveled along in 
his auto, to bring forth at once in- 
structions for the auto to stop, that 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he might greet and shake hands 
with the little children. The chil- 
dren swarmed around him by 
hundreds and thousands. There 
was no fear on the part of the chil- 
dren that they could not approach 
the President of the Church. All 
felt that they were in the presence 
of one who had great love for them, 
and they would climb into his auto 
without hesitation that they might 
present him bouquets of flowers, 
and manifest in every way the love 
and the confidence they had in the 
President of the Church. Not only 
did little children give evidence 
of this spirit of confidence, and this 
feeling that they were welcome by 
the President, but the aged had the 
same feeling, men and women 
came to him, whose heads were sil- 
vered or gray, and they come in 
the same confidence — no feeling 
that they must stand back, that he 
was an austere and severe man, but 
just the opposite, all coming near 
with the greatest freedom, and all 
manifesting respect for and rejoic- 
ing in the blessing, and kindly 
greeting of this great man of God. 

I felt in my soul as I listened 
to the wonderful counsels that were 
imparted by the President, and wit- 
nessed the manifestations of the 
power of God given through him, 
that he was indeed all that has been 
said of him in this conference. 
You have listened as men have 
testified concerning his worth, his 
integrity, his honesty, his love for 
the truth of the everlasting gospel, 
his willingness to labor for the sal- 
vation of the souls of men. 

I will long remember the wonder- 
ful experiences of the trip, and how 
by night and by day the word of 
the Lord came from the mouth of 
our dear President and Prophet in 



rich abundance. The people of the 
Church were comforted when- 
ever they had opportunity to greet 
him, and I believe there was a feel- 
ing in the hearts of men and 
women, the aged and the middle 
aged, the youth and the little chil- 
dren, that Joseph F. Smith is in- 
deed a pi'ophet of the living 
God. 

I thank God that in my soul there 
has come a strong love for the work 
of our Father in heaven. God has 
made me acquainted with the 
truth of this wonderful gospel. He 
has made me sure that power has 
been revealed in these latter times 
for the salvation of the human 
family. It is the greatest thing in 
the world. It is the power of God 
unto salvation ; the power that will 
bring men into communion with 
their Father in heaven, and will 
lead them back from the things of 
this world into the presence of God. 
The truth given of God for the 
salvation of men has always been 
the greatest thing in the world 
whenever it has been among 
the children of men. We make 
no extravagant statement when 
we bear testimony, and make 
the declaration that this thing that 
has come by the revelations of our 
Father in heaven, is the greatest 
and most blessed thing that can be 
found by the human family 
today. 

God help us to believe the truth, 
to uphold proper authority, -to stand 
for the right in all things, that we 
may be men and women after the 
heart of our Father in heaven. I 
pray his blessings and his peace 
upon you, and testify to you of the 
truth of this work to which we 
have set our hands, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen,

The authorities were sustained 
unanimously as in the Tabernacle 
meeting. 

The choir sang, "Now let us re- 
joice in the day of salvation/' 

The closing prayer was offered 
by President William D. Kuhre, of 
the Jordan stake of Zion. 



SECOND MEETING 
OUT-DOORS. 

A second outdoor meeting was 
held in front of the Bureau of In- 
formation Building, Elder Benja- 
min Goddard, presiding. The mu- 
sic was furnished by the Latter-day 
Saints' University choir. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"O ye mountains high." 

Prayer by David J. Smith. 
. The choir sang, "O death, where 
is thy sting." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of the Southern States 
Mission.) 

The uppermost thought in my 
heart, as I face this vast congrega- 
tion, is one of thankfulness that I 
am a member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The faith of the Latter-day Saints 
is wonderful, it is sublime ; and the 
day will yet come that it will be 
acknowledge that the splendid faith 
of this people has helped to keep 
this old world from bursting 
asunder. It is nothing but faith in 
Jesus Christ and in his gospel that 
will save this world from moral 
and spiritual decay. There are 
many causes for the greatness of 
this latter-day people, but one of 
the main causes or reasons is that 



we are led by inspired men. The 
Bible tells us that "there were 
giants in those days." There are 
giants in this day, and this Church 
is led by men richly and abundant- 
ly endowed with divine inspiration ; 
and as all the holy prophets since 
the world began have spoken as 
they were moved by the Holy 
Ghost, so do the leaders of this 
Church speak by that same living, 
divine, all-sustaining power. O 
may the Lord grant that his fear 
may be in our hearts all the live- 
long day. 

We are told by the Psalmist that 
"the heavens declare the glory of 
God." That is true ; but his will is 
not declared by his visible crea- 
tions in the heavens. The will of 
God is expressed and manifested 
through his chosen servants whom 
he hath appointed to lead latter- 
day Israel. We are told that God 
cannot be known by the reason or 
intelligence of mankind ; and I 
want to say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that all we know of 
God comes through the channels 
of the holy priesthood and of the 
gospel, which is the power of God 
unto salvation. The gospel is the 
power of God unto salvation be- 
cause, by its ordinances, by obedi- 
ence to the divine law, we may 
know God, and thus gain eternal 
life. "This is life eternal," said the 
Savior, "that they might know thee 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom thou hast sent ;" and the 
knowledge of God is obtained by 
obedience to the laws and ordi- 
nances of the gospel. 

When Nicodemus came to the 
Lord Jesus and desired to know the 
means of salvation, Jesus said, 
"Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



into the kingdom of God." Daniel 
said that the God of heaven would 
set up a kingdom that should never 
more be thrown down nor be given 
to another people. My brethren and 
sisters, that kingdom cannot be 
seen, enjoyed, nor its truths ab- 
sorbed by the souls of men unless 
they are born of water and receive 
the baptism of the Holy Ghost. 

I read in the writing's of St. Paul 
that charity or love envieth not. 
We know by modern as well as by 
ancient scripture that in the spirit 
world we had progressed as far as 
we could in our spiritual existence ; 
and that God, who is love, who can- 
not envy, because he loveth his chil- 
dren, ordained that this mortal life 
was the pathway to lead on unto 
exaltation, that we might become 
by adoption, by obedience to his 
gospel, his sons. _ So, instead of this 
mortal life being a handicap, as 
many of us sometimes feel that it 
is, it is a privilege. A mission is a 
privilege. You parents, I know, 
esteem it a joy and an opportunity 
to sacrifice your sons and daughters 
who go forth to proclaim the word 
of the living God. And to the mis- 
sionaries it is not a sacrifice, it is 
an advancement, it is a promotion, 
it is a privilege which will bring 
them and their loved ones the hon- 
or and the pleasure that cometh 
from God only. 

Now, if God had envied his chil- 
dren, would he have ordained this 
mortal existence? No. I tell you 
that men and women are led up to 
exaltation by obedience to the laws 
and ordinances of the gospel. In 
this day we hear a great deal of 
talk about our rights. Why not 
talk more about our obligations? 
Why not ponder more upon our ob- 
ligations to God, to country, to 



neighbor, and to loved ones? If 
the love of God be in our hearts, 
there is no envy; in every place a 
man will meet a brother and a 
friend, and we will desire the ad- 
vancement and the progress of our 
brethren and sisters with all our 
hearts. And so God, in his mercy,, 
ordained that this mortal existence 
should serve as a probationary 
sphere. Why? God said when he 
looked upon us in the spirit world, 
"'We will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell. And we will 
prove them herewith to see if they 
will do all things whatsoever the 
Lord their God shall command 
them.'' So this is the purpose of 
life, to obey the commandments of 
God ; and, as the Apostle John says, 
"they are not grievous." Wicked- 
ness is grievous, wickedness breaks 
the heart, wickedness breaks the 
spirit, sin is the sting of death, but- 
the righteousness of God gives joy 
and faith and hope to the human 
heart, and helps us to fight the bat- 
tel of life with a good conscience 
and with a stout heart. 

In the Doctrine and Covenants 
there is a precious promise given 
by the Lord to the men who stand 
at the head of his Church in their 
day and appointed time. Unto 
the Prophet Joseph Smith the 
Lord said, "And thy people 
shall never be turned against thee 
by the testimony of traitors." 
O what a glorious promise, that 
if the Latter-day Saints live their 
religion, they will be found sustain- 
ing their leader and honoring and 
revering the authority that God 
hath placed upon the earth for their 
salvation and to aid them in obtain- 
ing eternal exaltation! Calumny, 
slander, misriepresentation, black 
falsehoods, have rolled and surged 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



127 



around the leaders of this Church, 
traitors have borne false witness 
against them, they have sought to 
betray them; but true to his prom- 
ise, God has given his people ears 
to hear, and they hear and they 
know the voice of the shepherd and 
not the voice of a stranger ; so tint, 
with magnificent unanimity, the 
people of God stand behind their 
leaders, for they have faith in the 
Lord's promise that they shall never 
be turned against the priesthood by 
the testimony of traitors. We love 
the President of the Church, and 
we love the adornment, the author- 
ity, that God has placed upon him as 
the president of this Church. I 
am thankful because he holds the 
keys by which we can go into the 
temples of the God of heaven and 
there receive blessings that we 
could not receive if traitors had the 
power to turn us against our lead- 
ers. And so I rejoice in God's 
promise and in its glorious fulfil- 
ment, that though storms may come, 
yet as a people we shall weather the 
gale, he true to our covenants, and 
always be found supporting the 
men whom God hath placed at the 
head of this Church for the bless- 
ing of this people. 

God help us, brethren and sis- 
ters, to live our religion. May he 
fill our hearts with his love, that 
there .shall be no envy within us, 
but that we shall desire the advance- 
ment, the welfare of our neighbors. 
If this love were in the hearts of 
men today universally, there would 
be no war, but the love of God 
would lead his children along the 
path of advancement to that goal 
to which our eyes are turned, and 
to which we and all our children 
shall be blessed in attaining-, even 
the goal of eternal life, which as 



our Father has said, is the greatest 
gift that he can give to his chil- 
dren. 

I bear you my testimony that I 
know that the God of heaven is 
with this people; I know that this 
work will triumph. I know that in 
the South, North, East and West 
the word! of God is expanding ; 
this war is humbling men and 
women and bringing them to re- 
pentance, and the wave of conver- 
sion is mounting higher and higher, 
for the fear of God is filling the 
hearts of men and women and his 
goodness is leading them to repent- 
ance. And so I thankfully bear 
testimony that this work is of God, 
that our leader is his prophet, and 
that you are the people of God, Is- 
rael, led and blessed by great lead- 
ers, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of the Northern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, when 
President Smith, in his opening ad- 
dress, said that in his recent visit 
through the South, he had come to 
understand one thing, and that was 
that he would like to become better 
acquainted with the people, and 
have the people better acquainted 
with him, I thought of the time 
when Jesus tried to make the disci- 
ples understand who he was and 
what his mission was in the earth. 
In all his instructions, he almost 
failed to make them understand 
him, and he said, "Ye believe in 
God, believe also in me," and went 
so far as to intimate that if they 
could not believe in him, they 
should believe in the works that he 
had done. The Lord in all ages has 
revealed himself to his prophets and 
leaders, that they in turn may teach 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the people concerning the true char- 
acter of our Father, for to know 
God and Jesus Christ is life eternal. 

Why, my brethren and sisters, we 
were placed here upon the earth, 
and it is the mission of our Father, 
to bring to pass the immortality of 
his children here ; and he revealed 
himself to his prophets down to the 
coming of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ, and he came as a reve- 
lation of his Father to the children 
of men, and dwelt among them as 
other men, and was known of them, 
and tried his best to teach them con- 
cerning his Father and the char- 
acter of our Father in heaven. 
President Smith seemed to have the 
same feeling in his heart, to be 
known and understood by the peo- 
ple. 

I am reminded of a personal ex- 
perience that came to me. In going 
to my home town after being away 
most of the time for ten or fifteen 
years, I met a little boy, who evi- 
dently knew me and had kept in 
touch with me. I said to him, 
"What is your name, my boy?" He 
said, "Why, you know my name." 
I said, "No, I don't." He said, "Ah. 
you do, too, know my name." I 
replied that I did not and asked, 
"Who is your father?" And he 
said "Surely you know my father," 
and in answer to one or two protes- 
tations, he said to me, "Why, I 
know my father just as easy." 

The ease with which the boy 
knew his father appealed to me 
while listening to President Smith. 
You would think he knew and un- 
derstood his Father and the pur- 
poses of God just as easily as the 
little boy knew his father. Why? 
Because he has kept in touch with 
our Father, and the great work that 
our Father has established in the 
earth. He seems akin to the Mas- 



ter who, when he was only a child, 
said in answer to his mother, "Wist 
ye not that I should be about my 
Father's business?" For President 
Smith has been about his Father's 
business from boyhood. 

In all the walks and conversations 
of Jesus the Master it was as if 
he was well acquainted with his 
Father, that he knew his will, and 
understood his own mission in the 
earth. He tried from the beginning 
to impress upon the disciples that 
God was truly his Father and that 
he was in very deed his Son as well 
as they his brethren. In teaching 
them to pray, as missionaries he did 
it in this sweet and familiar way : 

"Our Father which art in heaven, 
hallowed be thy name. Thy king- 
dom come. Thy will be done in 
earth, as it is in heaven." 

And again, to Philip's question as 
to the character of the Father, he 
made the following answer, as re- 
corded in the 14th chapter of John : 
"Philip saith unto him, Lord, show 
us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been 
so long time with you, and yet hast 
thou not known me, Philip ? he that 
hath seen me hath seen the Father ; 
and how sayest thou then, Show us 
the Father?" It seemed to grieve 
the Savior that with all his teach- 
ings, one of his disciples would ask 
to see the Father, for he had taught 
them that he was in the express 
image of his Father's person, that 
he had come to do his Father's will 
and the things he had seen his 
Father do. When he had finished 
teaching his disciples and bless- 
ing them. he turned to his 
Father, in the most intimate man- 
ner and talked to him as an earth- 
Iv son would talk to his father, 
for he had tried to impress upon his 
disciples his real character and the 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



L9 



character of our Father in heaven 
as recorded in 17th chapter of John. 

"These words spake Jesus, and lift- 
ed up his eyes to heaven, and said, 
Father, the hour is come; gLorify thy 
Son, that thy Son also may glorify 
thee: As thou hast given him power 
over all flesh, that he should give eter- 
nal life to as many as thou hast given 
him. And this is life eternal, that they 
might know thee the only true God, 
and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast 
sent. 1 have glorified thee on the 
earth: 1 have finished the work which 
thou gavest me to do. And now, O 
Father, glorify thou me with thine 
own self with the glory which I had 
with thee before the world was. I 
have manifested thy name unto the 
men which thou gavest me out of the 
world: thine they were, and thou 
gavest them me; and they have kept 
thy word. Now they have known that 
all things whatsoever thou hast given 
me are of thee. For I have given unto 
them the words which thou gavest 
me; and they have received them, and 
have known surely that I came out 
from thee, and they have believed that 
thou didst send me. I pray for them: 
I pray not for the world, but for them 
which thou hast given me; for they 
are thine. And all mine are thine, and 
thine are mine; and I am glorified in 
them." 

To me that is one of the most 
beautiful passages I have ever read 
in my life. After his close associa- 
tion with his diciples, to turn to his 
Father and talk to him as one man 
talketh to another ! He knew his 
Father "easy."' 

I believe that Latter-day Saints 
who live their religion have a right 
to know God our Father "easy," 
since it is only a continuation of 
their childhood idea of God. When 
one lives in the world and meets 
men and women of other faiths who 
are taught from childhood to get 
such a material notion out of their 
head and learn to conceive of God 
as the best in themselves, their 



"highest ideal," or some "great 
moving power beyond the concep- 
tion of man," it appeals to me that 
it is good to be still children, be- 
lieving in the God that "created 
man in his own image," the God 
that hears and answers prayers, our 
Father who claims us as his chil- 
dren. Some of the learned men in 
the world have said that we were 
almost vulgarly materialistic. It 
seems to me that no man was more 
of a materialist than the Master 
himself. He knew his Father from 
the beginning, and talked with him 
and conversed with him, and talked 
about him as if he actually existed. 
To the Latter-day Saints he is a 
material God, he is our Father, and 
we believe in him. We also believe 
in Jesus Christ the Redeemer of the 
world, the veritable Son of God, 
who was sent to earth to point the 
way, to do the things that he de- 
sired all his children to do, that we, 
too, may be glorified when our 
earthly missions are ended. 

On the occasion spoken of above 
he said : 

"If ye love me, keep my com- 
mandments , and I will pray the 
Father and he shall give you an- 
other comforter that he may abide 
with you forever." 

"The works that I do ye shall do, 
and greater works, because I go to 
the Father." 

So. my brethren and sisters, I feel 
that the Latter-day Saints have a 
mission in the world, and that is to 
teach the world to return to their 
chiF'hood faith, to come back and 
believe in God as they did when 
thev were little children, for he said, 
"Fxcept ye be as a little child, ye 
can in no wise enter into the king- 
dom of heaven" — not children in 
vears, but children in our honest be- 
lief in God our Father and his Son, 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Savior of the world. I can bear 
testimony that it has given me a 
great deal of joy to see the faith 
manifested in the life of the young 
men and young women who have 
come to the Northern States Mis- 
sion. I believe that true faith is 
growing in the hearts of the people 
of the world. It is my firm belief 
that had the Christian world a be- 
lief in God as they had when they 
were children, they would not now 
be engaged in killing their fellow 
men, in using all the ability that is 
known to man for the destruction 
of each other. The mission of the 
Latter-day Saints, my brethren and 
sisters, is to bring the world back 
to believe in God as true and faith- 
ful children ought to do, and hasten 
the day of peace and true brother- 
hood. 

We have a little advantage over 
the rest of the world, because our 
Father has supplemented the teach- 
ings in the scriptures by a visita- 
tion to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Together with the Savior he ap- 
peared manifesting his true charac- 
ter and clearing away all doubt as 
to their actual existence. This mod- 
ern day visitation has placed us in 
a position to know our Father and 
to know his Son Jesus Christ, and 
as Latter-day Saints, we ought to 
praise God for this glorious revela- 
tion of the latter days, for it has 
brought us happiness on earth, it 
has brought us even a taste of 
heaven while we dwell here in mor- 
tal flesh. 

The mission and responsibility of 
the Latter-day Saints has been and 
is to teach these great truths to the 
world. In doing so they do real 
service to their fellow man which 
is described by one man as stepping 
across the line in to heaven. Selfish 
work is earthly, while work for 



others is akin to heavenly things, so 
'"if you want to go to heaven, step 
across the line and do things for 
your fellow man." Latter-day 
Saints, especially all those who 
have been upon a mission and all 
those who are serving as mission- 
aries here at home, administering 
to the sick, teaching the principles 
of the gospel, and serving their fel- 
low men, have stepped across the 
line and are even enjoying heaven 
upon earth. When the missionaries 
come home to you, they say it is 
the best two years of their life. 
They have enjoyed the spirit and 
presence of the Lord and a real 
taste of heaven. Why? Because 
they have been using all their time 
and talents in the service of their 
fellow men. When you are in the 
service of your fellow man, you are 
in the service of God our Father. 
So says the Book of Mormon. 
And surely, when a man is in the 
service of God our Father, he can 
easily be in heaven. 

The truth revealed from heaven 
has made us free, and, as has been 
said by some of the speakers, we 
are a free people, living in a free 
land, the most glorious land in all 
the world. We sing and talk 
about the inspired constitution of 
the United States. Why was it es- 
tablished? That the Church of 
Jesus Christ might be established in 
the earth. Not only that, but this 
same freedom that we enjoy, the 
whole world must also enjoy, be- 
cause the day must come when 
every man will have a chance to 
hear the gospel and to decide for 
himself which way he will go. Else 
when they come before the judg- 
ment seat, they can say to the 
Father, "I could not be anything 
else but a Catholic, or a Presbyter- 
ian, or a Lutheran, and be true to

my country, so, the freedom of 
America must be the freedom of 
the world, that the gospel may be 
carried to the honest in heart of 
all the earth, that they may have 
a chance to know the true way. 

We did not win this freedom 
without a struggle. Eight years of 
war and four years of civil strife is 
part of the .price we paid. In the 
revolution we were greatly aided 
by France, and at the surrender 
at Yorktown, when Cornwallis 
marched between the lines, there 
were 5,500 American soldiers on 
one side and 7,000 Frenchmen on 
the other. France not only sent 
her sons but she sent her gold as 
well and that too in the very hour of 
need. We are now called upon to 
send our sons to battle in the old 
world that they too may enjoy the 
liberty that has been ours for so 
many, many years and likewise the 
glorious privilege of hearing the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. The Lord 
bless the Latter-day Saints, and 
help them as well as all our brothers 
in this nation, to acquit themselves 
like men and as one man has said, 
return with victory upon their ban- 
ner and a wreath of laurel woven 
out of the evergreen of Russia, the 
roses of England, and the lillies of 
France. I pray God that our boys 
will not only come back with a 
wreath of that kind, but clean and 
pure from the sins of the world, 
come home testifying that God 
opened the way for them to be 
great missionaries, not only of lib- 
erty, but of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, having had their faith in- 
creased, having had their knowl- 
edge extended, and with a testi- 
mony that will make all our hearts 
ring with praise to God, as we are 
sending them away. 

God help us, to serve our fellow 



men. God help us to- know not 
only the leaders of this Church 
"easy," as the boy said, but our 
Father in heaven. If we will keep 
close to our leaders, and know them 
as they are, we will likewise know 
God as he is. I pray that the peace 
and blessings of heaven may be 
with you, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. ,

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of the Western States 
Mission.) 

"The character of a community 
or a nation is the sum of the indi- 
vidual qualities of its component 
members." The words I have just 
quoted are from the opening sen- 
tence of a paper supplied by Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith to a great 
newspaper syndicate asking him for 
his opinion about one of the most 
important themes of the day. The 
subject was captioned, "Unchast- 
ity, the Dominating Evil of the 
Age." His masterful treatment of 
that theme showed that a deplor- 
able condition exists in this coun- 
try, as I presume in all other coun- 
tries, a condition, too, that none of 
us, I believe, would attempt to 
deny. 

It is eminently proper that we 
look this situation squarely in the 
face, and that as Latter-day Saints 
we act accordingly, not only be- 
cause of the condition as it might 
appear to us, in ordinary times, but 
moreso when we face, as we do 
now, one of the greatest perils and 
one of the most crucial situations 
that has ever been known in the 
earth. Our young men have enlist- 
ed or have been called by the thous- 
ands to fight for human liberty. We

have joined some of the great pow- 
ers of the world to that end, and 
this country must stand at some 
time or other as the great ad- 
judicator between the nations of 
the world. It will be up to this 
nation to decide what is best to be 
done, and how best to do it to set- 
tle the well nigh insurmountable 
difficulties that have arisen, and to 
do ,so justly we must be just and 
ethical ourselves. Shall it be said 
that our young men went away 
from their homes chaste and pure, 
and that they returned contami- 
nated with immorality, and with 
disease in their systems ? This will 
be true unless they themselves have 
been taught in their youth to be 
moral and chaste, and unless they 
remember the words of their par- 
ents and teachers when they face 
the critical temptations as they 
come to them from time to time. 

Do you know that more men of 
one of the great nations were put 
out of commission because of sex- 
ual disease than by bullets or 
swords or dynamite or any other 
thing, in the first year of this 
world war? Since that time, they 
have begun to correct these evils. 
We want to correct them before 
they go too far. We want all our 
young men to know, and those as- 
sociated with them to know, that 
they should set the example and 
tell other men what it means to re- 
spect womanhood. No man should 
presume to take a liberty with any 
woman that he would not be willing 
for some one else to take with his 
own mother, his wife, or his sis- 
ter. We should remember that 
"real happiness must be earned, like 
every other good thing. It can 
only be deserved when its price has 
somehow been paid." If we are 
going to be supremely happy, if we 



are going to be content, we must 
sacrifice, we must live a moral life. 
We should in all reason live above 
reproach. I mean that not only for 
soldiers, but for every son and 
daughter in Zion. 

One of the great poets had this 
to say on this matter, and entitled, 
"The Price He Paid" : 

"I said I would have my fling, 

And do as a young man may, 
And I didn't believe a thing 

The parsons had to say^ 
And I didn't believe in a God 

Who gives us blood like fire, 
And flings us into hell 

When we answer the call of desire. 

And I said, Religion is rot, 

And the laws of the world are nil, 
And the bad man is one who is caught 

And cannot pay his bill. 
And there is no place called hell; 

And heaven is only a truth 
When a man has his way with a maid 

In the fresh, keen hours of youth. 

But money will buy us grace 

When it falls on the plate of the 
Church, 

And money will neatly erase 
Each sign of a sinful smirch. 

For I saw men everywhere 
Hotfooting the road to vice, 

And women and preachers smiled on 
them 

So long as they had the price. 

So I had my joy of life, 

And went the pace of the town, 
And then I took me a wife 

And began to settle down. 
I had gold enough and to spare 

For all the simple joys 
That go with a house and a home 

And a brood of girls and boys. 

I married a girl with health 
And virtue and spotless fame: 

I gave in return my wealth 
And a proud old family name. 

I gave her the love of a heart 
Grown sated and sick with sin; 

My deal with the devil was all cleaned 
up, 

The last bill was handed in. 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK.

She was going to bring me a child, 

And when in labor she cried, 
With joy and fear I was wild, 

And now, I wish I had died. 
The son she bore me was blind, 

And crippled, and weak, and sore; 
The mother was left a wreck; 

It was so she settled my score. 

I said I would have my way, 
Arid they all knew the path I would 
go, 

Yet no one told me a thing 
Of what I ought to know. 

Folks talk too much of the lives 
From heavenly joys debarred, 

And not enough of the babes unborn, 
By the sins of their fathers scarred. 

Do not forget, my brethren and 
sisters, that if we sow in iniquity, 
in corruption, in lust, and in wick- 
edness, we will reap the whirlwind, 
and the price will somehow and in- 
evitably be paid, and every one of 
us will suffer — not only for our ac- 
tual deeds, we are told, but perhaps 
for our thinking as well. 

Wise men say that the source of 
everything wicked can be traced 
back to the philosophic thinking of 
the doer, just as bitter water is 
traced back to the poison spring; 
and that as individuals or nations 
think in the heart, so will they do 
in the life. I believe that firmly, 
and I believe that there is every ne- 
cessity for the mothers and the 
fathers in Israel to see that their 
sons and their daughters are pro- 
tected, and that when they are old 
enough to- know the things they 
ought to know, that they should not 
hesitate to tell them frankly and 
plainly what they have to meet, and 
let young men understand that they 
should try and maintain the same 
kind of morals that are demanded 
of their sisters. That is the kind 
of ethics we have been teaching 
and preaching; it is a part of the 



fundamental teaching of "Mormon- 
ism." 

I wonder how far the criticism 
aimed by President Smith in his 
article is true pertaining to this in- 
termountain country. Should it be 
said that even one portion of it 
could be laid at our door, then let 
us remember our duties to our chil- 
dren in that regard. The illus- 
trious Goethe said, "What we wish 
for in our youth comes in heaps 
upon us in old age." You know as 
well as I know, that that is true. If 
we are not careful in early man- 
hood and womanhood, we will reap 
the consequences in later life, and 
life will become a living hell on 
earth instead of a heaven as it 
ought to be. 

God grant his blessing to be with 
Israel, to be with our boys who are 
going away to fight our battles, to 
be with those sons who are in the 
mission field and those who are 
left at home, that we may continue 
to raise the standard of morals in 
this community, and thus benefit by 
our action aud our words, the moral 
uplift of the world, I pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I am not accustomed to speak in 
audiences out of doors. I have al- 
ways had them closed in where 
they could not get away. (Laugh- 
ter.) Brethren and sisters and 
friends, I want to bless you people, 
in the name of the Lord, for he 
surely ought to bless a people who 
hunger and thirst after righteous- 
ness enough to stand up as you 
have stood and listen to the word of 
the Lord. 

I bless you, as I have blessed 
hundreds and hundreds of elders 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who have gone on missions. I 
have had many of them come back 
and say, "Brother Kimball, every 
promise you made has been ful- 
filled." One of the easiest things 
to do in the Church in our ministry- 
is to bless an elder or a missionary 
sister who goes out in the service 
of the Lord and does his will and 
keeps his commandments. I have 
never been afraid up to date to 
promise them that they would go in 
peace and return in safety. 

Why fear .death ? That is what I 
am talking about to myself all the 
time. People have been looking for 
it in every case for a considerable 
length of time, but I have fooled 
them up to date ;and I am trying 
to learn not to fear death. A great 
man said when he went down with 
the ship, "Why fear death? It 
is the most beautiful adventure of 
life." He must have been exalted 
by a spiritual enthusiasm such as 
elders have when they go out into 
the world in the service of the 
Lord. They feel as Christ felt 
when he said, "Think not of your 
life, of what you shall eat, or of 
what you shall drink, nor of your 
body what you shall put on." I 
want to say, on the side, that is 
about all we are thinking about, at 
least some of us. 

My brethren and sisters, the 
short time I occupy I want to say 
to you, my knowledge is very lim- 
ited, and it does not take me very 
long to tell it, but what I do know, 
I know as well as any man in this 
Church from the least to the great- 
est. Why do I know it ? Because I 
have learned it through the things 
which I have suffered. We have 
to suffer .sometimes to find things 
out; until our hearts are twisted, 
before we are meek and humble 
and have faith in God. 



I remember reading a story. 
The incident happened during the 
civil war, when a large committee 
of Christian ministers came to 
Washington to wait on President 
Abraham Lincoln. After they had 
performed their duties, one of 
the Christian ministers turned to 
President Lincoln, and he said, "I 
hope the Lord is on our side." 
That is what all these nations are 
hoping, that the Lord is on their 
side. And President Lincoln said, 
"Well, I am not much concerned 
about the Lord being on our side," 
which was quite a shock to those 
ministers. "I am not concerned 
about that. What I am most con- 
cerned about is whether we are on 
the Lord's side." That is what I 
want you to be concerned about, 
you men who hold the holy priest- 
hood ; you want to remember, in 
this great rush and hurry, not to be 
too much taken up with man's bus- 
iness, but you want to be exercised 
more about "our Father's busi- 
ness." 

You have listened to three presi- 
dents of missions — the Southern, 
Northern, and Western States Mis- 
sions. I know just about as much 
about missionary work as they do. 
I spent five years in the Southern 
States, and filled my first mission, 
in 1883, when they killed elders. I 
was with Elder Roberts, and I 
know all about that experience. I 
never got much notoriety out of it, 
but I know something about it, just 
as much as anyone who was there. 
I know what it means to smell 
powder, and I am glad of it, and I 
thank the Lord I did not run. I 
guess I would have done so, but I 
had no place to go. (Laughter.) 
These brethren that have been talk- 
ing to you have been in the Lord's 
service, they are soldiers of the

Cross, and they are too old to go in 
the army of the United States ; and 
so am I. But I would like to 
touch off a 13-inch gun anyhow. 
(Laughter.) I am a great believer 
in the United States, but my service 
is first for God, for our heavenly 
Father. Do you remember when 
the Savior, Jesus Christ, was of the 
age of twelve? I think it was 
quoted at this meeting. He was 
in Jerusalem talking with those 
learned men and hearing and ar- 
guing with them, and his mother 
came back for him very much con- 
cerned. He said, "Wist ye not 
that I must be about my Father's 
business?" That is what we want 
to be concerned about. 

I think you recognize the fact that 
I am the son of a prophet of God. 
And I am mighty proud of it. 
Heber C. Kimball, a short time be- 
fore he died, often said to the peo- 
ple, "O, the test, the test, the test 
— who will be able to stand? And 
the answer comes back, 'Only 
those who know that Jesus is the 
Christ.' " Don't go off and forget 
it. There is a great test on, and it 
is only those who know that Jesus 
is the Christ that will be able to 
stand. I want to say to you breth- 
ren that if it is the last time I 
speak in the flesh, I feel that I am 
greater than a king on his throne, 
I am so much bigger than the 
Kaiser that I would not mention 
him in the .same breath. (Laugh- 
ter.) Why? Because I hold the 
priesthood of God, because I am a 
servant of God, because it is my 
right and privilege when I keep 
the commandments of God, to test- 
ify under the spirit of prophecy and 
revelation of this great truth. 

I am going to ask you a few ques- 
tions, and will let you answer them. 
Tf you don't know enough to an- 



swer them, then you don't know as 
much as I do. (Laughter.) I am 
going to ask you this question, Do 
you know of anything — you can 
think about your money, your 
wives, and children, and everything 
else — but do you know of anything 
in all this beautiful world more im- 
portant than human life? If you 
do, just hold up your hands. 

I am going to ask it in another 
way : "Do you know of anything 
in all this universe that is dearer to 
the Father than a human soul? 
You don't. 

I am going to ask you another 
question : Do you know of any gift 
in all this world, or blessing, that 
is greater than salvation? No, be- 
cause God said in the revelation 
that "salvation is the greatest gift 
of God to his children." These are 
reasons why you ought to be in the 
service of the Lord. That is why 
these presidents of missions and el- 
ders are blessed, and that is why we 
are able to come home as I did from 
the South in 1884 — and it is one of 
the greatest truths I ever told in my 
life — although I never had as hard 
a time in all my life as I had in 
the South, and when I think of it 
now, T actually shudder ; — and yet T 
came home to you people, and I 
looked you in the face and I told 
you it was the happiest time of all 
my life, and I never lied, either. 
That is what you get for being in 
the service of the Lord. 

I will conclude by reading to you 
from the Book of Mormon. It 
has impressed me very much, and I 
want you to think about it just as 
I have been doing. 

Therefore may God grant unto you, 
my brethren, that ye may begin to 
exercise your faith unto repentance, 
that ye begin to call upon his holy 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



name, that he would have mercy upon 
you ; 

Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for 
he is mighty to save; 

Yea, humble yourselves, and con- 
tinue in prayer unto him; 

Cry unto him when ye are in your 
fields; yea, over all your flocks; 

Cry unto him in your houses, yea, 
over all your household, both morn- 
ing, mid-day, and evening; 

Yea, cry unto him against the power 
of your enemies; 

Yea, cry unto him against the devil, 
who is an enemy to all righteousness. 

Cry unto him over the crops of 
your fields, that ye may prosper in 
them; 

Cry over the flo.cks .of your fields, 
that they may increase. 

But this is not all; ye must pour 
out your souls in your closets, and 
your secret places, and in your wil- 
derness ; 

Yea, and when you do not cry unto 
the Lord, let your hearts be full, 
drawn out in prayer unto him con- 
tinually for your welfare, and also for 
the welfare of those who are around 
you. 

And now behold, my beloved breth- 
ren, I say unto you, do not suppose 
that this is all; for after ye have done 
all these things, if ye turn away the 
needy, and the naked, and visit not 
the sick and afflicted, and impart of 
your substance, if ye have, to those 
who stand in need; I say unto you, 
if ye do not any of these things, be- 
hold, your prayer is vain, and avail- 
eth you nothing, and ye are as hypo- 
crites who do deny the faith; 

Therefore, if ye do not remember to 
be charitable, ye are as dross, which 
the refiners do cast out, (it being of 
no worth,) and is trodden under foot 
of men. 

Try and remember that, will you ? 

As a servant of the Lord, I only 
want to repeat what the servants of 
God have said : "These are the last 
days, spoken of by the prophets, 
when perilous times shall come;" 
and you know, as I know, by what 
we read, that the most striking 
feature of this world war is the 
great destruction of life, which 



owes its success, if there be success, 
to the employment of almost all the 
science of the world, except the 
numerous discoveries in surgery 
and medicine which is freely given, 
ar.d the physician, as a physician, 
knows no difference between races 
and nations, between friend and 
foe. 

This is the biggest thing that 
physicians ever did, and I pray God 
to bless them in their efforts to save 
life. 

There has never been a time such 
as the present in the history of the 
world, when men ought to be talk- 
ing big things, thinking big things, 
doing big things and overcoming 
their selfishness. It is a day of 
destruction, and leaders must be 
raised up who are constructive. 
Constructive work sometimes means 
destructive — you tear down to 
build up — you change the old 
for the new. Leaders must have a 
knowledge of mankind in order that 
the Lord's plans may be carried out. 

The German nation is one of the 
greatest nations today, when we 
consider her social and industrial 
condition, although it is founded on 
militarism. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints as it has been or- 
ganized through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, is more perfectly or- 
ganized and greater than any or- 
ganization upon the earth. 

When you contemplate this great 
organization you find prophets and 
inspiration which is not founded on 
militarism, but brotherhood, fra- 
ternity, and "love-one-another," 
which is in accordance with the 
teachings of Jesus Christ. The 
great test was : "By this shall all 
men know that ye are my disciples, 
if ye have love one to another." 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



137 



If you have not love for one an- 
other you have not the spirit of the 
gospel. 

May the Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(President of the Bureau of Informa- 
tion.) 

My brethren and sisters: This 
brings our conference to a close, in 
connection with the other meetings" 
that are now being held. While I 
have sat here and also in the taber- 
nacle, I have wondered what the re- 
sult of this great conference will be. 
Have we come just to listen and go 
home in the same condition that we 
came ? There may be some, but the 
great mass of the people, I trust, 
are inspired by the exercises of this 
conference to go home and live ac- 
cording to all the teachings that 
have been given. "Let your light 
so shine that others, seeing your 
good works, may be led to glorify 
our Father which is in heaven." 

Upon this block we entertain the 
strangers from all parts of the 
world. During the past week, a 
gentleman entered the building 
here, a perfect stranger, coming 
from the state of Ohio. He wanted 
to learn about our people, and after 
he had been entertained, he said, "I 
have working for me at my home a 
member of your Church, and I want 
to say that if all your members are 
as honest, as true, as devoted, and 
as trustworthy as that man, you 
need to be proud." 

Well, we are proud. With all our 
shortcomings, we may be proud of 
our people ; and I trust that the 
record we are making will continue. 

Brother Herrick referred espe- 
cially to the necessity of training 



our youth in virtue, in godliness. I 
visited a southern stake of Zion, 
just recently, in conection with our 
Church work, and met a poor 
widow there, who had raised to 
manhood and womanhood a^splen- 
<"id family, and when she was 
speaking to me, she said that the 
remark of one of her boys had been 
worth all her efforts. "Last Christ- 
mas," she said, "I did not have the 
means to distribute the tokens to 
my children that I would like, and 
to my youngest son, who was mar- 
ried, I said, 'My boy, O my heart 
aches that I cannot give to you and 
to the rest of my children some 
substantial token at Christmas time 
of my love for you.' And the 
young man stood there looking his 
mother in the eyes, and said, 'Why, 
mother, you have given unto me 
something more than all the Christ- 
mas gifts that I could possibly ob- 
tain. You have given me a good 
training, a good education, and 
more than all, a clean body — and, 
mother, I thank you for that pre- 
cious gift that has come unto me. 
urd I want to live to be worthy of 
such a mother.' " 

May God bless us, my brethren 
and sisters. Let us go to our 
homes with renewed determination, 
as a result of this conference, to 
serve God, to be honest, true, 
chaste, virtuous, according to the 
declaration in our Articles of Faith, 
doing good unto all men. God 
bless you. Amen. 

The authorities of the Church 
were sustained unanimously as in 
the Tabernacle meeting. 

The Latter-day Saints' Univer- 
sity choir sang a chorus, "Victory." 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"O ye mountains high."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder B. Cecil Gates. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle the conference 
was called to order at 2 p. m., by 
President Joseph F. Smith, who 
presided. 

The Tabernacle choir and the 
congregation sang the hymn : 
"Z'on stands with hills surround- 
ed." 

The opening prayer was offered 
bv President Wilford Day, of the 
Parowan stake of Zion. 

A tenor solo, "An Hour of 
Peace," was sung by James H. 
Neilson. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Are there few that be saved? — Christ's 
provisional and incomplete answer 
in the meridian dispensation — Car- 
ried forward in the later dispensa- 
tion — Another illustrative instance 
— Sermon of the shepherd and the 
sheep — Lay hold on eternal life. 

At this closing session of the gen- 
eral conference, it is possible to look 
in retrospect over what has been 
said in the earlier meetings. I have 
followed with interest the remarks 
of every speaker and, as each one 
closed, I have felt that had I then 
been called to speak I could have 
taken up the theme of the discourse 
and carried it on, having the spirit 
of it and feeling the genius of it, 
so full of suggestion and instruc- 
tion has been every address. 

I listened with particular and 
peculiar interest to the remarks of 
the brethren this morning relating 
to science, falsely so-called, and to 
the truths that have been revealed 



respecting man and his position in 
Nature ; and as I have given that 
subject some attention through 
many years I was prepared to say 
something; but I shall content my- 
self now with a simple expression 
of perfect accord and agreement 
with the spirit of what was said. 
We learned from the addresses 
given this morning a little regard- 
ing the origin of man — whence he 
came ; and we have heard through 
other addresses much as to where 
he is going. I feel rather inclined 
to dwell briefly upon the subject of 
his present duty, the duty of the 
day and the duty of the hour. 

In that regard I remember a very 
significant question that was sub- 
mitted to the Christ. We all know 
how he was subjected to question- 
ing on many occasions, the purpose 
of the questioner sometimes being 
to entrap him, if possible, in some 
incautious word, or to lead him to 
some overt utterance or act, where- 
by it was hoped to find excuses for 
accusation. Some of the questions, 
however, seemed to have been in- 
spired by worthy intent, and of this 
kind is the one to which I ask your 
attention. 

As I read in the 13th chapter of 
Luke, beginnig with the 22nd verse 
— Christ was on his way to Jeru- 
salem, the last journey he was to 
take through the provinces and up 
to the capital, for although there 
were some brief interruptions, this 
was in effect his march to the cross 
and to the tomb. He traveled 
slowlv, teaching in the towns, on 
the high-ways and in the by-ways, 
wherever people would pause to lis- 
ten. Tn the course of such min- 
istry the following incident oc- 
curred, as he went through the 
cities and villages teaching and 
journeying toward Jerusalem : 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE.

"Then said one unto him, Lord, are 
there few that be saved?" 

Consider the question. It is just 
as important today as it was then. 
It is recorded in the short, lapidar 
style of the scriptural record, terse, 
concise, condensed. Putting it into 
our modern speech, it meant this: 
Lord, tell us, of the thousands and 
millions living upon the earth and 
of the untold myriads that have 
lived and died and of all that are 
to come into the flesh, will there 
be a majority, many, saved, or only 
a few? Hasn't that question pre- 
sented itself to you individually ? I 
believe it has come up in the heart 
of every earnest student of the gos- 
pel, of every prayerful investigator 
of the truth. "Lord, are there few 
that be saved," or will the most of 
us be saved and only a few be 
lost? Note his rejoinder — response 
— it is not an answer : 

"Then said one unto him, Lord, are 
there few that be saved? And he said 
unto them, 

"Strive to enter in at the strait 
gate; for many, I say unto you, will 
seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 

"When once the master of the 
house is risen up, and hath shut to 
the door and ye begin to stand with- 
out, and to knock at the door, saying, 
Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he 
shall answer 'and say unto you, I 
know you not whence ye are. 

"Then shall ye begin to say, We 
have eaten and drunk in thy presence, 
and thou hast taught in our streets. 

"But he shall say, I tell you, I know 
you .not whence ye are; depart from 
me, all ye workers of iniquity. 

"There shall be weeping and gnash- 
ing of teeth, when ye shall see Abra- 
ham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the 
prophets, in the kingdom of God, and 
you yourselves thrust out. 

"And they shall come from the east, 
and from the west, and from the 
north and from the south, and shall 
sit down in the kingdom of God. 

"And behold there are last which 



shall be first, and there are first which 
shall be last." 

I ask your attention to a very 
grievous mistranslation in that 
scripture. The error is expressed 
by misleading punctuation. This 
•division of the scriptures into chap- 
ters and verses, is, as you know, a 
comparatively modern innovation 
and it has been made by the best 
skill and wisdom of men, but men's 
skill sometimes fails and men's wis- 
dom may come to naught. The 
error in question is none the less 
grievous because it is one of punc- 
tuation only rather than of word- 
ing. Here is one of the errors 
against which we protect ourselves 
in our declaration of faith when 
we say, "We believe the Bible to be 
the word of God .as far as it is 
translated correctly." We do not 
follow the mistranslations. This is 
not peculiarly or particularly "Mor- 
mon" criticism. Scholars, theo- 
logians, philologists of the day ad- 
mit the mistake but there it stands. 
I want to read to you again the 
passage as it is, and then read it to 
you as it should be, according to 
the best authority we have. Christ 
said to them in response to their 
question : "Strive to enter in at the 
strait srate, for many, I say unto 
you, will seek to enter in and shall 
not be able." There endeth the 
twentv- fourth verse, and the twen- 
tv-fifth verse, beginning a new sen- 
tence, reads : 

"When once the master of the 
house is risen up, and hath shut to 
the door and ye begin to stand 
without and to knock at the door," 
and so forth. Now, there should 
be no period there ; there should be 
no division in the verses and the 
passage should read in this wise : 

"Strive to enter in at the strait

gate, for many, I say unto you, 
will seek to enter in, and shall not 
b,e able when once the master of the 
house is risen up, and hath shut to 
the door." 

Do you see the difference in 
meaning? One is an indicative 
statement only, however great its 
portent; the other brings in the 
time element and the fact that there 
is opportunity which will pass — 
Strive to enter in now because many 
will come seeking to get in and 
will not be able when once the mas- 
ter of the house hath risen up and 
hath shut to the door. It is all in 
line with the tenor of the scripture, 
with the words of Paul and the 
other apostles. Do you call to mind 
the urgent behest — Lay hold on the 
kingdom and on eternal life while 
you can. Don't procrastinate. 
And that in harmony with the voice 
of the Book of Mormon prophets — 
Don't procrastinate the day of your 
repentance, or you may find it im- 
possible to repent when you would. 
I commend this .scripture to you, as 
recorded by Luke ; but coming back 
to the question : 

Didn't you feel a little disap- 
pointed at the fact that Christ did 
not give a plain answer to that ques- 
tion ? I did : I felt disappointed 
when I first read it, when I first 
pondered it so far as I can remem- 
ber, and I have had a little disap- 
pointment many times since. Oh, 
if he had only answered that 
squarely and definitely, how much 
more satisfied or dissatisfied, as the 
case may be, we would severally 
find ourselves. Will many or only 
few be saved? Suppose he had an- 
swered, Oh, most of you, most of 
vou, there will only be a few lost. 
Wouldn't we have taken license 
from it, wouldn't we have given 
way to carelessness even more 



than we do? Suppose he had said 
— Only a few will be .saved and all 
the great majority will be lost and 
be forever condemned and be thrust 
out into outer darkness. What a 
gloomy picture it would have been. 
But why didn't Christ answer the 
question? It seems to have been 
put in earnestness, it was not a 
trick question, there does not seem 
to have been any trap concealed in 
it: "Lord, are there few that be 
saved?" Would it not have been 
an easy matter for him to answer 
it in a direct way? But he evades 
it, and gives us a sermon, a very- 
beautiful and encouraging sermon, 
it is true, one embodying great 
truth, but it does not answer the 
question directly, and why? For 
the reason, the very same reason 
that operated to cut many another 
sermon of his so short. Have you 
not read his sermons and time and 
time again been disappointed be- 
cause he closed so abruptly? 

Let me digress a moment and 
illustrate by another incident. Read 
for yourselves, for I have not time 
to read it, in the 10th chapter of 
John, beginning, at the 16th verse. 
He was delivering at the time there 
referred to that splendid discourse 
of his concerning the shepherd and 
the sheep. He was explaining the 
difference between a shepherd and a 
sheepherder, a vital difference, and 
in the course of his remarks, he 
paused to tell them that there were 
other sheep not of that fold. Picture 
him discoursing about himself as 
the shepherd and about his follow- 
ers as the sheep. He says in the 
15th verse : 

"As the Father knoweth me, eyen 
so know I the Father; and I lay 
down my life for the sheep." 

Now comes the interpolation : 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



141 



"And other sheep 1 have, which are 
not of this fold; them also I must 
bring, and they shall hear my voice; 
and there shall be one fold, and one 
shepherd." 

And now, mark you, that is all 
he says about that phase, that par- 
ticular topic. He goes right back 
to the subject broken off in the 
earlier verse: 

"Therefore doth my Father love m.e, 
because I lay down my life." 

Now, haven't you wished, when 
you read that, that you could have 
heard more? The question natur- 
ally arises in our minds, Didn't he 
po.ssibly say more, which was left 
out by the recorder? No, he did 
not. That is all he said about that 
subject at the time. If you want to 
read the rest of that sermon, turn 
to the 15th chapter of the third 
book of Nephi. That is where he 
picked it up again and carried it on. 
Like many another of his sermons, 
this was begun on one continent 
and carried on on another, as we 
find some of his sermons begun in 
one dispensation and carried for- 
ward in a later one. Now, in the 
3rd book of Nephi. 15th chapter 
vou will find that Christ picks up 
the theme of that discourse where 
he left it off in Jerusalem. Christ 
there tells his Nephite disciples and 
the people generally that he had 
been teaching in Jerusalem accord- 
ing to the commandment of the 
Father, and he says : 

"And not at any time hath the 
Father given me commandment that 
T should tell it unto your brethren at 
Jerusalem ; 

"Neither at any time hath the 
Father given me commandment that 
T should tell unto them concerning 
the other tribes of the house of Israel, 
whom the Father hath led away out 
of the land. 



"This much did the Father com- 
mand me, that I should tell unto 
them, 

"That other sheep I have, which 
are ,not ,of this fold; them also must 
I bring, and they shall hear my voice; 
and there shall be one fold, and one 
shepherd." 

The next verse explains why he 
had not said more to the people at 
Jerusalem : 

"And now because of stiffnecked- 
ness and unbelief, they understood 
not my word; therefore I was com- 
manded to say no more ,of the Father 
concerning this thing unto them." 

Read the intervening verses for 
yourselves and then note this in the 
21st verse : 

"And verily I ,say unto you" — 
these are his words to the Nephites 
— "That ye are they of whom I 
said, other sheep I have which are 
not of this fold ; them also I must 
bring, and they shall hear my voice ; 
and there shall be one fold and one 
shepherd." 

In the next chapter he carries the 
same sermon regarding other sheep 
a little further, and makes plain that 
there yet are other sheep of still 
another fold to whom or to which 
he was then about to go. Thus we 
find these splendid addresses oft- 
times divided up — one part in one 
volume and another part continued 
in the next. 

So it was with this particular 
sermon regarding the sheep, the 
shepherd and the sheep-herder, and 
so regarding this question again, 
"Lord, are there few that be 
saved?" He answered it in part, giv- 
ing the questioner and hearers very 
direct warning, telling them to en- 
ter in at the strait gate while they 
had a chance, because after the 
Master of the house hath arisen tip 
and shut to the door they will knock 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in vain, and when they plead that 
they have known him, he will an- 
swer that he has never known them. 
He warns them against assuming 
that because they had citizenship 
in Israel they would be saved 
thereby, and tells them of the dire 
consequences of their neglect, when 
they shall see the prophets enter into 
the place prepared for them and 
they themselves shut out, when they 
shall see others coming from the 
east and from the west and from 
the north and from the south to sit 
clown with Abraham and Isaac and 
Jacob and yet and still and never- 
theless, they themselves shut out. 

But, as said before, he did not 
answer the question fully, "Lord, 
are there few that be saved?" The 
reason was precisely analogous to 
that which prevented him from car- 
rying on his sermon regarding those 
other .sheep, because of the people's 
unbelief, stiffneckedness, and in- 
ability to comprehend. Those Jews 
had been brought up in all the tradi- 
tions of the law and the thousand 
and one rules that had been attached 
to every feature of the law. They 
believed in a heaven which they 
called Abraham's bosom, and in a 
hell, and in no habited space be- 
tween. Every man, they thought, 
would go either into that heaven of 
supreme bliss or into that hell of 
dire torment ; and they were not 
prepared to know the truth. Now, 
suppose that Christ had said unto 
them, "Many will be saved, most 
of you, will be saved." They would 
have taken that to mean that many 
of them, the mo.st of them, prac- 
tically all of them, would attain that 
place of bliss to which they referred 
is Abraham's bosom. If he had told 
them only few, they would have un- 
dertsood him to mean that the 
greater part would be consigned to 



hell with all its torments. He could 
not finish the sermon, he could not 
answer them directly because of 
their unbelief, because of their wil- 
ful ignorance, because of their in- 
ability to understand him; and you 
will notice that Christ, the Master 
of masters, the Teacher of teachers, 
followed scrupulously the instruc- 
tion he gave unto his apostles — not 
to cast pearls before swine nor to 
throw the great truths of the gospel 
into the mire, at the feet of those 
who were not willing to understand. 

So, with masterful skill we find 
bim here turning the occasion of 
this question to good account and 
preaching a very instructive sermon 
in connection therewith, but does he 
never answer the question? Does 
he let the inquiry go by the board ; 
was it ever to remain unanswered? 
Not at all. You will find that he has 
answered that question very fully. 
Turn to the 76th section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants and there you 
have it in full, a sermon begun in 
the meridian of time, carried for- 
ward during the apostolic age 
through inspiration, for Paul 
preached a paragraph of it when he 
referred to the bodies celestial and 
the bodies terrestrial, one compared 
to the glory of the sun and another 
to the glory of the moon, and then 
referred to other bodies which are 
to be compared in glory to the stars, 
though Paul had not learned the 
name of that third kingdom or de- 
gree of glory ; and then the sermon 
is carried forward in this dispensa- 
tion, as you will find recorded in the 
section referred to. Therein the 
Lord makes plain- the fact that sal- 
vation as we call it, or being saved, 
has a relative meaning. That sec- 
tion tells us of the awful state into 
which shall enter the sons of perdi- 
tion, those who have sinned against 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMA GE. 



143 



light and knowledge, those who 
have been instigators of the shed- 
ding of innocent blood. All of this 
is pointed out, and then the condi- 
tion of those who attain the very 
lowest or least of the so-called king- 
'doms of glory receives attention. 
The one that Paul had no name for 
we have learned to be the telestial 
glory; and we are definitely told 
just who are the inhabitants or in- 
heritors of the telestial glory. The 
condition of those who attain the 
next higher or the terrestrial state 
is plainly set forth and then the con- 
dition of the supremely blessed, 
those who are permitted to dwell 
with the Father and with the Son, 
the Christ, in the celestial worlds 
throughout eternity. 

Now, those who are saved in the 
telestial glory are saved from the 
horrors of perdition ; those who at- 
tain the terrestrial glory are saved 
from the lower state, in the teles- 
tial ; and those who attain the celes- 
tial are saved from all lesser condi- 
tions and the lower glories of the 
telestial and the terrestrial. Those 
Jews, including even the twelve 
apostles, could not comprehend that 
condition of affairs and therefore 
the Christ did not answer the ques- 
tion directly but let it go with a 
very brief and incomplete answer. 

I say aeain this is one of the ser- 
mons continued through the ages ; 
and we are able today to compre- 
hend the meaning of salvation in a 
greater measure than ever before. 
Tn this respect be it known the theo- 
logical world is following the lead 
r-f "Mormonism" so-called, not only 
; n this particular but in many others. 
"Mnrmonism." that svstem of re- 
vealed truth which constitutes the 
charter of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-dav Saints, is pio- 
neering the way and going before 



like a bearer of light ; and the think- 
ers of the world are following it to- 
day, although many of them are 
loath to acknowledge and confess 
the fact. The doctrine of a single 
heaven and a single hell, separated 
by only a narrow strip, and into one 
or the other of which every soul 
shall surely go, ofttimes as the re- 
sult of very close calculation of his 
account, that horrifying doctrine 
has been practically abandoned by 
thinkers generally, by the theolog- 
ians at the present time, just as they 
have abandoned the infamous .doc- 
trine of the utter condemnation of 
babes who die unbaptized. It was 
thought, you know, but a short time 
ago, that hell was figuratively paved 
with the skulls of unbaptized babes, 
that babes who died without bap- 
tism were 'doomed to condemnation 
that should last forever and forever. 
And now what find we? That doc- 
trine was taught by an apostate 
church. It was proclaimed as the 
result of the absence of light. It 
was preached as a .dogma of men, 
not a doctrine of Christ. But today 
we find even the Roman Catholic 
Church permitting its members to 
believe that babes who die without 
baptism enter into a state of rest 
though they are denied the supreme 
bliss of beholding the face of God. 
or as thev set it forth, of having the 
beatific vision of God — a wonderful 
improvement. I hope that they will 
come to the whole truth some day, 
p ven as the Lord hath declared it by 
his own word ; and so in these re- 
spects the revealed word of God is 
leading- and "Mormonism" is pio- 
neering- the way for the modern 
theology.

professional men and women, to 
virtually throw down the challenge 
in this way in effect, though not in 
these words : Tell me one instance 
of advancement in matters theolog- 
ical since 1830 in which the 
churches have not been following 
''Mormon" lead. And no instance 
was produced. I bear my testimony 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is all its name 
professes to be, all that its name 
affirms it to be. It is leading the 
way, it is the gospel of Christ, and 
we find the sermons of the earlier 
c'ays carried forward. 

"Lord, are there few that be 
saved?" In the dispensation of the 
fulness of times the words of the 
prophet relating to what was shown 
are thus recorded. "And behold and 
lo, we saw the glory and the inhabi- 
tants of the telestial world, that they 
were as innumerable as the stars in 
the firmament of heaven or as the 
sand on the seashore." Herein lies 
the significance of the Lord's words 
to those who asked that question. 
"Strive to enter in at the strait gate 
for many, I say unto you, will seek 
to enter in and shall not be able 
when once the master of the house 
is risen up and hath shut to the 
door." 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
lay hold on eternal life before the 
door is shut. This I pray in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

President Wilson's message on the 
Bible to American soldiers — Some 
of the accomplishments of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that will redound to 
their blessing and insure them life 
eternal — The splendid work of the 



Priesthood and the auxiliary organ- 
izations — Security and safety in ob- 
serving the laws of the gospel and 
the counsels of the servants of God 
— Our hope for the people of Zion. 

I think, my brethren and sisters, 
that I have never heard so much 
scripture quoted to such good pur- 
pose as I have heard from our 
brethren during the .sessions of this 
conference. I hope that their ex- 
ample will be heeded by the Saints 
and that scripture-reading may be- 
come a more prevalent custom than 
it has'been and is today. I note that 
recently twenty-seven thousand 
copies of the Bible were, by one 
Bible society, placed into the hands 
of American soldiers. In each copy 
was inscribed a short letter from the 
President of the United States, and 
the sentiments expressed in that let- 
ter are worthy of our attention. The 
letter read : 

"The Bible is the word of life. 1 
beg that you will read it and find this 
out for yourselves. Read not little 
snatches here and there, but long pas- 
sages that will really be the road to 
the heart of it. You will not only find 
it full of real men and women, but 
also of things you have wondered 
about and been troubled about all 
your life, as men have been always, 
and the more you read the more will 
become plain to you what things are 
worth while and what things are not, 
what things make men happy — loy- 
alty, right-dealing, speaking the truth, 
readiness to give everything for what 
they think their duty^, and most of all 
the wish that they may have the real 
approval of the Christ, who gave 
everything for them, and what things 
are guaranteed to make men unhappy 
— selfishness, cowardice, greed, and 
everything that is mean and low. 

"When you have read the Bible you 
will know that it is the word of God, 
because you will have found it the 
key to your own heart, your own 
happiness and your own duty. 

"Woodrow Wilson." 

T believe, my brethren and sisters. 



ELDER STEPHEN 1.. RICHARDS. 



145 



that in the scriptures are to be found 
words, counsel, and admonition that 
are suited to every circumstance and 
every condition of life. I hope that 
we will read not only the words of 
the Bible, so highly commended by 
the President of the United States, 
but that we will read the words that 
have come to us in modern revela- 
tion, and the words of the prophets 
that have been recorded in our Book 
of Mormon. 

I desire to read a little scripture 
myself as a premise to the few 
thoughts that I would advance to 
you at this time : 

"When the Son of Man shall come 
in his glory, and all the holy angels 
with him, then shall he sit upon the 
throne of his glory: 

"And before him shall be gathered 
all nations: and he shall separate them 
one from another, as a shepherd di- 
videth his sheep from the goats: 

"And he shall set the sheep on his 
right hand, but the goats o,n the left. 

"Then shall the King say unto them 
on his right hand, Come, ye blessed 
of my Father, inherit the kingdom 
prepared for you from the foundation 
of the world: 

"For I was an hungred, and ye 
gave me meat: T was thirsty, and ye 
gave me drink: I was a stranger and 
ye took me in : 

"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was 
sick, and ye visited me: I was in 
prison, and ye came unto me. 

"Then shall the righteous answer 
him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee 
an hungred, and fed thee, or thirsty, 
and gave thee drink. 

"When saw we thee a stranger, and 
took thee in? or naked, and clothed 
thee? 

"Or when saw we thee sick, or in 
prison, and came unto thee? 

"And the King shall answer and say 
unto them, Verily, 1 say unto you, 
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one 
of the least of these my brethren, ye 
have done it unto me. 

"And then shall he say also unto 
th em on the left hand, Depart from 
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, 
prepared for the devil and his angels: 



"For 1 was an hungred, and ye gave 
me no meat: I was thirsty and ye 
gave me no drink: 

"I was a stranger, and ye took me 
not in: naked and ye clothed me not: 
sick, and in prison, and ye visited me 
not. 

"Then shall they also answer him, 
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an 
hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or 
naked, or sick, or in prison,' and did 
not minister unto thee? 

"Then shall he answer them, saying. 
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as 
ye did it not to one of the least ,of 
these ye did it not to me. 

"And these shall go away into ever- 
lasting punishment: but the righteous 
into life eternal." 

I gather much of encouragment 
and comfort from that scripture, 
for the Latter-day Saints. Without 
boasting, only in a spirit of grateful 
acknowledgment, I would recount a 
few of the accomplishments of our 
people which, it seems to me, will 
tend to lead them to life eternal and 
to the blessings which our Father 
has in store for those who have 
served him by serving his children. 

We have among us organizations 
designed to minister to the care and 
the comfort and the upbuilding of 
the children of men. Among these 
organizations there is one com- 
posed of women, the sisters of the 
Church. That organization has a 
record of which any people in the 
wide world could be most proud. 
You know what it does. I want, 
however, to mention a few items ac- 
complished by this great organiza- 
tion in ministering to the children 
of men. 

During the last year. I gather 
from the secretary's report, there 
were 21,985 days spent with the 
sick, more than sixty years of one 
person's time devoted gratuitously, 
willinging, lovingly and unselfishly 
to the care of the unfortunate. 
There were 88,140 special visits to 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the sick where relief was adminis- 
tered, encouragment given and 
good done beyond computation. 
Why, don't you know if we had to 
pay for the services of the physi- 
cian at the usual rate it would have 
taken more than a quarter of a mil- 
lion dollars to have paid for the 
simple, loving service devoted by 
this organization to the relief of the 
sick in our midst last year only. 
There were 6,803 families that .di- 
rectly received the help of this be- 
neficent organization. Two thous- 
and one hundred and ninety-three 
bodies of the dead were prepared 
for burial without cost, without 
compensation for service, as a mere 
gratuitous offering on the part of 
these good sisters. There were 
spent in temple work 26,201 days in 
doing vicarious work for the dead 
by this organization alone. Assist- 
ance was given to missionaries and 
their families to the extent of 
$2,735.35 in cash, aside from the 
great amount of assistance that was 
given in work and in caring f or the 
families of missionaries that in 
many instances needed the care of 
these ministering angels. 

Our sisters have done that which 
the Lord prescribed as one of the 
means of obtaining enternal life. 
They have ministered unto "these, 
the least of my brethren," they have 
cared for those who were sick and 
afflicted and in need of care. 

Then the other organizations of 
our Church, which I haven't the 
time or opportunity now to recount, 
have likewise administered to the 
health and succor and the uplift of 
all the children of God that have 
been members of the Church, or not 
being members of the Church, who 
have been willing to accept of the'ir 
assistance. Don't you know that 
there is an army of twenty thousand 



Sunday School teachers laboring 
every Sunday in the year, preparing 
themselves during the week days, 
unselfishly and willingly giving 
:heir time and ability to feed the 
children of God the bread of life 
and help them to imbibe at 
the fountain of truth, that they 
may live in the ways of God and 
walk in his righteous paths ? There 
is a comparatively large number of 
faithful servants devoting them- 
selves to the care of the young men 
and women in the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations of the Church. 
In addition to these we have great 
numbers of men and women unsel- 
fishly devoting themselves to the 
work pursued in our Primary As 
sociations and in our Religion 
Classes, attempting as best they can 
to administer to the good of man- 
kind and to feed them in the way 
that God wants them fed for their 
upbuilding and for their proper 
growth and development. 

And behind and above, it seems 
to me, all of the work that these 
good auxiliary associations are ac- 
complishing are to be found the 
men who sit in the fore part of 
this building, who, for years and 
years have given their lives, their 
service, their thought, their prayers 
to the nurture and the care of these 
the children of our Father who is in 
heaven. These presidencies of 
stakes, noble men, shepherds of the 
Father, caring for his flocks, as 
only the loving shepherd can care 
for them. These bishoprics of 
wards, fathers of the people, caring 
for them as only loving fathers can 
care for their children. O, what a 
grand and noble service are these 
men performing-. A.s I go among 
them in the ministry in which I am 
engaged, as I meet them and under- 
stand their spirits and recognize

their devotion to the cause, I feel 
mighty humble in their presence. 
They are men of experience, they 
are men of wisdom, they are men 
of integrity, they are men of a 
great big love for God's children ; 
and my prayer constantly is that I 
may be worthy to work with them, 
worthy to help them in the great 
work to which they are so stead- 
fastly devoted. These are the men 
who have brought forth the sons of 
the .states that have now responded 
to their country's call. These men 
and their good wives are the men 
and women who have implanted 
within the hearts of these boys, 
•standards of truth and virtue and 
morality that will make them stand 
out prominently among all those 
who come to serve this great nation. 
I was not surorised when the Secre- 
tary of the Interior stood on this 
stand the other evening and said — 
and I believe it was not flatterv — 
that in all the demonstrations that 
he had seen in this country his heart 
was never so touched as when he 
saw the bovs of Utah and the sur- 
rounding states march past the re- 
viewing- stand clad in their uni- 
forms, prepared to serve their coun- 
try and respond to its call. T was 
not surprised, because I do not be- 
lieve that the eminent secretary can 
sro anv place in this wide and good 
land and find as manv bovs who 
have within their hearts the love of 
truth, who are as firmlv and stead- 
fnstlv adherine to the principels of 
truth and the commandments of the 
Lord, and who hold to such high 
standards of virtue and honor and 
morality as these same boys. I be- 
lieve that one of them, if he will re- 
main steadfast and true to the testi- 
mony of the gospel, is and will be 
worth a half dozen of any who are 



not true, who are not worthy sons 
of God. 

These men — these men here, are 
responsible for them; and I give 
my honor and esteem to them for 
the splendid and great work that 
they have clone and are doing in this 
land. 

We all seek after eternal life. It 
is the greatest gift that God can 
give to men. We pray for it; we 
work for it ; and I believe, my 
brethren and sisters, that we are do- 
ing the things that will bring it to 
us. Our lives are being conformed 
to the life of the Master. There 
is encouragment wherever one goes 
in the land of the Saints. On every 
hand are the evidences, the indis- 
putable evidences of the love of 
men for God, in the love of men for 
men, and it is our service to these 
children of men, no matter how 
humble they are, no matter how in- 
significant in the world they may 
seem to be, that will be accepted by 
God as our service for him. We 
can't help him. He is beyond any 
help that we can give to him, but 
we can help his children ; we can 
work for them ; we can love them ; 
and we can persuade them with the 
help of God to live good lives and 
to come nearer to him, that they 
may eventually come back into his 
presence. 

That is our work, as I understand 
it. That is the mission of the 
Priesthood of God. The Priest- 
hood of God means to me only the 
right to serve, in the name of God, 
God's children, and he who serves 
God's children in God's name is do- 
ing the greatest service for the 
Master that can be done. I see only 
success, onlv prosperity, only hap- 
piness ahead for the people of the 
Latter-day Saints, if they will but 
obey the commandments that have 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been given to them. If they will 
but listen to the counsel and admon- 
ition that come from our head, if 
they will follow the guide of the 
Priesthood, I know they will be 
safe. 

And do you know, throughout 
all these troublesome times, when 
men have found it a very difficult 
thing to make up their minds re- 
garding the important matters that 
have come before us since the dec- 
laration of war, I have always car- 
ried in my own soul a deep feeling 
of satisfaction in this thought, that 
every man who will live the princi- 
ples of the gospel will receive in- 
spiration telling him what to do for 
himself, and the additional and still 
greater thought that if ever there 
should be required for this people 
any especial direction, any peculiar 
guidance suited to the condition of 
the times, we have the man of God 
to give it to us, and I have felt in 
that, security and safety? I think 
we are entitled to that feeling as 
a reward for our attempt to do 
Gods' bidding and to keep his com- 
mandments. 

Only a few weeks ago I hap- 
pened to stand in the majestic cor- 
ridor of the great city hall of San 
Francisco, a gigantic, beautiful 
building erected upon the ruins, or 
near the ruins of the former build- 
ing that stood there. I read an in- 
spiring inscription carved in solid 
granite, testifying to the great hope 
within that people for the future 
of their city. If I may paraphrase 
that inscription it will express, in 
some degree, my hope for the peo- 
ple of Zion : 

"O, Zion, thou glorious city of 
our God and our hearts, thou who 
hast been tried and not found want- 
ing; go thou forth to thy glorious 
future," Amen, 



Anthony C. Lund and the Taber- 
nacle choir sang a solo and chorus : 
"The Lord hath brought again 
Zion," the music by Arthur Shep- 
herd, a Utah composer. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

SHALL THE CHURCH PURCHASE LIB- 
ERTY BONDS? 

I have a matter that I desire to 
present to the conference, as the 
Trustee-in-Trust of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
When the subject of Liberty Bonds 
was broached and presented to the 
people, a number of my brethren 
submitted to me their views and 
their desires that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
as ,such, should contribute some 
means in aid of our Government, 
in the purchase of these bonds with 
the tithes of the people. As 
Trustee-in-Trust, not a dollar of 
the tithings of the people has ever 
been diverted out of the regular 
channels of the Church, by myself ; 
and the funds have been expended 
by the common consent of my coun- 
selors and of the Twelve, and as a 
general thing also that of the Pre- 
siding Bishopric. I did not feel 
that I had the authority or the right 
to divert fhe general funds of the 
Church from the usual channels in 
which all have agreed, and all have 
consented for it to be used, without 
submitting it to the general confer- 
ence of the Church. Therefore, the 
Question that I wish to present to 
the conference is : Will this Con- 
ference, this General Conference, 
authorize the Trustee-in-Trust of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints to use a certain 
amount of the funds of the Church 
for the purchase of Liberty Bonds? 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



149 



And in order that the matter may 
be brought a little more clearly and 
extensively to the attention of the 
conference, I will ask President 
Lund to express himself on the sub- 
ject. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

A MOTION TO PURCHASE LIBERTY 
BONDS. 

This does not mean a donation, 
but simply that we buy bonds and 
thereby help our Government. I 
think that everybody present feels 
that we must do everything we can 
to sustain the Government, as we 
have declared that we are willing 
to do. We cannot shirk the duties 
that devolve upon us as citizens of 
this State and this Nation. We 
want to sustain the Nation, to sus- 
tain the Government, in the pur- 
suit of obtaining a victory for the 
right ; and I move that we authorize 
the Trustee-in-Trust to negotiate 
for such an amount of these bonds 
as he shall find that the means of 
the Church can stand, not to exceed 
a quarter of a million dollars. 

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE 

SECONDING THE MOTION TO PUR- 
CHASE LIBERTY BOND,S. 

I arise to second the motion pre- 
sented by President Lund. Per- 
haps you did not all hear it dis- 
tinctly. The resolution is that this 
Conference, representing the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, authorize the Trustee-in- 
Trust to negotiate for the purchase 
of Liberty Bonds, in aid of our 
great Nation and Government to 
defend the principles of constitu- 
tional liberty, and to wage a war 
of defense against oppression and 



tyranny in all the world, for the 
purpose of aiding in spreading light 
and truth and freedom to all na- 
tions, and that the President of the 
Church, the Trustee-in-Trust, be 
authorized to enter into this nego- 
tiation for the purchase of honds 
as circumstances will permit, and 
not to exceed the sum of two hun- 
dred and fifty thousand dollars. I 
second the motion with great pleas- 
ure, believing that it will be for the 
right, and that it will be supported 
by the Latter-day Saints who are 
true in the faith, everywhere. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

UNANIMOUS VOTE TO PURCHASE 
LIBERTY BONDS. 

Brethren and sisters: You have 
heard the motion which has been 
seconded. Are you ready for the 
question. (Voices: "Question.") I 
hope that eveiry Latter-day Saint 
will feel his own right and freedom 
to vote as he feels would be right 
before the Lord. All in favor of 
the motion will signify it by raising 
the right hand. ( Apparently unan- 
imous response.) The contrary- 
minded, by the same sign. (No 
response.) The vote seems to be 
uanimous, as I have not perceived a 
single hand raised in opposition. 

Under the circumstances, and 
with the sanction and approval of 
this vast body of the Priesthood, 
and of the members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, we, your brethren, entrusted 
with the care of the funds of the 
Church, will use them as economic- 
ally and wisely as we know how, by 
the help of the Lord. 

We will now have presented be- 
fore us the general authorities of 
the Church.

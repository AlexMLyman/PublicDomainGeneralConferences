No toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you 
This journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder William McLaughlan. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"From afar, gracious Lord." 

(The choir was greatly augment- 
ed by members of other choirs from 
various stakes and wards of Zion.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Built in Canada — A New Temple 
Authorized to be Built in Hawaii. 

I am delighted and most thank- 
ful for the privilege I enjoy of being 
with you to attend our 86th semi- 
annual general conference of the 
Church. I am thankful, also, to 
see the very large number of our 
brethren and sisters who are as- 
sembled here this morning, and I 
sincerely hope that throughout our 
conference sessions the Spirit of the 
Lord may pervade our meetings and 
influence those who shall speak to 
us ; and bless everything that may 
be done for the upbuilding of Zion 
and for the continuance of the work 
of the Lord. 

I feel today, as I have always felt 
at the opening of our conferences, 
that the Church was never in a bet- 
ter condition spiritually or tempor- 
ally, since its organization, than it 
is today. I believe that the people 
have never been more united nor 
come nearer seeing eye to eye on 
doctrine and policy and principle 
than they now do. I cannot recall 
the time when the Church, or the 
members of the Church, were more 
prosperous temporally than they are 
now. The earth has been blessed 
of the Lord. It has been made 
fruitful to those who have toiled 
upon it and tilled it ; the people have 
reaped a bounteous harvest this sea- 
son, the elements have been propiti- 
ous, and all things seem to have con- 
duced to the well-being; happiness 
and prosperity of the people 
throughout the length and breadth 
of the land. There is no great rea- 
son for wonderment that under 
these circumstances the adversary 
is active on the other side, and that 
his satanic majesty is still alive; he 
is not dead, nor is he conquered, but 
to a very large extent his power is 



curtailed. He cannot now inflict 
upon us the trouble and injury that 
he once did ; neither can the agencies 
do so whom he employs in the work 
of opposition to the truth. I believe 
that from year to year this increase 
in the power of truth, and decrease 
in the power of evil, will grow in 
greater proportion, both as to the 
prosperity and happiness of the peo- 
ple of God, and also as to the cur- 
tailment of the power of their ene- 
mies, until the power of God shall 
prevail throughout the land; and 
the power of the adversary will 
wane, and truth will triumph and 
righteousness will reign. 

I feel very thankful for the gen- 
eral good health that prevails 
throughout the land, among all the 
people. It is true the great reaper, 
Death, has gathered some of the 
aged, the weak and infirm from 
among us, but our number has con- 
tinued to increase from month to 
month and from year to year. I 
pray that the blessings of the Lord 
may abundantly rest upon His peo- 
ple, and upon all the people of our 
land. We live in the midst of our 
great country, and our interests con- 
tinue unabated in the welfare and 
prosperity of all the people of our 
land, from ocean to ocean, and from 
the north to the south ; not only to- 
ward our own people but our desire 
and our prayers are that all the peo- 
ple of the earth may be blessed of 
God, that they may so conform to 
His will and so unite themselves to- 
gether in good works and upright 
purposes that they may be worthy 
of His favor and blessing. 

We earnestly plead and hope and 
pray -that the spirit of peace may 
come upon the warring nations of 
the earth, that they may cease their 
strife one against another and learn 
the peaceable things of the kingdom 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

of God. We would that it were 
possible for our elders and messen- 
gers of truth to penetrate every land 
and nation upon the earth, and carry 
to them the olive branch of peace, 
the principles of life, and the open- 
ing of the door of salvation to all 
the inhabitants of the world. 

I have a few items to be men- 
tioned at this meeting and I will 
read them: 

Since our last conference we have 
organized four new stakes. Curlew, 
North Davis, Portneuf and Raft 
River, are the names which have 
been given to these four newly or- 
ganized stakes of Zion. Of course, 
these new organizations are off- 
shoots of older organized stakes. 
The people are increasing, spread- 
ing out, and settling upon the land. 
Therefore, it becomes necessary, to 
insure the proper teaching and or- 
ganization of our young as well as 
the old, that new stakes should be 
organized to give opportunity for 
the people to enjoy the benefits and 
privileges of Church organization. 

There have been organized twelve 
new wards, and five branches not 
connected with any wards. We have 
a number of branch organizations 
which are a part of wards, and are 
looked after and presided over by 
the bishops of the wards" a presid- 
ing elder being appointed over the 
branch ; but in this mention they 
are independent branches, and are 
rapidly growing into sufficient num- 
bers and strength soon to be organ- 
ized into wards. 

There are now seventy-two or- 
ganized stakes of Zion with 764 
wards and thirty-eight branches, 
which are not connected with any 
ward, making a total of 203 wards 
and branches. 

During the past six months there 
have been changes made in the pres- 



idency of the Tahitian Mission, 
Ernest C. Rossiter succeeding 
Frank J. Fullmer ; and in the Japan 
Mission, Joseph H. Stimpson suc- 
ceeding Heber Grant Ivins. 

During the current year eighty 
wards have been assisted in erecting 
ward meetinghouses, amusement 
halls, or to pay for indebtedness in- 
curred on such buildings already 
erected ; and we are continually re- 
ceiving applications for assistance in 
the erection of new meetinghouses 
in the newly organized wards. We 
are continually contributing, out of 
the funds of the tithing so far as we 
have it at our command, to fill the 
promises that we have made to the 
various wards of the Church who 
are erecting their houses. We give 
to them from month to month, or 
from time to time, as they demand, 
and as they raise their proportion, 
that which we have promised to 
them. We have a large amount on 
our records which has been prom- 
ised, and which is gradually being 
drawn upon. 

I am happy to say, so far as the 
records show, that the tithing funds 
of the Church have been a little over 
the average of 1914. So far through- 
out this year (1915), the tithing 
funds have been a little in advance 
of those of the previous year. This 
is certainly very necessary, as the 
work is growing, the demands upon 
the Church are increasing, our 
schools are enlarging, and needing 
more and more assistance; we have 
already appropriated a very large 
sum of the yearly tithing to maintain 
our various Church schools. These 
schools need no praise from me on 
this occasion. Those who are as- 
sociated with them or live within the 
stakes where they are conducted 
have come to realize what a great 
benefit they are to the youth of Zion.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and we hope that they will continue 
to be conducted in the spirit of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. The object, 
I may say almost the only purpose, 
for the maintenance of Church 
schools is that true religion and un- 
defined before God the Father, may, 
be inculcated in the minds and 
hearts of our children while they 
are getting an education, to enable 
the heart, the soul and the spirit of 
our children to develop with proper 
teaching, in connection with the sec- 
ular training that they receive in 
schools. 

I hope that I may be pardoned 
for giving expression to my real 
conviction with reference to the 
question of education in the State of 
Utah. The government of the State 
has provided for the common 
schools up to the eighth grade, and 
meets the general expenses of these 
schools. The treasury of this state 
has provided for one of the best uni- 
versities that can be found in any 
state in the Union ; thoroughly 
equipped for the highest education 
in the land. The State Legislature 
has also provided out of' the State 
treasury, for an agricultural college, 
a most worthy and efficient institu- 
tion of instruction and training for 
the youth of the people of the state. 
In addition to these, we are having 
forced upon the people high schools 
throughout every part of the land. 
I believe that we are running educa- 
tion mad. I believe that we are tax- 
ing the people more for education 
than they should be taxed. This is 
my sentiment. And especially is it 
my sentiment when the fact is 
known that all these burdens are 
placed upon the tax payers of the 
state to teach the learning or educa- 
tion of this world. God is not in it. 
Religion is excluded from it. The 
Bible is excluded from it. And those 



who desire to have their children re- 
ceive the advantages of moral and 
religious education are excluded 
from all these state organizations, 
and if we will have our children 
properly taught in principles of 
righteousness, morality and religion, 
we have to establish Church schools 
or institutions of education of our 
own, and thus the burdens of taxa- 
tion are increased upon Ithe peo- 
ple. We have to do it in order that 
our children may have the advant- 
ages of moral training in their 
youth. I know that I shall be criti- 
cized by professional "lovers of ed- 
ucation," for expressing my idea in 
relation to this matter. 

We are striving to the best of 
our ability to provide for the poor; 
that is, for God's poor. You know 
there are several kinds of poor, and 
we want to provide out of the funds 
of the tithing and of the offerings 
of the Saints as far as we possibly 
can, for the honest and the worthy 
poor, and not for the drunken poor 
or for those who bring poverty, and 
distress upon themselves by "riotous 
living," extravagance, folly and sin. 
They should be put to work by some 
means or power, and kept at work 
until they learn to abstain from that 
which is vicious, and they will ob- 
serve and ~do that which is essential 
to life and to the well-being of man- 
kind. I am not prepared to give you 
exact figures with reference to our 
fast offering fund, but it would be 
safe to say in view of past refer- 
ences to this matter, that if the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would carefully, (I 
will not say honestly, because I do 
not believe they intend to be dis- 
honest about it,) and thoughtfully 
observe the rule or law of fasting 
one day in each month, and give for 
the benefit of the poor just what it 
would cost them to maintain them-

selves and their families with food 
on that one day, we would have suf- 
ficient funds in the Church to feed 
all our poor without taking a dollar 
of tithing to do it. When it comes 
to the fact that the fast offering 
represents perhaps about three or 
four cents per head per year, it does 
not figure out to be a very unex- 
haustive fund, and does not, of 
course, meet the necessities of the 
really worthy poor. 

I am glad to say that the policy 
to do ward teaching that has been 
urged upon the bishops and upon 
the bishops' counselors, and teachers 
is being carried out to a greater ex- 
tent than heretofore. It is advised 
that the bishops and their counselors 
themselves, by the aid of the teach- 
ers called to their assistance in their 
wards, shall visit every family with- 
in their ward, advise with them, and 
look after their temporal and their 
spiritual well-being. Not long ago 
I happened to be at the home of one 
of my children when the teachers 
came in. We called the family to- 
gether and submitted ourselves to 
the duties of the teachers. The head 
teacher began by saying that he had 
been sent there by the bishop of the 
ward to inquire into the condition of 
the members of the family. He was 
instructed. to inquire of them if they 
held family prayer, morning and 
evening, if they asked the blessing 
upon their food, at each meal. He 
was required by the bishop to in- 
quire as to whether they kept the 
word of wisdom, as to whether they 
attended to their Sabbath meetings 
and honored the Sabbath day, as to 
whether those who were of age to 
attend the various other organiza- 
tions of the Church, such as the Re- 
lief Society, the Young Men's and 
Young Ladies' Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations, the Sunday 



Schools, the Primary Associations, 
and the Religion Class, did so, and 
if they sustained in their hearts their 
bishop and his counselors and were 
united in feeling and sentiment with 
them, and if they were in harmony 
in their feelings and sentiment with 
the presidency of their stake. And 
as to whether they sustained, by 
their faith and prayers, the presid- 
ing authorities of the Church, the 
Presidency of the Church and the 
Twelve Apostles, the Patriarch, the 
Presidents of Seventies, and the 
Presiding Bishopric. If they could 
pray for them in faith and in good 
feeling, and were in harmony with 
them. If they believed and ob- 
served the law of tithing, and were 
at peace with their neighbors, etc. 
Then he asked that the head of the 
family should arise and open his 
heart to the teachers and tell them 
just what he had to say in relation 
to all these inquiries and require- 
ments that were made of the teacher 
by the bishop. I admired it. I 
thought it was just the right thing 
to do, and I approved of it, and so 
pronounced mv approval of the 
thoroughness, the simplicity, and the 
honesty of the teacher to inquire into 
all these things. I was very happy 
indeed, to see and hear the young 
man of the house get up and say 
that the family were endeavoring, to 
the best of their ability and knowl- 
edge, to comply with every require- 
ment that was made of them as 
members of the Church in that 
ward, as required by the bishop. 
Then T took the liberty to say to 
the teachers that I was pleased with 
their mission and with the perform- 
ance of their duty, and to assure 
them that from the training and in- 
struction that my children had had 
from their birth up, T felt quite sure 
that they would be found, wherever 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they were, complying with all the 
requirements that were there made. 
Namely: the keeping of the word 
of wisdom, eschewing the use of in- 
toxicating drinks, the use of tobac- 
co, of strong and hot drinks, etc. 
The word of wisdom comprises all 
these things. Do you have your 
prayers ? Do you remember God, 
the Giver of all the good you get 
and have in the world? Do you ac- 
knowledge His hand in all things, 
and do you render the gratitude and 
thankfulness of your souls to the 
Giver of every good and perfect 
gift? These are the questions that 
we should put to the inhabitants and 
the home-makers in Zion, to the 
family organizations in the Church. 
Is the husband and the father con- 
ducting himself in such a way as to 
be worthy of the affection and con- 
fidence of his whole family? Is 
his conduct and his dealings with 
them such as will secure to him 
their unstinted love and approval? 
Are the father and the mother liv- 
ing peacefully together, without 
strife or contention? Do the chil- 
dren live harmoniously and peace- 
fully together in their homes, and 
are they taught to be peaceful and 
gentle with their neighbors' chil- 
dren ? All these things should be 
taught by the teachers in the vari- 
ous wards, and by the bishops, visit- 
ing every house as far as possible, 
confirming the labors of the teach- 
ers in this work of love for the 
benefit of the inhabitants of Zion. 

My brethren and sisters, these are 
some of the little things, perhaps. 
Some people would consider them 
trivial and of no importance, but I 
say there isn't anything that I know 
of in a man's life that is more es- 
sential to his happiness, and to the 
happiness of those with whom he is 
associated, than these little amen- 



ities by which he shows his love 
and respect for others and he is re- 
spected and loved, and his presence 
is cherished, by those with whom he 
associates. The father comes home, 
and the children are glad to see 
him ; the mother welcomes him with 
all the affection of the true wife and 
mother, for he is good and true, he 
does all in his power to provide a 
home for them, to make them com- 
fortable and to add to their happi- 
ness and well being, also to provide 
for their education and their proper 
training and instruction. The whole 
family is united, and the children 
grow up to honor their parents and 
say : "My father and mother were 
honest. They set me the example 
of their lives. They taught me 
what was good, and they practiced 
it. They set the example to me, as 
well as taught me the precept of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I 
love them for it. I will always love 
them for it." When they shall go 
beyond, the children will carry with 
them forever a blessing for their 
parents. But the man who is rough, 
harsh, unkind and thoughtless, the 
man who spends his time away from 
his home and his children, when he 
should be with them, or who is ab- 
sent for pleasures of his own, or for 
associations that are not. congenial 
to the family, what influence for 
good can he have with his children ? 
Will thev not follow in his foot- 
steps ? . Will they not emulate his 
example? Will they not grow up 
to be even less observant of that 
which is required by the Lord of his 
children than the parents were, be- 
cause of the example set before 
them? 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
my business, my dutv, is to preach 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Him 
crucified and risen from the dead 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

and sitting enthroned in power, 
glory and majesty on the right 
hand of his Father, our God. That 
is my business and my duty, and I 
love to do that hiore than anything 
else in the world. I would deplore 
and dread the thought that I am 
neglecting my duty towards those 
whom I love more than my own 
life. I can't afford it. I must do 
the best I can, the best I know how, 
for those whom God has entrusted 
to my care. I must also do my duty 
toward the people of God to whom 
He has willed that I should be a 
humble minister and teacher of the 
Gospel. It is my duty to set an 
example, to plead with the people 
to live their religion. I ought to 
pay my fast offering regularly, right 
along, as I pay my tithing; when 
the end of the month comes I go 
and pay my tithing. Why? So 
that I won't neglect it nor forget it, 
and that is one of the things that 
the good teacher taught us the other 
evening at our home — the payment 
of tithing. Are we honest with the 
Lord ? Do we remember him with 
the first fruits of our increase? If 
I were as punctual in observing my 
fast, and as careful to do all I 
should do for it, and a little more 
than would be really required of me, 
as I try to be in paying my tithing, 
I believe I would feel better over it, 
but sometimes I am a hundred, or 
a thousand miles away from my 
ward on the fast day, and then I 
can't quite do it ; but the family at 
home can attend to their part of the 
duty when I am away. It is my 
duty as the head of my family to set 
the example before all the members 
of my household. 

I have the right to bless. I hold 
the keys of the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood and of the office and power of 
patriarch. It is my right to bless ; 



for all the keys and authority and 
power pertaining to the government 
of the Church and to the Melchiz- 
edek and Aaronic Priesthood are 
centered in the presiding officers of 
the Church. There is no business, 
nor office, within the Church that 
the President of the Church may 
not fill, and may not do, if it is nec- 
essary, or if it is required of him to 
do it. He holds the office of patri- 
arch ; he holds the office of high 
priest and of apostle, of seventy, of 
elder, of bishop, and of priest, 
teacher and deacon in the Church ; 
all these belong to the Presidency 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and they can offi- 
ciate in any and in all of these call- 
ings when occasion requires. 

God bless you. May peace abide 
and abound in Israel, from the 
north to the south, and from the 
east to the west ; and may the favor 
and mercv of God be extended unto 
all the nations of the world to their 
restoration to peace and unity and 
good will, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. 

I am reminded ! of one or two 
other items that I intended to men- 
tion. As you all know, we have 
been authorized and have under- 
taken, to build a temple in Alberta, 
Canada, and we have already ex- 
pended very large sums of money 
upon that building. It is in course 
of erection and is progressing rap- 
idly. The corner stone was laid 
only a week or so ago. The walls 
are being put up and it is nearing 
or will be nearing, soon, its com- 
pletion, and readiness for the ordi- 
nances of the house of God. We 
took it there — why? Perhaps just 
one instance that was brought to 
our minds yesterday, or the day be- 
fore, may illustrate. A young man, 
who has filled a good mission and 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



returned home, living away off in 
the northern part of British Colum- 
bia, still clinging to the faith and 
wearing the harness of his ministry, 
doing all that he can for the benefit 
of mankind, desires to get married 
and to be married right. He lives 
' hundreds and hundreds of miles 
away from a temple ; he has been on 
a mission for years and has ex- 
hausted all his means, he returns 
home almost penniless, and has 
found some good girl who is willing 
to enter life with him on the ground 
floor, and he says to us : "What can 
I do ? T want to begin a home for 
myself, it is according' to the law 
of nature and of God, but I haven't 
the means to go to the temple. Will 
it be right for me to be married 
here, and then when I get the means 
sufficient to gfo to a temple, go and 
be sealed for time and for all 
eternity ?" 

Well, what can you do under cir- 
cumstances of that kind All we 
could do was to say to him : "Go 
to the nearest bishop or elder of the 
Church that you can find, and with 
our permission and approval ask 
him to unite you in marriage for 
time, and as soon as you are able to 
reach a temple, where you can go 
to the altar and be united by the 
power of God, and not of man, for 
time and for all eternity, go and 
get your union sealed by the power 
of God that will unite you for 
eternity as well as for time, and 
will bring your children unto you 
under the bond of the new and ever- 
lasting covenant, as heirs of God 
and joint heirs with Jesus Christ." 
What else could we say to him? 
Nothing else, so we said it ; but by 
and by we will have a temple up 
there, and those who are in these 
circumstances will not be compelled 
to waste all their substance in travel 



to come to a temple here. We were 
in hopes, not many years ago of 
being able to build another temple 
near the borders of the United 
States, in Mexico ; but that nation's 
unfortunate people, oppressed by 
rulers ambitious for power at the 
cost of the lives of their fellowmen, 
have driven out or expelled prac- 
tically our people from their land. 

Now, away off in the Pacific 
Ocean are various groups of isl- 
ands, from the Sandwich Islands 
down to Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga, and 
New Zealand. On them are thou- 
sands of good people, dark-skinned 
but of the blood of Israel. When 
you carry the Gospel to them they 
receive it with open hearts. They 
need the same privileges that we 
do, and that we enjoy, but these are 
out of their power. They are poor, 
and they can't gather means to come 
up here to be endowed, and sealed 
for time and eternity, for their liv- 
ing and their dead, and to be bap- 
tized for their dead. What shall 
we do with them Heretofore, we 
have suffered the conditions that 
exist there, and have adopted the 
best measures that we knew how, 
always looking to the better and 
fuller requirements of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

Now, I say to my brethren and 
sisters this morning that we have 
come to the conclusion that it would 
be a good thing to build a temple 
that shall be dedicated to the ordi- 
nances of the house of God, down 
upon one of the Sandwich Islands, 
so that the good people of those 
islands may reach the blessing of 
the House of God within their own 
borders, and that the people from 
New Zealand, if they do not become 
strong enough to require a house 
to be built there also, by and by, 
can come to Laie, where they can

get their blessings and return home 
and live in peace, having fulfilled all 
the requirements of the Gospel the 
same as we have the privilege of 
doing here. 



I want you to understand that the 
Hawaiian mission, and the good 
Latter-day Saints of that mission, 
with what help the Church can give, 
will be able to build their temple. 
They are a tithe-paying people, and 
the plantation is in a condition to 
help us. We have a gathering 
place there where we bring the peo- 
ple together, and teach them the 
best we can, in schools and under 
the various auxiliary organizations 
of the Church. I tell you that we 
(Brother Smoot, Bishop Nibley 
and I) witnessed there some of the 
most perfect and thorough Sunday 
School work on the part of the chil- 
dren of the Latter-day Saints that 
we had ever seen. God bless you. 
Amen. 

A tenor solo, entitled "If with all 
your heart you truly seek Me," was 
sung by Elder Melvin J. Ballard, 
President of Northwestern States 
Mission. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Seemingly trivial things important to 
development — True religion a help 
to eternal life — Similarity or imita- 
ton not evidence of truth — Knowl- 
edge imparted by Holy Ghost the 
one sure evidence — Enduring trials, 
and overcoming evil, manifest true 



Saints — Need to be zealous in God's 
service — Importance of teachers' 
visits — Caution aginst false teach- 
ers. 

I have enjoyed the remarks of our 
President, and I believe we will all 
be united in praying for him that 
his cold may leave him, and that his 
speaking to us may have no bad ef- 
fect upon his system, for we all re- 
joice in hearing his voice and listen- 
ing to his advice to the Saints. What 
he has told us is very essential to 
our salvation. They are not trivial 
things, they are the steps by which 
we can ascend. The steps of a lad- 
der may be trivial in themselves, but 
we have to use them if we want to 
get to the top, and the steps he al- 
luded to are necessary for our de- 
velopment. 

He said our adversary is not dead. 
This is true, men are traveling 
through the states, berating the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, accusing them of 
things that have never entered their 
hearts. Our young men who go out 
on missions are astonished to hear 
such things about their homes, 
things that never came to their 
knowledge before, but they have to 
go abroad to learn what a bad peo- 
ple the Mormons are! Why have 
you and I joined a people so de- 
spised by the world? Our answer 
is, We joined this Church because 
we were convinced that it was the 
Church of Jesus Christ. We are 
told in holy writ that "This is life 
eternal, that they might know Thee, 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom Thou hast sent." This shows 
the great importance of religion, for 
religion deals with the knowledge of 
God. Some may take it in their 
hearts to speak lightly of the neces- 
sity of religion ; I have heard such 
people say : "If we do right to our 
neighbors and do not take ad- 



It is moved that we build 
a temple at Laie, Oahu, Ter- 
ritory of Hawaii. All who 
are in favor of it will please 
manifest it by raising the 
right hand [all hands raised] ; 
contrary minded by the same 
sign. I do not see a con- 
trary vote. 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



vantage of them, that is good 
enough religion for me." That is 
certainly a good course of conduct, 
and religion inculcates that doctrine 
upon all, but we are all looking for- 
ward to eternal life, and if eternal 
life is to know the only true God, we 
must seek to know Him, and hence 
the necessity of religion. 

There are so many religious de- 
nominations in the world, and the 
question arises, How shall I find the 
correct one? Paul tells" us there is 
but one true faith, that none is al- 
lowed to preach any other gospel 
than the one he preached : for if one 
should do so, he says : "Let him 
be accursed." It is therefore of vital 
consequence to know which is the 
true religion. The Lord has not left 
us without means to know this for 
ourselves. We have His word, 
which we can study, and it was writ- 
ten by men inspired by the Holy 
Ghost. While we are convinced of 
this, we do not believe that the word 
of God as contained in the sacred 
books is able to authorize men to 
officiate in the ordinances of the 
Gospel. The word of God is for 
our guidance, but we need the liv- 
ing oracles to direct and guide us 
and to administer the ordinances. 

We joined this Church because 
we had investigated its principles, 
and we found that the teachings by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith were like 
those given by the Savior and His 
apostles formerly. I want to say 
that similarity is not a perfect test, 
for it might be possible for some re- 
former to imitate the outward form 
of the Church as given in the New 
Testament, and then establish a 
church, but even such likeness 
would not make it a true church, it 
would be a mere man-made imita- 
tion, which would be valueless, for 



the Lord says: "But in vain they 
do worship me, teaching for doc- 
trine the commandments of men." 
The true Church must be estab- 
lished by authority of God, and 
there must be the life of the Holy 
Spirit in it. The Holy Ghost must 
be conferred upon the members by 
the ordinance ordained for its be- 
stowal, and when the Spirit is re- 
ceived it will testify unto the recipi- 
ents that they have obeyed the de- 
mands of the true Gospel. Now 
we have not feared to tell men that 
this is the Gospel of Christ, and 
that those who would obey it 
should know for themselves that 
they have obeyed His teachings. We 
have applied the same test which 
He gave when those who listened 
to Him were loth to accept His 
teachings. He said to them, "If any 
man will do His [the Father's] 
will, he shall know of the doctrine 
whether it be of God, or whether 
I speak of Myself." We have tested 
the teachings of the elders who 
came to us by doing the Father's 
will as declared by them, and 
we have verified what they have 
promised. We went into the waters 
of baptism, and became members 
jof the Church of Christ ; we re- 
ceived the Holy Ghost by the lay- 
ing on of hands, and it bore witness 
to our spirit of the truth, and that 
what was done was accepted by our 
Heavenly Father. For this reason 
we can say with Paul, that we are 
not ashamed of the Gospel, for we 
know it is the power of God unto 
salvation ; doubt and darkness have 
fled and we have felt that we are in 
communion with our Heavenly 
Father and with the Son. Feeling 
this assurance and having- this testi- 
mony for ourselves, what manner 
of men ought we not to be? How 



PRESIDENT A NTH ON H. LUND. 



11 



grateful we ought to show our- 
selves, to our Heavenly Father for 
this knowledge. Men may deride 
us, mock at us, but what does it 
matter? We know we have the 
truth. 

I want to say. to my brethren, with 
this testimony in your hearts don't 
feel too secure and think, "I have 
clone all that is necessary, I know 
I have entered through the door 
into the kingdom of God, and I need 
not fear." Remember that if we 
shall obtain our salvation we must 
work it out in fear and trembling. 
Every day has its duties. It is not 
the one who enters through the door 
that shall be saved, but it is he who 
endures to the end, and enduring 
and overcoming are the lessons 
which we must learn. If we over- 
come ourselves, and everything that 
is contrary to the word of God, if 
we endure affliction, trials and per- 
secution for the Master's sake, then 
we shall realize the promises made 
tc the faithful. 

Let us examine ourselves and 
ascertain our real condition. Are 
we alert and zealous for the up- 
building of the kingdom of God, or 
has the desire to build ourselves up 
temporally taken away our zeal for 
the upbuilding of the kingdom of 
God? I am afraid that too many 
are seeking too much the things of 
the world, and forgetting that which 
is of greater importance. Remem- 
ber that the things of the world we 
must leave behind us, but the good 
works done here upon the earth will 
follow us, they will be riches which 
we have laid up in the treasury 
above. Don't be afraid that you 
shall lose your reward for the good 
that you do ; records are kept both 
on earth and in heaven, and every 
good act you have performed will 



be remembered, and rewarded. On 
the other hand we are told by one 
who had authority to say so, that 
we shall give account of every idle 
word spoken, and if we shall be ac- 
countable for every idle word, what 
about evil acts and evil doings? 
They certainly will stand against 
us. 

Latter-day Saints, honor the 
covenants you have made with the 
Lord, serve Him earnestly and 
faithfully, and idon't let anything 
shake your faith. The one who has 
lost his faith has lost more than the 
world can give ; hence the necessity 
of our valuing at its true worth 
what the Lord has done for us. 

I was pleased to hear the Presi- 
dent relate about the teachers that 
came to his daughter's home. I hope 
that the teachers all through Zion, 
will do like those teachers did. Let 
them sit down with the people and 
learn how they feel, pray with them 
and try to buiid them up. Let us re- 
ceive the teachers when they come to 
our houses and tell them we are ready 
to have them teach us. The teach- 
er's duty is to teach the people in 
the house he visits, whether the head 
of the house holds a high position in 
the Church, or none at all, and he 
should not fear to do his duty be- 
cause he thinks that the person 
visited may know more than he. He 
knows what he is called to go and 
teach, and let him do this in humil- 
ity. Before he starts out let him 
pray to the Lord to be with him, 
and he will bring joy and edification 
to those in the homes he visits. 

I am afraid there is a carelessness 
manifest among us in attending our 
meetings. In some stakes we find 
that there is a much greater per- 
centage attending the sacrament 
meetings than in others. Don't let 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us neglect this duty and stay away 
from the house of the Lord on His 
Holy day, but go there and worship 
Him, partake of the sacrament, and 
renew our covenant with the Lord, 
then we shall receive strength to 
perform our duties. Some excuse 
their absence from sacrament meet- 
ings by saying that they are afraid 
they might partake of the sacred 
emblems unworthily. Well, if you 
have any such fear in your hearts, 
see to it that you put yourselves in 
a condition that you know you can 
partake worthily, and remember 
also that it is a commandment to us 
that we shall go to the Lord's house 
and partake of the sacrement. If 
we stay away or avoid partaking of 
the sacrament, we are . cutting our- 
selves short of the blessings we 
could enjoy; in fact such a course 
will cause spiritual starvation. Go 
therefore to the house of worship, 
pray for the man that speaks, and 
he will be able to convey unto you 
that which you desire to know, and 
to build you up in your holy faith. 
The Lord will be with him. I urge 
you to attend your meetings, and 
to the performance of the many 
other duties that rest upon a Lat- 
ter-day Saint. It is the only way 
to feel happy and satisfied. 

Remember the President's advice 
to us about fast offerings. What a 
beautiful custom it is to fast the 
first Sunday in the month, and then 
spend the means that it would cost 
for food that day to help the poor. 
Jesus laid great stress upon helping 
the poor. He knew how liable we 
are to love the things of the world, 
and He asked those who had means 
to remember the poor. Now the 
Lord has blessed us with means, we 
may not be of the rich of the earth, 
but He has blessed us with the 
necessities of life, and we can spare 



enough of them to help our breth- 
ren. 

Remember the Sabbath day and 
keep it holy. Remember to wor- 
ship God first and foremost and not 
seek other gods. Mammon is a god 
that is very much worshiped nowa- 
days. Don't let greed and lust of 
property draw your minds away 
from that which you ought to at- 
tend to. Your last thoughts at night 
ought to be prayer and thankfulness 
to our Heavenly Father, and when 
you wake let your thoughts ascend 
to Him and seek His aid and assist- 
ance during the day, and do as the 
Prophet Joseph says, let us get 
acquainted with our secret chamber 
also and go there and pour out our 
hearts to our Heavenly Father. 

I want to say a word concern- 
ing giving heed to the servants of 
God, and not to those who are put- 
ting themselves forward as teach- 
ers, who have not been appointed 
under the priesthood. Ever since 
the first days of the Church we have 
found men who have set themselves 
up to teach and lead the people. 
You remember that Brother Hiram 
Page had a seer-stone through 
which he received revelations, and 
commenced to teach the Saints false 
doctrines. In a revelation to Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Lord 
declared that these revelations were 
not of Him, and a conference of the 
Church found them to be false. We 
know at the time of the Prophet's 
death that many different schisms 
arose and men went away from the 
body of the Church. What became 
of them ? Did they succeed ? They 
are not known today, and we can 
point to the different ones who have 
apostatized from the Church and 
tried to lead the Saints astray, and 
we find that they have not been sue- 



PRESIDENT A NTH ON H. LUND. 



13 



cessful. I want to read one saying 
of the Prophet Joseph's : 

"I will give unto you one of the 
keys of the mysteries of the kingdom. 
It is an eternal principle that existed 
with God from all eternity: The man 
who rises up to condemn others, find- 
ing fault with the Church, saying that 
they are out of the way, while he him- 
self is righteous, then know assuredly 
that that man is in the high road to 
apostasy, and if he does not repent he 
will apostatize, as God lives." 

A man was telling me yesterday 
of a visit he had made as a teacher, 
and he found a certain man that 
goes around and holds meetings 
with people who says that he be- 
lieves all that the Prophet Joseph 
said, but the Church is gone some- 
what astray, and he is going to be 
the man mighty and strong to re- 
form the Church. I am surprised 
that men will listen to him. These 
words of the Prophet which I have 
read tell us that those who find fault 
with the Church and with those who 
are called to lead it, will apostatize. 
They may say they will not aposta- 
tize and that they believe what is 
taught in the Church, but they will 
add something else that is false and 
erroneous. They try to make peo- 
ple believe that they are very hum- 
ble and are preaching the truth, and 
yet they declare that there is going 
to be a falling away of the Church 
as formerly. Let me bear this testi- 
mony to you, that there will be no 
falling away of this Church. This 
dispensation is not going to end as 
the others have ended. It began 
with revelation as the others did, but 
it will continue until the reign of 
Christ will be introduced upon the 
earth, and the Lord has said that 
He will not give it to any other peo- 
ple. 

I see the time is going. I want 



to warn you against such influences. 
When men try to lead you astray 
and set you up against the priest- 
hood of Cod, you be on your guard ; 
don't let seductive spirits and in- 
fluences turn you away from the 
true path. Make it a matter of 
prayer, seek the Lord earnestly, do 
your duties and you will see your 
way clearly and not be led astray. 
May the Lord bless you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, help us to serve Him 
who has been so gracious to us, who 
has given us a knowledge of Him- 
self and of the true plan of salva- 
tion, I ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

President Smith read a notice, is- 
sued by the Presiding Bishopric, in- 
forming conference visitors concern- 
ing arrangements made for their 
lodging, etc. 

The choir sang the Temple an-

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Andrew Kimball, President of 
St. Joseph Stake, Arizona. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m. The services were pre- 
sided over by Elder George Albert 
Smith, and the Miller and Burton 
Ward choirs furnished the music, 
under direction of W. S. Lamor- 
eaux. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Hosanna." 

Elder Franklin R. Snow offered 
the invocation. 

A male chorus rendered the song, 
"We love thee, Utah dear."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER ALMA MERRILL. 

(President of Benson Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
this morning with you in having the 
privilege of attending our confer- 
ence. I always rejoice whenever I 
have the opportunity of meeting 
where so many of the Latter-day 
Saints assemble, because of the fact 
that, in assembling with the Latter- 
day Saints, it seems to bring a spirit 
of peace and contentment that 
makes a person feel as if he were 
at home. When we are in posses- 
sion of this spirit, my brethren and 
sisters, surely we are in possession 
of the Spirit of the Lord. 

We have engaged ourselves in 
the great latter-day work. A great 
many of us have been born and 
reared in the Church, and a large 
number also have heard the gospel 
in their native lands, and have gath- 
ered to this goodly land where we 
can serve God and keep His com- 
mandments. I often wonder if those 
of us who have come up to the Val- 
leys of these Mountains, and those 
who have been born and reared 
here, and have arrived to the age of 
manhood and womanhood, if we 
really understand our true positions, 
if we really appreciate the great 
blessings and favors that the Lord 
has bestowed upon us. Do those 
who have come from foreign lands 
really appreciate the great favor 
that the Lord has granted them in 
establishing them safely on this soil, 
a place our Heavenly Father has 
designated for the establishment of 
His work? I wonder if we realize 
the great responsibility that rests 
upon us as His servants who have 
received the Holy Priesthood, who 
have accepted the priesthood of our 
own free will, and are we magnify- 
ing this priesthood as we should ? 



Now you all know, no doubt, that 
there is great responsibility being 
placed upon the authorities of the 
stakes and wards, by the general 
authorities of the Church, in regard 
to seeing that the acting teachers 
are doing their duty in visiting the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints. I 
wonder, my brethren and sisters, 
why we need so much urging, so 
much coaxing, so much pushing to 
get us to magnify our callings, and 
get us to do that which is required 
of us as the children of our Father. 
This is His work that we are en- 
gaged in, and each one should feel 
zealous ; each one should feel that 
it is a privilege to take part in this 
great latter-day work, because we 
are working out our own salvation, 
and individually we are the ones 
who are receiving the blessing, and 
not those who visit us from time to 
time and urge us to do our duty, to 
keep ourselves moving, to keep in 
the path of life and honor before 
our Heavenly Father. 

It is a great privilege to be asso- 
ciated with the great latter-day 
work our Father has established. 
He has allowed us, His children, to 
be born in this gospel dispensation, 
and have all the privileges of the 
Gospel vouchsafed to us. We have 
many things conferred upon us that 
our fathers did not have, opportu- 
nities that have cost them their lives, 
in some instances. It has cost our 
fathers and mothers a great deal to 
subdue this western country, and 
bring it into the splendid condition 
that we find it today, and the 
younger generation are enjoying 
the fruits of their arduous labors. 
Do we appreciate the great bless- 
ings that have been bestowed upon 
us ? Are we serving God and keep- 
ing His commandments? Do we 
attend to our prayers in the morn- 



ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 



15 



ing and in the evening? Do we 
teach our children the principles of 
life eternal? or are we becoming 
neglectful in these things? Do we 
attend to our duties on the Sabbath 
day ? or do we neglect them, and go 
pleasure-seeking? These things, 
my brethren and sisters, are con- 
fronting us as Latter-day Saints. I 
wonder how it will be with us if we 
do not keep the commandments of 
our Heavenly Father, for He has 
said that we must serve Him and 
keep His commandments, for this is 
the land of Zion. 

I have had the privilege, on two 
occasions recently, of going west 
and visiting another part of our 
country, the Raft River stake of 
Zion, which is scattered over a con- 
siderable scope. I found that, while 
the people are much scattered, and 
have to go many miles to assemble 
to worship the Lord on the Sabbath 
day, yet they do assemble on the 
Sabbath day in mass, almost all of 
the people belonging to the Church, 
and many who do not, to worship 
God, our Heavenly Father. It made 
my heart rejoice when I visited that 
country and saw so many people 
gathered to worship our Heavenly 
Father. I had no idea that there 
were so many of our people located 
in that country. I found they were 
located in every nook and corner, so 
to speak. There are many such op- 
portunities for settlement, where 
our people can build homes, and be 
taught the principles of the gospel 
and live in peace. They have many 
of the conveniences of life, and some 
they do not yet have. They have 
the auxiliary organizations of the 
Church, under direction of the 
priesthood. And so we find it, my 
brethren and sisters, over much of 
this western land. 

I trust and pray that the Lord 



will bless us during our meetings 
in this conference. May the peace 
and blessings of our Father rest 
upon us. 

I bear you my testimony that this 
is the work of the Lord, and Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, stands at the 
head of this gospel dispensation. 
May the Lord continue His bless- 
ings upon us, I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A duet, "Come Unto Me and 
Rest," was sung by Luella Ferrin 
Sharp and L. Van den Akker. 

ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 

(President of Beaver Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
this morning in the opportunity we 
have of meeting together in confer- 
ence capacity. I rejoice in the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and in the fruits 
thereof, in the testimony of the 
Spirit, and in the evidences that we 
have of the great work that has 
been established by our Father in 
these latter days. I rejoice in the 
labors of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
in the establishment of this work, 
in the testimony that he gave to the 
world, and that we who have suc- 
ceeded him in the work are the 
beneficiaries of his life and labor, 
and what he did for humanity. 

I was just reading in our hymn 
book the words that were written by 
Apostle John Taylor, immediately 
succeeding the martyrdom of Joseph 
Smith, wherein he says : 

"O give me back my Prophet dear 
And Patriarch, O give them back, 

The Saints of Latter-days to cheer, 
And lead them in the Gospel track." 

I wonder, my brethren and sisters, 
how it is possible to give back to 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the latter-day Saints, in this day and 
age of the world, our Prophet and 
our Patriarch. His words and his 
life work have been pictured by 
poets, by orators, and by historians 
— and these we have with us — that 
we may revere him, and know him 
as he was. We have gifted singers 
who sing the hymns of Zion, and tell 
us in beautiful language what the 
Prophet Joseph Smith has done for 
,the Latter-day Saints and for the 
world. But I wonder, at times, if 
there is not yet in the future another 
means which will be used in order 
that we may have with us the 
Prophet of our God, in this age of 
the world. It occurs to me, inas- 
much as it has been stated, that 
there never has been a true likeness 
and picture given to the world of the 
Prophet Joseph, that there must 
come a time in the future when, out 
of the gifted young men or women 
of Israel, there shall arise a sculptor 
or painter who will picture upon 
canvas, or in marble, a true likeness 
and representation of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Then I cast my eye 
back over the pages of history, and 
I wonder which of the many great 
incidents in his life is the most ap- 
propriate one, that reveals the true 
character and manhood of this won- 
derful man. 

I see him first in Richmond jail, 
Missouri, manacled and in irons, as 
he lay there with his brethren, 
listening to the ribald stories that 
were being told by his jailers, of 
how they had ravished the daugh- 
ters of Zion ; and the beautiful pic- 
ture of that scene which followed, 
as portrayed under the inspired pen 
of Parley P. Pratt, wherein he 
states that, suddenly, the Prophet 
arose to his feet and, in a voice of 
thunder, commanded those jailers to 
cease their ribald stories, declaring 



unto them that, unless they did 
cease, he or they would die that 
minute ! Would not that be an in- 
spired picture, as the servant of God, 
manacled as he was, commanded the 
guards and jailers to remain silent, 
and cease their ribald stories? It is 
said that the jailers were completely 
subdued, and slunk off into corners 
or begged for mercy at his feet. 

T again see him upon the river 
bottoms near the city of Commerce, 
which afterwards became the beau- 
tiful city of Nauvoo. as he moved 
among the people who were living 
there in the agony of pain, suffering 
from the fever and disease which 
had come to them as the result of 
their exposures and hardships. I 
see him in the attitude of a minister- 
ing angel, as he goes from camp to 
camp, and from tent to tent, carry- 
ing with him the spirit of light, of 
truth, and of healing power, as he 
ministered to the afflicted Saints 
and comanded them to arise from 
their beds of affliction and how, 
when he was overcome with fatigue, 
he withdrew and left Wilford 
Woodruff and others to continue the 
good work he had begun. 

I see him again as he stood upon 
the platform in the city of Nauvoo, 
delivering 'his last address to the 
Saints before his departure for 
Carthage ; and as he stands there,' 
addressing that vast multitude, he 
draws his sword and holds it out 
on high, and says : "I call on God, 
angels, and men to witness that I 
have drawn my sword in defense of 
the lives of my people, and that it 
shall not be sheathed again until 
they have received the legal rights 
to which they are entitled, or my 
blood shall flow as water upon the 
sand." 

I see him again the day before 
his martyrdom, as he is being

guarded in a room of the hotel 
where officers of the Carthage 
Grays, and others, came into his 
presence out of curiosity, that they 
might behold this wonderful man 
that had been spoken of so freely. 
And as they stood in the presence of 
the prophet, he realized that curi- 
osity prompted their presence there, 
and he said unto them. "Do you 
see anything in my appearance that 
would indicate the criminal that I 
have been pictured by my enemies ?" 
One of the officers spoke up and 
said, "No, General Smith, we do not 
see anything in your appearance 
which would indicate that you are 
the hardened criminal that you have 
been pictured by your enemies ; but 
we cannot see what is in your heart, 
neither do we know what is in your 
mind." The Prophet Joseph replied 
to them, and said, "It is true, gen- 
tlemen, that you cannot see what is 
in my heart, neither do you know 
what my intentions are ; but," he 
said, "I can see what is in your 
hearts, and I know what your in- 
tentions are. You are thirsting for 
my blood, and you will not be satis- 
fied until you have taken my life's 
blood. But I want to say unto you 
that it is not for crime of any kind 
that I and my brethren have been 
persecuted, but it is because we have 
stood for truth and righteousness, 
and I tell you further that the time 
will come when you shall see blood 
to your hearts' content. Men who 
are here in my presence will live to 
see the day and time when they will 
look into the cannon's mouth, and 
when they will see blood and rapine 
to their hearts' content. This I 
leave with you, and when that time 
comes, you will realize that what 
I have spoken has been the words 
of truth." 

We have but to refer to the his- 



tory of the civil war, which occurred 
some 17 years later, to see that very 
section of country where the Proph- 
et was then imprisoned become the 
scene of blood, and resounded with 
the roar of cannon and musketry; 
and those who had killed the 
Prophet Joseph, who had sought his 
life's blood, were thus given the op- 
portunity to witness scenes of war, 
contention and bloodshed, rapine 
and violence to^ their hearts' content, 
I do not believe there was ever a 
more true prophecy spoken by the 
mouth of a Prophet than that ut- 
tered on that memorable occasion 
by the Prophet Joseph. And so I 
testify to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, that he realized that 
the burden of this work would 
eventually roll from his shoulders 
upon those of his successors ; and 
that as a prophet of God he has at- 
tained to the eternal honor and glory 
that shall reward those who are 
faithful in keeping the command- 
ments of God ; which I testify, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MILTON H. WELLING. 

(President of Bear River Stake.) 

The brother who offered the 
opening prayer, this morning, gave 
inspiration to an oft-repeated 
thought that is in the hearts of men 
and women in this Church, when 
they call upon their Father in 
heaven. It was a simple expression 
of gratitude to God for membership 
in this Church. I rejoice that I 
have membership in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I 
believe that is the reason that you 
are here today also. Not because 
you desired to be seen or heard of 
men, but simply because you were 
grateful to God the Eternal Father 
that you had a membership in His 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church. I am indeed grateful for 
my membership in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I 
heard the same thought expressed 
over in my stake of Zion, the other 
day, by a little child, in a meeting 
where children had the privilege of 
participating, and the children gave 
tbe exercises of the afternoon. A 
little child, who was scarcely able 
to enunciate his words properly, 
stood up and said to the people with 
a spirit of simple dignity that 
touched my heart ; "I am glad to 
have a membership in the Church of 
Christ." 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that membership in this Church con- 
fers blessings and privileges, and 
power that men in all the world, if 
they but understood it, would be 
clamoring for. It does not matter 
whether one has money or not. It 
does not matter if we are compelled 
to get along without the wealth of 
the world. But we are here as 
members of this Church, expressing 
the gratitude that is in our hearts 
for simply belonging to the Church 
of Jesus Christ. I trust that, with 
the blessings that come with such 
membership, we Latter-day Saints 
realize that it has brought obliga- 
tions to us as well, that membership 
in the Church is not a blessing that 
does not require that we who have it 
should pay for it, but that we should 
so live that our lives would make us 
worthy of membership in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

I have heard so often in my life 
the thought expressed that it would 
have been a magnificent thing to 
have lived in the past ages, to have 
lived and been able and willing to 
suffer, if need be, with those who 
have been martyred for the sake of 
righteousness and truth, from the 



time when the Savior lived upon the 
earth. We marvel today that men 
did not understand His ministry, 
that those who ought to have be- 
friended Him rejected His testi- 
mony, and crucified the Christ. 
When the Prophet Joseph lived 
upon the earth, as has been very 
beautifully and strikingly expressed 
to us this morning by President 
Tolton, the people misunderstood 
his ministry, rejected his testi- 
mony, and killed the prophet of the 
living God. We who live today 
feel that it is a remarkable thing 
that those people did not better un- 
derstand the significance of the min- 
istry and work of Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet. I am one of those, my 
brethren and sisters, who believe 
that being a member of the Church 
today is fraught with just as great 
significance as it ever has been in 
the history of the past, and I believe 
that it is just as needful today for 
us to be absolutely faithful, and de- 
voted to the teachings that we re- 
ceive from the servants of God, as 
it has ever been in the past history 
of this Church, or of any church in- 
stituted for the worship of our 
Father in heaven, in any dispensa- 
tion of the gospel. I sometimes think 
that our people in studying and con- 
templating the history of the past 
lose the proper significance of their 
relationship to the Church of Christ 
today. 

I wonder if, in hearing the splen- 
did testimonies, and reading the 
splendid writings of these men who 
have lived and died for the interests 
of the Church, and the establishment 
of the Gospel in times past, if we 
feel that our lives and the lives of 
other men today are just as import- 
ant in the work of God as any that 
have preceded them, humble though 
they be, I believe that the Lord re- 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING. 



19 



quires of His children today a de- 
votion and service in the interests of 
the Church that is just as binding 
upon us as it has ever been in times 
past. I cannot conceive of anything 
that we are doing, or trying to do, 
that would bring greater condemna- 
tion to us than a departure from 
the testimony and the faith that has 
been handed down to us from our 
fathers. 

I believe, as President Tolton has 
said, that it is a proper thing to 
contemplate the ministry of Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, and to learn 
therefrom the great lessons which 
he presented to the world. I believe 
that these young men and women 
that live today, and older men and 
women, have had made plain to 
them the necessity of conforming 
their lives to the lives of these great 
leaders of the Church in the past; 
if we do not conform our lives to 
their testimony and teachings we 
will be under the greater condemna- 
tion because of our knowledge in 
that respect. 

I have great pleasure in saying 
that I believe the young people in 
this Church- at heart are true ; but 
I wish that we could put away more 
of our indifference. I wish that we 
were more steadfast and more de- 
voted in our attitude towards the 
servants of the Lord in this Church. 
I believe, if that was our attitude, 
we would be a better people than we 
are today, more worthy of the sac- 
rifice that was made by the Prophet 
for the Church, more worthy of the 
sacrifice that was made, later on, by 
the indefatigable labor of our fath- 
ers, in conquering the desert for our 
sake. What condemnation could be 
greater today for us than to be un- 
worthy of the men and women who 
have builded this great empire in the 
west ? 



It is my firm conviction and belief 
that the young people of today will 
be worthy of their fathers and moth- 
ers, will be worthy of every sacri- 
fice that has been made in order that 
we might establish ourselves here in 
the very choicest spot, apparently, 
that there is upon the face of the 
whole earth. How grateful we 
ought to be, how devoted our 
service to our Father in Heaven ! I 
say, fervently today, I am grateful 
for my membership in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and being grateful, I desire to ex- 
press that gratitude, that appreci- 
ation, in the service of the Church ! 
T don't believe there ever was a 
time in the history of this organiza- 
tion, or ever will be, when service 
for the Church of Christ is more im- 
portant than it is todav. when men 
should be faithful and true to the 
obligations they have entered into 
in holy places, when men should 
honor the Priesthood of the living 
God, and when they should be will- 
ing to go and testify to the world 
that they know of a truth the divin- 
ity of the Gospel which they have es- 
poused. 

I testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that I know that the Gospel 
is true, and I know that there is 
pleasure, satisfaction, and joy to 
those who devote themselves faith- 
fully to the work of the Lord today. 

Mav God bless the hosts of Israel 
who have assembled here at this 
conference, and may His Spirit di- 
rect and overrule everything that is 
said and done here for our good, is 
my humble prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD. 

(President of North Davis Stake.) 

This is a very inspiring sight 
that has met my gaze, as I have 
been sitting here upon the stand this 
morning, a very unusual one to me. 
I am sure that I shall be voicing 
the sentiment of all who are here 
present when I testify, as my 
brethren have who -have preceded 
me, that I am profoundly grateful 
for the gospel, and for the testi- 
mony which the Lord has given to 
me of its truth. I have no misgiv- 
ings about the future of this 
Church. I am positive that it is 
founded upon the solid rock, and 
that it will stand, and though I ex- 
pect there will be renewal from 
time to time of persecution, I am 
still quite sure that the membership 
of this Church will not decrease, 
but that it will increase year after 
year until the Church, and the in- 
fluence of the Church, shall spread 
over the whole earth. I feel quite 
positive that the youth of Zion will 
stand true and firm. As a member 
or a representative of the third gen- 
eration of a family of Latter-day 
Saints, I am proud to say that I 
have full faith and confidence in the 
authorities of the Church as con- 
stituted today, and in the power of 
God as made manifest through the 
ministrations of the brethren who 
stand at the head of the Church. 

I have been thinking, this morn- 
ing, of a conversation I had re- 
cently with a gentleman located in 
Utah, who came from one of the 
Eastern states, and has, for about 
four years, been quite intimately 
associated with our people, and is a 
student, more or less, of the gospel. 
He has studied our social condi- 
tions, and in the course of his resi- 
dence among us has come to regard 



our people very highly. In the con- 
versation referred to, the gentleman 
said : "I think I see signs of the 
time coming when we shall have 
arrived at a unity of faith. I be- 
lieve that during my residence 
among your people I have observed 
a tendency of your coming some- 
what toward us, and I think that, in 
some respects, the other churches 
are drifting toward you. I look for- 
ward to the time when your Church 
will not be quite so particular about 
its forms and ceremonies, and or- 
dinances and the things you now 
hold sacred and necessary, and 
which differentiate you from other 
peoples and other churches of the 
world, when you will lay them aside 
and when we shall all view religious 
matters from almost if not quite one 
standpoint." 

Now, I have been thinking about 
that, and I have wondered if there 
is anything in connection with the 
outward expression, at least, of our 
religious life which would lead an 
outside observer to believe that we 
are veering somewhat from the 
straight line that our fathers and 
our mothers followed;, if, indeed, 
our faith in these ordinances, and 
our reverence and respect for them, 
is diminishing. T am not at all pes- 
simistic about this, but if there 
should be some such tendency — and 
it may be that you who are assem- 
bled here will have obesrved it if 
there is such a thing — it is a good * 
time for us to discover it and check 
it. We might profitably take stock 
of ourselves, and see if our faith 
is as surely and safely founded upon 
the rock of revelation as was that 
of our parents ; if we recognize as 
fully as did they the necessity of 
having performed for us the sacred 
ordinances of the gospel ; if, for 
instance, the young people of to- 



ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD. 



21 



day are just as desirous as young 
men and young women were in 
earlier days of the Church that 
when they take partners unto them- 
selves it shall be under the sanction 
of the priesthood of God, and in 
the places that He has appointed ; 
or if there is a disposition to disre- 
gard this very important privilege, 
and to feel that it does not matter 
so much whether they are married 
by civil contract or in the temple of 
the Lord. If such a sentiment is 
found, it would be prudent for us 
to do all in our power to correct it, 
for, my brethren and sisters, the 
ordinances and ceremonies of this 
Church have been revealed as part 
of the gospel, and no one of them 
can be omitted or disobeyed by us, 
if we are to attain salvation in the 
celestial kingdom of God. 

We sometimes hear it said, by 
those who have no faith in the 
Church, or in the efficacy of its or- 
dinances, that so long as a man is 
honest and does right to his fellow- 
men, all will be well with him in 
the hereafter. There is doubtless 
truth in that statement, but it is not 
the whole truth. There is a just 
God, and every man will receive a 
reward for the good he does. If he 
is honest, he will receive the re- 
ward of an honest man. If he is 
virtuous, he will receive in this 
world and in the next the reward 
of the virtuous. If he is truthful, 
he will receive a truthful man's re- 
ward. And so with others of the 
Christian virtues mentioned by the 
Apostle Paul, and which have been 
reiterated in our Articles of Faith, 
wherein it is said, "We believe in 
being honest, true, chaste, benevo- 
lent, virtuous, and in doing good to 
all men." Men of the world can do 
and be all of these things, and many 
of them are perhaps living up to 



these laws equally as well as many 
of the Latter-day Saints. But these 
laws, my brethren and sisters, per- 
tain to this world. They have to do 
with our relationships with men 
here on earth. They belong to the 
terrestrial plane, and living them 
will bring a terrestrial reward. Hon- 
orable men of the earth are entitled 
to this reward and this glory. But 
there are higher laws to be obeyed 
by those who wish to receive a ce- 
lestial reward ; spiritual laws that 
govern in the eternal world beyond. 
The principles of faith and repent- 
ance, the ordinances of baptism and 
confirmation, and all the other 
forms, and ceremonies and ordi- 
nances which the friend of whom I 
spoke thought would sometime be 
dropped by the Church, these must 
all be observed and performed. I 
testify to you that not one of them 
can be or will be dropped, or 
changed or omitted by the Church. 
On the contrary, they will stand 
forever as essential principles and 
ordinances in the Gospel of Christ. 

Faith is the principle that unlocks 
the door to the higher kingdom. 
When men have faith in their 
hearts, they will repent of the sins 
they have committed, and penitently 
they will go before trie Lord as 
those devout Jews went penitently 
before the apostles on the day of 
Pentecost, when they cried with one 
voice, "Men and brethren, what 
shall we do?" Whenever a man 
exercises faith and turns unto the 
Lord with that question on his lips, 
the answer will be to him as it was 
given by the Apostle Peter on that 
memorable day : "Repent, and be 
baptized, every one of you, in the 
name of Jesus Christ for the remis- 
sion of sins and ye shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost." Thus bap- 
tism becomes the door to the higher 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



kingdom of God. Without this or- 
dinance no man can be saved and 
exalted. It touches particularly the 
spiritual part of his being. Baptism 
and the confirmation which follows 
it are absolutely necessary if a man 
is to get into communion with God, 
his Father. Hence these ordinances 
mean everything to us. They have 
always been, are now, and will 
always be a part of the Gospel of 
the Lord, and can never be taken 
away from it. 

And there are other ordinances 
and ceremonies of like importance. 
If I were speaking to a group of 
young people contemplating mar- 
riage, I should suggest to them to 
be careful when selecting com- 
panions in life, that they choose 
those who can go with them before 
the priesthood of God, into the tem- 
ples that have been prepared for 
that purpose, and there be united 
for time and for all eternity. Men 
of the world can unite them for 
time, and have authority to do so, 
but the power has never been given 
unto the ministers of the various 
denominations to unite a man and a 
woman in marriage for more than 
time, or only until death parts them. 

But how different with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints ! We know that the 
Lord has given the priesthood unto 
men, and commissioned them to 
perform on earth the rites and cere- 
monies that are essential to prepare 
men and women for the life to 
come. Thus, to us, the ordinances 
of baptism, confirmation, blessing, 
administrations, ordinations, and 
marriage, are sacred and necessary 
parts of the gospel. We cannot 
dispense with them. And so, our 
young people are taught that when 
they marry they should do so under 
the blessing of the priesthood, and 
in the places prepared for this pur- 



pose, so that when they go beyond 
they may meet their life's compan- 
ions, and continue there the rela- 
tionships that have been so dear to 
them in life. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
not lose the reverence our fathers 
and mothers have always had for 
these sacred ordinances. I thank 
the Lord that in this Church there 
has been established with the priest- 
hood the right to bind upon earth 
and it shall be bound in heaven, to 
seal upon earth and it shall be sealed 
in heaven, and I hope and pray that 
the Lord will so temper the spirit 
and feeling of all the people of the 
Church that we of today may be in 
fact, as one of our singers has said : 

"True to the faith that our parents 

have cherished, 
True to the truth for which martyrs 

have perished, 
To God's command, soul, heart and 

hand, 

Faithful and true we will ever stand." 

May God grant this to us all, and 
may our young people rise in the 
dignity of the positions they hold, 
as descendants of the stalwart men 
and devoted women who, under the 
power of God, and with His bless- 
ings, were instrumental in establish- 
ing this Church, and stand forth as 
worthy representatives of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and be willing always to 
proclaim these truths to all the 
world. I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN G. M'QUARRIE. 

(Late President of Eastern States 
Mission.) 

Why, my brethren and sisters, 
should we be grateful for a stand- 
ing in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints? There is one 



ELDER JOHN G. McQUARRIE. 23 



reason why I am grateful, why I 
feel that it gives me strength and 
power; that is because I feel that I 
have a mission. I do not believe 
that any individual, or any nation, 
will ever accomplish anything great 
in the world until they feel that they 
have a mission, and until that mis- 
sion is clearly defined in their minds. 

If we review the history of na- 
tions, we will realize that those na- 
tions that have been great, and 
strong and powerful, have been the 
nations that have felt that they had 
a mission, that they were to perform 
service not only for themselves but 
a service to the world. I do not be- 
lieve that any individuals ever do 
anything very great, or make the 
most of all their powers until they 
love something, something bigger 
than themselves ; I believe that our 
power is then increased to that de- 
gree that we feel the greatness of 
the cause with which we are as- 
sociated. I was strongly reminded 
of this fact in listening to one of the 
beautiful songs that was sung here. 
The sister who led that song ap- 
peared one night in a great recital 
in New York City, in company with 
three other girls, and at the conclu- 
sion of their number they received 
a generous applause from the audi- 
ence. Their instructor said to the 
audience, "It may be interesting to 
you to know that these three girls 
all come from far off Utah." Of 
course they had an impression that 
they were all "Mormon girls." It 
happened that this sister had an- 
other number to render later in the 
evening, and as she appeared before 
that audience she felt that she was 
not merely a student with this in- 
structor, but that she then stood as 
the representative of a people, her 
people, and that their work would 
be judged somewhat by her ability 



and the way in which she rendered 
her part. Never before had she felt 
the necessity of using the gift that 
God had given her as she did on 
that occasion, and probably never 
before had she received such a tre- 
mendous applause as when she had 
finished that number. This may be 
considered only a little occasion, but 
I refer to it just to show what a 
power it gives to one to feel that he 
has a cause, that he is representing 
a people, and that he has a mission 
to perform in the world. 

In visiting the great fair at San 
Francisco, where we saw repre- 
sented the accomplishments of men, 
and where they were trying to 
single out what men had really done, 
and honor those who had really 
blessed the world, I noticed it was 
not great scholars, only those that 
had been content to merely preach 
to a congregation, and have ease 
and comfort in a well provided 
home; it was not that class of men 
that received honor upon that oc- 
casion. It was not the men who had 
accumulated vast sums of money 
and great wealth that were honored 
and noticed; but old Ezra Meeker 
with his ox team, who blazed the 
trail across the continent, men who 
did something to build up this great 
empire of the west, they were the 
men who were honored, whose 
statues were placed on high. I was 
proud when Utah was celebrating 
her pioneer anniversary, proud of 
the honor that was done to her, to 
feel that Utah and her pioneers, the 
men who have done something and 
felt that they had a mission, that 
they were really coming into their 
own. Both the mayor of San Fran- 
cisco and the man who represented 
the Governor of the State of Cali- 
fornia said "We gladly take off our 
hats to old Dad Utah and we 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



humbly and freely acknowledge that 
had it not been for the pioneers of 
Utah the present greatness of Cali- 
fornia would have been impossible." 
The Mayor of San FYancisco said : 
"We appreciate the wonderful work 
accomplished by the committee that 
has provided or reared these mag- 
nificent buildings. Their work is 
great ; they have accomplished won- 
ders, but it is nothing when com- 
pared with the wonderful work and 
great mission accomplished by the 
pioneers of Utah." 

If we receive any honor as the 
youth of Zion, boys and girls grow- 
ing up in this great inter-mountain 
region, if any honor ever comes to 
us, if we have any real satisfaction 
when we have lived our lives, it will 
be because we have proven worthy, 
as has been stated, of the sacrifices 
that have been made for us by those 
who have gone before, and because 
we have 'builded wisely upon the 
broad and strong, and splendid 
foundation that they have laid. 

May God grant that we may 
never forget our obligations to God 
and to our fathers, and may He 
grant that we may never lose sight 
of the mission before us. May we 
feel that we have the greatest mis- 
sion in the world, the mission of re- 
echoing the voice of God, crying, 
"Come out of her, O ye my people." 
Come out of the old world and build 
Mine alters in the new. Men who 
have the mission of calling out of 
the world those who feel worldly, 
calling them out to assemble to- 
gether with those who want to serve 
God, to learn of His ways and to 
walk in His paths, and to establish 
righteousness here upon the earth, 
and work for the accomplishment 
and the consummation of the pur- 
poses of God, until the kingdoms of 
this world shall become the king- 



doms of our God ; and I pray that 
we may be blessed in it, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN R. BARNES. 

My beloved brethren and listers, 
this is indeed a surprise to me to 
be asked to address you this morn- 
ing. I have listened with strict at- 
tention to the testimonies of my 
brethren who have preceded me, 
and I rejoice in the testimonies 
which they have borne. It is true 
they have been varied, but all lead 
in the same direction. 

As Brother Smith said, I received 
the Gospel in my youth, in my 
native land, a little ' more than 
sixty-seven years ago; and God in 
His mercy blessed me with a testi- 
mony prior to my entering into the 
Church. This may seem strange, 
but I fully understood that if I 
would ever attain to that glory and 
exaltation that is promised to the 
Saints, I must indeed obey the com- 
mandments of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ as they were taught by 
His humble elders in that day. 
Hence, in my fifteenth year, I 
obeyed the Gospel, and in due time 
received the priesthood, and later 
I gathered with the Saints to this 
valley. I have endeavored in a hum- 
ble way to keep the commandments 
of God, although in my weakness I 
have made many mistakes. Today 
I rejoice in the testimony which God 
gave me in my youth, which has 
continued with me up to the pres- 
ent time. 

I know that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, as my brethren who 
have preceded me have testified ;, and 
in my reflections I have long ago 
come to this conclusion that there 
was a necessity for God, the Eter-

nal Father, and His Son Jesus 
Christ to manifest themselves to 
man upon the earth in this dispen- 
sation. When we look at the world 
and the condition in which mankind 
were, without a knowledge of God, 
no man, so far as I know, except 
only those who received the prom- 
ise from the Savior that they should 
dwell upon the earth until His sec- 
ond coming, could arise and say 
that they knew that God lived. 
There was a great diversity of opin- 
ion as to what kind of being God 
was. Some believed that He was 
so big that He filled the whole earth, 
and others, that He was without 
body, parts or passions, and no man 
had authority to say that they knew 
that God lived and to give a descrip- 
tion of His appearance and person- 
age. Hence in order that this 
knowledge might be restored to 
men, in order to know God and His 
Son Jesus Christ, which is eternal 
life, it was necessary for the Father 
and the Son to appear to the 
Prophet Joseph. 

I rejoice in the character of the 
Prophet, believing and knowing that 
he, like Jeremiah of old ,was while 
yet in the spirit world, before he 
came to this stage of action, called 
to do this very work. And hence 
the Spirit of God moved upon that 
youth to heed the words which had 
been published to the world, that 
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him 
ask of God, who giveth to all men 
liberally and upbraideth not, and it 
shall be given him." He had faith 
in that divine promise, and in the 
humility of his soul he went before 
the Father, and there asked the 
question, "Which of all these con- 
flicting sects are right?" He re- 
ceived the answer : "None of them, 
my son." What a wonderful word ! 
Did he expect that answer? I do 



not think he did, but it was never- 
theless true. Why were none of 
them of God? They were man- 
made creeds, man-made theories, 
adopted by men who were not in- 
spired, and among them there was 
not existing a shadow of authority 
to administer the ordinances of God, 
as President Blood has shown when 
touching upon that principle. They 
were without that authority, and did 
not know God. No sooner had he 
received this divine testimony than 
the world, almost unanimously, 
arose against him and persecuted 
him from that hour on. The powers 
of darkness knew the importance of 
the mission that that boy was about 
to be entrusted with, and hence used 
all the efforts and powers of the ad- 
versary 'to destroy him, but God 
preserved him until he had accomp- 
lished his work, through the various 
scenes that have been referred to 
this morning, the various conditions 
in which he was placed, the various 
trials and tribulations, winding up 
with the sacrifice of his life. 

I rejoice in this testimony and 
the knowledge that the Lord has 
given me in reference to his 
Prophet Joseph. T know that the 
work in which we are engaged is 
true, and I reflect a great deal in 
regard to the conditions that sur- 
round us. Joseph fulfilled his great 
mission ; and the others who have 
succeeded him as President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints have filled their missions, 
and today we have a prophet of God 
upon the earth inspired similarly to 
His Prophet Joseph Smith. Om 
present leaders are indeed inspired 
of God, and so far as we listen to 
them they will lead us in the path of 
rectitude, in the path that will lead 
us back into the presence of our 
Father and our God. Are we listen- 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing to their counsel ? Are we giving 
heed to their advice? or, are we 
every one going his own way, seek- 
ing to follow his own will instead 
of seeking to follow the will of the 
Father? We can answer these 
questions for ourselves. I know 
that it is our duty and privilege to 
live before God so that we can have 
for ourselves the inspiration and 
comfort of the Holy Ghost, and it 
is our duty to constantly uphold and 
sustain those who are called upon to 
preside over us, whether in the stake 
or the ward, and those who preside 
over the Church. It is our duty to 
uphold them and sustain them, not 
only by our prayers but by our ac- 
tions also. I claim that actions speak 
louder than words. It is our duty, 
my brethren and sisters, to so live 
before God that our example will 
•become an ensample to the world, 
that they seeing our good works and 
our daily course of conduct will 
discern that there is something more 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints than there is in 
the religions of the world. 

I presume that I am taking up 
more time than I ought. I thank 
God for the knowledge and testi- 
mony that He has given me, and 
while I live I hope to be able to 
bear this testimony. I have written 
this testimony and I want it to be 
read to those who shall attend my 
funeral, the testimony that God has 
given me in regard to this matter, 
for I know it is true. 

Persecution may rage, and I know 
that yet many times the Saints of 
God will be called to suffer before 
we triumph, before the Church of 
God finally triumphs over the world. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
persecution will come again. Does 
persecution hurt us? I thought 
when the brother spoke of those 



who wished that they had lived in 
the days that are past, when perse- 
cution raged, they need not wish 
for that, for persecution will come 
quick enough ; it will come severe 
enough ; it will test the faith of 
those who are members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, for if I am not mistaken 
the day will come when it will be all 
a man's life will be worth to testi- 
fy as I am testifying this morning. 
How shall we be prepared for that 
day? By living near to God. Our 
daily lives must conform to the 
commandments which the Father 
has given. It is not enough that 
we attend conference. It is not 
enough that we attend our meet- 
ings ; our daily lives must be pure, 
upright, honest before God, show- 
ing every man that .we are indeed 
followers of the meek and lowly 
Jesus, that we have indeed a testi- 
mony of Jesus, which is the spirit 
of prophecy, and that we have with- 
in us a knowledge which will lead 
us to enter the temples of God and 
perform the ordinances that Presi- 
dent Blood referred to, ordinances 
for the dead as well as the living. 

Is it of much importance to the 
young people that they go to the 
house of the Lord? Is it not just 
as well, some may ask, that they 
(be married by this minister or the 
other minister ? No ; if you want 
the promises and blessings of God 
to follow you in the life that is to 
come you must obey the laws upon 
which those blessings are predi- 
cated. If our young people want 
the society of one another in the life 
to come, as husband and wife, they 
must enter the house of God, and 
there receive the blessings through 
the authority of those who have the 
power to give them. The world 
has no authority beyond this life. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH.

This life is of vast importance to us, 
but the days and hours are fast flit- 
ting by us, and it behoves us, you 
and me, to let not a day pass by 
without seeing to it that we are in 
fellowship with the Spirit of God; 
that we have within our bosom that 
knowledge and testimony that 
causes us to seek to our Father, that 
causes us to seek diligently to do 
His will and keep His command- 
ments. 

I pray God ever to be with you. 
May His peace and blessings be 
with us, and with the youth of 
Zion. I claim that it is the duty of 
us of mature years to set examples 
before the young people of which 
we need not be ashamed that they 
can look upon us with respect and 
can hearken unto us, knowing that 
our desires and aims have been to 
do the will of God. May the bless- 
ings of God be with us all. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Blessings attending the inhabitants of 
Zion — Testimonies of missionaries 
bearing fruit — Importance of im- 
planting faith in the hearts of the 
children — Peace in the souls of those 
who love God. 

Brethren and sisters, the Taber- 
nacle is full, this, the Assembly Hall 
is full, and there are hundreds of 
people on the block who cannot get 
into the buildings. This is the Lord's 
day, and Sunday naturally affords 
the best opportunity for attendance 
at conference, but I hope that dur- 
ing the remainder of this conference 
the Latter-dav Saints will avail 
themselves of the privilege of at- 
tending the meetin.es — at least that 
the Tabernacle may be filled at every 
session. 

T have enioved the testimonies of 
my brethren this morning and would 



be glad to hear from others if time 
permitted. 

The world is in turmoil. War is 
poured out on a large part of the 
earth. The selfishness of mankind 
in this life is apparent on all sides, 
and in the midst of it all I know of 
no people that are so contented with 
this life, or who have such an assur- 
ance of eternal life, as the Latter- 
day Saints. We are fortunate in 
having faith in God and His reve- 
lations to us and in having our feet 
planted on the land that He has said 
is choice above all other lands. This 
is Zion and will continue to be so 
unto the pure in heart. I am glad 
that so many of our Father's chil- 
dren are seeking to learn His will, 
and are conforming their lives to 
teachings which will eventually take 
them back into His presence. The 
Gospel is finding a response where- 
ever it is preached. Hundreds of 
our representatives are in the field 
in all parts of the world proclaim- 
ing the truth. My eyes have been 
dimmed with tears when in other 
lands, and among the peoples of this 
nation, when I have seen your sons 
and daughters arise and bear wit- 
ness, their hearts overflowing with 
Gratitude, that they did know that 
God had revealed His work in this 
latter day. 

There is no blessing that could 
come to me that would be more joy- 
ful than to have my children, who 
have been given to me by our Heav- 
enly Father, blessed with a testi- 
mony of the truth and live in obe- 
dience to that testimony throughout 
their lives. If there are any of us 
who lack faith in this work it is be- 
cause we have not kept the com- 
mandments of God. If there are any 
who do not know that this is the 
work of our Father, it is because 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they have not done their duty. I 
know as I know that I live that this 
is the Lord's work and that knowl- 
edge comes as a result of keeping 
His commandments. This latter- 
day gospel is finding its way among 
men, because of the strength that is 
in the truth revealed in this day, and 
its promulgation by your faithful 
sons and daughters. It is winning 
its way, and oh, how I rejoice when 
I see Latter-day Saint youths and 
maidens of this generation stand be- 
fore congregations who have assem- 
bled to hear the Gospel, and testify 
of its truth, in humility and faith, 
and with a desire to bless their fel- 
lowmen ! They may be seen upon 
the street corners of the great cities 
of the world, teaching the truth as 
God gives them power and oppor- 
tunity to do, proclaiming the princi- 
ples that are necessary for mankind 
to know for their eternal exaltation. 

This is our Father's work, and is 
not to be trifled with. It is of the 
utmost importance to us. Let us 
so order our lives that when the call 
comes we may answer, "Father, 
here am I," if need be to go to the 
ends of the earth. Let us have our 
houses in order, and endeavor to 
establish faith in our children, that 
thev may be willing to respond to 
every call, and feel in the depths of 
their souls to say I am ready to go 
wherever my Heavenly Father de- 
sires me to go. Let us live so that 
the sweet influence enjoyed this 
morning may be ever with us. There 
is nothing that can compare with the 
ioy that will be yours when, after 
keeoing the faith, you are called 
home and permitted to meet with 
vour loved ones in our Father's 
kingdom. Let us love and sustain 
each other, and sustain those who 
preside over us ; honor the servants 



of the Lord as He has honored 
them. 

Though the world may be filled 
with distress, and the heavens gather 
blackness, and the vivid lightnings 
flash, and the earth quake from cen- 
ter to circumference, if we know 
that God lives, and our lives are 
righteous, we will be happy, there 
will be peace unspeakable because 
we know our Father approves our 
lives. 

May the Lord have us in His 
keeping ; may we live worthy of His 
love day by day and overcome the 
temptations of life, and, when the 
time comes for us to go home, may 
we be gathered with our dear ones 
on the other side, and there receive 
the welcome plaudit from the Mas- 
ter of heaven and earth : Well done, 
my children, come home and enjoy 
eternal life and continued progress 
throughout all eternity. This is my 
prayer for all, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Sister Ethel Anderson, and 
choir, sang the hymn, "As the dew 
from heaven distilling." 

The closing prayer was by Elder 
Thomas R. Cutler. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 10 
a. m. Elder Rudger Clawson pre- 
sided, and the 33rd Ward choir, 
conducted by Joseph Poll, furnished 
the music. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART.

Elder Arthur W. Horsley offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir sang the hymn, "High 
on the mountain top." 

ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 

(President of Duchesne Stake.) 

Brethren and sisters, we have 
some up from the four quarters of 
the earth to be in attendance upon 
the Semi-Annual General Confer- 
ence, which opens this morning, 
that we may learn more fully of the 
ways of the Lord, and return to our 
homes and endeavor to walk more 
circumspectly in His paths. 

I deem myself under sacrifice by 
being deprived of the privilege of a 
place in the Tabernacle this morn- 
ing, that I might listen to the open- 
ing address of the President, and no 
doubt, in this respect, we all have 
harmonious sentiments ; but it is 
willed otherwise, therefore, let us 
submit ourselves with becoming 
humility to our present lot. 

We commenced these services by 
singing the hymn, "We thank Thee, 
O God, for a Prophet, to guide us 
in these latter-day days." As we did 
so I wondered whether we really 
sense the full significance of these 
words, and in very truth feel the 
gratitude they convey. This has 
been designated as "The dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times." It is 
designed to be laden with most im- 
portant events, as the essential keys 
of the Gospel of all former dispen- 
sations are to be committed to it ; 
and all important achievements, 
spiritually and temporally, are con- 
verging toward the second coming 
of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, as a distinctive feature in 
fulfilment of the promise made at 
the time of His transfiguration, in 
the meridian of time. 



The Prophet Isaiah foresaw that 
the Lord, at a certain time of the 
world's history, would "proceed to 
do a marvelous work and a won- 
der ;" and the early revelations unto 
the Prophet Joseph Smith clearly 
indicated this day to be the time of 
its fulfilment, and set forth the Gos- 
pel, with all the achievements to be 
accomplished under its divine power 
and authority, to be that "work." 
Doubtless, many worthy Saints who 
have gone before, who, through the 
eye of prophecy, were permitted to 
behold this age, well nigh envied 
those who should live during it and 
be successful participants in its ac- 
complishments. 

The first important event usher- 
ing in this dispensation was the visi- 
tation of the Father and the Son to 
Joseph Smith, when he was a boy, 
and in answer to his query as to 
which of all the various churches 
was divinely recognized, he was told 
that they had all gone astray, and 
for him to go not after any of them, 
and that in due time the true Gospel 
would be restored. 

A few years later, in the year 
1823, the Angel Moroni was sent to 
Joseph, who acquainted him further 
regarding this work that was about 
to commence, and revealed to him 
the existence of a book of metallic 
plates, upon which were inscribed 
the history of the ancient inhab- 
itants of this continent, of some of 
whom the American Indians are a 
remnant. After four years training, 
Moroni finally delivered unto Joseph 
these plates, together with the Urim 
and Thummim, by the aid of which, 
and through the gift and power of 
God, Joseph translated this history 
into the English language. He 
found that not only was it profane 
history, but that it related the hand 
dealings of God with branches of 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the House of Israel on this conti- 
nent, and contained the Gospel as 
given unto the Nephites by Jesus in 
person, after His crucifixion. This 
same Moroni had stood, 1400 years 
before, as the last of his exter- 
minated race, who had fallen 
through transgression. He being 
the last historian had, under divine 
instruction, hid these records in the 
Hill Cumorah, and it was fitting 
that he should restore them when 
the time arrived for their coming 
forth. On the east pinnacle of yon- 
der Temple stands his statue, trum- 
pet in hand, figuring the heralding 
of the Gospel, in fulfilment of the 
vision of John the Revelator, where- 
in he saw an angel bringing the 
Gospel again to earth. 

Isaiah saw the coming forth of 
the Book of Mormon, in the day 
when the Lord would "proceed to 
do a marvelous work" when a cer- 
tain people, through their history 
would "speak out of the ground." 
Ezekiel foresaw that a stick, or 
book, of Joseph would be brought 
forth and would go hand in hand 
with the stick of Judah ; and the 
Elders are now going forth into the 
world with these dual witnesses — 
the Bible and Book of Mormon — of 
the hand dealings of God with these 
branches of the House of Israel. 

As this "marvelous work" un- 
folded, John the Baptist, in the year 
1829, came and conferred upon 
Joseph the keys of the Aaronic 
Priesthood, and was followed by 
Peter, James and John, who con- 
ferred the keys of the Melchizedek 
Priesthood, they themselves having 
received the same in the Messianic 
dispensation. 

A House of the Lord having been 
erected at Kirtland, Ohio, under 
divine instructions, the climax of 
these commitments seemed then to 



have been reached. The Savior ap- 
peared therein to the Prophet 
Joseph and Oliver Cowdery, pro- 
claimed to them His identity, for- 
gave them of sin, declared them to 
be clean before Him, and accepted 
the Temple. Following this visita- 
tion came Moses, Elias and Elijah 
and committed, respectively, the 
keys of the gathering of Israel ; the 
dispensation of the Gospel of Abra- 
ham, through whom all nations of 
the earth were to be blessed ; and 
the keys of salvation of the dead. 
With respect to his mission, the 
Prophet Elijah declared that the 
time had fully come spoken of by 
Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) 
would be sent "before the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord come, to 
turn the hearts of the fathers to the 
children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the whole earth be 
smitten with a curse." 

I humbly pray that tnrough faith, 
repentance and good works, and 
through the blood of the Redeemer, 
we shall be cleansed from all sin, 
and finally prove ourselves wholly 
worthy of the privilege and the re- 
sponsibility of being participants in 
this "marvelous work," and of be- 
ing partakers of its munificent 
blessings ; which may Our Father 
grant in the name of His Son, Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 

(President of Cassia Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, we 
have gathered from our respective 
homes to attend this General Con- 
ference of the Church. Eighty-five 
and a half years have passed since 
the Lord, through the agency of the 
youthful Prophet Joseph Smith or- 
ganized His Church in this dispen- 
sation. Marvelous progress has 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 



31 



been made during the past, under 
trie guiding care of the Almighty, 
but great as the development has 
been, we may look for and should 
expect to behold greater works than 
these, in the unfolding of the possi- 
bilities of the future, when those 
who are now careless, and indiffer- 
ent to the responsibility of member- 
ship, and" the obligations of the 
Priesthood, shall awaken to the 
same righteous zeal, and intelligent 
efficiency in their religious duties 
that is manifest by the leaders in 
Israel, and by thousands of good, 
faithful men and women in all of 
the wards and stakes of Zion, as 
well as in the missions. Men are 
reaching out after greater efficiency 
in all the secular affairs of life, as 
the Church is urging its members to 
more zealous application and nob- 
ler results. 

We were favored in this city, a 
few days ago, with a visit by Mr. 
Harold Bell Wright, the renowned 
author, who, in an address before 
the Bonneville Club', took for his 
theme, "The Royal Family of To- 
morrow." After referring to the 
world war now in progress, and 
which is being sustained under the 
present systems of men and nations, 
where faith and love are alike being 
destroyed, and selfishness and pride 
have obscured the more important 
considerations of life, he said that 
the "future bore significant evi- 
dences of the approach of a New 
Royalty in which man would aim 
at an efficiency that would involve 
the study of man, an efficiency that 
meant greater service to humanity." 

We sincerely hope that this state- 
ment is well founded, for it is a well 
known fact of history that man has 
ever been mans' most deadly foe. 
When we consider that "God is the 
Father of the spirits of all flesh" it 



is easy to confess that the race 
should be a truly royal family, 
bound together in bonds of fellow- 
ship and righteousness. 

The pitiable condition of men in 
the religious world, was portrayed 
in an address delivered some months 
prior to the commencement of the 
present European war, by Lord 
Winston Churchill, home secretary 
of the British government in which 
he says: 

"The extreme restlessness seen 
everywhere is the sign of a great 
spiritual wave in history," and adds: 
"Most of us are like boys with cold 
hands, looking on at the 'game.' We . 
don't understand it. Perhaps it looks 
ridiculous to us. We are at cross pur- 
poses, with no anchorage of love or 
anything abiding. We want a religion. 
Perhaps we are waiting for a new 
one. We'd plunge into life, into use- 
fulness, if only we knew what life 
were; but we don't know. The con- 
ception of Christianity given us in our 
youth has failed to satisfy us. We 
are unable to say with the convic- 
tion of our fathers: 'This is the abso- 
lute truth.' The science and agnostic 
critics of the past have riddled that 
religion. We want to know! Whither 
shall we turn for a religion, a sanc- 
tion, a guide to life? We start off 
on our modern Pilgrims' Progress, to 
seek after God, if happily we may find 
Him." Then he states: "That the 
religion chosen must have a positive 
militant righteousness, called the 'New 
Patriotism,' and will involve, when 
adopted, heart and soul, a change in 
the motive of life. It will require a 
life of sacrifice. Not selfishness and 
acquisition. There must be a new 
birth. Man must become his brother's 
keeper. It must acknowledge the prob- 
lems of evil, and grapple with them. 
A striking note of this 'New Patriot- 
ism' is openmindedness; teachableness, 
and hence a capacity for growth. Its 
greatest enemies are those with closed 
mi'ids; the Pharisees of today, who 
neither 'enter in' themselves, nor per- 
mit others to do so. It involves the 
principle of individual worth, and in- 
dividual responsibility. We must 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



trust those whom God trusts, in this 
divine scheme, and love our neighbor 
as ourself." 

As Latter-day Saints, we recog- 
nize the beauty and logic of this 
statement, and we hasten to offer to 
all these modern "Pilgrims," that 
religion for which they are seek- 
ing, for it is to be found in the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, as revealed to 
Joseph, the Prophet of this last 
dispensation. And while the time 
allotted to me, at this Conference, 
will not permit me to enter upon 
this inviting phase of the subject, 
I will just say, that "Mormonism," 
so called, embraces every principle 
and quality sought for by the honest 
in heart. This- is the "absolute 
truth," and the stone which the 
builders have rejected is ready to 
become the chief corner stone in the 
structure of man's eternal salva- 
tion. It is the divine scheme, and 
the only scheme, that will eliminate 
war, and envy, and strife and bit- 
terness from among men and pre- 
pare the earth and her inhabitants 
for the rule of righteousness soon 
to be ushered into the world. We 
invite all men to look into the mer- 
its of this new, yet old religion. 

I will only say, in conclusion, that 
the thought to be gathered from the 
utterances of the noted gentleman 
in these quotations, and which I de- 
sire to leave with you, is the possi- 
bility of greater efficiency and more 
extensive service in the Church of 
Christ. Each of us, as officers and 
members of the Chruch should 
labor diligently in the service of our 
fellow men, with faith and prayer 
and study, that our efforts may be 
directed with intelligence, and 
balanced with wisdom, and sus- 
tained with unfaltering faith and 



devoted love, so that the larger 
results may be achieved in this glor- 
ious cause. 

God has given to His Church the 
most perfect organization in the 
world, and has made it possible for 
us to render the highest order of 
intelligent service, with divine au- 
thority to officiate in His name, 
therefore the responsibility rests 
with us, as to the quantity and the 
quality of the services rendered. 
There can be no more distinguished 
"royalty" than to honor our kin- 
ship with God, and no higher qual- 
ity of "patriotism" than to devote 
our lives to the accomplishment of 
His purposes in the earth. May the 
Lord help us to so live and labor, 
is my humble prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Rain commenced falling heavily, 
and the service was closed by prayer 
by Elder Benjamin Goddard.

I feel it is a great privilege to be 
permitted to meet with my brethren 
and sisters at this conference. I 
never felt the value of it more in 
my life than I do today. I have at- 
tended a great many general con- 
ferences of the Church, as well as 
conferences abroad in the different 
missions, but I never felt any more 
grateful to God for the privilege of 
attending a conference than I do 
today. 1 fully enjoyed the services 
this morning, and I presume that 
most of the congregation this after- 
noon were here at the morning ses- 
sion and heard the addresses that 
were delivered by President Smith 
and President Lund, and heard the 
music, the singing of the choir and 
the song that was sung by Elder 
Ballard, which I enjoyed with the 
rest of the services. 

President Lund, in the course of 
his remarks, asked the question : 
Why we became Latter-day Saints, 
why we joined the Church in spite 
of the obloquy upon it, in spite of 
the opposition of the world and in 
spite of the fact that the "Mor- 
mons" were and are now a people 
despised by the great majority of 
mankind. Well, I felt in my heart 
that the answer was in that song 
that Brother Ballard sang this 
morning. I believe the refrain was : 
"If ye with your whole heart seek 
unto God, ye shall ever surely find 
Him." That may not be the exact 
words, but T think that was the sen- 



timent and we can bear testimony 
that this is true and this is the great 
reason why most of the older mem- 
bers of this Church have become 
Latter-day Saints, receiving the 
truth in the various nations of the 
world and among the various de- 
nominations of Christendom. When 
the Elders of this Church were sent 
forth in the early days of its organ- 
ization, they went' out "without 
purse or scrip" in the way in which 
the ancient apostles traveled. They 
did not take money with them to 
pay their way; they had no wages, 
no salary, no stipend, no means of 
support but that which God raised 
by friends to administer to them. 
They had to seek to the Lord. They 
found Him and those who adminis- 
tered to them also received that 
blessing. I can bear testimony my- 
self that when I heard the Gospel 
preached, away back early in 1850, 
I went to the Lord. I had been 
trained to believe in God. I did not 
know very much about Him, al- 
though I was brought up among 
"Christians," so called. 

I learned that when Joseph Smith, 
the Prophet of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, desired to obtain a knowledge 
of the true Church, to find out which 
was the true religion among all the 
various existing sects, he followed 
the advice of James who said : "Tf 
any of you lack wisdom let him ask 
of God who giveth to all men liber- 
ally and upbraideth not, and it shall 
be given him ; but let him ask in 
faith." That is the great key to it. 
So Joseph in his boyhood retired 
to a grove near his father's resi- 
dence and called upon God that he . 
might learn which was the right re- 
ligion, for a great number of the 
religions of the time were engaged 
in their revival gatherings. Many 
of you know what that is, some of 
you perhaps do not. Revivalism is 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a sort of religious enthusiasm, often 
religious and spiritual inebriety ; 
people are "drunk but not with 
wine, and stagger but not with 
strong drink," using the words of 
Isaiah the Prophet, and they be- 
come sometimes delirious and go 
into all kinds of excesses ; and he 
was puzzled to know which was 
the true religion, and he followed 
the advice of the Apostle James. 
He sought the Lord and he believed 
that God would hear his prayer and 
answer him and in response to his 
petition the Father and the Son, 
God the Father, God the Son Jesus 
Christ, for He was God and was in 
the beginning with God, we read in 
the scripture ancient and modern, 
and God the Father and the Son 
appeared to him and spake to him 
and he was told by the Father to 
hear the Son : "This is my be- 
loved Son, hear Him." And the 
Son spoke to Joseph and told him 
to go after none of them. There is 
a side to the character of Jesus of 
Nazareth a little different to that in 
which He is generally pictured. 

I used to sing when I was a little 
boy and went to Sunday School : 
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, look 
on me, a little child," and I suppose 
He was meek and mild in His char- 
acter, and we are told that we ought 
to entertain a Christian spirit when 
we feel a little disturbed by the 
falsehoods of our enemies. But 
Jesus had two sides to His character 
and one of them was shown on this 
occasion, but not so forcefully as it 
was shown at some periods of His 
ministry on the earth. He said to 
Joseph : "Go after none of them. 
"The professors of religion draw 
near to me with their mouth and 
with their lips do honor me while 
their hearts are far from me and 
their fear toward me is taught by 
the precepts of men. Go after none 



of them ; they are all gone astray." 
You remember, if you are acquaint- 
ed with the history of Jesus, what 
little we have of it in the New Tes- 
tament, that He had a great aver- 
sion to those self-righteous Phari- 
sees and others of their ilk and the 
other sects who were hypocrites. 
"Woe unto you, scribes, pharisees, 
hypocrites ! Ye compass sea and 
land to make one proselyte and 
make him ten-fold more the child of 
hell than he was before." He was 
not very meek and mild upon those 
occasions nor was He when He 
went into the temple and made a 
thong of cords and kicked over the 
tables of the money changers and 
drove out them that sold doves.. 
"My Father's house is a house of 
prayer but ye have made it a den 
of thieves. Get out of here." That 
was the other side of His character 
but He was meek and mild and gen- 
tle to all when they were sincere, 
when He felt that they meant what 
they professed. When sinners were 
repentant, He was kind and gentle 
to them and welcomed them to Him. 
"Come unto me all ye that are weary 
and heavy laden and I will give thee 
rest.' That is where His mildness 
shone out. You must remember 
that Jesus was not only the Lamb of 
God slain from the foundation of 
the world, but He was also the Lion 
of the tribe of Judah. and the time 
is coming when He will shine forth 
in that character. When the work is 
being brought to a consummation 
and the kingdoms of this world are 
arrayed against Him He will come 
forth in His strength and the might 
and majesty of His power, and the 
kingdoms of this world will be 
broken in pieces before the king- 
dom of our God and His Christ. 

Now, I speak thus concerning 
Jesus of Nazareth because He is at 
the head of this work in which we

are engaged. This is no sect of re- 
ligion. This is no mere man-made 
organization. It is divine and was 
from the beginning and the Father 
and His Son appeared and opened 
up the latter-day dispensation. The 
greatest of all dispensations of 
God's mercy to man is opened and 
launched forth upon the earth and 
it will be brought to a grand and 
glorious consummation, for all 
things shall be subdued unto Him 
and He shall reign whose right it is 
to reign over all the earth. The 
promise is made to us as it was 
made of old by the Lord to the peo- 
ple: "Draw near unto me," saith 
the Lord, and I will draw near unto 
you." That is the process. We are 
to draw near unto Deity and Deity 
will stoop down and condescend to 
us and reveal to us that which shall 
be for our good, but we have to 
draw near to Him, as the song says, 
with our whole heart and to serve 
God and be determined to serve 
Him as He has commanded us in 
these latter days, with all our heart 
and might and mind and strength. 

That is what the Lord com- 
manded anciently and has renewed 
again in these latter days. For 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
to whom the Father and the Son 
spake in that heavenly vision, God 
has revealed the fulness of the ever- 
lasting Gospel, and has restored all 
the ordinances and rites and powers 
and privileges and gifts and bless- 
ings pertaining thereunto as they 
were enjoyed in times of old. God 
is the same "yesterday, today and 
forever," and those who draw near 
unto Him with their whole heart 
shall find Him and shall learn of 
Him and understand Him. Of 
course we do not expect to compre- 
hend Deity in the fulness thereof 
while we are in mortality, but the 
day is to come, according to both 



ancient and modern scripture, when 
we will come "face to face" with 
Him and "see Him as He is and be 
made like Him, but every man that 
hath this hope," the apostle John 
says, "purifieth himself even as He 
is pure." Here is something for us 
to consider, my brethren and sisters, 
and friends, if there be any here 
who are not of our faith : that is, 
that there is something more to re- 
ligion than believing in Deity, some- 
thing more than receiving ordin- 
ances and ceremonies and rites, and 
organizations. What is it? It is 
the Spirit and the power of God. 
Jesus Christ, when explaining to 
Nicodemus that peculiar saying that 
"except a man be born again he 
cannot see the kingdom of God," 
and Nicodemus could not under- 
stand it, expounded it this way : 
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, ex- 
cept a man be born of water and of 
the Spirit he can not enter into the 
Kingdom of God." This is some- 
thing we should all understand. It 
is necessary that we should be born 
of water. A great many of our 
modern religionists say that does 
not matter, that the water does not 
amount to anything and so it does 
not matter whether we are born of 
water or not. But Jesus Christ laid 
down as a fundamental that "except 
a man be born of water and of the 
Soirit he cannot enter into the 
Kingdom of God." 

To be born of water is very easy 
to understand, if we will look into 
the life and character and example 
of Jesus Christ. He started out on 
His ministry before entering into 
the preaching of the Gospel and ac- 
complishing the work that the 
Father sent Him to do by going to 
John the Baptist and being- im- 
mersed in the River Jordan. When 
He was baptized of John, we read, 
he came up straightway out of the 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



water and lo! the heavens were 

opened unto Him and the Spirit of 
God rested down upon Him in the 
form or sign of a dove and the 
Father from the heavens said: 
"This is my beloved Son in whom I 
am well pleased." He was born of 
water when He came up from the 
Jordan, and born of the Spirit when 
the Holy Ghost rested down upon 
Him in visible form. The voice of 
the Father proclaimed that He was 
well pleased with Him and He has 
"left us an example that we should 
follow in His steps." I do not want 
to take up time in regard to that 
particular point. If we will read 
the Acts of the Apostles in the New 
Testament we will notice the fact 
that whenever they went forth to 
preach the Gospel they proclaimed 
these principles, that if anybody 
wanted to enter into the Church or 
Kingdom of God they had to be 
baptized for the remission of sins ; 
and that baptism was an immer- 
sion, it was a death to the old life 
and a new birth to the new life. It 
is being "buried with Christ in bap- 
tism," being raised up in the like- 
ness of the resurrection of Christ. 

But then they laid their hands up- 
on the baptized, repentant believers 
and conferred upon them the gift of 
the Holy Ghost. So that the Holy 
Ghost is necessary as a baptism; 
that the individual must be bap- 
tized, immersed in that influence, 
quickened by it, enlightened by it, 
thus becoming one of the sons of 
God by adoption in the Gospel. Ver- 
ily, said the ancient apostle, "they 
that are led by the Spirit of God are 
the sons of God'" Now, here is a 
double birth — the birth of the water 
and the birth of the Soirit, and I 
want to impress upon the minds of 
my brethren and sisters that they 
should teach this to their children, 
not only to be baptized in water 



when they are eight years old, but 
to be "born of the Spirit," as the 
Lord has commanded. He says : 
"Inasmuch as there are parents hav- 
ing children in Zion or in any of 
her Stakes that are organized, who 
teach them not to understand the 
doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, the 
son of the living God, and baptism 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost by 
the laying on of hands when eight 
years old, the sin be upon the heads 
of the parents." Doc. and Cov. 
68:25. It is a splendid thing that 
in every month just before the fast- 
day, which President Smith drew 
our attention to so strongly this 
morning, just before the fast-day 
there is a baptizing day and parents 
send their children, when they are 
of proper age, to be baptized. It is 
to be hoped and believed that be- 
fore they send them they instruct 
them in these things. The Lord says 
il they do not teach them to under- 
stand that doctrine the sin shall be 
upon the heads of the parents. On 
the fast-day, generally, the children, 
after being baptized, are taken to 
the fast meeting and under the di- 
rection of the bishops, hands are 
laid upon them by the Elders and 
the Holy Ghost is confirmed and 
sealed upon them in form. But it 
is for the children to be instructed 
how to reach out, to reach up to 
God with all their heart, and if thev 
do they will find Him and they will 
receive that baptism and inspiration 
of the Holy Ghost from on high 
without which we cannot see and 
comprehend the things of God. 

For, as man by the spirit of man, 
which is in him understands the 
things of this world, so no one can 
comprehend the things of God but 
under the influence and power of 
the Spirit of God, the light of the 
Lord, that divine light which pro- 
ceedeth from His presence through-

out the immensity of space, that 
which is in the sun, in the moon, in 
the stars, in the earth, and in all 
things, and by which He operated 
when He made the worlds and by 
which Jesus, the Son, who was with 
the Father in the beginning oper- 
ated in the formation of this globe. 
It was He, Jesus the Christ, our 
elder brother in the spirit, that was 
spoken to by the Father in the be- 
ginning when He said : "Let us 
make man after our image and our 
likeness," and so on. But the Holy 
Ghost, the Comforter that Jesus 
Christ said He would send when He 
went away, is "a personage of spir- 
it." When He left His disciples He 
said He would not leave them com- 
fortless but He would send to them 
the Spirit of truth from the Father, 
who, when He came, would guide 
them into all truth and take of the 
things of the Father and of the 
"-in and show them to His apostles 
and unto those that received the gift 
of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Father 
and the Son and the Holy Ghost 
are three separate and distinct per- 
sonalities ; they each have their par- 
ticular power and sphere of opera- 
tions, but they are all one in mind 
and purpose, and in act ; they three 
are one in that sense. 

Now, we want our children to un- 
derstand that they can learn of the 
Lord as Joseph the Prophet did. 
Not that every one of them is to re- 
ceive visible manifestations as he 
did ; for he was a special witness 
raised up by the Almighty to usher 
in the greatest and grandest of all 
dispensations, but to learn to be led 
by the Spirit of God, to understand 
its whisperings, its inspiration, and 
if thev do learn that and walk in the 
h>ht that they will not be led astray. 
When those foolish vaearies that 
President Lund alluded to this 
morning, come along from time to 



time and lead some foolish people 
away from the straight and narrow 
path, we know by the Spirit what 
they are. They are not of God. 
They come to deceive, to darken the 
mind, to becloud the understanding, 
to lead people from that which God 
has shown to them to be the truth. 
True. Latter-day Saints hav<; *-'iis 
peculiarity about them that they are 
bom of God, by the water and the 
Spirit. And that Spirit is a spirit 
of revelation. It is a spirit of in- 
spiration : it enlightens the soul, as 
that which we call artificial light 
lightens the natural eyes. These 
lamps that shine here today give the 
same kind of light that comes from 
the sun and from the moon and is 
a property and a manifestation of 
the spirit of truth, the light of truth, 
the intelligence that always existed, 
that never was created or made, the 
Snirit by which God operates 
throuehout all His creations and by 
which He can learn about us when- 
ever He desires, and behold us, and 
can hear and answer our prayers. 

It is a great puzzle to some peo- 
ple how it can possibly be that a 
person, an individual, of form and 
stature, occupying- but one place at 
a time, can hear the prayers of His 
people or can comprehend them as 
David said He does : Said he : 
"There is not a thought of my heart 
but lo ! O God, thou knowest it al- 
together. If I ascend up into heaven 
behold thou art there. If I descend 
down into hell behold thou art 
there ; and if I take the wings of the 
morning and flee to the uttermost 
parts of the earth, there will Thv 
hand lead me and Thy right hand 
guide me." Of course these ex- 
r>res«ions are somewhat fieurative, 
but there is the great fact that God 
on be omnioresent bv the power of 
His universally diffused spirit 
which proceeds from His presence 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



throughout the immensity of space, 
and He can see and discern all 
things by that power, as He told 
Enoch, and Moses also, as you can 
read in The Pearl of Great Price. 
Moses and Enoch were each lifted 
up so that they could see, measur- 
ably, as Deity sees and they beheld 
the multiplicity of the creations of 
God ; and when Enoch declared that 
if a man could count the particles of 
the earth or of a. million earths like 
this, that would not be a beginning 
to the number of God's creations, 
then God told him, "Yea, and mine 
eye can pierce them all." By the 
power of that Spirit he sees and 
comprehends and understands all 
things, and His watchful care and 
His mercies are over all His works. 

There is another thing connected 
with that, which you can understand 
if you will read the 10th chapter of 
the book of Daniel. I will not take 
time to read it. I don't want to take 
up too much time. There are oth- 
ers to speak this afternoon. But do 
you read it. Daniel, the proohet, 
whose words are being fulfilled, 
many of them, in our own time, 
Daniel predicted and saw in vision 
the rising of the great kingdom of 
God in the latter days, to supersede 
and overcome all kingdoms upon 
the face of the earth. He prayed to 
God on a certain occasion and his 
words were not immediately an- 
swered, and he fasted and prayed 
and fasted and prayed but his words 
were not answered in the way that 
he expected, and after three weeks 
had passed by. a heavenly being ao- 
peared before him, an angel of God, 
and he fell down on the ground, and 
the angel said to him : 'Stand up 
like a man ;" and when he stood un 
he told him. "Daniel, from the day 
that thou didst set thine heart to 
understand and seek unto the Lord 
thy words were heard, and T am 



come for thy words ; but the Prince 
of the kingdom of Persia withstoo'1 
me one and twenty days, and lo ! 
Michael, one of the chief princes 
came to help me and now I have 
come for thy words." Three weeks 
had passed by since Daniel com- 
menced to pray for the blessing that 
he desired, and at length the mes- 
senger came to answer him and give 
him the asked-for information. 

Here is something disclosed that 
gives a little key to those who wish 
to understand the world behind the 
veil, the spiritual world, that it is 
organized. As the Church of Christ 
is organized here on the earth with 
quorums and organizations and in- 
stitutions in all their beauty and 
harmony and order, so it is in the 
spiritual sphere, and there are per- 
sonages appointed for different po- 
sitions and districts of that sphere, 
and they can proceed and act ac- 
cording to their office and author- 
ity and according to the sphere of 
their labor. This angel that came 
from the presence of God was 
fought by the powers of evil, evi- 
dently, and was withstood on the 
way for three weeks — one and 
twenty days. Sometimes our prayers 
then, are not immediately answered. 
Daniel's was postponed until the 
time when the angel came. Read- 
ing that chapter and reflecting a 
little may open the eyes of some of 
us in regard to the operations of 
God in His great universe in the 
spiritual world as well as in the na- 
tural world. 

And this is a certainty: If with 
our whole heart we seek God, God 
will draw near to us and we will find 
Him, not expecting, of course, that 
we will behold Him, visibly, that 
He will come down to everybody 
and appear in His personality, but 
by the power of His divine spirit, 
He will draw near to us and we will

39 



draw ;iear to Him, and every Lat- 
ter-day Saint who has really been 
born of the Spirit as well as of the 
water, understands something of 
this. . I don't know of any joy or 
pleasure, any sensation that is de- 
lightful, to be compared with be- 
holding the visions of eternity by 
the power of the Holy Ghost, and 
to have the soul lifted up above sub- 
lunary things and all earthly and 
material matters, to draw near to 
God our Heavenly Father. He is 
our Father, the Father of our 
spirits. We came from Him. He 
has sent us here. We are here for 
a purpose and an object and He de- 
signs our progress, our develop- 
ment into the fulness of His own 
image and likeness and power and 
glory; but to understand Him and 
His ways and to enjoy His lisdit and 
His presence and to find Him real- 
ly, we must be quickened by the 
power of the Holy Ghost and those 
who seek the Lord and try to serve 
Him with all their heart and mind 
and strength, will be able to draw 
near unto Him. 

I know this is true. When I was 
a boy I learned of this Gospel and 
T went to the Lord and inquired of 
Him concerning it. Not one of the 
family to which I belong embraced 
this Gospel, not one of my friends 
or associates in the different sects 
have received it so far as I have 
learned ; but I went to the Lord my- 
self. I believed in Him, I prayed to 
Him, and He enlightened my mind, 
He lit up my soul, He gave me a 
conviction of the truth of this work 
and I went forth and received the 
ordinance of baptism and the ordin- 
ance of confirmation by the laying 
on of hands by men appointed of 
God to minister in these ordinances. 
T received the remission of my sins, 
T received the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, and from that time to the 



present, I can testify that God has 
been with me on the land and on the 
sea, among the wicked and among 
the Saints. In all my labors and 
duties during the years that have 
intervened God has been "my ref- 
uge and strength ;" in Him we shall 
prevail. Our enemies may continue 
their onslaughts ; thev may contemn 
the leaders of this Church as they 
are doing today; they may conspire 
against us, but we shall prevail, not 
because we are so wise or so mighty 
or so numerous, but because God 
is our refuge and our strength, and 
He hears our prayers, and He 
answers our requests when what we 
ask for is wise in Him to bestow. 

We should remember that, my 
brethren and sisters. Sometimes in 
sickness, people call upon the Lord 
and they get angry because their 
prayers are not immediately an- 
swered. That is very foolish ; we 
are all foolish, I suppose, to some 
extent, weak, for we are human ; 
but we should understand that God 
is our Father, and fathers do not 
always give to their children every- 
thing they ask for. They know bet- 
ter than the children what they 
should have. So let us ask in faith 
and in trust, trust in God as well as 
faith in God, and keep His com- 
mandments, and all shall be well 
with us, and we will be guided of 
Him and inspired of Him and He 
will lead us in the path of life. 
Brethren and sisters, don't let us 
leave prayers to God to times of 
trouble and sorrow and distress, but 
call upon .the Lord in the morning 
and the evening, every day ; and 
when we are full of joy and glad- 
ness call upon Him and offer our 
prayers of praise unto Him. We 
should praise the Lord with halle- 
lujahs in our souls. Tf we can't 
give them voice, like the choir has 
done so beautifully today; we can

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



praise God in the soul ; we can draw 
near to Him in gratitude for His 
mercies unto us, for they have been 
wonderful and manifold to this 
Church to which we belong. God 
has manifested His power from the 
beginning, and it will continue and 
will prevail. 

Now let us understand another 
point, and that is, that when we 
pray to God, the Eternal Father, 
we pray to Him in the name of 
Jesus Christ, and Christ has prom- 
ised that if even a few of us are 
agreed and call upon the Father 
in His name, what we ask for shall 
be granted. There is power in the 
name of Jesus the Christ. 

I am glad to say before I sit 
down, that a splendid volume called 
"Jesus the Christ" has been issued 
from the press. Brother James E. 
Talmage of the Quorum of the 
Twelve was requested by the Pres- 
idency to write a real history of 
Christ. It begins away back in the 
beginning when He, as He has told 
us, was with the Father and was the 
first-born. It recounts His works 
from that time down, showing that 
the Jehovah of the Old Testament, 
was the Jesus of Nazareth of the 
New Testament. All this is set 
forth in excellent style, with quota- 
tions from ancient and modern reve- 
lations which make it a very valu- 
able work for the Latter-day Saints 
in all their societies and organiza- 
tions and in their private homes. I 
allude to this subject again so that 
you may not go astray. Some peo- 
ple get peculiar notions about who 
Jesus was. Understand, once for 
all, that the Father and the Son and 
the Holy Ghost are three separate 
and distinct individuals. We prav 
to God the Father in the name of 
Jesus Christ the Son, under the in- 
fluence and power and guidance of 
the Holy Ghost : and if we will walk 



in the ways that the Lord has point- 
ed out, we will not go astray. 

Any man who is imbued with the 
spirit of this Gospel will understand 
that God has established an order in 
His Church, for its guidance and 
government, as we heard this morn- 
ing, and when men start up here 
and there and over yonder and pre- 
tend to be some great . one to set 
things in order, they should under- 
stand and we should understand 
that in the very beginning of the 
Church, right in the very beginning, 
the Lord revealed that if He had 
anything to reveal to His Church 
He would give it through the man 
that stands at the head, and that 
has been the rule ever since. The 
man who stands at the head holds 
the keys and power of revelation for 
the Church ; but for individuals the 
blessing is free to all ; the spirit 
shall be poured out upon all. I 
know that God inspires the soul of 
man. I know that God qualifies 
His servants, weak though they may 
be, for the works that they are re- 
quired to perform ; and I thank 
Him and praise Him this afternoon 
for His mercies to me in all my la- 
bors and travels and toils through 
my past life, and I praise Him for 
the privilege of being here with my 
brethren and sisters this afternoon. 

I invoke His blessings upon all. 
May the Holy Ghost, the Com- 
forter, be our constant guide and 
companion, that we may be able to 
subdue all that there is in us that 
is wrong and contrary to the divine 
will, and be led and guided and 
subject to the Father of our spirits, 
through Jesus Christ, the Son, and 
the influence and power of the Holy 
Ghost. May God bless you and help 
us all to be faithful and true and 
save us in His glorious kingdom, 
for Christ's sake. Amen.

ELDER JOHN W. HART. 

(President of Rigby Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I deem 
this a great privilege, and an honor 
to me personally, to be called by the 
President to occupy this position 
this afternoon. I can assure you 
that if I say anything that will be 
for our benefit the Lord will be re- 
sponsible for it, and not me person- 
ally. It is very unexpected on my 
part to be honored with this call; 
and I might state farther that I have 
been suffering with a severe cold 
the past week, and I fear that I will 
not be able to. satisfactorily occupy 
the time ; but I pray that the Lord 
will be with us, that I may enjoy 
His help while I say a few words 
to you. - 

It was surely a great inspiration 
to me this morning to sit in the con- 
gregation and look in the faces of 
those on the stand, whom the Lord 
has chosen in this dispensation to 
have charge of His work in the 
earth ; and to be called to occupy 
this position this afternoon, and face 
this vast audience, to me it is an 
added inspiration. It is a wonder- 
ful testimony to the Latter-day 
Saints to note the many representa- 
tive people that have come from dif- 
ferent parts of the earth, and do 
come to attend these general confer- 
ences, the business meetings of this 
great Church. The loyalty and de- 
votion of those who have been se- 
lected to occupy positions in the 
Church is wonderful to me. 

I could not help but reflect upon 
some things that were stated this 
morning by the President, and prob- 



ably one statement of his that ap- 
pealed to me and caused me to re- 
flect more than any other was when 
he stated that the time had come 
when the adversaries' efforts toward 
this people were growing weaker all 
the time. I can bear testimony to 
this statement my brethren and sis- 
ters. I come from the state of 
Idaho, where I have lived for over 
twenty years ; I have seen the day 
there when a Latter-day Saint was 
not permitted to enjoy nor to exer- 
cise the privileges of citizenship, on 
account of his religion. I have 
seen, exhibited there, on the part 
of the enemies of this people, the 
greatest bitterness and antagonism 
I believe that existed anywhere 
since the Later-day Saints came to 
these valleys. I am. glad, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to state in your 
hearing today that the bitterness, 
antagonism and unfriendly feeling 
have practically disappeared from 
our state, and our neighbors and 
friends with us are glad that it has 
gone, that it has left us. I want to 
say farther that our neighbors 
honor us for our sincerity of pur- 
pose, and our devotion to our re- 
ligion, for our energetic efforts in 
furthering the principles of the 
Gospel in the parts of the state 
where we reside. W e now have a 
high classed lot of people in Idaho 
who are not members of our 
Church, and they are willing and 
glad to meet with us, to enter into 
counsel with us to consider things, 
ways and means that are for the- 
uplifting of the citizenship, for the 
inauguration and establishment of 
laws that would be for the better- 
ment of all mankind. We are grate- 
ful and thankful that this condition 
prevails now. 

The section of the country which 
the Latter-day Saints occupy, in 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that state, I believe is growing and 
progressing more rapidly than any 
other section where they live in 
these Western States. We are 
glad of this, and I believe that the 
people there are beginning to ap- 
preciate more fully the blessings of 
the Lord toward them, and the way 
that they are being prospered in 
their efforts, than they have done 
heretofore. We are grateful and 
thankful for this condition. 

I want to say, my brethren and 
sisters, that I am proud to hold a 
membership in this Church. I have 
a testimony of the truthfulness of 
the Gospel. I know that the Lord 
is with us and that if we will con- 
tinue to put forth our efforts for the 
establishment of truth in the earth, 
if we will go forward and battle 
against evil in the future as we have 
in the past, the time will come when 
truth and righteousness will con- 
quer evil, and we will enjoy more 
fully the Spirit of the Lord, and 
peace and happiness will be in our 
midst more extensively. 

I pray the blessings of the Lord 
upon this Church, upon those who 
have charge of its affairs, those who 
have been placed in authority, I 
hope and pray that they will have 
the Spirit of the Lord continually, 
that we may receive from them 
counsel and advice that will be for 
our good, and take it home to those 
over whom we preside, that they 
also may be benefitted by hearing 
the word of God, even if it does 
come second handed. I pray that 
the Lord will be with all who are 
occupying responsible positions, 
with the elders that go abroad, that 
they may continue to uphold the 
dignity of this Church, and that they 
may defend its principles loyally, 
and in a manner that will be accept- 
able in the sight of the Lord, in the 



future as they have in the past ; that 
His blessings will precede them, 
and that they will be rewarded with 
the testimony of His work. May 
His testimony abide with us, may 
we have faith continually, and may 
we seek unto the Lord for guidance 
at all times, that we may receive the 
blessings that are in store for faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 

(President of Fremont Stake.) 

I, too, am very grateful, my breth- 
ren and sisters, for this opportunity 
of bringing to you the greeting and 
good feeling of the people of the 
Fremont Stake of Zion. I desire to 
say unto you that they are very 
much interested in the work of God 
in the earth. They are a good peo- 
ple, and the Lord has abundantly 
blessed them in the land to which 
they have gone under the direction 
of the prophets of God. 

T have been very much interested 
in the remarks, teachings, counsel 
and advice we have received in this 
conference from President Smith, 
and the other brethren who have ad- 
dressed us. Surely we can say in 
our hearts we are blessed of God. 
He has given unto Israel mighty 
men, clothed with the power of the 
holy priesthood for the blessing and 
salvation of the souls of men. We 
have listened to President Hart, 
who has lived in Idaho, as he has 
said, for twenty years. Because of 
his life and conduct, his straight- 
forwardness in dealing with the 
people of Idaho, they have respected 
and honored him in their legislative 
assemblies ; and everywhere that he 
has gone he has brought honor to 
our people. We are blessed by the 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON.

labors of Brother Hart and those 
who are associated with him, and 
we are very grateful for this. The 
Lord softens the hearts of good men 
and women of the world, who have 
misunderstood us, when they come 
to know us; if they love righteous- 
ness. 

I pray that the Lord may bless 
us and help us to understand the 
great mission that has been given 
to us in the world, to teach men the 
truth, and when they know it they 
shall be made free. When men 
speak unkindly of those whom the 
Lord has called to positions in the 
Church, surely they are not our 
friends, or they would let us rest 
in peace, in the enjoyment of our 
right to happiness. But when some 
cry out falsely things that disturb 
our peace, surely those can not be 
regarded as our friends, and we feel 
justified in warning the Latter-day 
Saints against them. If a man loves 
you he will not try to disturb your 
happy condition. They who are un- 
happy, and desire to have you like- 
wise, are inspired by Satan, like the 
adversaries of this work, who ac- 
complished the jnartyrdom of the 
Prophet and his brother, and other 
faithful elders of this Church. Their 
power ends with the destruction of 
life, they are not able to go further. 
The old prophet said, "Fear God 
who may destroy both the body and 
the soul in hell." We have no need 
to fear men who have power to 
harm the body only. 

I thank God that He has called 
such splendid men to lead us, whose 
lives are an example of righteous- 
ness. God's work is going onward 
and upward ; and one stands at the 
head today who is fearless as a lion 
in defense of truth and righteous- 
ness. He has the admiration of good 
men and women in all the world, 



when they understand his motives. 
His counselors, the chosen twelve, 
and all the general authorities of the 
Church are also righteous men. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to be loyal, in accord with the 
song that has just been sung. We 
should be thankful for the prophets 
and the poets; may the Lord bless 
them, and help us all to understand 
and properly perform our mission 
in the world, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Eight young girls, under direction 
of Sister Lizzie T. Edward, sang 
"The Lost Chord." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I am deeply gratified for this op- 
portunity of standing before you for 
a few moments this afternoon, 
bringing a word of good cheer from 
the Elders and scattered Saints who 
are living in the Eastern States mis- 
sion, on the northeastern borders of 
this great republic, and also in the 
four eastern provinces of Canada. 
I trust that what I shall say, my 
brethren and sisters, will be actuated 
and inspired by the Holy Spirit. In 
and of myself I feel wholly incap- 
able of edifying you. I often think 
of the example which Joseph, who 
was sold by his brethren into 
Egypt, furnishes. When he was 
brought from the dungeon, after he 
had prepared himself to go into the 
august presence of King Pharaoh, 
on which occasion he was required to 
give an interpretation of Pharaoh's 
dream, which had troubled him, he 
stated, "It is not in me, yet God will 
give Pharaoh an answer of peace." 
I have found through my experience 
in the mission field, and at home, 
that the Lord will not leave those 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who are engaged in His service, so 
long as they will put their trust in' 
Him. 

Today the thought has been pass- 
ing through my mind, what would 
a mature person answer who should 
land upon the eastern shores of the 
United States, when asked, "Have 
you investigated Mormonism?" He 
may say, "I have never heard of 
such doctrine." Perhaps he would 
set out in search for the truth or 
falsity of what the world would 
call "Mormonism." He may go to 
one of the theatres in New York 
City, and he will find "Mormonism" 
made the coarse and vulgar jest of 
the wicked. He might go to the 
churches of New York City, and 
other eastern centers, and find the 
maledictions of the preachers poured 
out almost in liquid eloquence 
against this people. He will go 
upon the street corners and he will 
hear "Mormonism" spoken of as a 
hiss and a by-word. Eventually he 
may encounter two young men 
standing fearlessly before the pass- 
ing crowd declaring that God has 
spoken from the heavens unto His 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and has re- 
vealed His mind and will to the 
children of men in this age as in 
former years. H,e might b(e im- 
pressed with the sincerity of these 
young and faithful ministers, and 
conclude to read some of their liter- 
ature, and finally decide that he will 
come to where these people live, 
that he might learn for himself 
what "Mormonism" really is. He 
enters the valleys of these moun- 
tains, he sees the beautiful shade 
trees, and the orchards over- 
burdened with fruit, the fields and 
the farms well cultivated and luxuri- 
ant with golden grain. Every way 
he turns there is beauty and thrift. 
When he associates with the people, 



he finds cleanliness and devotion in 
their lives, he is compelled to change 
his erroneous opinion of "Mormon- 
ism" to what it really is. He would 
say, "If this is the fruits of the sys- 
tem that has been mocked and made 
the subject of coarse theatre jests, 
and paraded ludicrously upon the 
vaudeville stage of this country, and 
has been made a theme of reproach 
in many a pulpit, then I say, 'God 
speed Mormonism.' " "By their 
fruits shall ye know them," and not 
by what their enemies say of them. 

I am sometimes constrained to 
wish that some of you western peo- 
ple could partake of the "luxuries" 
that we are having in the East. Con- 
ditions are not all pacific, I will say, 
in the East. There are all manner 
of representatives of various anti- 
Mormon organizations trying to de- 
ceive the people in regard to what 
we believe, and with words of elo- 
quence they are blinding the eyes of 
many good and honest-hearted peo- 
ple. Comparatively speaking, we 
are just a mere handful, and though 
T speak of the Eastern States Mis- 
sion, especially, the same may be 
said of all the missions in the United 
States, and those in Europe also. 
Missionaries clothed in the robes of 
the holy priesthood, going out meet- 
ing and contending with the educa- 
tion and the training of men of the 
world, missionaries who have not 
been met squarely, who have not 
been treated fairly, they are declar- 
ing that God lives, and is revealing 
His mind and will to the children 
of men. Some of the reports of our 
opponents' efforts that come to our 
notice occasionally are not without 
comedy. I have v/ith me a tfew 
newspaper clippings, which come 
from a Press Clipping Bureau, and 
I want to bring some of these "lux- 
uries" home to you. I will read

only three of them. Here is one 
from the Philadelphia Pennsylvania 
Inquirer under date of April 29th, 
1915, quite recent : 

PERIL SEEN IN MORMONISM. 

Speaker Warns Mothers That Daugh- 
ters Are in Danger. 

"Mothers, it is time your eyes are 
opened to the dangers that threaten 
your daughters, that attend the high 
schools and colleges in this country," 
declared Mrs. May Leonard Wood- 
furd, recording secretary of the Wo- 
men's Home Mission Society, at the 
quarterly meeting of the Philadelphia 
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, which was held yesterday at 
the Arch Street M. E. Church, Broad 
and Arch Streets. 

'Mrs. Woodfurd spoke of the num- 
ber of people in this country, amount- 
ing, she said, to 68,000,000, that pro- 
fess Christian religions. She spoke of 
the growth of 'Mormonism' in the 
Eastern States." 

[Now she is dealing with something 
that we know a little bit about.] 

'"The Mormon Church has 2200 
missionaries in and around Pittsburgh 
alone.' " [Laughter.] 

I felt compelled to compliment 
Elder Watson, who is presiding 
over that conference. I turned to 
him, and to the four elders who 
were laboring in that great city, and 
said, "President Watson, you and 
your companions are a considerable 
crowd." 

"She said, ' they are attending 
schools and colleges, and frequently 
induced good girls to adopt the mon- 
strosity they call religion.' 

"The Membership Committee, con- 
sisting of Mrs. Seymour Eaton and 
Mrs. Leonard Woodfurd, announce an 
increase of fifteen hundred members 
[of the Mormon Church in that dis- 
trict] during the last quarter of this 
year." 

We are glad to know we are mak- 
ing this progress, and I am not sure 
but what there is some truth in the 



report from their point of view ; 
not from our records, however. 
These people, who are thus antag- 
onizing the Church of Jesus Christ, 
of Latter-day Saints, hold that all 
that is necessary for a person to do 
in order to join their church is to 
go to their prayer meeting and say, 
"I believe." I am very grateful for 
Mrs. Woodruff's opinion that 
there are fifteen hundred people who 
have gone to the ministers and said, 
"I believe in Mormonism ;" but they 
haven't had the courage to be bap- 
tized yet. The harvest is coming. 

At our conference six months 
ago a report was read of the ex- 
penditures of tithing paid during 

1914, which amounted to nearly 
two million dollars. Here is a clip- 
ping taken from the Lutheran's 
publication under date August 15th, 

1915. even more recent than the last 
clipping : 

"The advantages of centralized au- 
thority, and of a well-developed finan- 
cial system, are well illustrated in the 
achievements of Mormonism. The 
hierarchy has just issued a report 
which accounts for nearly tzvo billion 
dollars received in tithes the past 
year." [Laughter.] 

If the Church population is fve 
hundred thousand, that makes four 
thousand dollars each individual 
paid in tithing. (Laughter.) I call 
upon all to give some substantial 
reason why an organization whose 
members are capable of earning 
forty thousand dollars each per year 
and of paving four thousand dollars 
each in tithes, should be opposed. 
Nor do the reports seem to be in 
consonance with each other. Of 
course everything- must be true 
when it is against the "Mormons." 
It is really surprising to see how 
some people will swallow bait, sink^

GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



er and all. Here is a clipping from 
the Meadville Pennsylvania Mes- 
senger, September 15th, 1915, so 
recent that the ink almost smears 
under my fingers : 

"interesting lecture on mormonism. 
"By Mrs. Deifenderfor in First Pres- 
byterian Churches. 

"Some startling facts concerning 
Mormonism were really brought to 
light by the lecture of Mrs. Deifender- 
for at the Presbyterian Church. The 
following are a few extracts. 

"Mormonism is the most highly or- 
ganized institution in the world today. 
So perfect is the machinery that a 
command can be flashed from the head 
to its most remote member in just 
forty minutes." [Laughter.] 

"It numbers millions of adherents." 
[Did you get that?! [Laughter.] "It 
numbers millions of adherents, and has 
at least three colonies in every state 
of our Union. It has .established 
churches in New York City," [I wish 
that were true,] "in Chicago, and many 
other cities, and has two hundred mis- 
sionaries in Pittsburgh." 

Someone has made a mistake of 
at least two thousand missionaries. 
One says two thousand two hun- 
dred and another says two hundred. 
We are being "exposed" before the 
world, and a great many honest- 
hearted people are writing to our 
headquarters asking for literature, . 
and we are only too pleased to sup- 
ply the same, sending it by special 
messengers who have been set apart 
for that work; and we believe the 
work is growing. The sentiment is 
changing, notwithstanding the great 
effort that is being put forth by the 
adversary of men's souls to thwart 
the purposes of the Lord in send- 
ing this Gospel message to the ends 
of the earth. I feel we are camping 
on higher ground every night. We 
are trying to carry to the hearts of 
the children of men the doctrine of 
love for mankind, that man should 



love men as brothers, and that all 
should love and respect and obey 
God, our Father in heaven, as a 
father. 

Now may the peace of our heav- 
enly Father abide in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints forever, I ask 
it in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mis- 
sion.) 

The Book of Mormon declares 
that when we are engaged in the 
service of our fellow men we are 
only engaged in the service of our 
God. The service that wives and 
mothers in Israel, and the fathers, 
and the missionaries are rendering 
is as sacred in the sight of God as 
the service that angels are rendering 
around the throne of the Almighty. 
In the 17th chapter of the Gospel of 
St. Luke, it is said that Jesus healed 
ten lepers : of the ten that were 
healed only one came back to glorify 
God. The sin of ingratitude is a 
most abhorent one. I wonder if the 
account of this healing was intended 
for the admonition of Israel. I 
wonder if we who have been favored 
of God in our crops, and have been 
blessed in our basket and in our 
store, sometimes forget to glorify 
God by paying our tithing and by 
worshiping the Almighty with all 
our mind, and might, and heart and 
soul. 

I believe, brethren and sisters, we 
ought not to look too far into the 
distant future, I .believe there are 
blessings around and about us. Re- 
cently, when a photographer in At- 
lanta was taking the picture of our 
recently erected Church edifice, he 
invited me to look on the plate and 
I was endeavoring to look through 



ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 



47 



the plate and could discern nothing ; 
but he said to me : "Mr. Callis, look 
on the plate ; don't try to look 
through it;" and then I beheld a 
beautiful picture. On every hand, 
are testimonies of the truth of this 
Gospel. There are mighty proph- 
ecies being fulfilled now at our very 
doors that we can rejoice in and 
have our faith strengthened thereby. 

When the President of the 
Church stood up this morning and 
announced the blessed news that a 
temple was to be erected on one of 
the far distant islands of the sea, 
T said in my heart that that glorious 
prediction, that the spirit and power 
of Elijah would be manifested in 
this dispensation among this people 
is being gloriously and splendidly 
fulfilled. 

For these splendid tilings that are 
happening in our midst, for the 
great men who preside over us, for 
this great Gospel, for Tsrael — for 
Israel is a splendid people — I thank 
God, and bear testimony that this is 
the work of God and that we are 
the people of God ; in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, ''The 
Judgment ;" the solos were rendered 
by Esther D. Stephens and Horace 
S. Ensign. 

Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until Mon- 
day. October 4th, at 10 a. m. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder George F. 
Richards presided. Forest Dale and 
Richards Ward choirs, under direc- 



tion of T. Albert Hooper, furnished 
the music. 

The anthem, "Awake and Arise," 
was sung by the choir. 

Prayer was offered by Elder John 
R. Barnes. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Ye 
simple souls who stray." 

ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 

(President of St. George Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters. Al- 
though your faces are new and 
strange to me, yet I know that your 
hearts beat with mine, in the same 
desire and the same aspirations. 
Therefore, in responding to this 
call this afternoon, I do so with 
the assurance in my heart that 
you have come up here to wor- 
ship the Ford, and to receive en- 
couragement and strength to help 
you to keep the vows, covenants and 
obligations which you have made 
unto the Lord as His covenant peo- 
ple. It is these covenants and vows 
which we have made that make us 
a peculiar people, the people of God, 
and which characterize us different- 
ly from all other peoples of the 
earth. Because of the reverence and 
faith we have in those who preside 
over us we are thought not to be as 
independent in our lives as other 
people, but we have learned the 
principle of the freedom of obedi- 
ence. We have tried and tested 
the advice of the leaders of this 
Church and people, for so many 
years that we have perfect confi- 
dence in what they advise and teach 
us as being the mind and the will 
of the Lord. And, in carrying out 
their teachings in our lives, the 
Spirit of the Lord has uniformly 
borne testimony to us we are truly 
shown the way of life, truth and 
righteousness. •

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In listening to the words of Pres- 
ident Smith this morning, I thought 
of the principle that sometimes is 
inculcated in political platforms, to 
the effect that a frequent recurrence 
to fundamental principles is essen- 
tial for the perpetuity of the liberties 
of mankind, that it is necessary for ■ 
us to go back to the simple life ; it 
is necessary for us to remember the 
foundation stones and principles 
upon which our body politic is 
founded and upon which it rests ; 
and upon which our rights, both 
social and personal are founded. We 
must not forget them, but that we 
must live them in our political life 
if we would preserve our political 
liberty. Likewise, President Smith 
has called us back to the funda- 
mental principles of our home life, 
of our individual duties as- members 
of the Church. He has warned us 
against any departure from them, 
and has pointed out the benefits 
that would follow the performance 
of our duties, humbly and fully, as 
Latter-day Saints. 

In every age, where God has had 
a people upon the earth, the cry has 
gone forth to repent of wayward- 
ness and indifference, and turn to 
God. The prophets of old exhorted 
Israel : "Turn, O back-sliding Israel, 
return to your God and to the ways 
and to the teachings of the proph- 
ets." The Savior of the world cried 
out to Israel : "How often would 
I have gathered you as a hen gath- 
ereth her chickens under her wings, 
but ve would not." The call of 
President Smith to the Saints to 
practice the minor as well as the 
weightier matters of the law is to 
us the word of the Lord. It means 
that we must, in our homes and in 
our wards and in our stakes, if we 
have departed from those simple. 



fundamental principles, go back to 
them, if we would maintain the 
truth and righteousness so charac- 
teristic of the people of God. All 
that we have accomplished as a peo- 
ple in this western commonwealth, 
and as a Church, has been accom- 
plished because of obedience to 
these fundamental principles of the 
Gospel. 

We must remember the Lord ; we 
must be grateful to Him. night and 
morning, for the blessings that we 
receive. We must not forget to 
thank Him for bounties with which 
He has blessed us ; we must not 
forget to remember the Sabbath 
day to keep it holy, to go to the 
house of the Lord noon the Sabbath 
dav and partake of the sae'rament. 
and worship with the Saints of God. 
We must not forget to pay our 
tithes and our offerings in the day 
and the season thereof. We must 
not forget to show by our acts and 
bv our lives that we are in fellow- 
ship with our brethren and sisters, 
and that we unhold and sustain 
those who preside over us. These, 
mv brethren and .sisters, are some 
of the fundamental principles, some 
of the fundamental duties, of Lat- 
ter-dav Saints, and it is the doing 
of these duties, and the observance 
of the law of the Lord, which makes 
us strong and vigorous as a people, 
not onlv phvsicallv but intellectuallv 
and snirituallv, and gives us power 
and influence in the earth for good 
amone the honest and virtuous of 
the earth. 

There is an oft-repeateed passage 
in the New Testament, of Paul's, 
that he was not ashamed of the Gos- 
pel, for it was the power of God 
unto salvation. The Gosoel. if we 
live it. is the power of God unto 
Salvation. Salvation, as the 



ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG.

Prophet Joseph Smith interpreted 
it, means the placing of trs beyond 
the power of all our enemies. Now 
these enemies are not personal ene- 
mies. They are not enemies of the 
flesh in the form of men that we are 
afraid of ; but they are our own 
weaknesses, the weaknesses with 
which, perhaps, we were born, the 
weaknesses that perhaps we have 
acquired through bad habits which 
we have formed. The observance 
of the laws of the Gospel gives us 
power over all such enemies, in 
short, saves us from them. For in- 
stance, if we obey the Word of Wis- 
dom bv persisting vear after year in 
the abstinence of the use of tea. 
coffee, tobacco, and intoxicating 
Honors, does not this persistence in 
this habit, and this determination 
on our part to keen this rule of life 
become so rooted in our natures and 
in our lives, and in our very exist- 
ence, that we are saved from their 
degenerating- influence? Thus the 
Gosnel. so far as this one principle 
is concerned, has become to us the 
"m' , " r of God unto salvation. We 
are saved from that enemv : we have 
overcome it. The strength of being 
rlpnn ir yes effectuallv that the 
Hocnol. indppd. is the power of God 
unto salvation. 

Likewise in the payment of our 
tithes and offerings. Tf we have 
paid our tithing honestlv and scru- 
pulously in the time and the season 
thereof for vears and years, it has 
become to us the power of God unto 
salvation, because the temptations 
of the flesh, the sordidness with 
which we are possessed, and the 
love of monev. are rooted out of our 
svstems. It is no longer a tempta- 
tion to ns to retain that for our use 
which nVhtfullv belongs to the 
Lord, Wc never think of withhold- 



ing it. So we might go on from one 
principle to another, and we should 
find that if we persist in obeying 
principles of righteousness such per- 
sistence becomes unto us the power 
of God unto salvation, not only here 
but hereafter, for our salvation 
hereafter, we know, depends upon 
our life here. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
with you in this gospel. I am thank- 
ful beyond words to express that I 
was born in the Church, of good 
parents. I am thankful for the in- 
fluences that the Gospel has had 
upon my life. There is nothing that 
T would exchange my faith in this 
Gospel for. There is no wealth, no 
influence, nor possession for which 
I would exchange the simple faith 
that I have in God, and the knowl- 
edge that I have, that this is the 
kingdom of God, the Church of 
God, and that it is being led by the 
influence and power of God. 

May the Lord bless us, and sanc- 
tify all, that we may receive during 
this conference to our good, that our 
determination shall be to do the will 
of God and keep His command- 
ments, that we may enjoy salvation, 
here and hereafter ; which I pray in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG. 

(President of Sevier Stake.) 

My brethren, sisters and friends, 
President Snow was speaking about 
our hearts beating, but I do not be- 
lieve that your hearts are beating 
quite as fast as mine is in occupy- 
ing this position. 

It was stated when I was intro- 
duced that I was from Sevier. I 
remember the cjuestion being asked, 
•ire the people severe ? Not at all. 
I feel that we have a splendid good

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people in the Sevier stake of Zion, 
a people that. are at peace with one 
another as well as with their Gen- 
tile friends, and God is blessing 
them always. 

While I was looking over the con- 
gregation this afternoon, I thought 
how differently I viewed this grand 
congregation than a certain gentle- 
man did, a Rev. Collins, of Aus- 
tralia. I labored in that far-off 
land, among goodly people for up- 
wards of three years, and I enjoyed 
very much the hospitality and big- 
heartedness of that people. (By the 
way, I see faces in this congregation 
of some that I was instrumental in 
the hands of the Lord of taking into 
the waters of baptism. I feel grate- 
ful to my Heavenly Father that I 
was obedient to that call, to go as 
ctlle 1 by the Prophet of the Lord 
and perform missionary labors in 
that distant land.) This reverend 
gentleman I have alluded to paid 
Ltah a visit to study the "Mormon" 
religion, and also to learn some- 
thin? of the character of the "Mor- 
mon" people. When he returned 
he advertised to his own congrega- 
tion, giving them to distinctly un- 
derstand that he did not want it to 
come to the missionaries' ears, that 
he was going to deliver a lecture 
and expose "Mormonism," and tell 
the people something true about the 
real character of the "Mormon" 
neople. Rut some of his good peo- 
le ouietly informed us when the 
meeting would be, and we were in 
attendance, and sat immediately in 
front of the stand. When he be- 
held us it seemed to trouble him 
very much, and it was easily to be 
seen that he was not at ease. How- 
ever, he told how he got on the boat 
at Svdney, and spoke of some of the 
customs of the Americans as he 
found them on the boat, which by 



the way was an American boat. In 
telling about when he landed in San 
Francisco he seemed to be a little 
worked up in his feelings, and as 
he told about how he came across 
what he called the barren waste of 
the desert parts of Nevada, he 
seemed to be a little more worked 
up in his feelings. But when he 
alluded to his arrival in Ogden, he 
stopped and hesitated, and evidently 
hardlv knew what to say. How- 
ever, he proceeded, and. told about 
Brigham Young's home and his 
"forty wives," and other absurdities 
so on and so forth, which seemed 
to be very pleasant to some of the 
congregation. He said, "every- 
thing seemed to work in my favor. 
There was a 'Mormon' conference, 
and I attended the meeting in the- 
Tabernacle. They had a choir 
leader who was a perfect genius of 
music from the crown of his head 
to the soles of his feet, and they had 
a splendid large choir. But O 
Lord!" he said, "of all the care- 
worn, poor, miserable looking 
mothers you ever saw, there were 
many in that congregation. And 
what was worse," he said, "was 
when some of those 'prophets,' as 
thev claim to be, arose to their feet 
and spoke, and of all the dry dis- 
courses that I ever listened to in my 
life I heard the worst there. But, 
fortunately, the congregation, prac- 
tically all, feel asleep, and I prayed 
to the Lord that I could fall asleep 
also " 

I sat in front of the "rever- 
end." and when he got through I 
asked him for the privilege of read- 
ing a statement from a cosmopolitan 
gentleman, who had circumnavi- 
gathed our globe three times, and 
who. during his travels, had visited 
Ut^b In Australia, I said, this 
gentleman that T desire to quote to

you, is esteemed to be one of your 
greatest men, a man whose integrity 
is unimoeachable, a man who is 
known throughout this land for his 
honestv and uprightness. I want 
you to permit me, before you dis- 
miss iU; s meeting, to read to this 
people his views along the same line 
that vou have been speaking here 
thic ^~ning. Mr. Collins replied, 
"This is my meeting, and T want 
vou to distinctly understand that I 
don't want any 'Mormon' to open 
his month here and speak to my 
people." And, after a few words 
more, he dismissed his meeting. 

I want to state that was an exani- 
r>1« of a prejudiced mind, a man 
who had vainlv tried to stop the 
work, and had done all in his power 
to destroy the effect of the diligent 
labors of the elders in that far-off 
land But we find a different ex- 
ample in that gentleman who came 
here with an unprejudiced mind, 
„ T ;+Ti -> view to ascertain the truth, 
and learn for himself whether these 
"'ere true or not. That gen- 
tleman made a statement, in words 
to this effect : that the people should 
ceasp striving against the "Mor- 
mon" elders, for "I beheld in the 
Staff of Utah the most noble wom- 
en Tvl mothers that T have seen in 
ah n-T travels. T advise that you 
cease fighting their boys, because 
the whole ministerial world can 
never thwart the progress of sons 
born of such noble mothers." How- 
ever, thp reverend gentleman did 
not let me HI the congregation that. 
Later we had the privilege of deliv- 
ering- our tracts to the greater part 
of his congregation, and we were 
instrumental in the hands of the 
Lord in baptizing some of his fore- 
most people, which vexed him very 
much. 



Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
feel grateful when fair-minded per- 
sons come in our midst and praise 
the people. They find the fruits of 
the Gospel to be good ; they find 
young men who are clean, and high- 
minded. They find that our young 
women are pure, modest and re- 
fined. They have been taught by 
their fathers and mothers the prin- 
ciples of life and salvation. They 
are young men and women who, 
with their fathers and mothers, sin- 
cerely thank God every clay of their 
lives for His blessings. 

When we sing this beautiful 
hymn, "We thank thee, O God. for 
a Prophet," our hearts are made 
glad, and we rejoice we live in the 
day and age when prophets are with 
us. We heard inspired words from 
the lips of the prophet this morning, 
and T believe they met responsive 
welcome in every heart, and that 
our determination is now more than 
ever before to go forth and dili- 
gentlv perform the sacred work that 
is assigned to us. 

A great thinker and writer has 
said, "It is not possible for God to 
be everywhere, therefore He gave 
us mothers." T wonder if we ap- 
preciate our good mothers, our 
fathers also, those who have taught 
us all the davs of our life to be 
pure, to be upright, to be honest and 
to let our light so shine that the 
world mav see it and glorifv our 
Father in heaven. T was just think- 
ing that my mother in far-off Scot- 
land, (pardon me to refer to it), 
was one of the first in the neighbor- 
hood where she resided to join the 
Church. She had lost her father 
and mother, and was staving with a 
family as a servant girl. When 
she told this family about "Mor- 
monism," they became very angry. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



She was then only 14 years old, and 
they stated to her that if she did 
not cease visiting the meetings they 
would dismiss her from their ser- 
vice. She asked them not to be so 
harsh, and said, "I know it is true, 
I have a testimony it is true." They 
tried to convince her that it was 
just a hallucination of the mind, 
but they could not, and finally she 
was baptized, and they drove her 
from their home. All the money 
she had in her pocket at that time 
was 24 cents — one shilling — and she 
gave that, the night she was driven 
from home, to secure a hall, which 
was known as Townhead Hall, for 
the elders to preach in that night. 
Those elders blessed her and told 
her that she would never want ; and 
that blessing, I want to testify, has 
been literally fulfilled. She re- 
mained firm, steadfast, and immov- 
able to the cause of Truth. One of 
the members of that family, a young 
man, became converted, and finally 
the entire family were converted, 
and came to Utah, and their testi- 
mony was to the effect that it was 
all due to the integrity and faith of 
that little girl. My mother was 
also instrumental in getting my 
father to attend meetings, and final- 
ly he became converted. When my 
father and mother came to Salt 
Lake City with the other emigrants, 
there was a dinner already prepared 
for them by this very family that 
had driven her from their home be- 
cause of her belief in "Mormon- 
ism." T thank the Lord for her 
immovable faith. I wonder if we 
are all appreciative of the trials and 
sacrifices that our fathers and moth- 
ers have made to bring us to this 
goodlv land, this great land of 
America. Are we appreciative of 
the fact that we are recipients of 
the true Gospel, that we understand 



the plan of life and salvation, and 
that we have so many blessings 
showered down upon us day by 
day? I wonder if we are counting 
these many blessings, thanking the 
Lord for them, and regarding the 
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ as 
the biggest thing in all the world. 
That we may do this, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON. 

(President of South Sanpete Stake.) 

I am very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for the privelege of at- 
tending this splendid conference. 
The sessions that we have already 
attended, and the remarks that have 
been made by those that have ad- 
dressed us, have been full of inspi- 
ration and good things for the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The vast gathering 
in this building, and in the adjoining 
building, which is much larger than 
this, is a great testimony of • the 
grand work that we are engaged in. 
It seems to me that in each confer- 
ence the throngs become greater 
who gather here to hear the words 
of the Lord through His servants, 
the prophets. 

I am very thankful for the testi- 
mony of Jesus, for the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ that has been revealed 
througdi His servants the prophets. 
T want to say that I am thankful 
for the priesthood. I am thankful 
for the faith that I have in the cause 
of Zion, and in her people, in the 
servants of the Lord. I am thank- 
ful to God that He has given to me 
the faith that I have in my heart to 
uohold and sustain them in all the 
various conditions in which we have 
been placed, and they have been 
placed. It is a wonderful work that 
we are engaged in, preaching the 
Gospel in the nations of the earth.

and at home, and in performing the 
duties and labors devolving upon us 
as Latter-day Saints. 

I desire this afternoon also to ex- 
press my feelings in relation to what 
was said by the First Presidency, 
Presidents Smith and Lund, and the 
words of counsel that were given 
unto us by them concerning what 
was termed "small things;" but I 
want to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that those things that were 
referred to are great things. Those 
things referred to by President Ed- 
ward H. Snow this afternoon also 
are great, and are necessary for the 
building up of the work of God. 

We as Latter-day Saints, I be- 
lieve, are thoroughly conversant, 
and in harmony, and in tune, with 
the principles of the Gospel, at least 
with what we sometimes call the 
first principles of the Gospel, faith, 
repentance, and baptism, and the 
laying on of hands for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost. All these things, I 
believe, we are in harmony with, 
our hearts are in tune with them, 
believing that they are necessary 
unto our salvation and to our ex- 
altation. In these things I believe 
we have come to the unity of the 
faith, as being essential in every 
particular. I believe that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints throughout are be- 
lievers in those principles, because 
they manifest them in their lives, 
and their children manifest them in 
their lives. As a rule, we find that 
the children of Latter-day Saints are 
anxious to become members of the 
Church of Christ when they attain 
eight years of age. The parents 
likewise are anxious that they shall 
receive the ordinance of baptism, 
being initiated into the Church of 
Christ. In these things it may be 
said we have come to the unity of 
the faith. 



There are other matters, how- 
ever, pertaining unto our every day 
life, in which we sometimes do not 
see eye to eye. They were men- 
tioned this morning by our beloved 
President, and I was very much 
pleased in the illustration that he 
made in relation to home life, and 
to the teaching. There has been a 
great deal said of late in relation 
to the necessity of the teachers 
among the Latter-day Saints, the 
ward teachers, performing their 
duties in visiting the homes of the 
people, and making what is known 
as the one hundred per cent. I 
take it, my brethren and sisters, that 
those that are called to this great 
ministry of being ward teachers to 
the Latter-day Saints, should place 
themselves in a position that they 
will be able to teach, that good re- 
sults may come from the teachings 
and visits of our brethren in the 
homes of the Saints. I believe that 
is essential in order to be success- 
ful. We who are doing this work 
should bring ourselves into har- 
mony with the Lord and His pur- 
poses, so that, when visiting we can 
ask these questions in the way and 
manner that was stated by President 
Smith this morning; and that we 
can truthfully answer them our- 
selves in our homes, that we are 
living the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
that we are at peace in our homes, 
in our families, in our every day 
walk and conversation, and with 
our neighbors. 

I believe that this Gospel includes 
all that is good; it is a splendid 
thing for the Latter-day Saints to 
practice upon every clay of their 
lives. The payment of tithing also 
has been referred to by President 
Smith. To those who keep this 
law, it becomes second nature to 
them, as well as in obeying the 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other commandments of the Lord. 
I believe that if we observe these 
things they become a source of joy 
and satisfaction to us. Also the pay- 
ment of our fast offerings, and ob- 
serving that day day of fasting 
and prayer, a day of contributing 
of that which the Lord has given us, 
in the spirit and meaning thereof, 
for the benefit and comfort of the 
Lord's poor that we have among us. 
It was said by President Smith, this 
morning, that there would be ample 
in the hands of the bishops, that 
there would be no suffering among 
the poor people, and there would be 
no necessity of drawing from the 
tithing funds of the Church for their 
support, if all members of the 
Church would remember to observe 
this duty. I am thoroughly per- 
suaded in my experience that that 
is true. 

I am thankful for what was said 
to us in relation to the building of 
temples. My life, for twenty-seven 
years and upwards, has been, in a 
way, devoted to that work, and I 
want to tell you that this work is 
growing among the Latter-day 
Saints. In the city where I live, 
Manti, during the nine months just 
past there has been an increase of 
more than ten thousand ordinances 
performed in that temple above the 
record of a year ago, or of any other 
except the opening year of that 
temple. The Spirit of the Lord is 
upon the people, encouraging them 
to work for the redemption of the 
dead as well as the living, and be 
diligent in preaching the Gospel 
in the nations of the earth. The 
preaching of the Gospel to the dead, 
and doing ordinance work for those 
that have probably accepted it be- 
yond the veil, is progressing ; and 
the Spirit of the Lord is working 
upon men among the nations of the 



earth, that their hearts are turned to 
their fathers, and the hearts of the 
fathers are turned to their children. 
This is evident everywhere. 

We noted at the Congress that 
was held in California not long 
since, some of the effects of the 
spirit that is poured out upon the 
various nations of the earth. Dele- 
gates were there from various coun- 
tries, many from our own land of 
the United States, expressing their 
great interest in this important 
work, the gathering of genealogies 
of the people, of their forefathers 
and mothers and other ancestors. 
This is a work that has been long 
engaged in by the Latter-day Saints, 
and they enjoy the blessings thereof. 
In the nations of the earth men, 
that know not why these things are, 
are inspired to gather together 
records by which the Latter-day 
Saints are greatly assisted to prose- 
cute the great work of redemption 
for their kindred dead. 

I pray my Heavenly Father to 
bless the Saints. May His Spirit 
shine within them, that we may be 
able to accomplish the labors that 
are enjoined upon us, in a way and 
manner that shall be pleasing to our 
Heavenly Father, and that shall 
give blessing, consolation, and sal- 
vation to ourselves, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ADOLPH MERZ. 

(President of North Sanpete Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I rejoice with you in having the 
opportunity to attend this excellent 
conference. For many years these 
General Conferences have been a 
feast of blessings to me, and I have 
never gone home from one of these 
gatherings disappointed. I have 
felt in my heart, every time I at- 



ELDER ADOLPH MERZ. 



55 



tended them, that I had received 
strength in my soul and new testi- 
mony of the divinity of the work of 
God. I thank God for this testi- 
mony, and I desire to bear it to you 
this afternoon, if I may be led by 
the Spirit of God to do so, for I 
know in my heart that Joseph Smith 
was indeed a prophet of the living 
God. 

I rejoice in the remarkable growth 
of this people. For many years I 
have watched their gatherings, and 
it seems to me that the numbers who 
attend conferences are constantly 
increasing. When I heard President 
Robert D. Young speak this morn- 
ing of the Rev. Mr. Collins, I felt 
sorry that the gentleman could not 
have attended one of these great 
General Conferences of the Saints, 
and I wondered what he would have 
thought of it, or what effect it would 
have had upon his mind. The im- 
pression that I have always received 
at these conferences has been, that 
the people who attended them were 
filled with the Spirit of God and 
were hungering and thirsting for 
His word, and that they were eager 
to hear the voice of the true shep- 
herd. 

I rejoiced this morning to hear 
the voice of our beloved President 
and Prophet, the mouthpiece of God 
to this people, and I feel to sustain 
him with all my heart. When he 
arose to speak this morning and said 
that probably his condition was not 
such that he would be able to occupy 
much time owing to severe cold, I 
prayed in my heart that God might 
strengthen him, and I felt like one 
of the Elders of Israel of old, to 
uphold and sustain his arms, that 
God might give him strength to 
speak to the Latter-day Saints. And 
how remarkably impressive the 



word of God came to us ; I am sure 
that we all rejoiced in hearing the 
words of our beloved leader. 

There is no danger, my brethren 
and sisters, as far as I can see, that 
can come from the outside to injure 
this Church, as long as the people 
are united, and as long as we are 
performing our duties and labors 
in our humble callings in life. There 
is no danger of the adversary hav- 
ing power over, and prevailing 
against this people so long as we 
serve God and keep His command- 
ments. The only danger that I can 
see to this Church, and that not 
collectively, but to the individual, 
is the danger which comes to the 
man and the woman who do not 
keep the commandments of God, 
those who neglect their prayers, 
who desecrate the Sabbath day, or 
who refuse to pay their tithes and 
their offerings, and who are not in 
harmony with their bishops and the 
authorities of the Church. There 
I can see clanger, for as sure as we 
live, if we do not keep the com- 
mandments of God, little by little 
our faith will become weaker, and 
eventually we will lose interest in 
the work of God. 

For some time we have endeav- 
ored in our stake to bring a larger 
number of people to our Sacrament 
meetings, and to accomplish this we 
called into service some thirty mis- 
sionaries and singers and musicians, 
who for the last two or three months 
have visited alternately every ward 
in the stake, preaching the Gospel 
and calling the people to repentance. 
So far we have seen some fairly 
good results. But it seems to me, 
my brethren and sisters, that the 
distinction is becoming more and 
more apparent between the men and 
the women who serve the Lord and

keep His commandments and the 
ones who do not. I can see the need 
of labor, the need of visiting the 
homes of the Saints, and of praying 
with them, and bearing testimony to 
them of the truth of the Gospel. 1 
know the words of President Smith, 
which he uttered in his opening ad- 
dress this morning, are true. I am 
convinced that great good will re- 
sult from the faithful and devoted 
labor of the ward teachers, and of 
the officers of the Church, by pray- 
erfully admonishing the people and 
teaching them the word of God. We 
sometimes go to our meetings to 
hear certain men speak, and we hear 
the question asked, "Who is going 
to speak today?" "Why, Brother 
so and so." "Well, I have heard 
him before, I do not care about 
going to meeting today." On the 
other hand we hear it said, "Elder 
so and so is going to speak, let us 
go and hear him, he is a good 
speaker." And so we go to our 
meetings. And I have wondered 
sometimes how many people, how 
many of us, go to our sacrament 
meetings irrespective of who shall 
sing or pray or speak, but because 
we love the Lord with all our hearts, 
and because we feel to go to the 
house of worship to offer up our 
oblations to the Lord our God by 
partaking, in humility, of the em- 
blems of the atonement, in remem- 
brance of the sufferings and the 
mercy of our Savior, judging our 
hearts, our conduct, and our worthi- 
ness, to partake of the emblems of 
the broken flesh and spilt blood of 
our Redeemer. ' My brethren and 
sisters, I am sure that if we love 
the Lord we will obey all His com- 
mandments, and if we do not keep 
His commandments, it is because we 
lack faith and devotion to the work 
which He has intrusted to us. 



I rejoice in the work of the Lord. 
1 rejoice greatly in the labor, which 
I am permitted to perform. There 
is nothing compared with the priv- 
ilege that we enjoy to labor in the 
vineyard, whether at home or 
abroad. Money-making, my breth- 
ren and sisters, does not compare 
with it. It does not bring the peace 
and the satisfaction which com,es 
to the soul of the man and the 
woman who faithfully and devoted- 
ly do their duty in the Church. I 
have this testimony in my soul. I 
have rejoiced greatly in my travels 
abroad among the people of the 
world, preaching repentance to 
them, and warning them of the 
judgments and the calamities, which 
would overtake the wicked, because 
of their unbelief and their rebellion 
against the warning voice of God. 
But I have experienced as great a 
joy and satisfaction in laboring at 
home, in the ward and in the stake 
in which I live. I have found inex- 
pressible joy in teaching the boys 
and girls among our people, and I 
have oft returned to my home from 
Sunday School, or from the Mutual 
Improvement meeting, or from the 
homes of the Saints which I had 
visited, filled with gratitude to God 
for the privilege given unto me to 
labor in the vineyard, and of aiding 
someone, especially the youth of 
Zion, to obtain an understanding of 
the glorious principles of life and 
salvation. 

Brethren and sisters, let us all put 
our shoulders to the wheel, and 
labor faithfully and devotedly for 
the progress and advancement of 
the work of God, that we may stand 
blameless before Him in the day of 
judgment, which is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Individual responsibility an essential 
characteristic in welfare of the 
Church — -Aggregate of "little things" 
immensely valuable — Prayer one of 
the most important of "little things" 
— All Church duties, though humble, 
are important. 

My dear brethren and sisters, T 
cheerfully and unreservedly bear my 
testimony to the truth of the re- 
marks of our brethren who have ad- 
dressed us this afternoon and the 
spirit which has prompted those re- 
marks. I commend the same to you 
all, including myself. Tt will be 
profitable for us to ponder these 
things, and to put them, as far as 
possible, into the practice of our 
lives. 

The remarks made in this meet- 
ing and in the meeting this morn- 
ins:, in the large tabernacle, remind- 
ed me of some of the savings of the 
Apostle Paul, which I desire to read 
to von briefly from the first chapter 
of First Corinthians : 

"For ye see your calling, brethren, 
how that not many wise men after 
the flesh, not many mighty, not 
many noble, are called: but God 
hath chosen the foolish things of 
the world to confound the wise; 
a"d God hath chosen the weak things 
of t 1l e world to confound the things 
"•hich are mieditv: and has° things of 
t-lip world, and things which are de- 
spised, hath God chosen, vea. and the 
thines which are not, to bring to 
nought things that are, that no flesh 
shall glory in his presence." 

And then in the next chapter the 
Apostle Paul says : 

"But as it i c written. F.ve hath not 
seen, nor ear heard, neither have en- 
tered into the heart of man. the thing? 
wMrh God hat'-> prenared for them 
that love Him. But God hath revealed 
them unto us by His Spirit, for the 
Spirit searchcth all things, yea the 



deep things of God. For what man 
knoweth the things of a man save the 
spirit of man which is in him? even so 
the things of God knoweth no man, 
but the Spirit of God. Now we have 
received, not the spirit of the world, 
but the Spirit which is of God, that 
we might know the things that are 
freely given to us of God. Which 
things also we speak, not in the words 
which man's wisdom teacheth, but 
which the Holv Ghost teacheth, com- 
paring spiritual things with spiritual. 
B' t the natural man receiveth not the 
things of the Spirit of God, for they 
are foolishness unto him: neither can 
he know them, because they are spirit- 
edly discerned." 

The little things, my brethren and 
sisters, which go to make up our 
religious life are the things which 
count in the end, both for the indi- 
vidual members and also for the 
Church as a whole, just as the de- 
tails in any business go toward mak- 
ing- the success of that business en- 
terorise. 

Dunne the conference we have 
had detailed some of the things that 
indicate the growth of this great 
work in which we are engaged ; ad- 
ditional stakes and wards, an in- 
crease of population, of tithings 
paid. etc. 

If we would have Zion strong and 
so recognized in the world, with 
nowers for good, we as members of 
the Church of Tesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-dav Saints ousdit each to take 
his share of responsibility in makinsr 
it so. Tf the members are all strong-. 
Zion will indeed be strong- and 
potent for good. Neither does our 
strength as individuals in a relief- 
ions capacity nor as an organization 
of the Church consist in a spirit of 
independence, of being proud and 
boastful, or blasphemous, or of ex- 
ercising- our agencv so as to show 
our independence in doing- thinp-s 
which no honorable, good man or 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



woman would stoop to do. Our 
strength is in God, our Eternal 
Father, through living the laws of 
the Gospel which He has revealed, 
and they are made up of little 
things ; and as the Apostle Paul 
said, "These are as foolishness in 
the eyes of the world," of men who 
see not the things of God because 
they enjoy not the Spirit of God. 
But not so with us who have entered 
in at the door of the sheepfold in 
the way that has been appointed, 
who have had sealed upon our heads 
the Holy Ghost, with the rights 
and privileges of having Him ever 
with us to guide us in life, 
strengthen us against evil, giving 
us power to overcome self, to see 
and understand the truth, to love 
and obey it, and to finally obtain 
salvation. 

"Except ye be converted and be- 
come as a little child ye shall not 
enter into the kingdom of heaven." 
Jesus did not say, except ye become 
a king upon the throne, or a judge 
upon the bench. No — ye must be 
humble even as a little child, so 
humble that ye can worship God 
your Father and acknowledge Him 
and give Him reverence, so humble 
that ye can acknowledge Jesus 
Christ the Savior and Redeemer of 
the world, and serve and follow 
Him. There is no salvation except 
through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
and except through acknowledging 
Him as such, and by yielding obe- 
dience unto the laws and ordinances 
of His Gospel, simple though they 
may be. 

Brethren and sisters, the little 
things of life, such as the saying of 
our prayers, are important. Are we 
trving to go through life without the 
help of our Heavenly Father, ex- 
pecting to obtain a salvation ? If we 



expect His help, and we must have 
it if we succeed in this great enter- 
prise, we must obtain it through 
the means which He has ordained, 
and that is through the inspiration 
of the Spirit of God, the Holy 
Ghost, we must obtain it by seeking 
after it. The promise is only to 
those who seek. "To those who ask 
it shall be given," and our asking 
must be in faith, nothing wavering, 
for he that wavers is like the waves 
of the sea, driven of the winds and 
tossed. 

Who of us are grown, and were 
taught when we were children at 
our mother's knee to pray in secret 
before laying our heads down to rest 
at night, and again in the morning 
after we had risen to offer to Him 
our prayers, have outgrown these 
things ? Is it possible, brethren and 
sisters, that we need less of the pro- 
tecting care of the Lord ? less of His 
guiding hand and inspiration now 
when we are grown, and have a 
multitude of responsibilities, than 
when we were little children? Or 
is it because we think the Lord will 
hear the prayers of children, and 
will not hear us? Or is it because 
we have so far departed from the 
way of the Lord that we feel em- 
barrassed and ashamed when we un- 
dertake to approach Him in prayer ? 
Or what is the reason that we have 
forsaken our secret prayers? And 
have we adopted the order in the 
Church of praying in our families? 
If not, why not, brethren and sis- 
ters? If we have not adopted this 
custom in our religious life we are 
not in full harmony with the Church 
and the Latter-day Saints. We 
could call attention to other little 
things that have been spoken of. 
The attending to our fasts, for in- 
stance. Was the fast day instituted

for a few, and they of a certain 
class ! No, it was instituted for 
every man and woman, from the 
highest to the least in the Church, 
and I cannot justify myself in neg- 
lecting to fast on fast day. I cannot 
justify myself in withholding my 
offerings from the poor which 
should be given upon the fast day. 
And so with our tithing. If I am 
justified in not paying my tithing, 
why should you be required, my 
brethren and sisters, to pay tithing? 
Is not this a common cause in which 
we are engaged, the building up of 
the kingdom, and are not the tithes' 
of the people used for that purpose ? 
On the other hand, if you who do 
not pay your tithing are justified 
before the Lord, why should not I 
be justified without paying tithing, 
or every other member of the 
Church? And so with every relig- 
ious duty that devolves upon us. 
I admonish you to an exercise of 
care, my brethren and sisters, to all 
these little details which go to make 
up the consistent, faithful, devoted 
Latter-day Saint, and promise you 
that if you will do so you will have 
peace of mind such as cannot be 
purchased with gold and silver or 
with houses and lands or flocks and 
herds, yea, that which will surpass 
by far everything earthly. You will 
have joy in life, and a hope and an 
assurance that you will obtain eter- 
nal life with all its attendant bless- 
ings. 

We must know that our course of 
life is approved of God or we never 
can exercise that faith in Him which 
is necessary to take hold upon the 
blessings of eternal life. And let us 
remember, too, that we are depend- 
ent creatures, that we need the 
Lord's help to do these simple little 
things, to live the true and consist- 



ent life that is required of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

Now the Lord bless you all, my 
brethren and sisters, and sanctify to 
our mutual good, our happiness and 
our slavation, the remarks, the 
spirit, the prayers, the singing of 
this session of our conference, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Praise ye the Father." 

Closing prayer by Elder John G. 
McQuarrie. 



SECOND MEETING 
OUT-DOORS. 

Another meeting was held in 
front of the Bureau of Information 
building, at 2 p. m. Elder David O. 
McKay presided, and the 33rd ward 
choir, directed by Joseph Poll, again 
furnished the music. 

(By actual count, there were 11,- 
954 persons in the Tabernacle, at 2 
p. m. ; also, about 3,000 in the As- 
sembly Hall. Standing as well as 
sitting room was completely occu- 
pied in both of these edifices. About 
2,000 were present at the outdoor 
meeting, and a great many others 
were unable to find accommodation 
for hearing at either of the meet- 
ings.) 

The opening hymn, "Praise to the 
man who communed with Jehovah," 
was sung by the choir and congre- 
gation. 

Elder Win. H. Richards offered 
the invocation. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Guide us, oh Thou great 
Jehovah."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER WM. C. PARTRIDGE. 

(President of Big Horn Stake.) 

I feel to rejoice, my brethren and 
sisters, in the privilege of attending 
this conference, and the privilege of 
listening to the authorities of the 
Church. You know, I live a long 
way off, and feel that it is a great 
treat when we can come here to 
headquarters, and listen to the 
words of inspiration of the servants 
of the Lord. 

T rejoiced this morning in listen- 
ing to President Smith's opening re- 
marks. I could not help but think 
while he was speaking, especially 
about the lack on our part of paying 
sufficient fast offerings, and other 
things that we should feel in duty 
bound to do. I thought to myself, 
we are certainly somewhat careless 
and indifferent in regard to those 
matters. We come to these confer- 
ences, and listen to the servants of 
the Lord, and they touch our hearts : 
they come out in our midst, to the 
different stakes of Zion, and speak 
words of good cheer to us. and we 
feel encouraged, we feel that thev 
teach the very things that we most 
need, when they urge us to live our 
relieion ; yet in a few days we seem- 
inedv foreet, in a measure, the good 
things that we have heard. We 
reallv do not forget, but a spirit of 
indifference apparently takes hold 
of us. 

When the authorities undertake 
to bring about a reformation in cer- 
tain lines, we realize that these 
things are good for us. vet we are 
slow to carry them out. Take for 
instance, the one dav a month that 
we are asked to observe as "home 
evening-," get our children toeether 
around us in our homes, and teach 
them the principles of the Gospel. T 
have discovered, in traveling around 



among the people in our stake, that 
they all think this is a splendid 
thing, but many are so careless that 
they let the day that is set apart go 
by without observing it. I believe it 
is the same in other places, so far as 
I have been able to learn. Most of 
us are slow to do those things that 
we know are for our good. I be- 
lieve it is one of the greatest things 
that has been given to us recently, 
the carrying out of this idea of 
bringing the members of our fam- 
ilies together and teaching the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel to them, in the 
home. Most of us leave the teach- 
ing of our children to the Mutuals, 
the Sunday Schools, and the Pri- 
maries. I venture to , say that a 
large proportion of the people be- 
longing to the Church are not carry- 
ing out this counsel, and are not yet 
bringing their families together on 
the home evening, and teaching 
them the principles of the Gospel. 

When the Big Horn stake was 
first organized, Apostle Woodruff 
told us to hold devotional exercises 
every night and morning in our 
families, and most of us did that for 
a long time. But we began to get 
careless in that matter, and I can 
say today that there is not as much 
of the spirit of unity, of love, good 
feeling and contentment that there 
was a few years back when we were 
carrying out this practice more 
fully. I believe that one of our 
greatest failings is that we are not 
more diligent in teaching our fam- 
ilies the principles of the Gospel. 
Perhaps we do not realize what the 
result is. T can see it. I can see 
that some of our young people grow 
up without a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel, except what they gain in the 
organizations. There are some fam- 
ilies that attend to these things 
strictly, but T am afraid the ma- 



ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER. 



61 



jority of us do not yet carry them 
out. We acknowledge it is the 
proper thing to do, but we are care- 
less, and fail to put them into prac- 
tice to the full extent. 

The law of fast offering we ac- 
knowledge is one of the finest laws 
in the Church, to donate of our sub- 
stance for the support of the poor. 
There are very few in the Church 
that do not believe in this law ; but 
I find, in our stake, that not one- 
half of the people pay their fast 
offerings fully. According to the 
bulletins that come out to us every 
year, we are not below the average 
of the Church. I do not want you 
to think that I am running our stake 
down. We are above the average 
in a number of good things ; but 
with the aggregate membership of 
the Church, we are behind in these 
things, as President Smith said to- 
day : we are not paying all we 
should in fast offerings, and the 
Church has to furnish means from 
the tithing for the support of the 
poor. 

Brothers and sisters, I want to 
bear my testimony to you that we 
cannot keep the spirit of the Gospel 
in our hearts, we cannot have the 
proper love and respect for the au- 
thorities, unless we try to carry out 
their counsel in these little things. 
We cannot do it. We cannot be 
spiritually alive if we neglect our 
meetings, and neglect to partake of 
the sacrament. In fact, unless we 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord, we are in danger of getting 
luke-warm, and drifting away from 
the Church. I feel to plead with 
you, my brothers and sisters, to look 
to it, that your children are taught 
the principles of the Gospel, that 
they are not allowed to be entrapped 
by the snares of the adversary. Our 
children are precious gifts from 



God, and we should use every means 
in our power to bring them up 
aright, and not wait until we see 
them falling away into by and for- 
bidden paths, but commence as soon 
as they can talk to teach them the 
principles of the Gospel. 

Let us commence with ourselves, 
let us commence right now and re- 
solve within our hearts that we will 
live nearer to the Lord than we have 
done, that we will keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, and that 
we will be exemplary as Latter-day 
Saints, that we will help with all our 
might to teach the people of the 
world that we have the truth, for we 
have it, and we know it. May the 
Lord help us to do this, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER. 

(President of Curlew Stake.) 

While sitting here, this thought 
came to my mind this afternoon : 
"Why am I a 'Mormon?' Was it 
because my parents were Latter-day 
Saints, that I was born under the 
New and Everlasting Covenant? or 
have I a stronger reason why I am a 
'Mormon' than this ?" It is true the 
environments that we are under 
have a great deal to do with forming 
our life, morally, socially, as well as 
spiritually. I thank the Lord that I 
have been born under the New and 
Everlasting Covenant, with goodly 
parents; and that I have been led 
and guided by the hands of kind 
men who hold the Priesthood, who 
have guarded my footsteps until I 
became old enough to think and 
study for myself. This answer comes 
to me : "I have many reasons why 
I am a 'Mormon.' " 

In the first place, take history, 
start from the creation, from the 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



time that Father Adam was placed 
upon the earth, and we find that he 
was led and guided by the Lord. 
Angels visited him, conversed with 
him, taught him the way. We also 
find the same mode of procedure in 
the lives of the holy prophets, Abra- 
ham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and all 
the other ancient prophets. We find 
one of the prophets making this 
declaration, "Surely the Lord God 
will do nothing except He reveals 
His secrets unto His servants the 
prophets." Here, then, is a strong 
declaration. When the Lord has a 
people upon the earth, they must be 
led, according to Malachi, by the 
word of the Lord, through the voice 
of a prophet. This, then, gives us a 
key to the position to start from. 
The people of the Lord must be 
dictated to and led by Him, through 
a prophet of the Lord. 

We find the Savior came in the 
meridian of time. He did the great- 
est work ever done among the chil- 
dren of men. What did he teach 
the people? He taught them faith, 
repentance, and baptism. He made 
it very emphatic : Unless a man be 
baptized, he cannot enter the king- 
dom of heaven, and before He left 
the people, we- find Him thoroughly 
organizing the Church upon the 
earth. How was the Church organ- 
ized ? It was organized with proph- 
ets and apostles, etc., "for the work 
of the ministry, for the edifying of 
the body of Christ, until we all come 
to a unity of the faith." 

Now, these were the teachings of 
the Great Master, and they are ap- 
plicable to us. This same organiza- 
tion must exist with us, if we are 
truly people of God. This thought 
appeals to me — I must look for the 
church which has these character- 
istics. It is true the "Mormons" are 
not considered Christians, by some 



of our good friends; but, as Isaiah 
says, we can judge according to the 
law and the testimony, and we ap- 
peal to these to prove that we are 
Christians in very deed. Today we 
are preaching Christ and Him cru- 
cified. No people hold higher the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ than 
do the Latter-day Saints. No peo- 
ple have proclaimed higher ideals 
than do the prophets, we acknowl- 
edge them as being true servants of 
the Lord, and we follow them. 

We learn from history, that the 
Gospel was taken from the earth. 
In this last dispensation, we find a 
boy making the declaration to the 
people that he has been called of the 
Lord, that angels had appeared unto 
him, instructed him, counseled him, 
and told him what to do. Here then 
we find verified the words of the 
Prophet Malachi, "The Lord reveals 
Himself to His servants the proph- 
ets, etc." Now I have considered 
this question seriously : "Was this 
boy called to be a prophet of the 
Lord, or did he call himself?" I 
answer, We find that the boy Joseph 
Smith, during a great excitement of 
the religious world, declared that 
he had talked with the Father and 
the Son, and that later angels came 
and administered unto him. He 
made the bold declaration to the 
world that these were actual facts. 
Did he stop there? No, he followed 
the voice of those Divine Beings 
who had called him. They were his 
teachers, he followed them, and did 
as they dictated. Finally, God made 
him a prophet, the head of the last 
dispensation, and authorized him to 
be a mouthpiece unto the people. 
What are the fruits of his work? 
We find him advancing from step to 
step, and the Church was organized. 
We find him preaching the same 
doctrines as Christ and His apos- 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 



63 



ties taught — faith, repentance, bap- 
tism, the gift of the Holy Ghost — 
and telling the people that obedience 
to these doctrines was necessary to 
salvation. And was this all? No, 
he organized the Church as per- 
fectly as it was in the meridian of 
time, with prophets, apostles, and all 
the other essential officers, as we 
find Paul tells the Corinthians. They 
are necessary to the development of 
the Church, and thus we find it fully 
organized and equipped. 

We follow him from the early 
rise of the Church, and the history 
of the people that followed him, 
until his martyrdom; then follow 
the Church from the time they left 
Nauvoo until they arrived in these 
valleys of the mountains. In all 
these conditions we find the same 
perfect doctrines and organization 
prevailing that existed in the prim- 
itive Church. We are led today by 
the voice of God through His 
mouthpiece, and, as we are told by 
the Lord Himself, that "whether I 
speak by mine own voice or the 
voice of my servants, it is all the 
same." These thoughts appeal to 
me. They are reasons why I am a 
"Mormon." They convince me. 

I have a living testimony that I 
wish to leave with you this after- 
noon : not the testimony that my 
mother planted within my soul, but 
I have one for myself. I know that 
the Lord lives, I know the Gospel 
is true, and I know that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God ; and I 
bear it to you this afternoon, and 
feel, as Paul of old felt, that "T am 
not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, because I know it is the 
power of God unto salvation." 

May the Lord bless you, bless us 
all, and help us to do His will, and 
may those of us who have not a tes- 



timony seek and find it, is my hum- 
ble prayer and desire, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Israel, 
Israel, God is calling." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(President of Temple Block Mission.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that I may be able to speak under 
the influence of the Spirit of the 
Lord, and that I may have an inter- 
est in your faith and prayers. My 
voice is somewhat husky as I have 
participated in several gatherings of 
late. I have been interested in all 
that has been said this afternoon, 
and also in the open air meeting this 
morning, with regard to the great 
latter day work. 

I endorse the remarks of my 
brethren who have testified that the 
Lord has commenced a great work 
in this dispensation. You have heard 
them comment upon the revelations 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
They have referred to the organiza- 
tion of the Church, to the coming 
of prophets, the appearance of 
angels upon the earth and their mes- 
sages to the Prophet Joseph. 

This story, wonderful as it is, 
would have little effect upon the 
minds of the people if it were not 
for the evidences of truth following 
these great events. We declare unto 
all men, and to all people, that God 
has not only established His Church, 
and given unto us prophets and 
apostles, pastors and teachers, but 
He has placed His seal upon this 
work by permitting fruits to follow 
the ministry of His servants. 

I refer particularly to some of the 
revelations mentioned in your hear- 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing this day, viz : — that angels have 
come to the earth, that the Prophet 
Moroni, whose statue is upon our 
Temple here, appeared unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith as a resur- 
rected being, and revealed unto him 
the records from which the Book of 
Mormon has been translated. 

At a previous meeting, the state- 
ment was made that Moses, the 
prophet, appeared in Kirtland and 
gave unto the Prophet Joseph the 
keys of the gathering of Israel, that 
Elijah the Prophet had also ap- 
peared and conferred the keys for 
the redemption of the dead, that the 
Gospel with all its authority was 
now upon the earth, and that we are 
ministering by virtue of the Aaronic 
and Melchizedek Priesthood, the 
power of God given to men. We 
are often asked for proofs indicat- 
ing that these statements are true. 

Allow me therefore to draw at- 
tention to the following facts. In 
this congregation there are mem- 
bers of the Church who heard the 
Gospel in Europe, or upon the 
islands of the sea, or in various 
parts of this continent. We appeal 
to you and ask, why are you here 
in these valleys of the mountains ? 
What incentive brought you here? 
You will answer by saying that you 
have believed, with all your hearts, 
the declaration of Isaiah, that "in 
the last clays, the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in 
the tops of the mountains and shall 
be exalted above the hills, and all 
nations shall flow unto it." You 
are here in fulfilment of that proph- 
ecy. God has implanted in your 
hearts a desire to be with His peo- 
ple ; and therefore you have gath- 
ered from the nations of the earth, 
the islands of the sea, and from 
various parts of this country. Man 
alone could not have brought to- 



gether such a wonderful assemblage 
of people as we see now upon 
Temple Block. We have sung, 
"Israel, Israel, God is calling." 

I testify that we have heard that 
call and by our presence give evi- 
dence that the keys of the gather- 
ing were indeed conferred upon 
Joseph Smith by Moses the prophet. 
We have felt the inspiration of the 
Almighty and the impress has been 
made upon our souls that this is 
God's work. 

In response to a revelation given 
to the Prophet Joseph, our elder-s 
are preaching the Gospel in many 
lands, and the promise was renewed 
"these signs shall follow them that 
believe, in My name they shall do 
many wonderful works ; in My 
name they shall cast out devils, in 
My name they shall heal the sick ; 
etc." These words have been verily 
fulfilled in the ministry, and we 
bear testimony that God has thus 
sanctioned and confirmed the labors 
of these humble elders of Israel. 

We also solemnly declare that 
Elijah the prophet has come to 
"turn the heart of the fathers to the 
children and the heart of the chil- 
dren to the fathers." This is a 
simple declaration but it is true. 
We testify that Elijah the Prophet 
appeared to Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery in Kirtland Temple. 
You may read the wonderful story 
in Section 110 of the Doctrine & 
Covenants. Friends ask, can this 
be true? Has Elijah the Prophet 
really ministered to men in our clay ? 
This great Temple, a monument in 
stone, bears testimony to the faith 
of the Saints, that the spirit of 
Elijah's mission is here, for in that 
Holy House, day after day, year 
after year, thousands of our mem- 
bers are entering the Temple and 
ministering therein for the salva- 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD. 



tion of their dead. If you have op- 
portunity, converse with these 
faithful workers, ask them how they 
feel when they enter that sacred 
building, and they will testify to you 
that the spirit of their mission is 
upon them. ' They rejoice in its 
saving power. They go to be bap- 
tized for their ancestry in full faith 
that when the departed ones, in the 
spirit world, receive the Gospel mes- 
sage that the work thus done will 
be efficacious. Thus do we demon- 
strate our faith in the mission of 
Elijah the Prophet. 

We believe that every angelic 
messenger has come with a mes- 
sage, and each message to the be- 
liever has been followed by signs 
following. 

The priesthood has been restored 
to the earth. John the Baptist 
came, laid his hands upon the heads 
of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
de'ry and conferred upon them the 
Aaronic Priesthood, as recorded in 
the 13th Section of the Doctrine & 
Covenants. I commend this book 
of revelations unto you and suggest 
that it be read often, that the truth 
may be in your minds and in your 
hearts, that you may all know that 
the great forerunner of the Lord 
Jesus Christ in the meridian of time 
has again appeared and through 
Him has come unto us the authority 
of the Priesthood which he held 
upon earth and by virtue of that 
Priesthood our deacons, priests, and 
teachers are ministering in the work 
of God. 

We also declare that Peter, James 
and John came and conferred the 
authority of the Melchizedek 
Priesthood upon the head of the 
prophet. I exhort you all to read 
the story. This Church is of God. 
Our boys are ministering in the 
Aaronic Priesthood, our elders are 



abroad ministering in the authority 
of the Melchizedek Priesthood, and 
the power of God follows them in 
their work. We have all seen the 
fruits of their faithful labors. 

I trust that we shall receive an 
incentive today to be more diligent 
in this work, to meet with and teach 
it to our families, to inspire our as- 
sociates as we bear this testimony, 
for the Master will require an ac- 
count from us of our labors to ad- 
vance His great work among the 
children of men. 

May the Lord help us in every 
good work, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD. 

(President of Alberta Stake.) 

I come from the extreme north, 
the Alberta stake of Zion — of Al- 
berta, Canada. I am reminded of a 
story. There was a Swedishman 
applying for work as a collector. He 
went to a gentleman that had a store 
with a lot of old accounts to be col- 
lected. So the employer said, "All 
right, Brother Johnson, we will be 
glad to employ you, here are three 
or four accounts I would like you 
to go and collect." "All right," 
Brother Johnson said. So he took 
the accounts and went out, and came 
back. Soon the employer said, 
"Well, what did they say?" "Well, 
Bill Key, he say him pay when he 
sell him hogs, John Thomas, he pay 
when he sell him wheat, Yohn John- 
son, he pay in Yanuary." Well, 
that is the first time that that man 
ever promised to pay his bill. Are 
you sure he said he would pay it in 
January?" "Ya, veil, he say he 
tank it be a cold day when he pay 
that bill, and I tank it be a cold day 
in Yanuary."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is a cold day when the people 
of our stake, the Alberta stake, one 
of the largest in the Church, do not 
attend their meetings. I heard what 
Brother Partridge said. I am rather 
glad I live in Alberta. We do at- 
tend our meetings there. We stand 
at the head of the list, having the 
largest percentage of people attend- 
ing sacrament meetings, and we are 
proud of it. 

We are told that our stake ex- 
tends from the Canadian boundary 
line on the south to the North Pole 
on the north. When I saw Presi- 
dent Lund yesterday he said, "And 
the north shall give up — " "Not its 
dead," <l said, "the sea will give 
up its dead, but the Israelites' army 
shall come from the North." Two 
weeks ago today, Apostle David O. 
McKay and others participated in 
the laying of the corner stone of the 
new Temple in Cardston, Brother 
McKay offering the dedicatory 
prayer. It rained and it hailed, and 
it stormed; but it did not discour- 
age us. We ,have a tabernacle, 
about the distance of this Taberna- 
cle from the Temple. Brother Mc- 
Kay expected everybody to run to 
the Tabernacle. But no. We stood 
it out, and we had a good time. 

We appreciate the blessings of 
the Lord ; and we appreciate the 
people that we live with there. The 
great Dominion of Canada sent one 
of their representatives to witness 
the ceremonies I speak of. We 
have the only member of the British 
Parliament who is one of our people 
who also attended, representing our 
constituency in the Provincial Gov- 
ernment in Alberta; and a great 
many other people were in attend- 
ance. We are visited often by many 
people who travel through the 
country. They are very interested 



in the Temple. This member of the 
British Parliament complimented us 
by saying that, when the Temple 
was finished, it would be the best 
church edifice in Western Canada. 

I have listened with interest to 
what the other brethren have said. 
I was pleased this morning on hear- 
ing that a temple was to be built in 
the Sandwich Islands. I have been 
there a number of times, and spent 
many years on the Samoan Islands. 
I love the Polynesian Islanders, 
who we believe are of the same 
family as our Indians, all of whom 
I love very much. We have them 
in our country. I thought I would 
tell you of a dream that an Indian 
had, in the far eastern boundaries 
of Canada. Brother Goddard spoke 
about the fruits of the Gospel, the 
signs that should follow the be- 
liever. The story is of today, not 
anything that my grandfather 
heard, or that I have read in books, 
but an incident which happened re- 
cently. 

A tribe of Indians came to our 
country, called the Kree Indians. 
They were headed by a man named 
"Yellow Face." He said that he was 
a member of a council of five who 
lived in the eastern part of Saskach- 
ewan, the Province to the east of 
Alberta. They spend their time in 
the winter hunting and fishing. 
They roam around the country for 
that purpose, and then go back 
again in the spring. This man and 
his one hundred twenty-eight fam- 
ilies came into our country, and 
camped in the woods by a river, 
right where the road led from two 
of our wards. We did not know 
anything of their business. They 
went about hunting and fishing. 
One day this man "Yellow Face" 
sent to a ward for the "high chief" 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD. 



67 



of that ward, as he called him — we 
call them bishops — and wanted him 
to come to his tent and have a visit 
with him. These people had visited 
us. We had asked them into our 
meetings. They had come to our 
entertainments, and we had become 
interested in them. They are a very 
intelligent people, the Kree nation 
— not like the Indians here. They 
dress as we do, and they are edu- 
cated. They have a written lan- 
guage of their own, not made by 
white men according to signs and 
sounds, but of hieroglyphics, com- 
posing a nice looking alphabet. This 
man sent for our bishop, and when 
our bishop came, he found a large 
tent, with the heads of these one 
hundred twenty-eight families 
there, and Yellow Face was sitting 
right in front, with one lady. So 
Yellow Face said to this bishop, 
"We want you to talk to us. We 
have been to your meetings. We 
have been to your parties. You 
have asked us to dine with you. 
Now we return the compliment. We 
want you to conie^ and visit us." 
Bishop Parker did not know what 
to say. He had never been on a 
mission, wasn't prepared to preach 
the Gospel. But he was struck with 
the sincerity he noticed in the peo- 
ple's faces as they sat in the circle. 
They were pleased to see him. So 
he told them about the restoration 
of the Gospel, and about our work 
of colonizing in that country. They 
did not seem much interested in 
that. After he got through, they 
said, is that all you know about 
your Gospel ? He thought and said, 
"Well, I believe I have told about 
all I know." "Well," Yellow Face 
said, "don't you have any book that 
you talk about?" "O yes," and 
Brother Parker then thought of the 



Book of Mormon. "Well, tell about 
that book." Brother Parker told all 
he could. It did not take very long, 
and when he got through, the Chief 
said, "That is all," and Brother 
Parker went home. 

About a week after, he sent for 
him again. Brother Parker did not 
know this time what would be ex- 
pected of him. But he went, and 
found the same crowd there. This 
time, Yellow Face said to Brother 
Parker, "When you were here be- 
fore, I sat there, and you stood here. 
This time I'll stand here, and you sit 
there, and so he related this story to 
Brother Parker: 

"Two years ago the high chief of 
our council had a vision." [Mind 
you this man never knew anything 
about our Gospel, never knew there 
was such a thing as visions or heav- 
enly manifestations.] "Our high 
chief, the great chief of the Kree 
nation, had a messenger come to 
him that he never knew, and he told 
this chief, You are going to die, 
but you won't die all over. The 
chief did not know what he meant, 
and he said, When you die, I do not 
want you to be buried until you get 
cold all over. So the chief said all 
'right ; and he said he went with 
this messenger, as he thought he 
died. All the other chiefs thought 
he was dead. But he had told his 
nearest associates to watch his body 
when he went cold, from the ex- 
tremities of his fingers, his toes, to 
follow how far his body was cold, 
and if they found a warm spot, not 
to bury him yet. So he was watched 
for five days, and only above his 
heart was a small place of his body 
yet warm. On the end of the fifth 
day, he came to, and he called all 
his council together, and told them 
he had been into a country where 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he saw his forefathers, walked with 
them, talked with them; and they 
told him that he would not yet die 
when he came to the earth, and 
that he was to go all over the coun- 
try until he found a people who had 
the book in which was the history 
of the very people he had been with 
in the spirit world; and he said, I 
will give unto you four signs by 
which you may know the people. 
First, they will not drive you out of 
their country. Second, you can 
turn your horses loose. They won't 
steal them. Third, they will go 
through your village, and they 
won't rob the virtue of your Indian 
women. Fourth, they will let you 
hunt and fish on their domain." So 
he said to Brother Parker, "with 
my family two years we have hunt- 
ed for such a people. You invited 
us into your meetings. We sat at 
the table with you in your picnic 
parties." [He had an interpreter 
tell all this.] " You have come 
through our village. You have not 
molested our women. We are fish- 
ing and hunting today on your 
Church lands. So I asked you. I 
watched you. We have watched 
your men, your young men, we have 
watched every action of all your 
people. When I heard you speak, 
it sounded like good news to me, 
and when you said that was all, I 
thought again I am disappointed. 
So I asked you if you had a book. 
You told me you had. That is our 
book. That is our history, not 
yours." 

So Brother Parker went and got 
the book, and brought it back to the 
Indians. The Indians took it, gave 
it to the interpreter, and had him 
sit down and read bv the hour. \w\ 
when he got through, the Indian 
took the book— did not think he had 



to buy it. He said, "It is our book, 
our history," and wrapped it up and 
took it away. 

They have visited us several 
times. They are a fine people. I 
pray that God will help us to re- 
member some of the words of this 
book. I will read just one verse: 
"Ye cannot say when ye are brought 
to that awful crisis, that I will re- 
pent, that I will return to my God. 
Nay, ye cannot say this, for that 
same spirit which doth possess your 
bodies at the time ye go out of this 
life shall possess your bodies in 
eternity." 

May God prepare us that when 
we lay down our bodies, when we 
go into the grave, that we may have 
the spirit with us of love and belief 
in eternity that these Indians have, 
because as .sure as the sun shines 
and we stand in the shadow of 
God's house, here on this Temple 
square, I testify we shall meet our 
friends on the other side. May we 
have the Spirit of the Gospel ever 
with us, I ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER WM. H. RICHARDS. 

(President of Malad Stake.) 

This is the first time in my life 
that I have had the privilege of talk- 
ing to an audience of this kind out- 
doors. It generally gives me heart- 
failure to stand before a congrega- 
tion to try to expound the principles 
of eternal truth to them. It is not 
that I am ashamed of the Gospel of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
because, I can say as Paul said, "I 
am not ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, because I know it is the 
power of God unto salvation;" so, 
as I have stated, it is not because I 
am ashamed of the testimony that I 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

have of the Gospel that makes me 
fear when I am called to bear it be- 
fore a congregation. 

I feel to thank the Lord today, my 
brothers and sisters, that my parents 
were converted to the principles of 
the Gospel in their native land, and 
that they saw fit, through the 
prompting of the Holy Spirit, to 
yield obedience to the Gospel, to 
leave their native land, and to 
gather where the Lord has appoint- 
ed for the gathering of Israel. I 
feel thankful today when I read of 
what is going on in their native 
land, thankful that they were con- 
verted to the Gospel and to the prin- 
ciple of the gathering, and that they 
came to this country where their 
children have been brought up and 
nurtured in the principles of eternal 
truth. 

I have never seen the time in my 
life, although I have been amongst 
a great many peoole who have not 
had much use for the Gospel, for 
the Latter-day Saints, or for any of 
their teachings, but I have never in 
my life seen the time when I felt 
that I needed to hang my head in 
shame because I was a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-dav Saints. T have alwavs held 
my head no. and felt to thank the 
Lord that that great privilege has 
come to me. 

While I have not had the nriv- 
ilege of going out into the world as 
a missionary, I have had some ex- 
perience in working in the Gospel 
at home : but it has alwavs been in 
a presiding canacitv, and being 
backward in nublic sneaking: T have 
alwavs called on others to do the 
talkinp-. Nevertheless, as T have 
told vou. T havp a te«timonv of 
the Gospel, and I have never 
seen the time when T was afraid 



to bear it to outsiders or any- 
one else. I know that the principles 
of the Gospel are true. When we 
take into consideration the princi- 
ples that are taught to us today by 
our Church leaders, we find that 
they compare favorably with the 
teachings of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ, as has been explained 
to us this afternoon. 

May the Lord bless us, my broth- 
ers and sisters, that we may realize 
the position that we hold, and that 
in every action of our life the world 
may see our good works and glorify 
our Father which is in heaven, are 
the blessings I ask, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. M'KAY. 

An antagonistic minister subdued — 
The key to eternal life — Knowledge 
gained by doing — The will of God 
defined — Service to God and fellow 
men. 

With one exception, during a visit 
to the Central States Mission, this is 
the first time that I have attended 
an open air meeting since we met on 
Citv Poad, in old Glasgow. And an 
incident that occurred one night, 
about the last night that I was in 
the mission field, has been called 
to mind. 

We were met, as we approached 
the olac€ of meeting, by a motherly 
woman, whom I had never seen be- 
fore, and have never seen since, who 
said, "The minister wi' a' his con- 
gregation is here the nicht, to break 
ud your meetin'. Stand close the- 
gither. so he canna get in the circle." 
And =he and some of her friends 
ioined in that circle and helned us 
keen it. When the first sneaker be* 
fan to testify to the restoration of 
the Gospel, this alleged minister 
cried out. "These men are 'Mor- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mons,' " and the Elder, who at that 
time was giving his first address in 
public out in the field, became some- 
what confused, said a few more 
words, and stepped back in the ring. 
Then this interrupter had the 
crowd, and among other things, 
said, "These men come from Salt 
Lake City ; they are after your 
daughters, and they want to take 
them out there and hitch them to 
the plow and make them work, and 
make slaves of them." Well, we 
called on Brother Leggatt, who was 
a resident of Glasgow, and he 
stepped out in the ring and said, 
"Fellow Townsmen," which gave 
the lie right at once to the minister's 
statement that we were all from 
Salt Lake City, and then Brother 
Leggatt bore his testimony in an 
excellent address. Well, that man 
continued his railing until our meet- 
ing was about half over, at which 
time the crowd began to realize that 
his heart was filled with animosity, 
and they silenced him, and listened 
to the message which the Elders had 
to give. 

That misguided brother and those 
who joined with him did not realize 
the importance of the message 
which those humble boys — for some 
of us were mere boys — had to give 
to the world. He thought, and those 
who sympathized with him thought, 
I grant sincerely, that those men 
holding that meeting were represen- 
tatives of an organization whose 
purpose is to injure the people. 
They did not know — or if so then 
they were wicked indeed — that the 
message which those Elders had to 
give to the world was indeed, and is, 
the message of life, a philosophy 
which is the true science of living. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ, as re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 



is in very deed, every way, the 
power of God unto salvation. It is 
salvation here — here and now. It 
gives to every man the perfect life, 
here and now as well as hereafter. 

Life is the dearest thing to us in 
all the world. Nothing else that you 
cherish as you cherish your life. You 
who would give your life today for 
some one else would give it in order 
to save the life of one who is dearer 
to you than your own life. So life 
is the one thing we hold to. It is 
the one thing we desire here and 
hereafter. Eternal life is God's 
greatest gift to man. 

What is eternal life? In that 
glorious prayer of intercession of- 
fered by Jesus, our Redeemer, just 
before he crossed the brook Cedron 
and received the traitor's kiss that 
betrayed him into the hands of the 
soldiers, we find these words, "This 
is life eternal, to know thee, the only 
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom 
thou has sent." To know God and 
His Son is eternal life. There is the 
key. Life eternal is what I desire. 
I desire it more than I desire any- 
thing else in the world — life eternal 
for me and mine and all the world. 
And there in the words of the Re- 
deemer I have the secret given to 
me in a simple sentence, "To know 
God and Jesus Christ, whom Thou 
hast sent, is eternal life." 

But how shall I knozv him ? That 
is the next question. How may I 
know Him? Has He, at any time, 
or on any occasion, answered that 
question? If so, I want the an- 
swer, because it is vital. In search- 
ing the record as it is given to us 
by men who associated daily with 
the Lord, I find uoon one occasion 
that men out in His audience cried 
out against Him. They opposed His 
works as men today opposed you, 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



71 



my fellow missionaries, when you 
were out in the field. And one voice 
cried out and said in effect, "How 
do we know that what you tell us 
is true ? How do we know that your 
profession of being the Son of God 
is true?" And He answered in just 
a simple way ; and note the test : 
"If ye will do the will of My Father, 
which is in heaven, ye shall know 
whether the doctrine is of God or 
whether I speak of myself." That 
test is most sound. It is most phil- 
osophical. It is the most simple 
test to give knowledge to an in- 
dividual of which the human mind 
can conceive. Doing a thing, in- 
troducing it into your very being, 
will convince you whether it is good 
or whether it is bad. You may not 
be able to convince me of that which 
you know, but you know it because 
you have lived it. That is the test 
that the Savior gave to those men 
when they asked Him how they 
should know whether the doctrine 
was of God or whether it was of 
man. 

But in considering His answer 
there is another question arises. // 
ye will do the will — what is the zvill? 
We can see what conditions will 
bring eternal life. We have the 
spoken statement that if we will do 
His will, we shall know ; but now 
comes the question, what is the will ? 
And therein, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is the whole essence of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. Just as plainly 
as Jesus stated and denned what was 
eternal life or how we should know 
it, just as plainly as He laid down 
that test, just as plainly has He ex- 
pressed what His will is. 

These brethren, who have ad- 
dressed us today, presidents of 
stakes, presidents of missions, have 
defined one by one in different ways, 



some of those principles which con- 
stitute the will of God. I am not 
going to take time — it would not be 
wise, even if I could — to narrate all 
the principles that constitute that 
will ; but they are so simple that as 
the scriptures say, a wayfaring man 
though a fool, need not err therein. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints bears testimony 
to the world that this will of God 
has been made manifest in this dis- 
pensation, that the principles of the 
Gospel, the principles of life have 
been revealed. They are in harmony 
with the principles which Christ 
taught in the meridian of times. In 
harmony ! they are the same ; be- 
cause they are eternal, as the prin- 
ciples given in all dispensations of 
the world : Faith — Why, who can 
dispute that faith is an eternal prin- 
ciple? You cannot live without it. 
It is as eternal as love, eternal, 
active and may be as constant as 
the force of gravity that is acting 
every day. Repentance. Why, it is 
not just in Scripture that you find 
that repentance is an eternal prin- 
cipal. Read Carlysle, you who take 
him as a guide, and like his reason- 
ing. Do vou know that in contem- 
plating this principle of repentance, 
he makes this statement, "The man 
who cannot repent is dead." And 
he is right. He felt the eternal ele- 
ment in that saving principle. It is 
part of life. It is a fatal condition 
to reach when one cannot repent. 

So we might go on with our prin- 
ciples.. But then you can sum it up 
in this, my fellow workers, that after 
obeying the principles and the or- 
dinances of the Gospel the will of 
God is to serve your fellow man. 
benefitting them, making this world 
better for your being in it. Christ 
gave His all to teach us that prin-

ciple. And He made the statement, 
"Inasmuch as ye do it unto the least 
of these my brethren, ye have done 
it unlo Me." Why, Elders going- 
out to injure ! to entrap the inno- 
cent ! It is just the opposite. Their 
message is to bless. Their duty is 
to serve. There is the message 
which God has given us in the per- 
fect organization of the Church re- 
ferred to by our brother. That 
Church is God's Church, which is 
so perfectly organized that every 
man and every woman, every child, 
may have an opportunity to do 
something good to somebody else. 
Such is the organization of our 
Church, and that is the obligation 
of you ward teachers, the choir 
members, the high priests, seventies, 
and elders, and priests, teachers, and 
deacons, all the auxilaries in the 
Church, to serve and do God's will ; 
and if we do, the more we do it, the 
more we shall become convinced 
that is the work of God ; because ivc 
are testing it, and we shall knozv. 
Bobby Burns says, "The proof o' 
the puddin' is the' preein' o't ;" 
which is just another way of ex- 
pressing the same thing. 

Then, by doing the will of God. 
we get to know God, and get close 
to Him, and feel then that life eter- 
nal is ours. We shall feel to love 
humanity everywhere, and we can 
cry out with the apostle of old, "I 
know that I have passed from death 
unto life, because I love the breth- 
ren." 



In conclusion, let us all go from 
this meeting with a sincere deter- 
mination to do what the poet has 
said he would like to do. 

It may not be on the mountain's 
height. 

Or over the stormy sea; 
It may not be at the battle's front 

My Lord shall have need of me; 
But if by a still, small voice He calls 

To paths that I do not know, 
I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand 
in Thine, 

I'll go where you want me to go. 

Perhaps today there are loving words 
Which Jesus would have me speak. 

There may be now in the paths of sin 
Some wand'rer whom I should seek, 

O. Savior, if Thou wilt be my guide, 
Though dark and rugged the way, 

My voice shall echo the message 
sweet, 

I'll say what you want me to say. 

There's surely somewhere a lowly 
place, 

Tn earth's harvest fields so wide, 
Where I may labor through life's short 
day 

For Jesus the crucified, 
So trusting my all to Thy tender care, 

And knowing Thou lovest me, 
I'll do Thv will with a heart sincere, 

I'll be what you want me to be. 

I'll go where you want me to go, dear 
Lord, 

Over mountain, or plain, or sea; 
I'll say wdiat you want me to say, dear 
Lord, 

I'll be what you want me to be. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hvmn, "High 'on the mountain 
top." Elder Heber C. Austin offered 
the closing prayer.

PREST. FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Large numbers of influential people 
visiting Utah — Peace and prosperity 
prevailing here — All who hold 
Priesthood are teachers — Duty of 
prayer generally observed by Saints 
— High character of leading men in 
Church — War deplored — Peace ex- 
tolled — Safety in following counsel 
of leaders. 

It is very delightful to be in this 
conference, so generously attended 
on yesterday and a good-sized con- 
gregation this morning. The last six 
months have been remarkable for 
a variety of reasons. The war in 
the world, the peace at home, and 
our very remarkable Panama-Pa- 
cific expositions, have marked the 
period in a way never to be forgot- 
ten. The people of our nation, in- 
stead of going across the waters to 
the East, seem to have all come 
West, to see us, and we have been 
better seen and are becoming better 
understood than ever before. A 
larger volume of people, interested 
and influential in our nation, as well 
as from other parts of the world, 
have come to visit us, to look us 



over, and to learn of us. And al- 
though the troubles in the world 
have prevented many of our elders 
from going into the mission fields to 
preach the Gospel, yet those who are 
there have been very faithful and 
have accomplished a splendid work. 
Opportunities are given to local peo- 
ple to take care of the branches and 
to enter into the ministry, to assist 
the brethren sent from Zion, and the 
work is progressing, and Zion tri- 
umphs and prospers gloriously in 
the earth. We have very little rea- 
son to complain — fruitful season, 
peace abiding with us, and union 
and good fellowship among us and 
with many peoples of the world. 

We were certainly interested in 
the report of conditions of the 
Church and what it had accomp- 
lished, by the President yesterday, 
and the doctrinal talks and dis- 
courses by his counselors and other 
brethren were intensely interesting. 
I am delighted to have laid before 
the Latter-day Saints, so generally 
as was done by the President yester- 
day, in regard to the course of the 
labors of our elders in the midst of 
the people, officiating as teachers 
among the people, and the lesson 
laid, down that will be preserved, 
and that will be remembered much 
better than though the same lesson, 
possibly, had been taught by each of 
the bishops of the Church, to their 
company of officiating teachers and 
elders. It was simple, brief, and to 
the point. Of course, every man 
who serves as a teacher among the 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people is expected to officiate, and 
labor, and instruct as the Spirit of 
the Lord gives him utterance ; but 
the principle was laid down so nicely 
and beautifully for us yesterday, it 
may well be remembered and prac- 
ticed upon. For every man is a 
teacher who labors among the peo- 
ple, from the Presidency of the 
Church and the general authorities, 
down to those who bear the Aaronic 
Priesthood. All- are teachers, and 
are expected to be occupied in that 
calling on all occasions, living teach- 
ers, working among the people by 
their precept and by their example. 
And thus the Latter-day Saints are 
better taken care of, possibly, than 
any other people in the world. 

And the Latter-day Saints are a 
prayerful people. It was announced 
a day or two ago in the papers that 
the President of the United States 
had let it be known to his cabinet 
that he believed in prayer. It seemed 
to be quite an event in the history of 
so prominent and remarkable a man 
as the leader of this nation. He is, 
of course, a religious man and an- 
nounced the fact to his cabinet that 
he believed in prayer, but he had 
not, at that time, found out whether 
his cabinet were believers in prayer 
or not. They belong, no doubt, to 
different faiths, different churches. 
But the Latter-day Saints are all 
prayerful. From day to day we 
pray, morning and evening in a 
general manner for the welfare, not 
only of the Latter-day Saints and 
Zion, but we pray for our neighbors, 
we pray for our friends, we pray for 
the President of the United States, 
we pray for his cabinet, we pray for 
the members of Congress, we pray 
for the officials who serve us politic- 
ally as well as those who serve us re- 
ligiously, and possibly we are re- 
markable in that regard. I have not 



known, so far as my acquaintance 
goes, any people that have been so 
strictly trained, and are held to an 
account to remember the Lord. And 
every week of our lives, when we 
attend strictly, as we should do, to 
our worship, we pray before the 
Lord and partake of the emblems 
of the body and blood of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, witnessing to the 
Father that we remember Him and 
His Son, and that we are under ob- 
ligation and covenant with Him to 
serve Him and keep His command- 
ments. And how thoroughly the 
brethren and sisters who were with 
us yesterday, and those who are here 
today, are trained in this discipline ! 
We are in close touch with the in- 
spiration of the Lord, through our 
faith, through our works, and a life- 
long training ; and we are a people 
of peace, a people of justice, and a 
people of righteousness and moral- 
ity. 

A moral people are the Latter- 
day Saints, for no true Latter-day 
Saint is immoral. When a Latter- 
day Saint becomes immoral, he 
ceases to be a Latter-day Saint. If 
he becomes dishonest, if he is wicked 
and corrupt in any degree whatever, 
it deprives him of being a Latter- 
day Saint. We have a testimony 
abiding in our hearts in regard to 
the truth, in regard to the revela- 
tions of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus, and the doctrines that were 
stated so simply and plainly, and in- 
terestingly, to us yesterday by Presi- 
dent Penrose in a very brief manner, 
yet covering the ground, and indi- 
cating to us the way of life and sal- 
vation, how to serve the Lord, how 
to come into His presence and fel- 
lowship and to enter into covenant 
with Him, to serve Him while we 
live in the flesh and while engaged

in a struggle and warfare with 
Satan in this probation. 

The brethren who sit before me 
here, leading, prominent brethren of 
the Church, coming from all over 
gathered Israel, Zion, are model 
men. I thought, when two of our 
stake presidents and two of our 
mission presidents appeared and 
spoke to us yesterday afternoon, 
that we have 72 just such men as 
those who talked to us, and they 
have each two counselors ; and we 
have quite a number of mission pres- 
idents, the same as those who talked 
to us yesterday. These are leading 
men, and they are surrounded by 
men of strength and influence, and 
character, that are devoted and 
faithful to the cause of Zion and to 
the truth, and in the hearts of these 
men burn always the testimony of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 

And we are so delighted to recog- 
nize the fact that we are dwelling 
in the land of Zion, that peace abides 
here, and is to abide here upon this 
land. We have had our share al- 
ready, I trust, in war and trouble, 
and bloodshed, that commenced in 
the division between the North and 
the South very many years ago, as a 
fulfillment of prophecy. For the 
Lord had revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph that such would be the case. 
And we had war for years. Thou- 
sands and hundreds of thousands of 
our brethren went to' their death in 
defense of the union. The war was 
fought, and I hope that our troubles, 
so far as war is concerned, are over, 
and that we shall not be drawn into 
the wars of the Eastern world, and 
have none of our own, and that our 
nation will be a nation of peace 
makers. The President seems to be 
thoroughly pledged, and his cabinet 
and his advisors, to maintain peace 



with honor, which is most delight- 
ful. And we expect the time to 
come that in Europe, and other parts 
of the world, where men are not 
willing to take up their swords 
against their neighbor, they will 
need flee to the land of Zion for 
safety, and that here they shall find 
peace. We pray for peace, we live 
for it, we labor for it, and make 
some sacrifices and do all that is 
possible for us at all times. We 
pray for those who are in trouble. 
There is no sense, no judgment, no 
wisdom in the prosecution of wars 
as is being done in the world today. 
It is a shame and a disgrace to 
Christians or pagans to do what is 
being done today in tne world. It 
ought not to be, and we are labor- 
ing to correct those conditions as far 
as we possibly can in our own lives. 

I want to say for the Latter-day 
Saints, according to my observation, 
we have been so well trained, so 
thoroughly trained for so many 
years until peace abides in our own 
homes, in our own families, in our 
neighborhoods, in our wards, in our 
stakes ; and the bishops with their 
courts, presidencies and high coun- 
cils of stakes, with their courts, have 
very little serious difficulties to at- 
tend to, because the people are so 
thoroughly trained that they know 
just exactly how to settle their own 
difficulties, and to live in peace and 
to make peace and pursue it with 
each other. Zion is triumphing and 
prospering in the earth, and the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are becoming known 
and those who war upon us and try 
to make us trouble, do so at the ex- 
pense of conscientiousness and hon- 
esty and morality, for we are work- 
ing for righteousness in the earth 
and to save the people. We travel 
for the salvation of the children of 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men. That is the ministry that has 
been conferred upon the Latter-day 
Saints through the revelations of the 
Gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The testimony in regard to the di- 
vinity of his mission and the divin- 
ity of the mission of the Savior, is 
established thoroughly in the hearts 
of all Latter-day Saints. For, hav- 
ing done the will of the Lord, the 
testimony abides in our souls and we 
are grateful and thankful to our 
brethren, who are one with us in 
our ministry in officiating at home 
or officiating abroad. We are mak- 
ing every effort that we possibly 
can to put able, well-informed and 
influential men into the field to 
preach the Gospel, and we trust that 
the time will soon come when the 
Gospel shall be preached to every 
nation, that it may be taken every- 
where, and there shall be no ob- 
stacles in the way, and that peace 
may be established among the na- 
tions. 

We thank you, my brethren and 
sisters, for your generous attend- 
ance here. We love to have you 
come to headquarters and meet 
with us. We go to you, we 
go to every stake and give at- 
tention and care, not only to the 
stakes, but to wards and quorums 
and organizations in the Church, 
giving our attention all the time to 
the labor that is required, that the 
Church may be in order and the Lat- 
ter-day Saints may be thoroughly 
instructed and trained. And they 
have before them always in their 
midst established and reliable men, 
upon whose counsel and instruction 
they can always depend. And the 
Latter-day Saints never go astray 
when they rely upon counsel. And 
they know the counsel that they 
should rely upon and depend upon, 



for it is always in their reach. We 
not only have the presidency of the 
Church and the general authorities, 
but in every stake, in every ward 
and in every mission, there is a head 
that can be relied upon, depended 
upon and trusted to give forth the 
word and will and counsel of the 
Almighty. Always when brethren 
or sisters have gone astray in any 
degree whatever, it is because they 
have done so contrary to the coun- 
sels of the , Lord to His servants, 
and His servants are always at our 
elbow ready to give us correct and 
reliable direction and instruction. 
Let us remember this and never do 
what we do not know to be right. 
Be sure that we are right and then 
go ahead. And if we follow our 
file leader, we will not go far astray ; 
and our file leaders are those that 
walk the straight and narrow path 
that leads to eternal life. 

We should not be led astray by 
those who are in error. We want 
to be established and firm and set- 
tled and fixed in our purposes to 
serve the Lord and keep His com- 
mandments while we live in the 
flesh. Our lives are not very 
lengthy, this probation is short, 
and possibly well enough that it is, 
but we should magnify our callings 
and position and responsibility in the 
Priesthood, and as members of this 
Church, as advocates of the truth, 
and examplars in all things. These 
brethren that stand at our head and 
are entrusted with the care of the 
people, are model men, or should 
be, in all things, serving God and 
giving forth the true sound, that we 
are one with those who lead us and 
we should be one with our Savior 
and Redeemer, as also with the 
prophet who has been before us, and 
those who have served us since his

passing away, for these men have 
been true and devout and faithful 
without exception. They have hon- 
ored God and have listened to His 
counsel and direction in all things 
and have been reliable, as they are 
today. Those who lead us today, 
you can depend upon their counsel 
and it is our duty and business to 
know exactly where they stand, 
what they advise, what they counsel, 
and what they direct us to do, and 
Zion will triumph and prosper glor- 
iously. 

I do not care to take much time 
this morning. Time is brief of 
course, in our conference. The 
Lord is with us by His Spirit and 
He is softening the hearts of men to- 
ward us. Fie is helping us to main- 
tain peace upon this side of the 
world. And He moves not only 
upon the hearts of Latter-day 
Saints and the people of this Church, 
but He is moving upon the hearts of 
men as far as men will listen and 
heed His warning. He is sounding 
the truth to them and calling them 
to repentance and reformation, and 
works of righteousness. Let us take 
our part and carry the responsibility 
that is upon our shoulders and mag- 
nify our callings and positions as 
Latter-day Saints in the earth, and 
we will have great joy in time, and 
salvation and exaltation in the world 
to come, when Satan will have been 
baffled and defeated and we will be 
victorious, not only in the world to 
come, but in this world also, for the 
Lord will vindicate the truth on 
earth as well as in heaven. 
" May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, may His Spirit 
fill our hearts and souls now and 
forever in all departments where we 
labor, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. A'rhen. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 

(President of Summit Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
been very much impressed in this 
conference by the counsels given. 
One statement that strongly im- 
pressed me was the remark of Pres- 
ident Lund when he was quoting 
the Prophet Joseph Smith in regard 
to these who find fault with the au- 
thorities, that it leads to apostasy. 
This was brought forcibly to my 
mind from some experiences I have 
had as President of a stake. When 
I first went to the Summit stake of 
Zion, there were a few of the people 
that were very much offended, and 
they continually found fault with 
the actions of the authorities of the 
Church. I want to tell you one of 
the things that influenced me more 
than anything else in my life. Quite 
frequently, when I would come into 
the city, the President of the Church 
would ask me how we were getting 
along, and I thought I had better 
tell about what these men were say- 
ing, the fault that they were finding 
with the Church, and I did so sev- 
eral times as I had opportunity. One 
day in the President's office, when 
nearly all the authorities of the 
Church were present, President 
Smith asked me that question again, 
and I started in to tell him and he 
stopped me. He said, "Moses, say 
'Shoo-fly, don't bother me,' about 
things of that kind." When I went 
out of the office, one of the promi- 
nent men who was present came to 
me and said, "It is all right for 
President Smith to sav that to you, 
but he couldn't say 'Shoo-fly, don't 
bother me.' " I said to him, "I 
don't care what President Smith 
can do, the prophet of the Lord has 
Said to me, 'Say shorj-fiv, don't 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bother me,' and I am going to 
do it." 

I want to testify to the Latter- 
day Saints that of all the counsels 
that I ever received in my life, I 
have received the greatest benefit 
from that "shoo-fly" counsel. Now 
it don't matter what the unwise say 
or what they do, I say, "shoo-fly, 
don't bother me ;" and I find that I 
am magnified in the eyes of the 
people by taking that course. What 
called it to my attention, more than 
anything else, happened the other 
day. I met a prominent lawyer, 
and the name of President Smith 
came up in our conversation, and he 
said, "I would like to meet President 
Joseph F. Smith," and I asked 
"Why." "Well," said he, "he ap- 
pears to be one of the most remark- 
able men in the world today, and 
for this reason, I followed up that 
period of vituperation, when some 
of the newspapers were villifying 
him day by day and day by day. He 
never answered a word ; he must 
know that he is right, he must know 
that he is absolutely right." I told 
him this "shoo-fly" story, and he 
said, "That accounts for it, that is 
the way that he lives himself." 

I am impressed with the thought 
that, in our stake we are very anx- 
ious that there shall not be anybody 
find fault with the authorities of the 
Church. I always tell them that 
whenever a man starts to find fault 
with the authorities of the Church, 
and thinks that the authorities have 
it "in for him," that it is a sign of 
insanity, and we tell them right out, 
"You are going crazy ;" always tell 
them. "You are going crazy, and 
the sooner you stop it the better." 
T thought I would like to say that 
much in regard to that point, be- 
cause it is one of the greatest coun- 



sels Lever received in my life. 

There is another thing that 
pleased me very much. A son of 
mine came here to the city to work, 
and lodged in the 20th ward. He 
had not been there but a short time 
before the Bishop came and invited 
him to be one of the teachers. 1 
appreciated that very much. This 
fall I sent one of my boys in to 
school, and he stays at his brother's 
house. I met the Bishop the other 
day and he said to me, "Have you 
any objection to me using that other 
boy of yours as a teacher?" He 
said, "He came into the ward the 
other day and youi son, on account 
of work, could not go teaching, but 
he said, T will send my brother,' 
and now the teacher comes and 
says, T want the brother to be my 
companion, the boy that is going 
to school.' " Of course I had no 
objection, I wanted to thank the 
Bishop for taking care of my boys 
when away from home, and T felt 
like saying this to the bishops and 
others in Salt Lake City here. The 
boys that come from the country 
have got pure blood, pure minds, 
and clean thoughts, and you can't 
get better teachers in all the world 
than the boys that come from the 
country. We parents that live out 
in the country appreciate it when 
you take care of them, and use them 
in the Priesthood ; they will prove 
their worth to you if you will use 
them. 

Now may the peace and blessing 
of heaven be with us. I know that 
the Gospel is true, and I know that 
this is the greatest work in all the 
world. The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints is the greatest 
organization in all the world, and 
the greater position you can get in 
it, the greater you will be in this 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



world. I want to say to the Latter- 
day Saints that I never have seen 
a bishop, or other prominent man 
in this Church, sacrifice his position 
in the Church, for some financial 
position or otherwise, that suc- 
ceeded. They lay down the greater 
for the less. So brethren, when you 
have received a position in the 
Church, magnify it, as President 
Lyman said, and the Lord will mag- 
nify you before the people, and you 
will realize that God is your father, 
your friend and benefactor. May 
the peace and blessing of heaven be 
with us, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The sacred song, "Abide with 
me," was sung by Sister Francisca 
R. Parkinson. 

ELDER GERMAN E.ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I rejoice in the testimony that I 
have of the great work our Father 
is doing in the earth. It is very 
like the work that has been done by 
God during all dispensations of the 
world's history. We find that 
Father Adam offered sacrifice be- 
cause he was commanded of the 
Lord ; Enoch worked righteousness 
among the people in his day, under 
direction of the Father ; and Abra- 
ham won the title of the "Father of 
the Faithful" because he was will- 
ing to keep the commandments of 
the Lord. Moses, under the direc- 
tions of Jehovah, became the leader 
of Israel in his generation. Daniel 
the Prophet, and the three Hebrew 
children, were preserved by the 
Lord through divine interposition. 
Zachariah, though he doubted the 



visitation, became the father of the 
great Prophet John. Mary, the 
mother of Christ, likewise was vis- 
ited by heavenly messengers ; and 
the birth of our Savior was an- 
nounced by personal visitors from 
heaven, as also the resurrection. 

In every part of the work of our 
Heavenly Father, He has been in 
close communion with His servants 
who dwell in the earth. He tells us 
in Holy Writ that He would do 
nothing but what He made His mind 
and will known to His servants, the 
prophets. He has promised likewise 
that, in the last days, He would send 
His messengers to prepare the way 
before His face. He has likewise 
told us that Elijah should come for 
a special mission. John, while on 
the isle of Patmos, was visited by a 
heavenly messenger, who said to 
John, when he was about to fall 
clown and worship the visitor, "See 
that thou do it not, for I am one of 
thy fellow servants, worship God." 

When I stop and think of the 
work that is being done in this day, 
it is so much like the work that has 
been done by our Father in all ages 
of the world. It makes me rejoice 
that I am blessed with a testimony 
of what God is doing in the same 
work this day. The beginning of 
the work was under the direction of 
the Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ, renewing again the true con- 
ception of the Father and the Son. 
and telling what would come to pass 
in this generation, beginning with 
the establishing of the Church that 
bears the name of the Master, even 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We then find that 
the messengers promised in the 
scrioture have been sent, and the 
work that they are doing is identical 
with the work that has been done' in

the past ages. John, who preceded 
the coming of the Christ in his day, 
preached faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, repentance from sin, and 
baptism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins. He proclaimed the 
same doctrine in this day, and in- 
structed the prophet how to proceed 
to follow this counsel, and be in har- 
mony with the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Following his instructions, Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery were 
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, 
for the remission of their sins. Then 
Peter, James, and John, at the right 
time, came and delivered a certain 
message, certain authority and in- 
structions concerning the great 
work of our Father in the earth in 
this day. Following that visit, other 
messengers, who were prophets of 
the Lord, came and delivered kevs 
and power which they held under 
the directions of the Father. 

And so, when I stop and think 
that, in this day, God has established 
a Church that bears His name, and 
in the very way He did it in former 
days, by sending His servants, it 
makes me happy to think that I have 
part in such a great work. The 
very name of the Church is a great 
testimony to me. I rejoice in the 
principle of faith in the Father of 
the spirits of the human race, faith 
in Jesus Christ, who is His Son in 
very deed, and our resurrected Re- 
deemer. Faith or conviction of this 
sort will bring men to repentance, 
turn them from their sins and evil 
walks in life to a godly life. When 
thev yield to the instruction of the 
Spirit of the Lord, they are led into 
the waters of baptism and come 
forth in newness of life. I bear 
witness that I have seen the converts 
come out of the waters of baptism 
.with a look upon their face as pure 



as though they were new born. I 
have seen them reform their lives 
and walk in the spirit of the Gospel 
of Jesus, as they had never done be- 
fore. 

When I think that I belong to the 
Church that bears the name of the 
Master, and teaches doctrines that 
were taught by the prophets of old 
and by Christ Himself, it makes 
me rejoice that I am thus favored 
in the world. It makes me rejoice 
to see the power of the Lord man- 
ifest through the young men and 
young women who come into the 
Northern States Mission, when they 
stand forth and bear their testimony 
to the people of the world. God 
has truly revealed to their" hearts, 
and has put it in their souls, and 
lias made their tongues to testify of 
His name, and of the great work 
that is being done in this our day. 
I rejoice that I believe in the coming 
of angels, that T believe God our 
Father can send prophets in this 
dav, and instruct His children how 
to live and what to do to come back 
into His presence. It is a glorious 
thing to believe that the heavens 
and the earth are so near together, 
and that our Father has personal 
charge in this clay as in other days. 

I rejoice in the testimony that has 
come into my heart that. God sent 
angels in this day to instruct the 
Prophet Joseph Smith concerning 
the great work to be done. I rejoice 
that 1 believe in the prophets that 
followed the first angels, and the 
keys that they delivered. I rejoice, 
more than I have the language to 
express, that I have received a testi- 
mony in my soul that Joseph F. 
Smith is a prophet of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and that the work of 
our Father in this day is under His 
direction. The counsel and advice

given by the Prophet to the Latter- 
day Saints in this conference, and 
in all previous conferences, if 
heeded, will make men and women 
after the similitude of our Heavenly 
Father and prepare them to go back 
and dwell with Him eternally. I 
bear witness that the heavens have 
been opened, that God has sent His 
angels, not only in ages past but in 
our day and age. The angels have 
been with the missionaries, going 
before their faces and preparing the 
hearts of the people to receive them. 
They have seen them, and heard 
their promptings concerning what 
to do and say. I reioice in my tes- 
timony, and pray God that He will 
bless me and all the rising genera- 
tions, and implant within our hearts 
a desire to magnify the name of God 
in the earth, and fulfill the mission 
that has been given to this genera- 
tion. I bear witness that what has 
been done up to the present time is 
onlv a beginning of the.work. There 
will be a time, not very far awav, 
when it will reauire everv man, in 
whose heart dwells the testimony of 
Jesus, to go out and bear that wit- 
ness, and teach the people of the 
World the straight and narrow wav, 
that His work mav be established, 
and His name" mav be glorified. 

In the hearts of many young men 
are being implanted a love of the 
goods of this world, and the honor 
of men, a love of things that will 
pass away, while, on the other hand, 
thev should have a desire to be able 
to bear testimony of the restorer! 
Gospel, above all other desires of 
their 'hearts; for it is the greatest 
work in the earth. It has been es- 
tablished by our Father. He is di- 
recting it. I know that. I should 
think that every man and woman in 
■the world, who is seeking salvation. 



would rejoice to know that God has 
visited the earth, that He has sent 
His angels, that He has established 
His Church, putting upon it His 
name, teaching the doctrines that 
will make men and women His chil- 
dren in very deed. There is power 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to 
work righteousness and salvation in 
the hearts of all those who will hear 
and obey the message. 

Mav the Lord bless the Latter- 
dav Saints : may He bless our Presi- 
dent and his counselors ; may He 
bless President Lvman and the Quo- 
rum of the Twelve. I bear testi- 
mony that they are proohets of the 
Lord, and that God is directing His 
work through them. Mav He helo 
tis all to magnify His name and to 
prove worthy of the wonderful 
blessings that have come into our 
lives. T a^k it in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN. 

(President of Bingham Stake.) 

I assure von, my brethren and sis- 
ters and friends, that I feel very 
weak in occupying this position. I 
desire an interest in your faith and 
prayers the few moments that I mav 
stand before you, that I mav be di- 
rected to sav something that will be 
in harmony with the spirit of this 
conference. 

I rejoice in the work of the Lord. 
I know that the Gospel is true. I 
rejoice in association with the 
brethren who are called to preside 
over the Church ; I love them, I am 
very much benefited, as you are ben- 
efited bv the influence that they 
carry with them. I appreciate the 
reesponsibility that is resting upon 
our brethren who are directing the

affairs of the work of the Lord in 
this day, and it is my desire, in my 
weak and humble way, to aid and 
assist them, and to sustain them in 
the labor which they are called to 
perform. 

I know that the Lord is with us, 
that the Lord is with His work, that 
it is divine in its nature, and it has 
within it the power of salvation for 
all of those who will render obe- 
dience unto its principles. I have a 
living testimony of its divine truths. 
I am thankful to the Lord for the 
knowledge that I have concerning 
this work. I am thankful to the 
Lord for my standing and member- 
ship in the Church. I pray God that 
I may prove faithful,' that I may be 
able, in my weakness, to keep His 
commandments, to set an example 
before those with whom I labor, 
those with whom I am associated 
that will encourage them in the per- 
formance of their duty. 

I am from the north ; I am living 
among the people of tbe Southern 
part of Idaho, in the Bincham stake 
of Zion, with Idaho Falls as its 
headquarters. Idaho Falls is a citv 
of about 7,000 people, with onlv 600 
Latter-day Saints there, so you will 
readilv see that, to all intents and 
purposes, it is what is termed a 
"Gentile" town ; but I want to bear 
testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, and friends, that there is 
perfect harmony there. We are liv- 
ing in peace with our neiehbors. 
there is no contention. The bitter- 
ness that used to be has all passed 
awav. Those men who used to fiqht 
the "Mormon" people have lost their 
influence. They carry with them no 
harmful influence any more. Manv 
of them have passed away, or movpd 
awav. We are living in neace with 
our neighbors ; we respect them, and 



they respect us; and they are will- 
ing to grant unto us all the rights 
and privileges that belong to us. We 
work in harmony with them, and 
conjointly with them in measures of 
reformation. 

We have been very actively en- 
gaged in the cause of temperance, 
for a few years. We have worked 
together until we have been able to 
bring about wonderful reformation 
along that line, wonderful as com- 
pared with the old conditions. It is 
almost unknown now to see a man, 
in our section of the country, under 
the influence of liquor. It is be- 
coming very unpopular to foster, or 
encourage, or defend the use of 
liquors. Men who used to have 
some sympathy for it, a little time 
ago, have changed their views, and 
they have been convinced that the 
cause of temperance is for better 
citizenship, better living, more com- 
forts in our homes, better providing 
for our families, and eliminating 
from our midst those evil tendencies 
that are kindred to the use of liquor. 

Mv brethren and sisters. T thank 
God that I have been identified with 
men and women who have labored 
for the betterment of the human 
race, and that we have lived to see. 
in a measure, some of the fruits of 
our labors. Now, mv brethren, 
there are responsibilities resting 
upon us as the servants of the Lord, 
because we are in the service of the 
Lord. We have been honored with 
the priesthood, and that priesthood 
carries with it responsibilities and 
obligations, and we will be blessed 
according to the measure that we 
magnify our calling. 

I prav that the Lord may bles« 
the Latter-day Saints, that the work 
of the Lord may grow, that the 
Gospel may be carried to the na- 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION.

tions of the earth until every honest 
man and woman shall be convinced 
of the truth, and be gathered into 
the fold and be blessed as we are 
blessed. 

Oh, I am so thankful that I can 
scarcely express my gratitude to my 
Father in heaven that, in the early 
days of the Church, before I was 
born, my father and mother heard 
the Gospel, and that their hearts 
were touched with divine inspira- 
tion, that they knew it was true, and 
that their children have been raise 1 
and reared . under their teachings, 
and, through our experiences, we 
have gained a testimony of the di- 
vinity of this work. May God 
grant that we may ever be worthy 
of His blessings, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

Yesterday, the words of the Lord 
came to my mind as He spoke 
them unto Abraham, when He said 
to him : "In thee and in thy seed 
shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed." The remarks of President 
Smith brought this to my mind. A 
few conferences since, we voted 
that a temple be built in Canada. 
Yesterday the same privilege was 
granted us to vote for a temple to 
be built on one of the islands of the 
Pacific Ocean, that the work of the 
Lord which, in a measure, has been 
hampered might be extended, that 
those brethren and sisters who have 
heard the voice of the Redeemer 
might have the privilege of looking 
after their dead and uniting their 
families ; and that the doctrine 
might be made plain and shown 
unto all men that, though men and 



women die, they shall live again, 
and shall have the privilege of hear- 
ing the Gospel. 

No wonder Paul made the state- 
ment that "if in this life only we 
have hope in Christ, we of all men 
are most miserable." There would 
be no happiness or pleasure at all 
in this life if it were not for the 
fact that we are laying a foundation 
for the future. We build today for 
the future, so far as temporal affairs 
are concerned ; and we prepare for 
our future existence by our actions 
of today. The only blessing that 
can come to the children of men, 
whether in this world or out of it, 
will be through the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the gospel which Abraham 
taught, the gospel which he lived, 
and the gospel which made him the 
prominent character that he was 
and is in the hearts of the Christian 
world. 

The Latter-day Saints teach noth- 
ing more than the Lord has re- 
vealed We believe in a restoration 
of the Gospel. We have never been 
accused of a reformation of it. We 
believe in the same Gospel that the 
Lord established in the days of 
Adam, in the days of Abraham, in 
the days of Christ. We do not 
teach continued priesthood but we 
do teach a restoration of the gospel, 
the gospel plan which the Lord told 
Abraham would save or bless all 
men and all women. The strength 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints lies in its princi- 
ples and in its doctrines. It takes 
men to the isles of the sea and to 
foreign countries, and wherever the 
Gospel is to be preached, and it will 
continue until the Son of Man 
comes again in the flesh. 

Men and women who have died 
without a knowledge of the Gospel 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will have the privilege of hearing 
it, as was stated here yesterday, and 
I know that it is the truth. There 
is an organization of the Church on 
the other side. I can look back on 
my life and see men that I have 
known who have died, faithful men, 
men of integrity, men of character, 
filled with love for the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and it would be abso- 
lutely impossible for me to believe 
that they are inactive. I know that' 
they are active, and that they are 
preparing a way for the Lord to 
come to His people, in His temnle, 
when He shall have it erected in 
His own due time. 

The statement has been made that 
if polvgamy should be stamped frn«i 
among this peonle. the time wo"ld 
come that the Church would dip : 
that those who practiced tbat prin- 
ciple were fanatics ; and ■ that the 
generations who were to fr»11<v« 
would not have the strength and 
courage that their fathers hid. But 
facts orove otherwise. The chiHren 
who have been born from parents 
who came into this western country 
are here, as a witness unto the world 
that the faith of their fathers is in- 
creased in them, and that there is no 
such thing as cowardice, neither will 
there be, but that the strength of 
these everlasting hills, which has 
come unto them through their 
fathers, shall be among them to give 
them power to carry the Gospel 
unto the ends of the earth, until the 
Lord shall crv "Enough." There 
is no such thins: as failure: there 
is no such a thing as this Church 
not having; the power to go into all 
the world. It will go into all the 
world and it will not onlv teach a 
man to look after himself but it will 
teach him to look after his dead 
kindred. Thus will the plan of Sal- 



vation, through which the children 
of Abraham shall be blessed, be 
manifested unto every man, woman 
and child. 

I want to tell you it is my firm 
belief that the children of this coun- 
try, and men and women of this 
land, in other states of this Union, 
who know us not, shall become ac- 
quainted with us. In their being 
flows the blood of Abraham. I tell 
you that as I have placed my hands 
upon the shoulders of men and 
talked to them in the world, — my 
neighbors, men that I know to be 
good, honorable men, — I have felt 
that the day will come when the 
promptings of the Holy Spirit shall 
have its power and effect upon 
them, and they will listen to the 
voice of their Redeemer. They 
shall know it, and they shall stand 
for what thev know to be the truth. 
They have grown up to be Method- 
ists, Presbyterians, and so forth, 
and their environment has made 
them largely what thev are. but the 
fact remains that, when thev grow 
old enough to see and know for 
themselves that the gospel which 
they are following is not preparing 
them for the future, they will break 
away from those bonds and will 
reach out for the truth ; for the 
truth, after all, is loved by the hon- 
orable men of the earth, and this 
earth has millions of them. You 
will find them in every church and 
in every part of the country. This 
thing called prejudice is rapidly 
vanishing and it will depart en- 
tirely ; for that spirit of truth, that 
spark of light which came into the 
world when the Lord appeared to 
Joseph Smith, will dispel the dark- 
ness and jrloom that cover the 
earth, and the children of men will i 
see it. They will bec'ome acquainted 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



85 



with the revelations of the Lord, 
and they will come to this land and 
to the islands of the sea and receive 
their blessings for themselves and 
for their dead. And they will all 
know that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of the living God, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, and 
that the people who were brought 
into this country were led here by 
divine appointment, by a man who 
had been prepared from before the 
foundations of the earth. They will 
know and recognize that man as one 
who knew the truth and who dared 
to live it and who dared to come in 
the face of all trials and adversity 
and establish a place where men and 
women could rear children of faith, 
and through them the world would 
be blessed. 

This blood of Abraham has never 
ceased to flow among God's children 
who have passed on before, those 
who died during the dark ages and 
entered into the eternal worlds. 
There were men and women who 
knew the truth, and it is my firm 
belief that they have never ceased 
to importune the Father until He 
sent His messengers again. I be- 
lieve that the spirit and power of 
prayer is in the eternal world as 
it is here ; that men and women 
pray there as they do here. I don't 
believe that our Father, who has 
the power to make and arrange 
such a beautiful world as this, and 
who has the power to fashion such 
creatures as men and women are, 
would leave His world and His peo- 
ple anywhere in an unorganized 
condition but rather th^t He does 
organize them, that His angels 
ascend and descend, and that they 
live with His children and are there 
to minister for good. 

I know that the power of the 



Lord is with the Latter-day Saints. 
I know that it is with the elders ol" 
Israel. My experience has been 
this : that of all who have labored 
in the ministry under my direction 
I don't know one who has left the 
Church, and there have been per- 
haps a thousand of them, clean hon- 
orable men and women who are 
going to carry the burden that shall 
be placed upon them, and who will 
do it under the direction of those 
who preside over them. 

I stood upon the streets of a city, 
a short time ago, holding a street 
meeting. The elder who was with 
me was a pale-faced young man 
that looked to me as if he could ac- 
complish very little, just as frail 
as he could possibly be. His mother 
was struggling hard to keep him in 
the field. I never had such a mani- 
festation of God's power in my life 
as I stood upon the streets of that 
city and listened to that quivering 
boy bear his testimony — without a 
dollar in the world, not knowing 
really how long he could stay, or 
what he would do when he re- 
turned home. But he stood there 
as brave and bold as a lion, bearing 
testimony unto those people that the 
Lord had revealed Himself unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and that the 
gospel which the prophets had pre- 
dicted would be restored, was re- 
stored. I thought of the words 
again, that through the blood of 
Abraham would all the nations of 
the earth be blessed. 

All men will accept "Mormon- 
ism" sooner or later, when they are 
brought face to face with it. They 
may go into the other world without 
it. undoubtedly many will, but they 
will receive the truth when they are 
shown their path of duty. So as a 
Latter-day Saint, as one of the 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thousands of Israel, I feel to thank 
the Lord that He has so favored me, 
and I bear my testimony to it all the 
time. I have never seen a time in 
my experience when I did not tell 
people who I was. I never saw a time 
when I lost any favor through it. 
I want to tell you that, after all, the 
people of this world like to meet the 
"Mormon" people and like to talk 
to them, and like to become ac- 
quainted with our people. As young 
men and young women in Israel, we 
will prove that the faith of our 
fathers shall be manifested in us, 
and that we will not cease to carry 
the burden that has been placed 
upon us. We will do our duty and 
prove unto the world that we know 
the Lord lives and that we know 
that this is His people, that Jesus 
is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God, and that "Mormonism" is 
true; that the Lord has a prophet 
to guide and counsel men, assigned 
to take care of His work on the 
earth ; that He is here with His 
people, and that He has a people in 
the earth who are keeping His com- 
mandments each day to the best of 
their ability, looking after their 
dead and looking after the living. 

I pray that we may find joy and 
happiness always in the knowledge 
of the Gospel principles we receive 
from time to time, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President Western States Mission.) 

As I listened to the interesting 
portrayal, by President Smith, of 
the condition of the Church, yester- 
day morning, and those who fol- 
lowed him during the day and to- 
day, the thought uppermost in my 
mind was and is now : How thank- 



ful we should be for the knowledge 
we possess pertaining to the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus, and how best can 
we indicate our appreciation for the 
blessings and remarkable opportuni- 
ties that come to us as Latter-day 
Saints. If you parents could look 
upon the faces of your sons and 
your daughters, who have been in 
the mission field for a few weeks 
and have become imbued with the 
missionary spirit, and see there the 
determination to be servants in very 
deed of the Master, or if, after they 
have been in the mission for two 
years or more, you could hear them 
say that they regretted going home 
more than the regret that they ex- 
perienced when they left their home 
to go into the mission, you would be 
astonished and gratified beyond 
measure, but you would thank the 
Lord for the opportunity that had 
come to them. If the young men of 
Zion could but realize the breadth 
of knowledge and of training that 
comes to the earnest missionary, 
they would all welcome the time to 
come, and pray for the opportunity 
to come speedily, when they could 
go into the world and preach the 
Gospel. 

Upon the occasion when Christ 
had been instructing His disciples 
as to their duties, and about the time 
He answered the question of the 
young man who was rich, when He 
said that he should sell all that he 
had and give to the poor and follow 
Him, He intended, undoubtedly, to 
convey to them a thought of sacri- 
fice, for He said : 

"And every man that hath forsaken 
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, 
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, 
for my name's sake, shall receive an 
hundred fold and shall inherit everlast- 
ing life." 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK . 



87 



It was immaterial perhaps what 
kind of sacrifice they made, but if 
they sacrificed for the least of the 
things thus enumerated, He would 
have them believe that they should 
receive an hundred fold. So I be- 
lieve in our great work, if we shall 
go forth as emissaries of Him, if we 
shall be ready to sacrifice when the 
time comes, we too shall receive an 
hundred fold. 

The year before this Church was 
organized, when the Prophet Joseph 
received a revelation regarding mis- 
sionary work, this thought was ex- 
pressed : "Behold the field is white 
already to harvest, and lo, he that 
thrusteth in his sickle with his 
might, the same layeth up in store 
and perish not, but bringeth salva- 
tion to his soul." That was the 
burden of the message given to 
those staunch and fearless men, in 
the early days of this Church, when 
they went forth without money, 
when they went forth giving every- 
thing they had and laying it all at 
the altar of the Church. That I re- 
peat was the burden of their mes- 
sage ; thrust in your sickle with your 
might and you shall bring salvation 
to your soul. 

In the experience of that mighty 
man Neohi there was an exhibi- 
tion of faith, the like of which we 
ought to endeavor to emulate all 
our lives. When Nephi received the 
call from his father to return to 
Jerusalem to obtain the records that 
should later form a part of that 
great record of two peoples upon 
the Western hemisphere, which we 
have today, what was the reply? 
"I will so and do the things the 
Lord hath commanded, for I know 
that the Lord glveth no command- 
ments to the children of men, save 
he shall prepare a way for them 



that they may accomplish the thing 
he commandeth them." I believe, 
too, that the Lord requires nothing 
of us excepting He shall prepare the 
way for us to do it. It is my faith 
and my hope in this great latter-day 
work. I believe that His prophet is 
placed at the head of the Church to 
guide and direct this people. I be- 
lieve that his associates are entitled 
to the same kind of respect and love 
that we should have for him. I be- 
lieve that the Council of Twelve are 
men of God, and I believe the Lord 
expects us to heed their instructions, 
to love them and honor them in 
their position. 

I call attention to the words of 
Elijah, when he was put to the se- 
vere test, when it came to a question 
of authority, "How long halt ye 
between two opinions ? If the Lord 
be God, follow Him; but, if Baal, 
then follow him ;" and so I say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, shall 
we hesitate in our allegiance to our 
Church and its authorized leaders? 
If we believe that the God of the 
ancient prophets is our God then 
likewise believe that President 
Joseph F. Smith and his associates 
are prophets, seers and revelators, 
and as such we should honor them, 
and give to them our loyal support. 
We shall then undoubtedly find it to 
be our duty to sacrifice when the 
time comes regardless of what that 
sacrifice may be. It is not only for 
the poor man, or for the one in mod- 
erate circumstances to sacrifice ; the 
professional man, the rich man, the 
business man, must be called upon 
to sacrifice sooner or later, and 
when the time comes I earnestly 
pray that we may be ready to an- 
swer any call made of us to further 
this great latter-day work, the 
greatest and most vital thing in all 



8^

the world. This is my prayer for 
all of *us, in the name of Christ, our 
Lord. Amen. 



ELDER EVAN STEPHENS. 

(Tabernacle Choir Conductor.) 

My brethren and sisters : About 
a month ago a letter was sent out 
addressed to choir leaders, in the 
various wards of the Church, asking 
them to ascertain how many of their 
choir members expected to attend 
the General Conference, in October 
of this year, and asking such as so 
intended to accept an invitation 
to join with the Salt Lake 
Tabernacle Choir in the sing- 
ing during said Conference. A large 
number of choir leaders responded, 
in all reporting over six hundred 
singers who would attend, at least, 
some of the meetings. Tickets ad- 
mitting all such to the choir gallery 
were sent out. Some two or three 
hundred took part with us yester- 
day, (Sunday), and about one hun- 
dred are present this (Monday) 
morning. But we have reason to 
believe that a great many have taken 
seats in the congregation, being 
timid about appearing in these con- 
spicuous seats, fearing lest it might 
seem pretentious to take seats with 
this noted choir. To any such I de- 
sire to say there is not a choir in 
this or any other church where less 
classification or "aristocracy" can be 
■found than in this choir. The best 
singers we have in the community 
lend their services freely in it, with- 
out even a select seat assigned. 
Each and every one quietly take 
whatever vacant seat is most con- 
venient in the section used by the 
"part" they sing. Not in all the 



twenty-five years that I have had, 
charge has there been an honorary, 
or special seat assigned on account 
of rank or merit. The visiting 
singers, therefore, need not fear that 
they will be trespassing upon places 
reserved even for regular singers, 
or that they will be greeted by any 
one with other than a welcoming 
nod or smile. We are most grate- 
ful for the presence of those who 
have so kindly joned us, and espe- 
caily for the hearty responses of the 
choir ' leaders throughout the 
Church. 

I desire to emphasize again the in- 
vitation to all choir members to 
come into the choir loft, at each fu- 
ture session of the conference that 
you may attend. May the Lord con- 
tinue to bless us, that we may per- 
form well our special task in His 
great work is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Guide us, O Thou great 
Jehovah." 

Elder Joseph R. Shepherd pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjonrned until 2 p.m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hvmn, "The Spirit of God like a 
fire is burning." 

Elder John S. Geddes offered the 
opening praver. 

The choir sang the hvmn, 
"Though deep'ning trials throng 
your way."

Great outlay for Temples, etc. — Gen- 
eral spirit of helpfulness in mem- 
bers of Church — Our religion em- 
braces all that is good in other re- 
ligions — What the Lord has pro- 
vided is greater and better than man 
has devised — The Priesthood, aux- 
iliary organizations, revenue system, 
etc., given of God — Duties required 
of all alike, no discrimination in 
blessings — Great good accomplished 
by Protestants — The tree of "Mor- 
monism" produces good fruit. 

It is a great satisfaction to mingle 
and associate with the Latter-day 
Saints. I rejoice very much in our 
meetings of this conference. I am 
sure the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints were made glad at the open- 
ing of our conference, in receiving 
the information that was given by 
President Smith, more particularly 
with respect to the growth of the 
Church and in receiving the news 
that a temple was to be built on the 
Sandwich Islands. With two tem- 
ples being constructed at this time, 
and other work of the Church that 
is going on in the erection of Church 
offices, and in the assistance ren- 
dered in building meetinghouses, 
stake tabernacles and amusement 
halls, in the different wards and 
stakes, the brethren can readily un- 
derstand- that a great amount of 
means is called for in all of these 
expenditures. So far as mv knowl- 
edge goes, we are in a better shape 
to entertain these expenditures to- 
day than the Church has ever been 
before, and I am sure that this in- 
formation must be gratifying to the 
Latter-day Saints. Nevertheless, it 
is expected of us that we will keep 
the commandments of the Lord, and 
that we will assist with our tithes 
and our offerings in building up the 
Church and kingdom of God upon 
the earth. 



What a splendid organization this 
is. What a spirit of helpfulness 
there is in every one of the different 
societies, and associations, and quo- 
rums of priesthood that constitute 
this great Church. Where is the like 
of it to be found? May we not, 
with truth and with pride, say to all 
the world, Where can you find so 
much of the spirit of helpfulness, 
the spirit of brotherly love, the sin- 
cere desire of being of assistance 
and blessing, benefit and help to one 
another, as you will find in this or- 
ganization ? Can we not say to our 
brethren of other churches. Protest- 
ants, Catholics, Christian Scientists, 
and all other organizations, We 
have all that you have that goes to 
make right living and good citizen- 
ship, good order and peace, good 
government and the well-being of 
mankind ; we have all of that. There 
isn't anything that any one of those 
organizations can point to that 
makes for the betterment of man- 
kind and the uplift of humanity that 
we do not have. Indeed, one of the 
articles of our faith is that "if there 
is anything lovely or of good re- 
port, or praiseworthy" in the world, 
that belongs to us, we have it, we 
incoroporate it, it is part of our sys- 
tem. 

And now. in addition to all that 
these have, and thev have the best 
that man has been able to devise, we 
have much more. I have no criti- 
cism or comnlaint on that score, the 
best that such men as Tohn Knox 
or Martin Luther, or Wesley or any 
man has ever devised, it is the best 
they could devise, but it is not as 
good as we have. Whv? Because 
the Lord has devised this system ; 
this i 5 ; thp Lord's wav. We ought 
not to be blamed or censured by our 
brethren of the outside because our 
svstem is better than theirs. Neither 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ought we to be praised particularly 
because it is so much better, but we 
should give praise to the Lord be- 
cause it is so much more efficient, 
so much more helpful, so much more 
strong in doing things, in accomp- 
lishing results. We put it before all 
the world as the most excellent in 
the world in producing the results 
of peace on earth and good will to 
all men, and the blessings and com- 
forts that are included in all that. 

We have in this organization a 
different spirit. We are not to be 
given the credit for having that 
especially : we did not devise it or 
send it here. Neither are our neigh- 
bors to be blamed because thev do 
not have it : a spirit, an impelling 
spirit, a spirit that constrains always 
to righteousness, and to the well- 
being of humanity and to the uplift- 
ing and upbuilding of righteousness 
in the earth. We are not entitled 
to the credit for that particulaly, an; 
more than we are entitled to credit 
if we follow it, but it is the Lord 
that has given it, that makes it dif- 
ferent from all other organizations. 

We have our organizations of the 
cmorums of the priesthood, which i c 
that much more than anv other or- 
ganization in the world has. Thev 
don't have them ; they are not to 
'he blamed for not having them be- 
cause thev didn't know about them. 
Man could not devise it and man 
has not devised it. NHther ou?ht 
we to be so much praised because 
we have it. because it is the Lord, T 
say again, that has given it to us, 
and it is His way of working thinsrs 
out. In addition we have our auxil- 
arv organizations, like the Relief 
Societv. What a splendid organiza- 
tion that is. how maenificent in its 
activity, how beautiful in its service 
and work among the poor, and 



among the sick ! The Lord gave it 
to us. Others have tried to copy 
after what the Lord has given and 
that is good, we are glad to see that, 
but the spirit that goes with this 
work, the world cannot give and the 
world cannot take away. The Lord 
has given it and so it makes the or- 
ganization better than anything the 
world has to offer. 

And so with our revenue system, 
our system of collecting revenue for 
the Church, the old way the Lord 
had ages ago, the same way, it is 
not anything new, but it is the 
Lord's way and we did not know 
about it, but the Lord revealed it to 
His servant the Prophet, and gave 
unto us a system of collecting the 
revenue for the sustenance of the 
Church, for the building of these 
temples that we hear about, for the 
spread of the Gospel, for the build- 
ing of meeting houses, for the main- 
taining of all the activities of the 
Church, and the Lord gave us that 
system different from anything else 
in all the world. Some of our 
neighbors are trying to copy after 
it and we are glad of that, but they 
don't srem to quite get it as we have, 
because, of course, the spirit of the 
thing in this organization is dif- 
ferent from the spirit of any other 
organization in the world. It is 
easy, perhaps, for a sculptor to make 
a clay model of a man, to make it 
perfect in form, but it is another 
thing altogether to breathe into its 
nostrils the breath of life, the life- 
giving spirit. That is a very dif- 
ferent proposition, and the Lord has 
empowered and given to this organ- 
ization, to this Church, that living 
spirit, that living force of power and 
potency that impels and constrains 
me and you to works of risrhteous- 
ness and to impart of our substance. 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY

We cannot call it sacrifice because 
it isn't any sacrifice. It is a law gen- 
eral in its nature, it applies to all. 
Not like the laws we have enacted 
in our government and in other gov- 
ernments, too, that apply to special 
individuals, individuals who have 
means, and does not apply to others 
who have not any means to speak of, 
but the Lord's law, the just law, is 
that all who receive the benefits of 
the Gospel shall sustain the Gospel 
by their means, shall sustain the 
Church. The widow at the wash 
tub, yes. She has the blessing of 
the temple, she has the blessing of 
the meeting house, she has the bless- 
ings of the Church in all that it can 
give ; the widow's mite is acceptable, 
and she may do more proportion- 
ately than we all ; yet she is expected 
to do, that is the Lord's law. Not 
so with man-made laws. They say 
one-half of one percent of the com- 
munity shall pay to support the 
blessings of good government, and 
the other 99 J /2 percent shall be 
exempt. The Lord's law is different 
from that. It applies to all alike, 
and so the rich pay according to 
their means and so the poor give 
according to their means, and all re- 
ceive equally the blessings of the 
house of the Lord. So it is a little 
different, don't you see, from any- 
thing else in the world. 

Another thing different from any 
of the organizations of our brethren 
on the outside is this, that if a man 
is doing the works of unrighteous- 
ness, although he may claim mem- 
bership in the Church, if he persists 
in his unrighteousness, no matter 
how rich he is or how powerful, or 
how great, or how much some may 
think the Church depends upon him, 
that man will be dealt with and 
dealt with quickly; he must cease 



his wickedness or his unrighteous- 
ness, and repent, and repentance 
means to stop it, quit doing the evil 
thing, or he will be dealt with, ex- 
communicated from the Church. 
Now I don't find that in many other 
organizations. I find men in good 
membership in other organizations 
who are known to be not living cor- 
rect lives, and they are not dealt 
with, they are let go. Now in this, 
we are a little different. This is 
the Lord's way of doing it, to bring 
me or you upstanding, so to speak, 
to demand of us that we keep the 
commandments of God and work 
the works of righteousness. 

Another thing that makes us 
distinctive and a little different from 
any others — and I am not finding' 
fault with any others, I am only try- 
ing to show you what the Lord has 
done, to count our many blessings, 
and show what the Lord has done 
for vou and for me, and for this 
organization — another thing,, this 
organization, in its spirit of help- 
fulness, tries to get the people to 
own their own homes, to get out of 
debt, and to stay out of debt, and so 
in consequence, in our community 
73% of all the Latter-dav Saints 
own their own homes. Now isn't 
that a good thing? Are not all of 
these activities that I have men- 
tioned good things? Are they hurt- 
ful, do they make for anything that 
is wrong and unrighteous No, no, 
they are all good, they are all bless- 
ings. 

We heard here from President 
Smith, in his opening remarks, of 
the wrvrk of the teachers of the 
ward, different from anything in the 
world. I challenge the attention of 
every one with respect to this mat- 
ter, that here, in this things that I 
have called attention to, in this 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



special thing als o of the work of the 
teachers, in this special thing of the 
work of our Relief Society, and in 
our revenue matters pertaining to 
the Church, in all these there is noth- 
ing like it in all the world. How 
beautiful the work of those teachers 
that the President so well explained 
to us yesterday morning ! Could 
anything be better? Could anything 
be more beautiful in giving assist- 
ance, the spirit of the helping hand 
and brotherly, and sisterly affection 
and love, to the brother or sister 
who needs it? Could there be any- 
thing better devised? Is there any 
other wav, has anybody in the world 
got anything like it to offer? No, 
no, of course not, and I say again, 
no one is to blame for that, because 
they have the best, the verv best that 
man could devise through all the 
ages, and I don't decry these 
churches of Protestantism. I take 
off my hat to Protestantism. I re- 
call, with gratitude and praise in my 
heart, how that the Protestants 
fought and suffered, and were per- 
secuted and worried, and contended 
with down through all the time of 
Knox and Luther, Cromwell and 
Wesley, Blake and Drake and all 
those firm Protestant people, war- 
ring against tyranny, against oo- 
pression, and against that which 
would be subversive of liberty and 
of the rights of man, and I am here 
today and you are here, in the en- 
joyment of liberty, because of the 
Protestant world that accomplished 
these results for us. Otherwise, we 
probably would not have been en- 
joying these liberties ; so all honor 
and praise to Protestantism. 

But when it comes to matters of 
religion, and organization of 
churches and so on, I repeat again 
they have the very best that man 



could devise, but here is something 
better, and I have shown you a few 
of the things that the Lord has 
added, which they have not got. In 
addition we have the spirit of the 
thing, the life-giving power, the 
Holy Ghost, they have not that, that 
has not been given to them. We 
see an elder of the Church taking a 
person down in the water to be bap- 
tized and, raising his right hand be- 
fore God, he says "having been com- 
missioned of Jesus Christ," — just let 
that sink in, — "having been com- 
missioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize 
you," etc. Who else has been com- 
missioned, what other organization? 
You cannot blame an organization 
that has not got it, we cannot take 
praise to ourselves because we have 
got it. It is the Lord that has given 
it to you and to me, and to this or- 
ganization, and all praise and glory 
and honor be to Him. So in all the 
organizations of the Church, I find, 
notwithstanding our weaknesses, 
and they are many, I find this spirit 
of helpfulness, this spirit or desire 
to be of service and of benefit to 
mankind. I do not believe that, as 
a people, our hearts are set alto- 
gether upon the things of the world. 
I believe that in the main our hearts 
are for the Church and Kingdom of 
God and His righteousness, that it 
mav be established in the earth, and 
that His work may spread. 

Now in assisting people, bishops 
of the different wards sometimes as- 
sist people to get a piece of land. As- 
sisting people, poor people who 
don't know so much, trying to teach 
them in the way that they should 
improve their stock, for example. 

In every way to try and help and 
be a benefit and a blessing. Can 
any one say that there is a single 
thing connected with all this that 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY 



93 



is bad, that ought to be uprooted 
and extirpated? I thought this 
morning when some of the brethren 
were saying, Brother Austin, from 
Bingham Stake, how well their 
neighbors and they got along to- 
gether, that they loved one another, 
they got along peaceably ; and why 
not, why shouldn't they? It is dif- 
ferent from a while ago, it is differ- 
ent even now where we are not 
known and understood, but the time 
is fast coming my brethren and sis- 
ters, when we are apt to get a little 
heady because of the things that 
the Lord has done for us, and take 
credit to ourselves, and outrank 
our neighbors so far that' we will 
feel perhaps a little above them. 
We ought to be careful of that feel- 
ing if we have anything, and we 
have so much that is different and 
so much better than all the world, 
we ought to always remember that 
it is the Lord that is giving it, that 
it is the Lord that is continuing it. 
This is not President Smith's work, 
or Joseph Smith the Prophet's 
work alone, that is to say, it is their 
work, of course, as it is your work 
and mine, but they didn't devise it, 
they didn't breath into its nostrils 
the breath of life, and give it that 
living, potent, powerful, helpful 
spirit. They didn't do it. They 
could not do it but the Lord has 
done it. 

Now of all these good things, and 
many more that I could mention if 
I only had time, can anyone say that 
any of these are bad? Can any- 
one in the world stand up and say 
that they have anything to compare 
with it in- the organizations of the 
world, or all of them put together? 
No, no thev hiven't. Well th°n, 
when Joseph Smith the prophet 
stated to those few people in Pal- 



myra, in 1820, that he had had a 
heavenly visitation, the Father and 
the Son, and that these results now 
have been brought about in conse- 
quence of that small or that great 
beginning did he. tell the truth or 
was it a lie ? when he stated that the 
Book of Mormon and those golden 
plates had been delivered to him, 
and the three witnesses to> the Book 
of Mormon stated that fact and 
published it to the world, was it 
true or was it false? Can it be pos- 
sible that an evil tree of falsehood, 
built upon falsehood and lies can 
produce such good and excellent 
fruit? If that is so, then the Savior 
of the world's words are false, be- 
cause His word is that an evil tree 
can not bring forth good fruit, 
and by their fruits ye shall know 
them. Men do not gather grapes 
of thorns nor figs from thistles; 
they do not come that way. So 
with all these good results, and so 
many more that I could stand here 
and point to you, I bear testimony 
that Joseph Smith the prophet, that 
the three witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon, that everything connected 
with the work of the Lord is true 
and not false. It is God's way of 
doing it. He is in the earth by the 
power of His Priesthood to accomp- 
lish these results and greater re- 
sults than these, for the time shall 
come as one of our brethren said 
this morning, when all will believe, 
when every knee shall bow and 
every tongue shall confess that Jesus 
is the Christ, — they will bow down 
and confess to this fact that Jesus 
is the Christ to the honor and glory 
of God the Father, which I humbly 
nray mav speedily come to pass for 
the Messing of mankind every- 
where, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 

(President of Wayne Stake.) 

It has been my privilege to be 
called to lift up my voice upon street 
corners, and in halls hired by the 
Latter-day Saints, in this and for- 
eign countries, to preach repentance 
to the people, and I never remember 
assuming this responsibility in my 
life without feeling a sense of hu- 
man weakness, but never have I felt 
that responsibility more than I feel 
it in facing this mighty congrega- 
tion this afternoon; but notwith- 
standing this feeling, my heart cries 
out : "Bless the Lord, O my soul, 
and all that is within me, bless and 
praise His holy name." These 
words of the psalmist are expressive 
of my feelings this afternoon, as 
nearly as I can express them, for the 
good things that the Lord has done 
for me and, doubtless, for hundreds 
of my brethren and sisters who are 
in this congregation this afternoon. 

I remember very well that when, 
as a lad of nineteen years of age, I 
first heard the message of the Gos- 
pel proclaimed by the elders of this 
Church in my native land, that my 
mind was beclouded and somewhat 
prejudiced, for at that tender age, 
I had read a great deal about so- 
called "Mormonism." I had read 
something about what the Christian 
Herald had to say upon the subject. 
I had read much from apostate 
"Mormons ;" but, unfortunately, up 
to that time I had read little or noth- 
ing in favor of the Latter-day 
Saints ; and, like many others, hav- 
ing been taught to believe in the 
traditions in the churches — that 
Bishop Nibley has alluded to this 
afternoon — or rather in the tenets 
of faith of the various churches, 
having read the kind of literature 
that I have referred to, you may 



know that my mind was deeply 
prejudiced, but I was very greatly 
impressed with the 13th article of 
the "Mormon" faith : 

"We believe in being honest, true, 
chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in 
doing good to all men. Indeed we 
may say that we follow the admoni- 
tion of Paul. We believe all things, 
we hope all things, we have endured 
many things and hope to be able to 
endure all things. If there is any- 
thing virtuous, lovely or of good 
report or praiseworthy, we seek 
after these things." 

Those words greatly impressed 
me. I knew that a people who had 
such ideals, who believed in such 
saving principles, could not be of the 
character that I had read they were, 
and on investigating I became ac- 
quainted with the truth that they 
were teaching, the plain, simple gos- 
pel that I had been seeking for from 
the earliest days of my childhood, 
but had never found to my satisfac- 
tion. It never occurred to me, my 
brethren and sisters, in my early 
youth, that it would be my privilege 
to find a church possessed of the 
gifts and blessings of the Gospel 
that were enjoyed in the primitive 
church, or of the doctrines as they 
were proclaimed in their perfection 
by the Son of God. 

Bishop Nibley this afternoon has 
referred to some of the reformers, 
and in thinking of their work, I am 
reminded that those honest men 
never made the claims that have 
since been made by the authorities 
of this Church. John Wesley never 
bore a testimony to the world such 
as the Prophet Joseph Smith pro- 
claimed. To the contrary, he taught 
the people according to the light, 
knowledge, and inspiration that he 
possessed from God, and we honor 
the memory of John Wesley, as we 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 



95 



honor the memory of other reform- 
ers, and those who have not been 
named this afternoon. You will re- 
member that John Wesley was the 
spokesman. He preached what he 
believed to be the Gospel, and that 
to the best of his understanding. He 
suffered much, as all good men have 
suffered for what they believed to 
be the truth that they taught to the 
people. Charles Wesley, his brother, 
was the poet, and in many of his 
poems he expressed the feelings not 
only of himself, but of his brother 
and those who believed in the doc- 
trines that they advocated. I re- 
member that there is to be found in 
our hymn book one of the poems of 
Charles Wesley, and in speaking of 
the days of the primitive church, in 
reviewing conditions that then ob- 
tained, he was led to give expres- 
sion to these words, thinking of the 
time when men held the authority to 
speak and to act in God's name, that 
Brother Nibley has referred to this 
afternoon, when men go forth 
clothed in the authority of the holy 
priesthood, to call people to repent- 
ance, and if they repent with all 
their hearts and come to God with a 
contrite heart and a broken spirit, 
they are endowed with the authority 
to lead them into the waters of bap- 
tism and, in the name of Messiah, 
to baptize them for the remission of 
their sins. I think that Charles 
Wesley was thinking of that day 
when he said : 

"Oh, what an age of golden days, 
Oh, what a choice, peculiar race, 
Washed in the Lamb's atoning blood, 
Anointed kings and priests to God." 

He seemed to have had something 
of the inspiration of the Spirit, and 
what it meant to men and woman 
when the priesthood was enjoyed 



by men upon the earth ; and further, 
he realized that that power no 
longer existed with men upon earth. 
He realized that people were not 
living in that golden age, that they 
were not enjoying the apostolic 
blessings, hence, in looking around 
in the world, in reviewing the con- 
ditions, in thinking of the various 
religious denominations that ex- 
isted, he said: 

"Where shall we wander now to find 
Successors they have left behind? 
The faithful whom we seek in vain 
Are 'minished from the sons of men." 

Oh, what a confession for a man 
of this character to make! If there 
were time, and we could review 
some of the writings, we would find 
that John Wesley and his brother, 
and hosts of believers looked for- 
ward in fond hope to a day dawning 
when the fulness of gospel light 
should shine upon men. 

My brethren and sisters, we are 
living in that glorious age and dis- 
pensation, the time foretold that 
was predicted by the prophets. We 
are enjoying the blessings of the 
Church of God that has been estab- 
lished upon the earth. We have been 
gathered, hundreds of us, as one of 
a family and two of a city, and the 
Lord has brought us up to Zion. He 
has established our feet in these 
valleys of the mountains. He has 
given us the opportunities that have 
so beautifully been portrayed during 
this conference. I wonder if we are 
making the best of our opportuni- 
ties. Reference has been made to 
the conditions that now obtain in 
Europe, to the strife and contention 
that now prevail. Is it not possible 
that, had it not been for the saving 
power of God, had it not been that 
the Gospel of the Redeemer appeal-

ed to you and me, we should have 
been today where many of our rela- 
tives are, engaged in that terrible 
conflict ; but instead we are here en- 
gaged in the work of the Lord, a 
work of peace, a work of righteous- 
ness, a work of love, a work that 
brings joy to our hearts as we wake 
in the morning and as we close our 
eyes in slumber at night. When I 
think of all these things, my broth- 
ers and sisters, my heart is full, to 
overflowing, of gratitude to God for 
His loving kindness to me and to 
His people. 

I deem the privilege of being a 
member of the Church of Jesus, 
Christ of Latter-day Saints the 
greatest honor that could possibly 
come to me in this life, and the Lord 
knows that I feel grateful that I 
have been counted worthy to bear 
a portion of His priesthood, to be 
associated with my brethren who 
are willing to make sacrifice for the 
work of God. My heart goes out 
in love and admiration for these 
men who are willing to give of their 
time and their substance to bear 
witness of the truth to the nations. 
I love these presidents of missions. 
I love the missionaries who are in 
the world carrying the message of 
salvation, in their weakness, to the 
people; for they will find many 
among the children of men such as 
you and I, who are willing to be im- 
pressed with the truth when they 
hear it, who know the voice of the 
true shepherd and who respond to 
that voice, for they are of the seed 
of Abraham, as referred to this 
morning, of the blood of Israel, and 
all they are waiting for is an oppor- 
tunity to hear and receive the truth. 
It is a glorious privilege, my 
brethren and sisters, to be associated 
with a prophet of God, with apostles 



of the Lord Jesus Christ, endowed 
with power and authority from on 
high, and with men and women 
who love God above all other things, 
and delight to keep His command- 
ments. 

I bear you witness that I know 
that my Father in heaven responds 
to every seeking soul. I know that 
every man and woman who will seek 
the Lord in earnestness, with a de- 
sire to know the way of right, will 
be led into the paths of righteous- 
ness. I know by experience that 
God is no respecter of persons, but 
that out of all nations and among 
all peoples, He gives liberally of His 
Spirit to all who seek Him and de- 
sire to do the things that are right. 
I know that the Lord is working in 
the hearts of the children of men 
just as powerfully today as ever be- 
fore in all the history of men. I 
believe that the Lord is doing just 
as marvelous things today as He 
ever did at any time since Father 
Adam commenced the great work 
in this world. I believe it because 
of the things that I see and the 
things that I hear, and because of 
the feelings that are in my own soul. 
The Lord is doing His work in such 
a way that unless we are in touch 
with the inspiration of His Spirit, 
perhaps we are not cognizant of the 
marvelous changes that are taking 
place ; but in the events that are 
transpiring every day, I see the ful- 
fillment of prophecies ; I see that 
God is bringing to pass His pur- 
poses, and I rejoice in this work. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, 
that we may heed the kindly coun- 
sels that have been given to us dur- 
ing this conference ; for I know that 
a man who will listen to and obey 
the counsel of the servants of God 
and the inspirations of the Holy 



ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL.

Spirit, to which he is entitled, as he 
does the will of God, he will be 
blessed and have joy in this life, and 
glory, immortality and eternal in- 
crease will be added to him in the 
world to come. There is no reason 
why we should mourn over the past. 
There is opportunity for us in the 
future. Let us find today wherein 
we have failed, wherein we have 
been weak, wherein we have not 
followed always the dictation of our 
conscience. Let us, from this day 
henceforth and forever, seek to be 
diligent in the service of God, and 
in the end we shall have salvation in 
His presence. That God may grant 
us this boon and blessing in the 
world that is to come, and that we 
may have joy while we live, I hum- 
bly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER OLEEN N. S'TOHL. 

(President of Box Elder Stake.) 

I sincerely pray that the Lord will 
bless me while I attempt to speak 
to you for a few moments. I need 
not say to you that I feel my weak- 
ness and dependence upon the Lord 
in standing before you, but I know 
that this is our Father's work, and 
that we are engaged in His service, 
and I know that He has been with 
us, and that He has blessed us thus 
far during our conference, and that 
He will continue to bless us. 

I was reminded, while Bishop 
Nibley was addressing us, of a state- 
ment made by President Welling at 
the dedication of the Bear River 
Stake Tabernacle. He said, in the 
course of his remarks, that since the 
organization of the Bear River 
Stake, some six years ago, that they 
had expended in that stake for 
meetinghouses and tabernacle, and 



other church houses erected for the 
blessing of the people, some eighty 
thousand dollars, and he testified 
before the people who were assem- 
bled on that occasion, that the peo- 
ple of that stake were better off 
financially, and enjoying more of the 
spiritual blessings of the Lord at 
that particular time than ever be- 
fore. In other words, there were 
none of them who were poorer be- 
cause of their willingness to take 
of their means and use them for the 
upbuilding of the work of the Lord. 
And I began to think of our own 
stake. The Bear River stake was 
largely taken from the Box Elder 
stake. In fact if we go back to the 
early history of the Box Elder stake, 
I can say that it was wholly taken 
from the Box Elder stake. I began 
to make a little calculation to see 
what the Box Elder stake had ex- 
pended for meetinghouses and other 
church edifices during the past ten 
years, and I found that we had ex- 
pended in the neighborhood of 
ninety thousand dollars in similar 
improvements to those referred to 
by President Welling. And I want 
to bear testimony, brethren and sis- 
ters, that the people of Box Elder 
stake are not poorer because they 
have done this, but better off. And 
this was clone in addition to the pay- 
ment of their tithes and offerings. 
The Lord has poured out His bless- 
ings upon them and they are more 
prosperous than they ever were be- 
fore. 

I remember at the time that two 
or three of our wards were building 
their meetinghouses and making im- 
provements that ran up into a con- 
siderable sum of money. At the 
close of the year the bishops re- 
ported that the people had paid 
more tithing that year than any 
previous year, so it showed again 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that the Lord poured out His bless- 
ings upon the people ; and while 
they were willing to take of their 
means for the upbuilding of the 
Church, they were also willing to 
observe the law of tithing and did 
better than they had done formerly. 
I know, my brethren and sisters, 
from my experience, that when we 
are willing to serve the Lord and 
to use our means for the upbuilding 
of His kingdom, that He will pour 
out His blessings upon us. 

I am thankful for the testimony I 
have of this work. I am reminded 
of the words of the Savior and was 
reminded of them, and have been 
during this conference, wherein He 
said : "My doctrine is not mine, but 
His that sent me. If any man will 
do His will, he shall know of the 
doctrine whether it is of God or 
whether I speak of myself." Now 
that is our privilege ; that saying ap- 
plies to us. If we will do the will 
of the Father we shall know the 
doctrine, and know whether it is of 
Him or of man, and the gratifying 
thing connected with this is that 
those who have tried the doctrines 
and the laws, by living them, they 
are the ones who can testify that 
they know that the doctrines are of 
God. That testimony has come to 
you and to me, and we know that 
the doctrines of the kingdom of our 
Father can be tested in this way, 
and that is very gratifying to us. 
We are not dependent upon man 
or men, simply dependent upon our 
own humble obedience and right- 
eous living, and the blessings of our 
Heavenly Father. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
feel this way, that while we are en- 
joying all of these blessings, many 
of us laying up treasures upon 
earth, we must not let our hearts 
be so fixed upon the earthly treas- 



ures that we will forget God who 
has given them to us, but if we will 
use our treasures for the upbuilding 
of our Father's kingdom, and there- 
by lay up treasures in heaven, the 
peace and power and blessing of 
God will abide with us, and we will 
have that living testimony within 
our hearts that we will daily and 
hourly know that this is our 
Father's work. I rejoice in the spir- 
itual things of the kingdom. While 
we are dealing with the material 
things, we are also in daily touch 
and contact with the spiritual things, 
and I want to say that I know that 
the signs follow the believers, that 
the blessings promised through obe- 
dience to the Gospel follow the be- 
lievers, just as much today as at any 
time. I feel to praise the Lord be- 
cause I know that my life through 
His blessing and power was spared, 
and as one of my brethren said to 
me today, I was given a new lease 
of life of the Lord. 

Now I feel that it is not my priv- 
ilege to take up your time. I re- 
joice in the work of God; and I 
know that it gives that joy to us that 
we cannot obtain in any other call- 
ing or labor. Let us go forth and 
serve our Maker, and let our hearts 
be centered upon Him and upon His 
work, and upon helping our fellow 
men, and serve them and bless them, 
and if we will do this, our Father 
will bless us. 

May His peace and blessings con- 
tinue to abide with our leaders, with 
those who preside over us, and all 
who labor for His cause, whether 
it be at home or abroad, is my hum- 
ble prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A contralto solo, entitled, "A 
World of Love," was sung by Sister 
Mabel Cooper.

ELDER SERGE F. BALIFF. 

(President of Cache Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I have faced policemen in Germany, 
Austria and Hungary, but I do not 
believe that I trembled so much as 
I tremble this afternoon in standing 
before you ; and I hope and trust 
that the Lord will bless me with His 
spirit, that I may be enabled to say 
a few suitable words this after- 
noon. I appreciate more than I am 
able to say my standing in the 
Church of Christ. I have a testi- 
mony burning in my bosom that 
tells me that this is indeed the work 
of God, that God is directing His 
work here upc?n the earth. 

I am pleased and honored to say 
that I reside in the Cache Stake of 
Zion. We have many things there 
to be thankful for. I don't know 
of a valley in all the world, that I 
have visited, that is so blessed as 
Cache Valley. You only need to 
ride through the country and see 
our crops, the bounteous harvest. 
The people are being blessed on 
every hand. The Lord is blessing 
the earth for their sakes ; and I do 
hope and pray that the people will 
appreciate the great blessings that 
the Lord is pouring out upon them. 

We are farming in Cache Valley 
scientifically. We have a fine lot of 
educated farmers; they are raising 
splendid crops of beets, and grain ; 
and when you compare the condi- 
tion of the farmer of today with that 
of twenty years ago, I say that we 
have a great deal to be proud of 
and grateful for. 

The conditions that have brought 
about the blessings that we are en- 
joying today, in a great measure, 
come through those great institu- 
tions that have been established in 
our valley, the Agricultural College 



and the Brigham Young College. 
Those two institutions are doing a 
wonderful work in educating our 
young men and young women in 
farming and dairying. As has been 
stated today, this is the temporal 
part of the building up of the king- 
dom of God upon the earth, and I 
deem it as one of the essential 
features of this great work. 

We look with pride to the presi- 
dents of those colleges ; they are do- 
ing a splendid work. We have pro- 
fessors in those institutions who 
come from many parts of this great 
nation, and I want to say to you that 
when these men leave our institu- 
tions, they are better men than they 
were when they came there. The 
spirit of the Gospel is impressed 
upon the students of those institu- 
tions, and they go from our city 
filled with the spirit of faith in the 
gospel. In a great degree they are 
being taught scientific principles, but 
they naturally partake of the spir- 
itual influences that are to be found 
in our city. I am very thankful for 
this. I am very thankful, my 
brethren and sisters, for the good 
support that these college men are 
giving us in our state. I want to 
say to the people who are sending 
their children to Logan to be 
schooled, that we have a system 
there, in all of our wards, whereby 
our young men and young women 
can be looked after, to become ac- 
tive in the organizations of the 
Church. Whether they be of Latter- 
day Saint parents or not, we are 
looking after their best interests. 

T was very favorably impressed 
this morning with the remarks of 
one of the mission presidents, when 
he spoke of a young man who was 
preaching the gospel on a street cor- 
ner in some eastern city, and he said 
that he was a poor boy. His mother, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I believe he said, was a widow, and 
the boy scarcely knew where the 
next meal was coming from, at the 
same time, he said, that when he 
stood before the congregation he 
was fearless, and bore a marvelous 
testimony of the Gospel. I want to 
say to the Latter-day Saints my ex- 
perience has been that when you 
send your boys out into the mission 
field, ■ if you will clothe them with 
the Spirit of God, the spirit of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, and let them 
leave their money at home, let them 
go into the mission field depending 
upon the Lord, that they will be 
blessed and they will give the Lord 
an opportunity to bless them, they 
will give the Lord an opportunity 
to show them what they can accom- 
plish if they will put their trust in 
Him. I am an advocate, and be- 
lieve in the first principle as our 
fathers did, to go unto the nations 
of the earth and trust in the Lord, 
and go without money and without 
price. I have demonstrated beyond 
all question of doubt that the Lord 
can and will take care of our young 
men. He will take care of us when 
we go into the world to represent 
Him. 

I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord may continue with us. May 
we be united in our supplications to 
the Lord that He will bless our 
prophet, that He will bless all those 
who are called to preside over this 
great work here upon the earth, this 
is my prayer and I ask it in the 
name of the Lord, Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 

(President of Deseret Stake.) 

I sincerely pray, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord will calm my 
spirit, and let His Spirit rest upon 
me for the few moments that I may 



stand before you. I ask myself the 
question why should I so fear and 
tremble, and I cannot answer 
further than to say that I sense, 
measurably at least, the great re- 
sponsibility that rests upon me when 
I stand up to take the attention of 
this vast audience. One thing I can 
do, and perhaps that is all that is 
necessary upon this occasion, is to 
bear testimony to the divinity of this 
great work. I cannot remember 
the time, and never in my life have 
been perplexed with any doubts as 
to the divinity of this work ; in har- 
mony with the teachings of a good 
father and a good mother, who from 
my childhood up taught me that this 
was the work of God, and that if I 
was a prayerful, humble boy, the 
Lord would manifest to my spirit 
the truthfulness of their testimony. 
I believed them, and the Lord has 
given me that testimony. He gave 
it to me before I went abroad, called 
as a missionary to proclaim the 
Gospel. 

Now I am very happy, in my visit 
at this conference, to have with me 
my son, a boy of twenty years of 
age, who stands up to his father's 
height, and looks me in the face and 
says : "Father, I am glad that I am 
here to be blessed and set apart to 
go and bear testimony, as you have 
borne before, to the nations of the 
earth that this is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ." When asked, "Wouldn't 
you rather go to some English- 
speaking people than to go to far-off 
New Zealand?" "No," he said, "I 
would rather go where the Lord 
wishes me to go, for He knows 
where I can accomplish the best 
work." 

I was delighted with this spirit, 
and I thought when Brother Austin 
stood here and bore his testimony, 



ELDER ALONZOA. HINCKLEY. 



101 



and testified of the faith of his 
father, and of the teachings of his 
father and mother who received the 
gospel in the world, I shed tears of 
joy as I sat there and listened to 
that humble testimony, and I blessed 
the name of my father. My father 
never could stand up and preach the 
Gospel with any degree of elo- 
quence, but with his wives and chil- 
dren, he taught them the Gospel, he 
bore testimony to them, and he had 
them grow up to pray, and to lead 
clean lives, and to seek the Lord and 
keep His commandments. Oh, it is 
my hope that my life shall be worthy 
of such a sire, worthy of such a 
mother, that when I shall have fin- 
ished my work, and I shall appear 
before my father, that I can say, 
"Father I have cherished the testi- 
mony, I have lived the principles of 
the Gospel as you taught me, and 
after you left, as the Spirit of the 
Lord has led me, I have followed 
in your footprints." And then I 
want to be able to say further: 
"Now father, that your sons and 
daughters have gathered with you, 
and your family unit is complete, I 
hope also that I can bear testimony 
that my sons and daughters, with 
their good mother, are following : 
we have faith and reason to believe 
that thev will come also, and then 
our haooiness will be complete." I 
cannot conceive of anvthing that can 
minister to our happiness so com- 
pletely as to see our sons and daugh- 
ters in their dailv life manifest that 
they have full faith in God, that 
thev are not led off after the things 
of the worH, but that thev prize the 
Gnsnel and the truths thereof above 
all things else, and that thev fear 
not in the face of men to stand up 
and bear testimony of the divinity 
of this great work. 



I feel happy when I think of my 
associations. I delight to bear testi- 
mony concerning the good men with 
whom I associate, and I say, as has 
been said in this conference, look at 
the fruits of the gospel. It has been 
our experience recently, in the Des- 
eret stake of Zion, in visiting the 
priesthood, to call the men together 
and catechize them, to question 
them in every quorum, and we find 
the high priests, seventies, elders, 
priests, teachers and deacons, all 
working faithfully in the Church 
and kingdom of God. We discover 
that they prav, that their lives are 
clean, and that they are morally 
clean in every way; they are ob- 
servers of the word of wisdom, and 
accept it as the word of the Lord. 
The fruits of "Mormonism" sur- 
rounds us in men of this kind, in 
fathers and mothers of this kind. 
We discover, bv careful examina- 
tion, that the officers of auxiliary 
organizations are also leading ex- 
emplary lives. What else can we 
have them than the best of men and 
women? Why should we be aston- 
ished to find men and women such 
as these stand up and bear testimony 
that this is the work of God. that the 
Lord has spoken from the heavens, 
that He has restored His everlasting 
fospel. and that He has established 
His priesthood : that men soeak in 
the name of the Lord, and that it 
comes to us with the same weight, 
authority and significance as though 
the Lord Himself has spoken, for 
thev soeak as thev are moved upon 
bv the Snirit of God. 

The Lord help us to appreciate 
all that we have, and to live worthy 
to receiv the Klessines that He has 
in store for us, I pray in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Commending faithful services and 
worth of Stake Presidents. 

We have had the honor of listen- 
ing to a few of the good and great 
men from among the seventy-two, 
who stand at the head of that many 
stakes of Zion. Surely the sheep in 
the folds over which these good 
shepherds preside cannot take any 
hurt if they will listen to the counsel 
and drink freely of the spirit mani- 
fested here by the men who preside 
over them, as we have heard and 
witnessed by their fervent spirit and 
powerful testimonies borne to us 
during this conference. For my own 
part I cannot but express the sin- 
cerest gratitude of my soul for such 
men; and from the depths of my 
heart I bless them and invoke the 
blessing of Almighty God upon 
them. We will not be able to hear, 
from all of these good men, but we 
propose to hear from as many of 



them as the time will permit, and 
we would like our brethren of the 
presidencies of the stakes to make 
up their minds to be called upon. 
They do not know where the call 
will hit, nor who will come next; 
but we would like them to be in pos- 
session of the spirit of their calling 
and ministry so that when they come 
up here to address the conference, 
they can express themselves as those 
have clone who have already spoken 
to us. God bless the people who 
dwell under the watch-care of these 
good men and help them to humble 
themselves before them and be sub- 
missive to the counsel and direction 
of their leaders. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Let 
the Mountains Shout for joy." 

Elder George E. Stoddard pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference was adjourned until 
10 a. m., Wednesday, Oct. 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Wednesday, 
October 6th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel, our 
only delight." 

The opening prayer was by Elder 
William H. Smart. 

The choir sang the hymn, "High 
on the mountain top." 

PREST. SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I want to make a confession. I 
find myself a little bit lame, through 
carelessness. In trying to catch a 
car last night I was thrown off my 
feet, and a sprained ankle resulted. 
I am reminded of what my father 
said : "Never allow yourself to get 
careless. Wherever you are, and 
wherever you go, remember to be 
careful, take in the situation around 
you, watch and guard every avenue 
of danger so that no accident may 
happen to you, if you will do this 
through life, you will be free from 
hurt." I have considered that very 
good advice for me to follow all my 
life ; but I missed the car, however, 
and limped clown to the theatre, 
where I enjoyed the opera given by 
the Emma Lucy Gates Company. I 
must say to you that I enjoyed one 
of the best musical treats that I have 
witnessed for many a day. I se- 
cured a seat near the orchestra 
where I could hear and see all the 
fine points of the vocal and instru- 



mental music, and was amply repaid 
for my painful experience in limp- 
ing to the theatre. 

I was happily reminded of the 
builder of that great institution of 
amusement, President Brigham 
Young. When I saw and heard his 
grand-daughter and the talented 
company that gave her support, in 
that beautiful production of the 
opera taken from Camille, the great 
French play which President Young 
used to enjoy so much. T was re- 
minded of old times, and thoughts 
and memories came welling up in 
my heart and brain. I almost fan- 
cied I could see President Young, 
President Kimball, and President 
Wells, in their accustomed seats, 
witnessing the beautiful plays on 
that dear old stage. President 
Young understood the wants of his 
people. In constructing this house 
of amusement, he said that the peo- 
ple had seen too many serious 
phases of life, had witnessed so 
many sad scenes in their drivings 
and journeyings from city to city, 
and from state to state, finally mak- 
ing the difficult exodus across the 
plains, and enduring privations here 
for several years, being short of 
food and the necessaries of life. He 
deemed it very proper to give the 
people an opportunity to see the 
pleasant side of life and he gave 
them a chance to witness on the 
mimic stage less serious phases of 
existence, providing places for them 
to dance and to enjoy social life with 
each other. Those social gatherings, 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as well as the theatres, I well re- 
member, were opened by prayer, by 
a servant of the Lord stepping forth 
upon the stage of the theatre, or 
upon the musicians' platform in the 
ball room, before tne play or ball 
began, and praying before the Lord 
that the influence of His Spirit 
might be present and prompt those 
who acted upon the mimic stage, or 
those who danced, that their 
thoughts and actions might be clean 
and pure, and that this recreation 
might be a reminder of things that 
were good, and bring happy enjoy- 
ment of the specially selected plays 
rendered in a proper manner. T 
must say that, if Brigham Young 
were present, he would have been 
pleased with the rendition of that 
beautiful music, both vocal and in- 
strumental, under the direction, and 
participated in, by one of his grand- 
daughters, ably assisted by a com- 
pany of bright young men and 
women. The orchestra was effi- 
ciently led by her brother, Cecil 
Gates. 

I am very glad to say that I am 
enjoying the spirit of this confer- 
ence. I am in accord with the re- 
marks of President Smith and his 
counselors, and all those that have 
spoken. I endorse the remarks of 
President Smith in regard to the 
welfare of the people, educationally ; 
and I am in accord with every effort 
that is made to maintain the prestige 
of our Church schools. T see the 
necessity for them, as the authorities 
do, and I agree with them that it is 
better for us to represent ourselves 
and the principles that we love, the 
principles of the gospel, in a proper 
manner before our children, while 
their minds are in a condition to ab- 
sorb true principles. Let the pure 
principles of the gospel be taught 



them in our Church schools, the 
Latter-day Saint high schools and 
colleges. I am glad to know that 
the University of Utah has become 
one of the leading institutions of 
learning in the West. I had the 
privilege of attending school in the 
old Council House, that stood on the 
corner where the Deseret News 
Building now stands. In that little 
stone and adobe building the uni- 
versity was begun. Orson Spencer 
was the chancellor or president of 
the university, as well as chief in- 
structor, Orson Pratt. W. W. 
Phelps, and others were instructors 
also, and members of the regency, 
and as best they could with the fa- 
cilities they had, they conducted the 
institution. I had the pleasure of 
attending the university when it was 
advanced still [further. D*-. Park 
was then at the head of the univer- 
sity, and the Doctors Benedict were 
instructors in chemistry and physi- 
ology ; Dr. Bellieve was the profes- 
sor of languages. There was at this 
time marked improvement over 
former years, because of improved 
facilities. Today, I am glad to say, 
it stands high among the institutions 
of this western country ; and when I 
consider the efforts that are being 
made for progress in every educa- 
tional department that this people 
arc concerned in, my heart rejoices 
at the success we are making. 

The L. D. S. Hospital had a very 
small beginning. It was first called 
the Deseret Hospital and was lo- 
cated in a large adobe building, op- 
posite the Sixteenth Ward square, 
where the University of Utah was 
established later. This building was 
occupied as a hotel by David Wilkin, 
a partner of mine in the handcart 
missionary company. We started 
an institution to relieve suffering

humanity, and did the best we could 
to make an institution where peo- 
ple could be cared for who were 
maimed or ill. The Dr. Groves' 
L. D. S. Hospital, is a credit to any 
people and to any country ; and I am 
glad to say this of all the institutions 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

I was pleased to be reminded, in 
the prayer this morning, of our priv- 
ilege of voting to establish temples, 
one in Canada and at this confer- 
ence, one upon the Island of Oahu. 
This is in keeping with the progress 
of the work of the Lord, in provid- 
ing for the spiritual education of the 
living, also for the development of 
those great principles which shall 
reach through time and beyond the 
vale, for the welfare of Zion, and 
her children, for the blessing of the 
living and redemption of the dead. 
This in fulfillment of the promise 
made by the Angel Moroni to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, when he 
said, the Lord will send Elijah, the 
Prophet, and he shall turn the hearts 
of the children to the fathers and 
the hearts of the fathers to the chil- 
dren. That promise was fulfilled 
literally in the Kirtland Temple, for 
the Prophet records that he, in com- 
pany with one of his chosen elders, 
prayed at the altar of the Kirtland 
Temple, and the Savior appeared 
to them and declared that He was 
their advocate with the Father. 
Then came Moses, committing to 
the Prophet the dispensation of the 
fathering of Israel ; and Elias, com- 
mitting the dispensation of the Gos- 
pel; and then came Elijah, the 
Prophet, fulfilling the promise that 
he would come and turn the hearts 
of the children to the fathers, and 
the hearts of the fathers to the chil- 
dren. I rejoice today in the pros- 
pects that are before the Latter-day 



Saints. When I look around and 
see the many blessings that have 
been given to us in this year of our 
Lord, in the way of bounteous har- 
vest, and in the encouragement the 
people have received to pay their 
tithes and their offerings ; I see a 
time of prosperity before this people 
such as they have never known, if 
they shall prove faithful and true to 
(he trust committed to them. 

I was very much pleased not long . 
ago when one of my grandsons, the 
fifth generation from my grand- 
father, John Young, who had just 
returned from Camas. He had gone 
over to Camas, immediately his 
school closed, in search of work, 
and he had a very good position 
given him. He was manager, clerk, 
and operator in loading and unload- 
ing a hay wagon for thirty days, 
earning two dollars a day. When 
he came home, he said, "Grandpa, 
I want to pay my tithing. W r here 
shall I go? We haven't located yet 
in a ward since we came from the 
canyon." Someone has said, in 
criticism of this people and their 
doctrines, the doctrines of the 
Gospel, "Oh, you just wait till the 
third, fourth and fifth generation 
come along and you will find that 
faith has gone out of the hearts of 
your children and your grand chil- 
dren." It is not so, for I find faith 
existing in the hearts of our chil- 
dren today, bright and untarnished : 
and there is more faith, and greater 
numbers are evidencing that faith 
in the midst of this people, than ever 
before. And so it will be if we shall 
do our part, perform our full duties, 
in teaching our children in the pure 
love of God and the Gospel of His 
dear Son. Thus enabling them to 
recognize the light of truth and the 
right.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I do not in this matter wish to be 
understood to have any censure for 
our district schools, for the high 
schools, for our splendid Univer- 
sity of Utah, they are in their 
proper place and they are doing- 
great good. But I wish to encour- 
age the thought that our Latter-day 
Saint schools are very necessary for 
in them our children are taught to 
receive, in their youthful and in- 
nocent minds, the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, in 
closing I bear testimony to you that 
the Gospel is true, that this Church 
has the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that 
Joseph Smith was a true prophet, 
and that those who preside over the 
Church today are men God has 
chosen to preside over His people, 
and I say may God bless them for- 
ever, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

"How beautiful upon the mountains 
arc the feet of him that bringeth 
good tidings, that publisheth peace; 
that bringeth good tidings of good, 
that publisheth salvation; that saith 
unto Zion, Thy God reigneth." 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the 
voice; with the voice together shall 
they sing: For they shall see eye to 
eye, when the Lord shall bring again 
Zion." 

These words of the poet Prophet, 
Isaiah, came to my mind frequently 
during this conference, when hear- 
ing the testimony of our brethren 
as to the increase in membership and 
faith, and integrity and loyalty of 
our people, of their growth in tem- 
poral things, of the prominence that 
we have among our friends for 



everything that goes for the uplift 
of humanity, and for the conserva- 
tion of social virtues. And my heart 
was made to rejoice because I felt 
that Isaiah, in these words, was 
prophesying of this very time and 
day, and in prophetic vision had 
seen the Saints gathered in the tops 
of the mountains, had heard the re- 
ports of the brethren relative to 
Zion, which God has brought again 
and established for the last time. 

During the past season we have 
had, as reported, a great many visit- 
ors, and it has been my privilege 
in common with many of my breth- 
ren, to meet not only the leaders of 
our own state, but the leaders among 
men of affairs in this country and 
from the nations abroad. It was 
my high honor recently to become a 
member of several conventions, 
among which was the International 
Irrigation Congress. We held sev- 
eral sessions in the Sacramento and 
San Joaquin valleys, and then one 
in San Francisco, at the great Pan- 
ama-Pacific International Exposi- 
tion. It added to my faith to sit 
under the teachings of world re- 
nowned men day after day, to learn 
that in their ideals and striving after 
that which will benefit mankind 
most, they were following in the 
wake of the leaders of Zion. Men 
were present to this Congress from 
Australia, from New Zealand, from 
Hindoostan even, from China, and 
from the Dominion of Canada. 
Representative men of our own gov- 
ernment, whcuhad been sent abroad 
to look into the civil and sociological 
conditions of Ireland, of France, of 
Germany and of Italy and to studv 
their modes of co-operation and 
community growth, brought home 
the knowledge thus gained to the 
United States, to enable our people 



ELDERJOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



107 



to foster their best interests, to con- 
seve the strength, and the manhood 
and virtue of her people, and to 
husband her finances by the sub- 
jugation of the soil, etc. 

To find that these men in their 
ideals, as I have said, were follow- 
ing in the wake of the leaders of 
Israel, made my heart rejoice and 
sing for the testimony of the truth 
it brought to me. I learned again 
that God is with His people, that He 
led them in the beginning of our 
history, that it was no chance at all 
that a modern Moses struck his 
plow share into the barren soil of the 
West here, and married the waters 
to the land, and made of this wil- 
derness a garden of the Lord where 
"joy and peace, thanksgiving and 
the voice of melody" is found. I 
learned again that the spirit of co- 
operation and bf ithe building orf 
communities for the conservation of 
social virtues, for fostering of the 
drama, the school and the church, 
that they commend as essentially 
necessary for the growth of Amer- 
ica, and for the proper redemption 
of the soil, and to turn away from 
the cities the thousands of men and 
women that become there "the 
slaves of clock and bell and pris- 
oners of walled up streets," was the 
very methods that established our 
people in this land and made our 
little towns and villas and cities 
appear "like apples of gold in a plat- 
ter of silver" held in the hands of 
plenty. It was an inspiration to me 
to hear these men say how they 
"must get nearer the colonist," and 
they "must studv his interests," 
"must see that land is procured at a 
more reasonable rate, that interest 
shall not be so heavy, a longer time 
for payment given," and that in 
this they are looking abroad for the 
best of the land, for the best men 



and women, the men of heart and 
blood as well as of mind and educa- 
tion, men who love mother earth, 
and nursing deeply from her pre- 
cious and luscicous breast, shall re- 
ceive full and rich compensation for 
their trust and toil. They will wel- 
come the laboring classes, from 
Europe to America, and will assume 
the necessity of caring for them 
after they have been planted upon 
the soil ; for we learn that the origi- 
nal purchaser has in most instances 
made a failure, and it is the second 
and third settler who has made a 
success of farming. 

We learn that as the cities have 
increased from sixteen to twenty- 
two per cent in population during 
the last decade, that in the country 
our increase has been but four per 
cent, so they are saying to you, "we 
must seek after the immigrant and, 
feel after him, look after the 
colonist, and nurse him, and not let 
interest abate just so soon as he 
has purchased a piece of ground. 
How familiar 'this doctrine must 
be to the ears of my aged brethren 
and sisters who were found by the 
Gospel in the old world, and were 
brought to this land by the "perpet- 
ual immigration fund," had their 
feet planted here upon the soil, then 
were nursed tenderly and carefully 
until they in turn were able to help 
care for themselves and aid others. 
In all these things, in all these 
avenues and vocations of trade men- 
tioned by our leading men at our 
recent congress, I found an added 
testimony to the worth, integrity 
and divine guidance of the prophets 
of God. 

May the Lord guide us to His 
praise, and deliver us from evil, and 
enable us to recognize His hand in 
all things, that we shall keep the 
faith, and when we have finished 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our labors in earth have the same 
acknowledged by our Father, and 
be crowned with eternal lives in His 
presence, I pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER ORVIL L. THOMPSON. 

(President of Millard Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I hope 
that I may enjoy that same good 
spirit that has been enjoyed so 
abundantly by our brethren, as they 
have occupied this position during 
the sessions of this conference. My 
testimony has been strengthened 
and my faith increased in listening 
to the counsels and the testimony 
of those who have spoken in this 
conference, and I have felt that it 
is gcod to be here. 

T have been impressed most deep- 
ly by the comparisons that were 
made in the preceding session of the 
conference by Bishop Nibley, his 
statement of the activities and the 
spirit that characterizes the work of 
the Latter-day Saints as compared 
with others. As he spoke, the words 
of the Lord as they were given 
ancient Israel came to my mind, 
wherein He said, as He was prepar- 
ing His ancient people that they 
might inherit the land that had been 
promised to them, He used these 
words : "Thou art a holy people 
unto the Lord thy God, and the 
Lord has chosen thee to be a pe- 
culiar people unto Himself above 
the nations that live upon the 
earth." I thought that latter-day 
Israel is measuring up to the stand- 
ard that was set by the Lord for 
ancient Israel before they entered 
into their inheritance. The bishop 
made comparison of the forms and 
ceremonies of the latter-day work 



and those who have tried to copy, 
in a degree, some of these ordin- 
ances and forms, and pointed out 
the distinctive peculiarity that per- 
tains to the Latter-day Saints and 
their worship. I thought of one 
other great feature of this work 
that he did not mention in his re- 
marks This item was brought to 
my attention in the opening session 
of the conference, in the remarks of 
President Smith, and the announce- 
ment that was so heartily seconded 
and approved by the great assem- 
blage on that occasion in regard to 
the establishment of a temple on an 
island of the Pacific. 

One of the peculiar and distinc- 
tive features of the gospel, of this 
latter-day work, has been the build- 
ing of temples Very early in the 
history of the Church, even as early 
as December, 1830,a very few months 
after its organization, it was made 
known unto the prophet that there 
should be a house built unto His 
name, and a promise was made that 
the Lord would visit it, or suddenly 
come to His temple Early in the 
year 1831, at a counsel of the breth- 
ren held in Kirtland, a company of 
them were selected, and they were 
sent out into the then far west, and 
finally congregated in Missouri ac- 
cording to appointment, and there, 
on the 2nd day of August, 1831, a 
site was selected for the rearing of a 
house of the Lord, in Independence, 
Jackson County, but the building of 
this great temple was to be post- 
poned for a time And again the 
Lord spoke to His people and point- 
ed out the necessity of speedily 
erecting such a building wherein 
the ordinances of His house might 
be properly performed. And so, 
revelations were again given and a 
place selected, and a spot dedicated 
for the rearing of a temple in Kirt-

land, Ohio, and in 1833 this work 
was begun, in the days of the pov- 
erty of the people, and amidst the 
bitterest persecution ; in the days of 
limited numbers and means was this 
work begun. In 1835 the building 
had so far been completed that some 
rooms could be used for sacred 
purposes, and in that year some of 
the most glorious manifestations of 
the power of God and His goodness 
and mercy were given unto the 
prophet Joseph Smith, and those 
that were associated with him in the 
ministry at that time. 

It is stated in the history of the 
Church that a glorious vision was 
given previous to the final comple- 
tion and dedication of the Kirt- 
land temple, in which it is said that 
they beheld the celestial kingdom of 
God, and saw the transcendent 
glory of the gate through which 
the heirs of that kingdom should en- 
ter ; they saw the Father sitting up- 
on His blazing throne and the Son 
at His right hand ; they saw the 
streets of the kingdom having the 
appearance of being paved with 
gold. Many other things of a mar- 
velous nature, and of great encour- 
agement to the people in their dis- 
tressed condition, were given to the 
people at that time, which encour- 
aged them to press forward in their 
spendid work so that the temple 
might be completed, which was ac- 
complished in the year 1836 At the 
dedication of that temple more of 
the wonderful manifestations of the 
power of the Lord was given, so 
eloquently referred to in the open- 
ing prayer of President Smart this 
morning, and further referred to by 
President Seymour B. Young, 
wherein the Lord was seen stand- 
ing upon the breastwork of the tem- 
ple, and the veil was. taken from 
their eyes, and wonderful promises 



were made. The keys of the gath- 
ering of Israel, and of the blessing 
of the people, and the spirit of Eli- 
jah, all of these blessings were be- 
stowed upon the brethren on this 
solemn occasion But persecution 
came, they were forced to leave the 
edifice which they had built to the 
name of the Lord, and. to move 
away from that sacred spot. An- 
other site was selected and dedi- 
cated for the erection of a temple, 
in Far West, but the building of it 
was not allowed, and again, in No- 
vember, having been forced to va- 
cate the places where they had gath- 
ered and the Church centered for 
a time, and found a new gathering 
place at Nauvoo, again the voice of 
the Lord comes that a temple shall 
be built there. As they begin upon 
the twelfth year of their existence 
as a Church, in April, 1841, again 
dedicatory services are held, and the 
operation of building a temple is 
again begun. Persecution continues 
but, amidst all the trials that came 
upon them our brethren and sisters 
were faithful to their trust, and 
prosecuted their labors in faithful- 
ness under the direction of the 
prophet and his associates. 

They were not permitted to see 
the completion of the temple at 
Nauvoo, for the Prophet and his 
brother were murdered by assas- 
sins in 1844, and the temple was 
not completed and ready for dedi- 
cation until the spring of 1846. Un- 
der the leadership of Brigham 
Young, who took up the work 
where it was laid down by the 
prophet and his brother the patri- 
arch, was successfully carried to 
completion that great work, in the 
days of the great poverty and per- 
secution of the people. Again they 
were forced to flee from their 
homes, but after cr ossing the wil- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



■ derness, as they entered this valley 
from the canyons on our east and 
looked over its barren waste, the 
prophet of the Lord saw in vision 
that this was the place; and four 
days later a site had been selected, 
and on that spot designated the 
prophet said, "Here shall we raise 
the temple of our God." 

And so, this has been a character- 
istic from the beginning, a distinc- 
tive feature of this Church, the 
building of temples. Then arose 
the necessity of a temple before this 
great edifice that now stands upon 
the Temple Block might be com- 
pleted, and so in St. George, in the 
far south, one is erected, and 
dedicated, and one at Logan in 
the north, and another in Manti, 
the central part of the state, 
and later, in 1893, the - com 
pletion and dedication of the splen- 
did edifice that stands upon these 
grounds. Now we hear with joy 
and our hearts do rejoice at the 
work proceeding on the erection of 
a temple in Canada, and the decision 
to erect another at Laie, on one of 
the islands of the Pacific ocean. It 
certainly is a testimony unto us that 
the spirit of Elijah is operating up- 
on the hearts of the children of men 
today. I bear record that in the 
stake over which I preside this spirit 
is active, and is being manifested in 
the labors of our brethren and sis- 
ters, particularly the sisters of the 
Relief Society, who have taken 
great interest in this work. We 
have not many sick nor many poor 
that require the charitable attention 
of the sisters of our Relief Society, 
and therefore their efforts are being 
directed in preparing the records of 
the people for the work of salva- 
tion for the dead. 

I rejoice in the testimony which 
the Lord has given me of the truth 



of His work. I desire to bear it to 
you, my brethren and sisters, on this 
occasion, in connection with those 
who have borne testimony before. 
I know that this is the work of the 
Lord. May we live so that we may 
merit His blessings, and finally 
achieve salvation in His kingdom, I 
pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The hymn, "Ye simple souls who 
stray," was sung by John W. Sum- 
merhays as a tenor solo. 



ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 

(President of Hawaiian Mission.) 

Aloha no ia oukou apau. (A love 
greeting to you all.) 

1 feel that I have as much reason 
to rejoice this morning as any other 
person present, for truly the spirit 
of Elijah has been upon the people 
over whom it has been my good 
pleasure to preside for the past 
twenty years. The spirit of temple 
work, looking after themselves and 
their dead, has been in the hearts of 
that people for vears, and now we 
have voted to build a temple upon a 
piece of ground chosen of the Lord. 

That land, the land of Laie, was 
chosen by revelation, by a committee 
appointed by President Brigham 
Young, our President Joseph F. 
Smith being one of that committee. 
President Young appeared in spirit 
to one of the committee and said to 
him, "Upon this land we will build 
a temple." That was after the 
Church had been established upon 
the islands, and Lanai had been 
chosen as a gathering place for the 
Saints of that mission, and after the 
notorious Walter Gibson had taken 
advantage of the people, and pro- 
cured deeds and bills of sale of all

their lands, and their goats and their 
sheep, and their turkeys or whatever 
they may have had, in his own 
name. He was excommunicated 
from the Church after a committee 
chosen and sent by President Young 
had investigated his case, and the 
people were forced to get away 
from Lanai. A committee of those 
sent remained and sought out a 
gathering place that the Saints 
might have a home. Now, this par- 
ticular land, the land of Laie, now 
owned by the Church since 1864, 
was a city of refuge in olden times, 
because that people are of the pure 
blood of Israel, and we find among 
them until this day rites and cere- 
monies that were practiced by an- 
cient Tsrael. and they had cities of 
refuge and Laie was one of those, 
and it will be an eternal city of 
refuge to the remnant of that por- 
tion of the house of Israel. 

I have felt for years that there 
would be a temple there, and I have 
put forth what effort the Lord has 
given me to that end trying to build 
up and beautify that sacred land. T 
believe in the near future that it will 
grow more than it has ever grown 
before, and the feeling and senti- 
ment of the people, not onlv the 
Latter-day Saints but the sentiment 
of the outside, is coming toward us. 
A gentleman said to me onlv re- 
cently, he is manager of a large 
mercantile institution : "Mr. Wool- 
lev if I had mv way. if I were the di- 
recting authority of this institution, 
I wouldn't have anvbodv but 'Mor- 
mons' work for me." Many others 
have the same good reports to make 
of our people in that land. A few 
vear* ago we had the privilege of 
voting on a temperance move in 
that land. A committee was sent 
out over the whole group to ask the 
people, the Hawaiian people in par- 



ticular, their sentiments regarding 
prohibition, and the tabulation, ac- 
cording to the secretary of that 
committee, who introduced himself 
to me one day upon the street say- 
ing, ''Are you Mr. Woolley of 
Laie?" I said, "Yes, sir," He said, "I 
want to compliment you on the good 
work you people have done. I have 
the tabulation of the committee sent 
out to inquire after the feelings of 
the people, and I have this to say: 
"seventy-five per cent of those vis- 
ited who are 'Mormons' are in favor 
of prohibition, seventeen per cent 
Catholic, and eight per cent of the 
church of whom I am a member, 
the Protestant, eight per cent only." 
He said: "I am ashamed, the mis- 
sionaries who brought the Bible that 
we hold dear, to this land and only 
eight per cent, are willing to abolish 
liquor." There were a number of 
people, local elders, chosen as mem- 
bers of a committee of one hundred 
to labor for prohibtion, those who 
selected them not knowing they be- 
longed to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, but they 
were recognized as good solid men. 
One of the number of our people 
was one of the three who came here 
a number of years ago as a commit- 
tee that went to Washington to in- 
tercede for her Excellency the 
Queen, who was dethroned, the late 
David Kalauokalani. He said to the 
chairman of the committee, Mr. J. 
P. Cook, "I have believed in this for 
the last forty years, I have been 
taught it in the church that I belong 
to." He says : "What church do 
you belong to?" "The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 
"Do they teach these things?" 
"Yes. and every other good thing." 
"Well." he said, "I never knew that 
before." "Because you never went 
to our meetings," was the reply.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



From that time we have grown in 
influence. Those men that took up 
and labored, in connection with the 
other denominations, for prohibi- 
tion have grown and our influence 
is spreading out, and there is a good 
feeling towards us today, generally 
speaking. So I believe that, now 
we have voted for a temple, when 
that is completed and dedicated I 
believe that the spirit of prejudice 
will be allayed more and more, as 
it has been in every land and at 
every time we have dedicated a 
temple unto the Lord from the be- 
ginning. 

My heart rejoices in these things, 
and I love that people because the 
Lord loves them. They are a good 
people, and I want to tell you they 
will be on hand with their means 
whatever they possess, if it is called 
for ; they will be there to assist, 
every one of them, and we have now 
9,310 souls in the mission. I be- 
lieve they will come and respond 
cheerfully with all they have, and 
they will help to maintain the Tem- 
ple, because that is one of the char- 
acteristics of that people. Last Au- 
gust the Relief Society of Honolulu 
gave a public feast, on a square 
right in the center of the city, oppo- 
site the Alexander Young Hotel, a 
beautiful little place, and they were 
asked twenty dollars for the use of 
it. They gave this feast. It was 
upon a Saturday, and they cleared 
$1,265.00 over and above expenses, 
to erect a house for the poor at 
Honolulu. Before twelve o'clock 
Saturday night everything was 
cleared away, and left neat and 
clean, and the man in charge said, 
"Here is your twenty dollars, I took 
that because every other feast that 
has been given at this place has cost 
us twenty dollars to clear the refuse 



away." Another mark for our peo- 
ple. 

J feel now as I have felt for years, 
that every time I hear reports from 
other parts of the world concerning 
the people, (I have talked with 
President Smith about these 
things), I feel in my heart to mark 
Hawaii up one, and today I feel to 
mark her up another one. Think of 
it, the only mission, I believe, since 
the Church was organized that is 
going to have a temple, and I re- 
joice in it. Thank God for good 
men that the Lord can reveal His 
mind and will to. I sustain them 
every one in my heart and in my 
soul, and I hope to be true, true to 
the people, true to the Lord, true to 
the priesthood, and true to the cove- 
nants that I have made, and I hope 
to continue faithful to the end. I 
hope this for all of us, and for the 
Hawaiian people especially, because 
I am most interested in them. The 
Lord loves them ; He chose men to 
go there in early days, He spoke to 
President Cannon with His own 
voice in that land. He came to 
Brother Cannon at Lahaina, Maui, 
and told him that He would lead 
him to a people that would receive 
the truth, and He did. Now there 
are tens of thousands of people who 
have joined the Church in that land, 
who have passed away without the 
Temple blessings, and there are 
tens of thousands who never did be- 
long to the Church who were honest 
hearted. They will have to be 
worked for, and the Lord will have 
to help us to obtain their genealo- 
gies, because they haven't kept gen- 
ealogy, but He can do it. He knows 
how, and He will do it in the right 
way too. 

May the Lord help us to prove 
true and faithful to the end, I ask 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

"Then said Jesus unto them, When 
ye have lifted up the Son of man. 
then shall ye know that I am he, and 
that I do nothing of myself; but as 
my Father hath taught me, I speak 
these things. 

And he that sent me is with me: 
the Father hath not left me alone; for 
I do always those things that please 
him. 

And as he spake these words many 
believed on him. 

Then said Jesus to those Jews which 
believed on him, If ye continue in my 
word, then are ye my disciples inded; 

And ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall make you free." 

I rejoice very greatly, my breth- 
ren and sisters, at this opportunity 
of bearing my testimony to you of 
the truthfulness of the Gospel. Since 
the opening remarks at this Con- 
ference, by President Smith, this 
scripture has been in my mind, and 
it occurs to me that our duty as a 
people, is to continue in obedience 
to the words of the Lord as they 
are given unto us by His prophet, 
and by His inspired teachers, that 
we have among us. By thus doing 
we will become in very deed the 
disciples of the Lord, and we shall 
be able to know and discern the 
truth in all things, and the truth will 
make us, in the future, as it has 
done in the past, free from the evils 
of the age in which we live. It oc- 
curs to me that there is no other 
way given in the wide world, 
whereby the world may be rid of 
those things that are an abomina- 
tion today, save it be giving heed to 
the word of the Lord as it comes to 
us, and living in accordance with 
that word. 

I want to ask the question if there 
is any system existing in the world 
today that can rid the world of the 



evils of war, and of strife and 
bloodshed that exist in the nations, 
save it be by living in accordance 
with the doctrines as laid down in 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ? And, 
has there ever been any institution 
established that will rid men entire- 
ly of the evil of liquor, that will 
rid them of the evils of ambition, of 
profanity, and every other evil that 
we might mention, save it be the 
word of the Lord as taught in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ? The Lord 
said, at the conclusion of that mem- 
orable sermon, the greatest sermon 
ever delivered to man on the earth, 
that sermon upon the mount : "He 
that heareth these words and doeth 
them, the same is likened unto a 
man who built his house on a rock," 
and whatever might come after- 
wards in the way of temptation, in 
the way of stprms that come into 
the human life, nothing could shake 
that man who built his edifice, or 
faith, on the word of the Lord as 
delivered there, and who obeyed 
those words. The Lord has said to 
those that doubt, "My doctrine is 
not mine but His that sent me ; He 
that shall do the will of the Father 
shall know the doctrine, whether 
it is of God or whether I speak of 
myself." And the Apostle James 
said : "But be ye doers of the word 
and not hearers only, deceiving your 
own selves." Therefore I say to 
you, brethren and sisters, the 
thought that has come to me is, 
that it is our duty as listeners, our 
duty as the people of the Lord in 
this generation, to give heed to the 
word of the Lord as it has come to 
us and do according to that word, 
and thus shall we be made free, and 
we shall know of the doctrine that 
it is of God, and we shall rejoice 
as nothing else in the world can 
make us rejoice.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I rejoice to be able to bear to 
you my testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, that I know that the Gospel 
is true. I know that the angel 
spoken of by John the Revelator has 
flown through the midst of heaven, 
and I know that through him the 
Gospel has been restored to the 
earth again. I bear you my testi- 
mony that Joseph Smith did in very 
deed receive a vision of the Father 
and the Son, because I know that 
it is true ; and I bear you my testi- 
mony that he received, at the hands 
of angels sent from God, the holy 
priesthood that holds the keys and 
powers to establish this great work. 
By that authority he received, he 
did establish the kingdom of God 
upon the earth in this day and age 
of the world. In this Church exists 
the authority to administer in all of 
the ordinances necessary for the sal- 
vation of the living, and for the re- 
demption of the dead. 

As a people we rejoice today in 
seeing the work grow, extending 
not only in behalf of the living but 
also in behalf of the many hun- 
dreds of thousands of people of hon- 
est hearts who have died without 
this privilege, and whose descend- 
ants now have the temple doors 
opened to them to work out for 
them, as far as it is possible for 
mortals to do for those who have 
passed beyond, a salvation in the 
kingdom of our Father in heaven. 
I rejoice also in the great mission- 
ary spirit among the living, and in 
the opportunity that I have had of 
laboring among the nations of the 
earth. I wish to bear testimony to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that 
there are very many people in the 
world whom "the Lord loves, many 
who are not yet members of this 
Church for the simple reason that 
they have not had explained to them 



the principles of the Gospel. When 
the Gospel is carried to them they 
will with gladness receive it. Those 
of us who are fortunate enough to 
be laboring in the ministry abroad 
find such people every day in our 
labors. Very recently it has been 
my privilege to travel in parts of the 
country where the gospel has not 
been taken before, among descend- 
ants of the original natives of this 
land of America, down in Colorado 
and in New Mexico, and we find the 
people anxious and willing to re- 
ceive the teachings of the Gospel. I 
rejoice in having the privilege of 
carrying it to them. 

I do not desire to occupy your 
time, my brethren and sisters. I feel 
good in this work, and I rejoice at 
the privilege of bearing this testi- 
mony, that I do know that God lives 
and that his priesthood is among us, 
and our duty is to hear His word, 
with open hearts, from those men 
who have authority to give it to us, 
because it is the word of God Let 
us, my brethren and sisters, live 
each day of our lives in accord with 
the word of the Lord as it comes to 
us, and we shall indeed be made 
happy, and free from all of the sins 
that exist in the world today. May 
the Lord help us to understand His 
purposes and to live in accordance 
with the light that we receive, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

It is not always possible for the 
younger element in the Church, who 
have been born and raised in these 
peaceful valleys, to understand what 
it has cost to produce those wonder- 
ful results that we have heard some- 
thing about today, and during the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



115 



other sessions of this conference. 
We have not contributed very much, 
some of us, in comparison to what 
our parents and grand-parents have 
done. I believe that no man can 
fully appreciate and deeply love this 
gospel unless he or she does some- 
thing for it. I have discovered that 
those who have labored earnestly, 
who have sacrificed much, loved 
much, and I believe that if the 
young men and women of this 
Church shall continue to love God's 
truth they must serve in the procla- 
mation of that truth, and in the es- 
tablishment of that truth in their 
lives. 

No great things have ever come 
to the world, of any value, except 
through sacrifice. We recount the 
experiences of the past and discover 
that Jesus gave His life for the most 
precious thing that we have in the 
earth today — the plan of life and 
salvation. Apparently it could not 
come without sacrifice. It required 
great sacrifice on the part of the 
founders, under God, of this work. 
Many of them gave their lives for it. 
It required sacrifice on the part of 
the founders of this great govern- 
ment. I have felt, as I have come 
to understand and realize, in part, 
the purposes of God, that this glori- 
ous work, "Mormonism," in some 
manner and way is linked with the 
great and glorious institutions God 
our Father has established in Amer- 
ica, that they shall go forward, 
these two great forces, one to break 
down political bars that have kept 
men's minds and hearts in slavery, 
and make the way. for liberty to 
come to all lands, judging among 
the nations in the settlement of 
wars, and the establishment of right- 
eousness, politically, among the na- 
tions of the earth. As a hand 



maiden and companion with this 
mighty force looking to the estab- 
lishment of political liberty shall be 
found that other great companion 
of truth, The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, proclaiming 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
which shall destroy the error and 
superstition, and false notions that 
men have had with respect to God, 
His purposes and desires ; and they 
shall accomplish ultimately the hu- 
man redemption and emancipation 
of our Father's children. 

My heart goes out in gratitude 
that, notwithstanding it has not 
been permitted to many of us young 
members of the Church to stand in 
those perilous positions that have 
been occupied by our fathers, in 
building the bridges, subduing the 
wilderness or in standing before 
mob violence ; that here, after all, 
are chances perhaps grander than 
any that ever came to them, to show 
our manhood, our integrity, and our 
devotion to the work of God at a 
time when, perhaps, it takes more 
strength, more moral courage, to 
stand out against the allurement of 
the world, and to be a true, clean, 
honest, upright servants of God. I 
feel that if the young men and the 
young women of this Church can 
succeed in weathering the insidious 
influences that are arrayed about us 
everywhere to destroy true ideals of 
life, if we can resist and become 
triumphant by the mastery of our- 
selves, subjecting ourselves to these 
gospel principles that we have heard 
about today, we shall win laurels, 
place and positions of renown that 
shall not be excelled by any who 
have preceded us. 

I believe with all my heart, my 
brethren and sisters, that it is pos- 
sible to do a service today that shall 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be as acceptable to the Lord as any 
that has been performed. I feel that 
we are in unfinished stages of the 
work of the Lord. I thank God that 
we have watchmen upon the towers, 
such as the President of this Church 
and these leading brethren, con- 
stantly calling our attention to the 
unfinished work that is yet to be ac- 
complished. I believe that the Lord 
Almighty intended to establish here, 
as the result of the introduction of 
this gospel, a perfect race of men 
and women who shall be an inspira- 
tion to the world, the very light 
upon the hill. We haven't yet per- 
fected ourselves ; there is much yet 
to be clone to bring to pass that 
perfection in our lives. I am thank- 
ful that there are teachers in the 
Church willing to devote their time 
to visit the members of the Church. 
I feel that this is one of the great 
and important labors of this present 
hour and time, that we shall reach 
out to every home, that every father 
and every mother shall be anxious 
to keep prominently and conspicu- 
ously before the minds of their chil- 
dren the true picture in the mind 
of our Father when He established 
this truth, that we shall build on the 
foundations that have been laid 
until we shall perfect our lives and 
by this t>rove to the world that the 
great philosoohy of "Mormonism," 
the wonderful truth God has given 
is practical, it is workable. 

The world is full of theories that 
are not practical. These theories 
and philosophies of eternal truth are 
practical ; they work out. We must 
prove that they work out, and then 
we shall have no difficulty in per- 
suading men and women to believe 
in the truth that the Lord has given 
to us. While at the present time, in 
some sections of the world, the de- 



livery of the message of the gospel 
is curtailed because of the great dis- 
tress of the nations involved in war, 
it may be the winter of the preach- 
ing of the gospel, so far as the Eu- 
ropean nations are concerned. If it 
be so, I pray you, my brethren and 
sisters, that we shall be wise during 
this winter season, that thousands 
of able and efficient men in this 
Church shall get out of debt and 
shall prepare themselves, by gather 
ing strength during this waiting 
season, that when the cry shall come 
once again, "Lo, the harvest is ripe," 
we shall be prepared. I testify to 
you that there will be called hun- 
dreds where tens have gone into the 
European nations, when this mighty 
struggle is ended, and it is essential 
that we shall be preparing ourselves 
now, to save faith in God in the 
world. 

I believe that men's faith is being 
shaken; they are being tried, and 
they are turning away from God 
and away from Christ, and away 
from their hope and belief that the 
gospel which they had would solve 
the world's difficulties and bring 
peace on earth and good will toward 
men. We shall have to preserve that 
faith. We shall have to preserve the 
eternal principles by the message 
that God has given to us. Now 
don't imagine, my brothers and sis- 
ters, that while the Lord has been 
merciful and kind to us and has 
brought us, one of a city and two 
of a family, — and oh, how thankful 
I am that that is true, — away from 
Babylon, away from the turmoil and 
strife of the world, that we be not 
patakers of her plagues and her 
judgments, don't imagine that the 
Lord has brought us here to enjoy 
this gospel alone. I conceive that 
He has called us simply to persuade 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



117 



others, simply to be qualified as 
teachers for the nations of the earth, 
and our mission is to all the world. 
We did not come to these valleys of 
the mountains just to reap and to 
sow, to plant and to gather the good 
things of the earth and be contented 
enjoying the blessings of a material 
and a spiritual character, for our 
families and ourselves. We came 
here true to the prophecies of old, 
to become teachers unto the nations, 
the salt of the earth, the light on a 
hill. Our mission is unto the East 
and the West, the North and the 
South, and I am beginning to feel, 
I believe, as I come in contact with 
our Father's children, more of that 
spirit and feeling that the Lord 
really has. 

I was impressed a few months 
ago, by an appeal that a father made 
concerning an only son who was in 
the mission field. The boy had not 
shown much interest in the work 
of the Lord, and the father said, 
"Oh, go to my son ; do something 
for him. ■ He is my only son, and 1 
love him with all my heart, but I 
can't reach him. Won't you please 
go and do something for him?" 
And then the vision arose up in my 
mind of another father, the very 
Eternal Father who loves His chil- 
dren with a love greater than that 
exhibited by this father, and I in 
fancy could hear the appeal of that 
Father in heaven to you and to me 
and to those who have been called 
and who have • listened : go unto 
them, my children, for I love them. 
Call them away from the folly of 
the world ; call them away from the 
powers of the adversary and bring 
them back unto me. And so I do 
love the children of men in the 
world. I don't love their wicked- 
ness, but I do love their souls. They 



are precious before the Lord, and 
I must have burning in my heart 
an anxious desire to call them to the 
Father, away from error, and away 
from superstition and darkness. 

My heart rejoices in this work. 
The more I do for it, the more I 
love it and the more I appreciate 
it. I feel thankful that in this 
western country, out in the north- 
west where I have the joy to labor, 
that there are a good people, broad- 
minded, liberal, not so narrow as 
many in other sections. I felt, while 
President Monson was referring to 
the apparent success of those who 
are traducing the character of the 
Latter-day Saints in the East, that 
not one of such workers as those 
could succeed in the Northwest. 
There is a broad, liberal, generous 
spirit there. Only a few weeks ago, 
to illustrate, in the city of Port- 
land, where delegates from seven 
western states had gathered in a 
great water-power congress, the 
governor of this state presided over 
the deliberations of that body the 
entire time. Everybody knew he 
was a "Mormon" and nobody ob- 
jected. President Hart, who spoke 
to you, was the chairman of the 
committee on credentials, and 
Brother Smoot was honored with 
that most important position of be- 
ing chairman of the committee on 
resolutions. Everybody knew who 
these men were.' There was not one 
to raise a voice of complaint, but all 
were pleased to see them. I feel 
that we were blessed indeed, sur- 
rounded in this western country by 
broad-minded, liberal men in these 
western states who are our friends. 
Thpv will help us to win the East. 

God bless us that we shall con- 
tinue, out in the settlements where 
we live, to be exemplary and to win 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the respect of good men and women, 
and I know we will do it if we 
come up to the teachings of this 
conference. 

There is no revolt against the 
leaders of this Church that corre- 
sponds to the vain babblings of some 
who thought they had discovered a 
schism and a break. I tell you, and 
I am sure that I speak for and in 
behalf of the tens of thousands of 
young men in this Church, that 
there never was a spirit of loyalty 
exhibited by any generation of men 
in this Church that excells the spirit 
of loyalty, devotion and faith mani- 
fested by the young men of this 
Church today. If there is a revolt, 
I pray that it may ,be a revolt 
against evil, a revolt against the 
sins of the world and a resolution 
and determination that we, the 
young men of this Church, shall 
prepare ourselves to step forward 
in the grand work of the future, 
perfecting our own lives and calling 
the world to God and to our Christ, 
which may the Lord grant in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Rouse oh ye mortals." 

Elder Louis W. Shurtliff pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 



CLOSING SESSION.

stands, with hills surrounded." 

The invocation was offered by 
Elder James Duckworth. 

The choir sang a hymn, composed 



by Prof. Evan Stephens, entitled, 
"True to the Faith." 

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 

(President of Liberty Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, I realize 
that it will be impossible for me to 
say anything which will be bene- 
ficial or profitable to this conference 
unless the Lord shall direct me. The 
spirit which has accompanied the 
remarks to which we have listened 
bears ample evidence to my mind 
that the thousands of people congre- 
gated in this city have come to- 
gether hungering and thirsting for 
the word of the Lord, and they 
have been fed, they have been given 
instruction which will make for 
their eternal salvation. It seems to 
me that never in my life, have I at- 
tended a conference which has made 
me feel so determined to press on, 
and with the help of the Lord, to 
work out my salvation, and to dis- 
charge the duties which devolve 
upon me. 

I thought this morning, while 
Brother Woolley was speaking, that 
even he, who has spent twenty years 
in the Hawaiian mission, presiding 
over that people, could not feel more 
joyous than I felt with the an- 
nouncement that a temple is to be 
built in that land, for from my ear- 
liest infancy, I have had instilled 
into my heart a love for that people. 
It was on the Sandwich Islands that 
my father demonstrated to his own 
satisfaction that the Lord is willing 
to hear His humble servants. At a 
time when he was alone, when he 
was friendless, when those to whom 
he should naturallv have looked for 
instruction, were wavering, at least 
some of them, he found that the 
Lord was his friend, and he learned 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 



119 



from the lips of the Almighty that 
He loved the people of those islands, 
and that He intended the gospel of 
salvation should be preached to 
them. I rejoice more than I can 
tell at the action which has been 
taken that a temple is to be built 
there, that our brethren and sisters 
are to have the rights and priv- 
ileges which we enjoy in this land. 

I see in this, as has been stated 
by a number of speakers, the fulfill- 
ment of prophecy. On one occasion 
I heard President Snow, speaking 
in the Salt Lake Temple, declare 
that temples would be built outside 
of the confines of Utah and outside 
of the United States. At that time, 
it had never dawned upon my mind 
that temples would be built outside 
of Utah until we got ready to com- 
mence the edifice in Jackson coun- 
ty ; but he made the statement posi- 
tively, and 1 see in this the fulfill- 
ment of that prophecy. I see in it 
more than the fulfillment of proph- 
ecy. I see that a people who are 
worthy and anxious to do the work 
for their dead are to have the oppor- 
tunity of doing so, and not only for 
their dead, but for themselves' as 
well. In several sessions of this 
conference, I have seen a young 
man who labored as president of 
one of the conferences of the Swiss 
and German mission during the time 
that I was there. He is now prin- 
cipal of one of the Church schools, 
a very studious, thoughtful, high- 
minded man. who said to me on one 
occasion : "T feel that my parents 
have deprived me of a blessing 
which should have been mine, be- 
cause thev might have gone to the 
temple of the Lord and been seiled 
together for time and all eternitv. 
but thev permitted trivial matters 
to come in the way and I was not 



born under the covenant." I won- 
dered at the time and I have often 
thought about it since, what excuse 
can the parents of such a man offer 
to themselves and to him ? It seems 
to me that if they know his feelings, 
they will receive sufficient con- 
demnation in the knowledge that 
their son feels as he does. He is a 
man who would be a credit to any 
parent, to any father, to any mother, 
and the last time I talked with him, 
he felt that his parents had deprived 
him of a blessing which belonged to 
him, and robbed him through their 
carelessness, of something which 
was his, or should have been his, 
because they were indifferent or 
careless, did not attach to this duty 
the importance which should belong 
to it. And I wondered how many 
more parents are in the same con- 
dition, actually robbing posterity of 
the blessings which should be theirs, 
because of indifference or careless- 
ness, or because they feel their un- 
worthiness, and will not put them- 
selves into a proper condition to go 
to the house of the Lord to be sealed 
together for time and eternity. 

It seems to me that we owe pos- 
terity something as well as our- 
selves. The steps which are being 
taken by the Church to erect tem- 
ples in the outlying parts will give 
people a better opportunity to go 
to the house of the Lord than thev 
have ever had before. There are 
doubtless very many cases, as has 
been suggested here, of people who 
cannot possibly, because of their 
conditions, reach the temples, and 
have to be married in some other 
way, but I thank the Lord for mv 
own part, that I was born under the 
covenant, not because I feel that T 
am any better than those who are 
not. but T have thought all my life. 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that if this had not been the case 
with me, I perhaps, would not have 
been faithful. I thank God for the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and for what 
it has done for me. Insignificant as 
I am in the work of the Lord, I 
know that I am very much better 
and more useful in life than I would 
have been without the gospel. I 
fear and tremble when I think of 
what my lot might have been if it 
had not been for these truths and 
for the teachings of my parents in 
my youth. I thank the Lord for 
my parentage and I thank Him 
more than I can express that I too 
have had the privilege of going to 
the house of the Lord. Those who 
are near to me are mine forever and 
cannot be taken from me bv any 
power on earth or beneath the earth 
or above the earth, save through 
wrong-doing on my own part. 

I think we do not appreciate these 
blessings. We are as little children. 
"We see as through a glass darkly," 
but sometime we will be able to un- 
derstand what this all means, and 
will be more faithful and more dili- 
gent than we have been. I think 
that the Latter-day Saints have 
abundant cause to rejoice. In my 
opinion, there never has been a time, 
at least not within my memory, 
when the people were as well looked 
after as they are at the present time. 
I think there never was a time when 
the organizations were doing the 
good that they are doing at the 
present time, when the people were 
being visited and being labored with 
and looked after as they are now. 
The Church districts are being di- 
vided and sub-divided, and now 
there are seventy-two stakes in the 
Church, a very remarkable increase 
in the last few years, and the result 
is that people are being better cared 



for and labored with, and they are 
becoming more diligent in their du- 
ties. No uncommon thing now to 
see wards that have one hundred 
per cent of block teaching, wards 
where a hundred per cent of block 
teaching has been done for four or 
five years, not a single family missed 
in any month in that time. And we 
are seeing the fruit of this diligence 
in the lives of the people. Faith is 
increasing and the Saints love the 
gospel as they never loved it before. 
They are more diligent, they are 
striving more earnestly to keep the 
commandments, they are paying 
their tithes and offerings, they are 
keeping the word of wisdom and 
living nearer the Lord than they 
have ever done, at least .within my 
experience. 

1 bear testimony to the divinity of 
the gospel and the power and au- 
thority of the men who stand at the 
head. All we have to do as Latter- 
day Saints, is to follow in their 
footsteps and give heed to their in- 
structions, and we are absolutely 
safe. It does not matter to us, or 
it should not matter, whether we 
approve always of that which is 
done. The Lord will sustain those 
who sustain His authority. And 
men lose the power and spirit of the 
gospel the moment they begin to 
find fault and criticize. I know men 
who, notwithstanding the fact that 
their lives were not exemplary for 
years and years, had a knowledge of 
the gospel burning in their souls. 
They frequently bore testimony be- 
fore the world that they knew this 
was the truth, but when they reach- 
ed forth their hands to "steady the 
ark," the Lord deserted them in that 
moment, and they were left in dark- 
ness ; and when once light becomes 
darkness, that darkness is some-

thing terrible. I pray the Lord to 
bless this people and help us all to 
work out our salvation, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LARS P. OVERSON. 

(President of Emery Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, it makes 
me shake a little to face this large 
congregation, but nevertheless, I re- 
joice in having the privilege to bear 
my testimony to the truthfulness of 
the work of the Lord in which we 
are engaged. I have rejoiced ex- 
ceedingly during this conference in 
listening to the timely counsel, and 
the testimony that has been borne, 
and to the instructions that we have 
so abundantly received. I feel as 
though I would be able to go back 
to my home and be a better man than 
I have been in the past, that I would 
be able to bear a stronger and better 
testimony to the people of the sec- 
tion of the country where I live 
than I have ever done before. 

T come from one of the remote 
stakes of the Church away off across 
the mountains, but over in that 
country we have some splendid, 
good people, people who are striv- 
ing to serve the Lord and to live 
up to the requirements of the gospel 
to the best of their abilitv. I re- 
joice in being associated with them, 
and to have the privilege to min- 
ister in the midst of the people of 
God. 

T have had for many years an 
unouestionable testimony burning 
within my bosom of the truthfulness 
of this work. I realize and fully 
know to my own satisfaction that 
Tosenh Smith was a proohet of God, 
that he was inspired of the Lord to 
bring forth this mightv work, which 
Ins spread abroad and grown in the 



few years since it was first organ- 
ized, till today it is reaching into 
all parts of the world. I appreciate 
the blessings that have come to this 
people through the establishment of 
this gospel, through the organiza- 
tion of this Church and through the 
ministry of the servants of the Lord 
who have labored in the midst of the 
people for the establishment of the 
work of the Lord upon the earth. I 
sustain and uphold the servants of 
the Lord who are called and placed 
at the head at the present time. I 
know that they are men of God, I 
know that they are called of God 
and that they are capable of leading 
this people onward and upward in 
the paths of righteousness ; and if 
we, my brethren and sisters, will 
follow their admonitions and coun- 
sel, we will be able to reach that 
glory and exaltation in our Father's 
kingdom for which we have started. 

I rejoice to know that the gospel 
is spreading abroad, that the work 
of the Lord is growing in all parts 
of the world and that steps are be- 
ing taken to establish more fully the 
work of the Lord in the nations of 
the earth. It has been my privilege 
to be associated with this Church 
from my childhood, although I was 
born in a foreign land, but my 
parents embraced the gospel while I 
was a child and brought me to this 
goodly land, and I have had the 
privilege to be tutored and instruct- 
ed in the principles of the gos- 
pel, by the servants of the Lord, all 
the days of my life, and I cannot 
sufficiently thank my Heavenly 
Father for this privilege. I know 
that this gospel will continue to 
grow ; I know that it has been es- 
tablished, never more to be thrown 
down, never to be given to another 
people, but that it will continue to

spread abroad whether we, my 
brothers and sisters, keep pace with 
the work of the Lord or not. 

I hope and pray we may all be 
faithful and true, that we may con- 
tinue steadfast in the cause of truth, 
that we may be valiant in its de- 
fense, and stand up for the princi- 
ples of righteousness wherever it 
may be our lot to be cast amongst 
our fellow men. That the Lord will 
help us and bless us to this end and 
enable us to be faithful all the days 
of our lives, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEMUEL H. REDD. 

(President of San Juan Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, I feel 
very timid indeed in standing before 
this great congregation. I trust 
that the few words I utter may be 
directed by the Spirit of the Lord. 
I can say that I have rejoiced in at- 
tending this conference. I endorse 
every word that has been spoken. 
I know that the word of the Lord 
has been given unto us, and I trust, 
my brothers and sisters, that we will 
carry with us the good spirit that 
has been so manifest here during 
our conference. 

I come from the San Juan stake 
of Zion, perhaps the farthest stake 
from Salt Lake City. I have lived 
there for the last thirty-five years, 
was called there when I was a mere 
boy. It was a wild Indian country 
when I went there, but I can say we 
have a splendid country out there, 
and a good people and a good place 
for young men and young women to 
go to get homes. There is lots of 
good land, and the conditions are 
good. If the young people are will- 
ing to go there and labor, and be 
economical and industrious, they can 



make good homes. It is a splendid 
experience for young people to go 
through. I can say that those who 
are willing to go and be directed by 
the Spirit of the Lord, and be gov- 
erned by those who are placed over 
them, they will enjoy life, they will 
prosper in the land. This has been 
my experience. 

I am in love with the Latter-day 
Saints. I am in love with the prin- 
ciples of the gospel. I know they 
are true. I bear testimony to you, 
mv brothers and sisters, that I know 
that Toseph Smith was a proohet of 
the Lord ; that no man could do the 
things that he did unless he was di- 
rected bv the Spirit of the Lord. 
Those who hsve succeeded him also 
are men of God. I have had the 
honor and pleasure of visiting with 
those who preside in this Church, 
and T know that thev are splendid 
men. T never heard a word or sen- 
tin >cnt come from them but what I 
know to be true. 

My brothers and sisters, I pray 
the Lord to bless each one of us, 
that we may be enabled to go to our 
homes and possess the good spirit 
we have enjoyed here, that we may 
learn to be better men and better 
women, to be more faithful than we 
have ever been before and finally 
may be saved in our Father's pres- 
ence, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 

(President of St. George Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, I have 
had an opportunity already during 
this conference of sneakine to the 
Latter-dav Saints, but President 
Smith advises me that T may bear 
mv testimony to you. It is a great 
privilege and of course carries with 
it a great responsibility. 



ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK. 



123 



Like my brethren who preside 
over stakes of Zion, I have grown 
to love the work of the Lord and 
the people of the Lord. We have in 
the St. George stake of Zion, one of 
the best peoples in the Church. It is 
a desolate region, full of sand and 
rocks, but the people have become 
so habituated to battling with the 
elements for subsistence, and wrest- 
ing from them some of the comforts 
of life, that these sands and rocks 
have grown dear to us, and we love 
the everlasting hills. We love to 
ride through your, fertile valleys 
from St. George to Cache, as we 
can do it now, and see what you 
have and what we have, and while 
we know and realize that you are 
living in better lands than we, yet 
we are glad that our mission is in 
that part of the country ; and we are 
glad, also, that we have held onto 
the mission of our fathers and we 
have made it better land to live in 
than when they first went there, 
that we have builded well upon the 
foundations which they laid, not 
only temporally, but, I hope, spirit- 
ually. 

I love the work of the Lord, I 
love the association of my brethren 
and sisters, especially do I prize my 
association with the servants of the 
Lord. It is a good thing that the 
human heart does not deceive itself. 
We are not deceived in our attach- 
ment to these brethren, and our loy- 
alty has been won from us by a 
service for mankind and for God, 
that we cannot and would not gain- 
say. I am glad that it is so. I am 
glad to give them my support. I am 
glad to be guided bv their counsel 
and their advice. I know that sac- 
rifice brings forth the blessings of 
heaven, and the more we do for the 
Church and kingdom of God the 
greater we love it. 



We sometimes think we have dis- 
covered psychological principles, 
among which is that we learn to do 
by doing. The Lord is a great 
psychologist. He knew well we 
would learn to do by doing, and He 
knew that we love the things we 
make sacrifices for, and consequent- 
ly I think He gave us principles in 
the gospel such as tithing and offer- 
ings, donations and things that we 
call sacrifices on our part, that 
would cause us to love the work of 
the Lord, for it is well known by all 
of us that the more we do for it and 
the more service we perform for the 
benefit of mankind, the greater is 
our love for the children of men. 
And we all realize and know too, it 
is in the service of mankind, that 
we best serve our God. 

May the Lord bless us, that the 
desire may always be with us to 
serve Him and to serve our fellow 
men, that we may enjoy and merit 
the favor of God, which is the 
source of all true happiness, I pray 
for it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK. 

(President of Wasatch Stake.) 

I feel rather timid in attempting 
to address so many as there are as- 
sembled together on this occasion, 
brethren and sisters that I know are 
well versed in the principles of the 
gospel, and have received a testi- 
mony of its truth as well as I have. 
Nevertheless, I feel to corroborate 
and add my testimony to those that 
have been rendered on this occasion 
by my brethren. 

I know that the principles of the 
gospel are true, and the teachings 
which I have heard from my in- 
fancy, or from my boyhood days to 
the present time, have been for my 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



welfare and the welfare of my 
brethren and sisters, for our best 
interest in this life and in the eternal 
world. I rejoice in association with 
my brethren and sisters. I love my 
brethren ; I court their acquaintance, 
and desire to be associated with 
them in whatever may come to this 
people. I love this land, and our 
homes in these valleys of the moun- 
tains. I feel, with all my heart, that 
God has brought us to these lands, 
and this is the place which God has 
provided for the gathering of His 
people. 

It was my pleasure to be associ- 
ated with President Robinson, for 
a few days, in the Irrigation Con- 
gress, in our neighboring state upon 
the Pacific Coast. Truly they have 
a wonderful country there, a place 
desirable to men wfto are seeking 
aggrandizement, wealth and the 
honors of men, a state which, in the 
near future, if the suggestions of the 
Irrigation Congress are carried out, 
will become one of the greatest, if 
not the greatest, state in all the 
Union. But it does not compare 
for our purposes, for the Latter-day 
Saints, with these little vales in the 
tops of the mountains, the place God 
has appointed for His people to 
gather unto, that they might become 
united, and work hand in hand in 
carrying out the principles of the 
everlasting gospel, a condition which 
could not have possibly been devel- 
oped in that great and glorious state 
of California. 

God bless California and the peo- 
ple. They, I believe, are friendly 
toward us ; but they are seeking the 
things of the world. To those among 
us who want the things of this world 
and its pleasures, I would say go to 
California ; but if you want' to serve 
God and keep His commandments, 



stay in these vales of the mountains, 
surrounded by brethren and sisters 
who are seeking God's truths, and 
desire to carry out His principles. I 
am assured that we will make much 
greater success in keeping God's 
commandments in the place which 
He has appointed. I thank our 
Father for these lofty hills and 
mountains, which gather the snows 
and make it possible for us to es- 
tablish homes at their base, in our 
beautiful little valleys, just big 
enough for us, developing as we 
grow, and not -attractive, particu- 
larly, to those who are seeking for 
the good things of the world, which 
is the case in great cities, and in the 
great state in the west at the shores 
of the sea. 

I feel that the Lord has been good 
to us to let us live in this dispensa- 
tion, and given us inspired men to 
guide and direct us ; and in reveal- 
ing- the everlasting gospel for our 
salvation.' W e should show our ap- 
preciation bv keeping the com- 
mandments of God, for in doing so 
there is peace, happiness, and con- 
tentment of the mind, and eternal 
rest in the kingdom of our Father in 
heaven ; which may God grant will 
be the lot an<-1 condition of every 
Latter-dav Saint, and everv honest- 
hearted man and woman throughout 
the earth, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES WOTHERSPOON. 

(President of North Weber Stake.) 

Mv brethren and sisters. T feel it 
an honor to have been called to this 
ston^ tndav. anrl lik-p the brethren 
who have alreadv addressed vou, I 
reioice in the statements that have 
been made, and in the counsel and 
advice that have been given to us at 



ELDER JAMES WOTHERSPOON. 



125 



the different sessions of this confer- 
ence. 

I rejoice with the brethren and 
sisters at all times, when they are 
enjoying that spirit and influence 
that comes from our Father in 
Heaven. He has given to us the 
Gospel of His Son, He has given 
to us the plan of life and salvation, 
which, if followed out in our lives, 
will lead us back into His holy pres- 
ence. To me there can be nothing 
greater come to mankind than to 
have lived in this dispensation in 
which God has been so merciful to 
open up our understanding and give 
us the light of truth, that we might 
be able to receive a testimony of this 
great latter-day work. I testify to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that I 
know this is the work of God. 

I am thankful that the elders came 
to Scotland in early days, and that 
my father and mother had the hardi- 
hood to accept the principles which 
they taught, to accept their testi- 
mony, and afterwards to obey the 
Gospel and receive a testimony for 
themselves. I thank God for this, 
because I know not whether I would 
have had the hardihood of myself 
to accept it or not, but I do appre- 
ciate the fact that they did, and that 
I have been brought to this goodly 
land ; and that so far as the guid- 
ance of the Spirit of the Lord has 
been with me, I have tried to follow 
in the path of truth. To a man full 
of weakness and imperfections, it is 
a hard thing to do. But I have tried 
in my weakness to do that which is 
right and, whether I have made a 
success in it or not, the Lord will 
judge me when the great day shall 
come. I pray that His blessings 
mav be with us as Latter-day Saints, 
that we may realize that we are 
God's children, and that the bless- 



ings of heaven are given us, inas- 
much as we will do that which He 
requires at our hands. 

Mention has been made at one of 
the sessions of this conference in re- 
gard to the great principle of unit- 
ing families together for time and 
for all eternity. To me, this is the 
grandest and most glorious prin- 
ciple that the latter-day work pre- 
sents to us, the fact that God has 
given to His servants in this dis- 
pensation, authority to bind men and 
women together as husband and 
wife eternally. Nothing can be more 
joyful than to know that after the 
troubles of this life are over, after 
we have passed through scenes of 
adversity, and sometimes prosperity, 
and have finished this course of life, 
that we shall arise on the morning 
of the resurrection and meet those 
that we loved on earth, and those 
that loved us. To me, this is one 
of the greatest and grandest prin- 
ciples that has been revealed in this 
latter dispensation. We know the 
troubles there are in life : we know 
the adversities we have to pass 
through, we know the struggle there 
is, and then to think that, after 
death claims us, those we have loved 
and who have loved us would not 
be our associates in the ages that are 
to come, to me it is impossible, it is 
not God-like, it can't be true. 

God is a lover of His children, 
just the same as we are lovers of 
our children, and we want to meet 
and associate with each other 
through the countless ages of eter- 
nity ; and may God grant it to us all, 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOHN J. M'CLELLAN. 

(The Tabernacle Organist.) 

My dear brethren and sisters : I 
have faced audiences in many parts 
of the world, and feel that prob- 
ably I have done myself justice, but 
this is the most trying position I 
have ever occupied. I am very 
grateful to God our Heavenly 
l*ather for this recognition. I am 
thankful to be counted worthy to 
stand in your midst, and proud to 
bear my testimony. I have known 
all my life that this is the work of 
God, and I expect to spend all my 
time in this glorious work. I ex- 
pect to live and die among this peo- 
ple, because they are the best peo- 
ple in the world. I have traveled 
a great deal and I know we have the 
best people, that we have the Gos- 
pel in its true and pure state, and 
that the Church is blest with revela- 
tions from time to time. I know that 
President Joseph F. Smith is, and 
all his predecessors have been, 
prophets of God. I don't merely 
think it, I know it ! 

I testify that those associated with 
the President, his counselors, the 
apostles and the general officers of 
the Church are men inspired. Of 
course, I appreciate my standing in 
the Church, though I feel sometimes 
that I am a rather poor Latter-day 
Saint, but I am trying to do the best 
I know how. You will agree that I 
am a poor preacher ; but though I 
seldom express my love for the Gos- 
pel with my lips, I try to do that in 
my own way, at the great organ. 
God has given me a musical gift and 
I am trying to develop that ; and if 
I do my duty in that way, I feel that 
I am doing, partly, that for which 
I was sent here on earth. 

I know that the Gospel is true, and 
I have never been ashamed to say 



that I belong to this people ; I have 
always been proud of that fact, and 
have always associated myself with 
the Church, and shall always strive 
to do so. 

My standing in this Church, that 
I thank God for, means more to me 
that all the rest of the world's inter- 
ests. I am sincere in this because 
I believe it with all my heart. In 
my way I shall dedicate my life to 
this work, under the direction of the 
authorities of the Church. I love 
our people. There is one thought I 
would like to present to this mag- 
nificent audience, and it is this : We 
have been the most persecuted peo- 
ple of modern times ; you well know 
that. I remember the persecution 
among our people in the early days, 
when I was a child, and my heart 
ached ; I thought we were the most 
abused people in the world. Hav- 
ing been so situated, having been so 
persecuted, we should as a people, I 
believe, possess a great degree of 
charity, one for the other. There 
should be no back-biting; there 
should be more evidences of broth- 
erly love, and we should give the 
"other fellow" the benefit of the 
doubt. It is easy, as our dear presi- 
dent here, can testify, to be in the 
public eye and be hammered to 
death almost. Have you ever 
thought about it that we are most 
uncharitable sometimes toward our 
very own? I wish I had the power 
and eloquence of an orator to pre- 
sent this subject as it should be pre- 
sented. This great thought, charity 
and forgiveness to one another, so 
beautifully touched upon in this con- 
ference, should be religiously culti- 
vated among us. It would prove to 
be a wonderful blessing, if we bore 
a more kindly attitude to the erring 
ones. Let us do away with the 



ELDER EDWARD P. KIMBALL. 



127 



habit of "knocking," which is 
prevalent to some extent in our com- 
munities. It is surely always bad 
for the "knocker" as well as for the 
one maligned. My dear brothers 
and sisters, I feel that being follow- 
ers of the meek and lowly Jesus, 
and believers in His Gospel, as re- 
vealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and knowing as we do that 
brotherly love is a great feature in 
our profession of religion, that it is 
a divine factor, we should encourage 
in each other kindly feelings, exhibit 
a forgiving spirit, and be in very 
deed brothers and sisters in the Gos- 
pel. 

I thank God for the Gospel, and I 
shall try in my humble way to assist 
in its upbuilding in the earth. I 
am grateful for this privilege of 
speaking to you ; and I pray that the 
Lord of Hosts will bless and help us 
all to do our duty according to the 
light that is given us. Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD P. KIMBALL. 

(Assistant Organist > 

When President Smith called me 
over and whispered in my ear, I 
thought I was going to be sent on 
some errand, but when he said 
"Will you bear your testimony for 
five minutes?" my heart stopped. 
Nevertheless, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I am grateful for this priv- 
ilege. 

It is the rather unhappy lot of 
men associated with the musical 
profession to have to live down the 
fallacy that a man cannot be a lat- 
ter-day Saint and be a professional 
musician. For one, I am doing my 
best to live down that untruth. I 
believe there is nothing in the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ that will act 
upon any man or woman in any 



other way, if he or she be engaged 
in an honorable, upright profession, 
than to make him or her excel in 
the line of work which they take 
up. I admire the physician or the 
surgeon who has courage enough 
to administer the ordinances of the 
Church to his patient before per- 
forming an operation, recognizing 
the hand of God and his own limi- 
tation, putting himself as a humble 
instrument in the hands of God for 
the cure which he hopes, through 
the power of God, to be instru- 
mental in bringing to pass upon 
those to whom he is called to ad- 
minister. I admire any man or 
woman engaged in any lawful pur- 
suit who has the courage to stand 
up and bear testimony of his con- 
viction. 

I hope you will pardon me for a 
few personal reminiscences. Some 
of you may not know, others may, 
that I was in Europe, in Berlin, at 
the time war broke out. I could see 
no reason for coming home. 
Friends were raised up to us on 
ever side, and we were not expect- 
ing to return home until we re- 
ceived the word from the president 
of the mission that President Jo- 
seph F. Smith had called the priest- 
hood out of Germany. That was 
sufficient for us. We sold our 
household belongings and came 
home, broken-hearted, along with 
fifteen or sixteen other students 
who were continuing their studies 
in that country. I testify to you 
that there is not one of those stu- 
dents who had to return to the 
United States, as he believed with- 
out having completed his work, 
who has not been able to accom- 
plish more in the eastern cities than 
had he remained in Europe under 
present conditions Now, to me that 
is a testimony that President Smith 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



was inspired of God, and that no 
man or woman will ever lose any- 
thing by following the counsel of 
those who stand at the head of the 
priesthood in this world. 

I was compelled at one time to 
give up the dearest desire of my 
heart. I had the chance of entering 
a musical conservatory in the East. 
My brother was called upon a mis- 
sion at the same time. It was a 
question of him remaining home or 
I. I was able to forego the priv- 
ilege at the time and he went on a 
mission. Another time I thought 
the time was ripe for me to go, and 
I was called on a mission myself. I 
set my work aside and went into 
the missionary field as any other 
elder would do. Those who knew 
me as a missionary did not know, 
until weeks afterwards, that music 
was the profession of my life and 
the thing to which I hoped to de- 
vote my entire time. I put this 
aside, devoted myself according to 
my best ability, in weakness and 
humility, to the labor as a servant 
of the Lord in the missionary field. 
I testify to you that I am of the 
same opinion today, if the authori- 
ties of the Church should ask me 
to lay down my professon, which to 
me, next to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and my loved ones, is the 
dearest thing in the world, as I feel 
now, I would do it, to take up labor 
in any capacity to which I might 
be called. 

I take my work here in the tab- 
ernacle, as asistant organist in the 
Church, very seriously. There are 
preaching missionaries in the 
Church. I consider my work, and 
I consider the work of my associ- 
ates here as that of playing mis- 
sionaries of the Church. It is a 
matter of prayer with me. I re- 
member not more than ten clays ago 



I had an extremely difficult pro-] 
gram to render, and I bowed my 
knees in prayer, as I always do, to 
ask for the help of the Lord, that 
those people who heard my effort 
here might receive at least a com- 
parative idea of the musical ability 
of our people, for such I consider 
the work which we render here 
gives. After I had finished I was 
told by one of the janitors in the 
east end of the building, that a cou- 
ple had come to him and had made 
this statement : "I don't know who 
that young man is, but he surely is 
imbued with the Spirit of God." 
This was an answer to my prayer. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
hope that the time is coming when 
. you, all of you, will recognize that 
a man or woman can follow any 
lawful occupation in the world and 
succeed, and still be even a better 
Latter-day Saint. I believe the 
Gospel with all my heart. I am 
proud of my lineage. The state- 
ment was made by Brother Sey- 
mour B. Young this morning that 
it was prophesied of this Church in 
the early days, by enemies of this 
people, that the third and fourth 
generation would leave the faith. I 
am of the third generation on the 
side of my father, and I am of the 
fourth generation on the side of 
mother, and I want to testify to you 
that the faith in the Gospel has not 
died out within my soul ; there is no 
sacrifice which I would not make if 
called upon, providing I can keep 
the same spirit of humility and faith 
which I now have, and I intend to 
see to it that the spirit of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ and the testi- 
mony of the divinity of the work of 
Joseph Smith shall not die within 
the hearts of my children, if the 
Lord will permit me to give them 
the example which has been given 



ELDER EDWARD P. KIMBALL.

to me by my parents and grand- 
parents. 

I believe the most potent thing 
in the Church today is the bearing 
of testimony. I don't believe there 
is a servant of the Church who is so 
humble and who is so unlearned 
that, if he will put himself in con- 
dition arid bear the simplest testi- 
mony it will not have a tendency to 
increase the faith in the heart of 
some one. Now we who have been 
born in the Church have most of us 
had the testimony of the Gospel 
given to us by continuous hearing 
of the word, until the Lord ' has 
touched our souls ; and I think that 
we should never stop bearing testi- 
mony. I am grateful that the au- 
thorities have seen fit to set me to 
work as a missionary here on the 
block. I have borne my testimony 
to more thousands here this sum- 
mer than I did in the three years of 
my missionary experience in the 
world. 

Now, may the Lord bless you; 
may He preserve the lives of the 
older brethren and sisters who have 
made it possible to meet under such 
auspicious circumstances. May He 
preserve the life of His servant, 
President Smith, and his counsel- 
ors, and the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles, until they shall have ful- 
filled the work which God has out- 
lined for them here. 

Once more my brethren and sis- 
ters, in my humble, weak way I 
bear to you the testimony that I 
know, so far as it is possible for a 
man in weak mortality to know, 
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
true. I don't know that South Af- 
rica exists, I don't know that there 
is such a place as South America 
except through the testimony of 
those who have been there and who 
do know it I don't know that God 



lives through having heard His 
voice or seen His face. I don't 
know that Joseph Smith received 
the visions which he did, through 
having come personally in contact 
with Him at the time, but the tes- 
timony of faith has been established 
within my soul through hearing the 
testimonies of those who do know, 
and I believe it is possible for ev- 
ery member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ to have not only the testi- 
mony of belief and of desire, but a 
testimony of positive knowledge. 
There will come a time when the 
hearts of every one of us will burn 
within us, as the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants says, if a man will know that 
a thing is right he can only know by 
the burning sensation which comes" 
within the soul. . We all know that 
the things of this world, our occu- 
pations, fade into insignificance 
compared with the things we enjoy 
— compared with some of the rich 
outpourings of the Spirit in our 
priesthood meetings. What is the 
reason? Simply because we are in 
tune .with the Infinite, and the 
things of the world disappear, and 
become as naught. 

I hope the Lord will give me 
long life, and allow me to devote 
my entire time in whatever capa- 
city I may be called, to the promul- 
gation, and the furtherance of His 
purposes, and that I may always al- 
low the solemnities of eternity to 
rest upon my soul, that I may treas- 
ure up continually the word of the 
Lord, and that I may be ready at 
any time, wherever I may be, in any 
clime or under any conditions, to 
testify to the truth of the Gospel, as 
I really and sincerely feel it in my 
heart today. God bless you in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

boys from generation to generation 
continually." 

ELDER TRACY Y. CANNON. 

(Assistant Organist.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, I 
am glad that I was called upon to 
speak, although 1 believe this is one 
of the most trying times of my 
whole life. But I have noticed this ; 
that since I came from my mission, 
quite a number of years ago, 1 have 
been called upon, perhaps, only 
twice to administer the sacrament in 
our meetings, because I have always 
been busy with the choir or at the 
organ ; and I have felt sometimes 
that the brethren forget that we mu- 
sicians hold the priesthood, and that 
we want to exercise our rights 
therein. For this reason I am happy 
indeed, my brethren and sisters, to 
bear unto you the testimony which 
burns within my soul, for I have a 
testimony of this Gospel, that it is 
the work of God. 

I have traveled quite a good deal 
in my short life, and have studied 
somewhat concerning other faiths, 
and I have noticed that each partic- 
ular faith that I have studied has its 
own peculiar spirit. There was a 
certain spirit attending me, it 
seemed, when I studied the beliefs 
of the great Catholic Church, and 
there was an entirely different spirit 
when I read somewhat concerning 
the Hindoo faiths ; and T notice this, 
and always have noticed it. that 
when I have gone into one of our 
meetings or picked up one of our 
Church works, that there was an en- 
tirely different spirit from any one 
of them. A sweet, beautiful snirit 
came to my soul and testified that 
this was the greatest of all works 
among mankind, and so, my breth- 
ren and sisters, I am thankful. ?r~"" 



the bottom of my heart, to be a 
member of this Church. 

I am thankful for the opportuni- 
ties that are presented, from day to 
day, for us to play to the thousands 
of people that come through here ; 
because I know from experience, in 
speaking to the tourists, that their 
hearts are softened towards us, be- 
cause of the beautiful music from 
this great and wonderful organ in 
this still greater and more wonder- 
ful building, thus preparing thou- 
sands of people to receive the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, 
that this Gospel is true. I feel this 
testimony burning within my soul, 
and I know that when I am doing 
my full duty that the spirit is burn- 
ing deepest in my heart. I feel to 
uphold President Smith, his coun- 
selors, and the Twelve, the mission- 
aries and every man and woman 
who is working in this Church for 
the furtherance of truth ; and I feel 
like Brother Kimball, and I know 
Brother McClellan feels the same, 
that I would be willing to lay down 
my professional work to go out as a 
humble elder, tracting from door to 
door. I have done it once, and it 
was really and truly a joy and power 
to me, even as is playing this won- 
derful organ ; and you can imagine 
what a great joy and what a won- 
derful amount of satisfaction and 
happiness comes to one in having 
the great opportunity of playing to 
so many thousands of strangers. 

I pray God to bless von all, my 
brethren and sisters, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith said :

sembly hall, and in our opening- 
meetings during this conference, 39

presidents of stakes and 10 presi- 
dents of missions have spoken and 
borne testimony, and I regret that 
we did not occupy all day yester- 
day, as well as the Sabbath and 
Monday and today, in hearing the 
testimonies of our brethren who 
stand at the head of the vari- 
ous stakes and missions of the 
Church. I think we have heard very 
much to convince us that the Lord 
has made wise choice in the selec- 
tion of those men, who have spoken 
to us, to occupy the important posi- 
tions they are called unto. 

It will be necessary on account of 
the shortness of time to change our 
course a little. Brother Smoot will 
be leaving us to attend to his duties 
at Washington, we would like to 
have him express himself and bear 
his testimony before he goes. The 
other brethren of the Twelve and of 
the Seventies will be with us and 
will visit you from time to time, and 
you will hear from them again. We 
will now give a few moments of the 
time to Brother Smoot.

t 

What a splendid conference we 
have had, and what wonderful tes- 
timonies have been given, and what 
a rich outpouring of the Spirit of 
the Lord has attended those who 
have addressed this conference. 
During the few moments that I 
stand before you today I pray the, 
blessings of heaven to be with me. 
I want the people to know that my 



whole being has been, in tune with 
the testimonies that have been 
borne and the admonitions that 
have been given, and I thank mv 
Father in heaven for the privilege I 
have had of being with you at this 
conference. 

My heart rejoiced when Presi- 
dent Smith, in his opening state- 
ment to this conference, said that 
the Church never was in a better 
condition spiritually and temporalis 
than it is today. Mv brethren and 
sisters, I believe that God intends 
that as the people grow in the spir- 
itual things of life so shall they be 
blessed with the temporal things of 
life. We have heard many testi- 
monies durinsr this conference of 
the wonderful prosneritv of the 
r>eor>le of Utah, and I am so thank- 
ful for it. I am thankful to mv 
heavenly father that our country is 
enioying peace, and as far as I am 
concerned. I believe that there has 
not been a moment that our coun- 
try was in danger of becoming in- 
volved in this wicked and unjusti- 
fiable European war. I have been 
taueht all mv life, and so have you. 
to pray for the rulers of the world, 
to nrav for the President of the 
United States, to nrav for the law- 
makers of ah countries, and partic- 
ularly our own ;to prav for the gov- 
ernors of states, the legislatures of 
states and all who make and admin- 
ister the law : but. mv brethren and 
sisters, that does not mean that we 
must approve of all that men do in 
those positions. It is our right to 
ask our heavenly Father to give all 
men wisdom and judgment. I 
measured mv words when I said 
^iat I do not believe that there has 
been a moment that our countrv 
was in danger of becoming" involved 
'»-> this wicked and unjustifiable 
European war. There are so many 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



reasons for this that I haven't the 
time this afternoon to even mention 
a tithe of them, but first and above 
all is the fact that there are a hun- 
dred million of American people 
that are opposed to war. And 
again, I believe when the true his- 
tory of the war is written, after the 
close of the war, it will be found 
that the greed for expansion of ter- 
ritory, the ambition for greater 
power, and not least, if the last that 
T mention, a desire to control the 
commerce of the world will be re- 
corded as the fundamental reasons 
for the war. We should thank our 
Creator that our country, the one in 
which our liberties are so well pro-, 
tected, has no ambition to rule the 
world by force ; that it has more 
interest in the commerce of its own 
country than it has to control the 
commerce of the world, and that 
her peoole do not want another foot 
of land of any foreign power. 

I believe what has been testified 
to in relation to the prosperity of 
the people today. I wish that it 
had come through some other way 
than through the channels of mur- 
der and war ; and I now call the at- 
tention of the people to the fact that 
this horrible massacre of human be- 
ings must cease before long, and 
when it does the products of our 
state and of the intermountain 
country will not be so highly prized, 
and will not bring in dollars and 
cents what they are bringing todav. 
And I plead with all that while this 
prosperity exists., unfortunate as the 
cause of it is, that you save a part 
of your gains for the future. I am 
deeply sensitive of the jealousy I 
have for the growth and develop- 
ment and thrift of my country and 
my Church, and I desired to speak 
upon the subject of thrift, but T 
haven't time to discuss it at length. 



I must be content with the time at 
my disposal, to present the question 
as it were in headlines, and let ev- 
ery one present make the argument 
for himself. 

In speaking of thrift I mean 
thrift in its broadest sense, the kind 
that makes better men, better wom- 
en, better children, thrift that will 
build a better nation. We often 
mistake what thrift means. It 
means more than the mere saving 
of money. It means prosperitv, 
good husbandry, good farming, 
economical management, frugalitv. 
It means individual efficiency. It 
means order and system. It means 
character building in its broadest 
sense, morally, temporally and spir- 
itually. The thrift that I desire to 
impress upon you today does not 
mean stinginess ; it does not mean 
miserliness, nor does it mean upon 
the other hand a wild extrava- 
gance ; rather would I say that it 
means a walk of life between the 
two that I believe our heavenly 
Father intended His children to fol- 
low. Thrift and thriving mean the 
same thing. A farmer who lets his 
broken fences go unrepaired, his 
farm implements remain in the field 
all winter is not a thrifty farmer. A 
wife who throws into the garbage 
can enough food to feed another 
familv, which often is the case, is 
not a thriftv woman. And do you 
know, my brethren and sisters, that 
it is estimated that there is wasted 
throueh the garbage cans of the 
United States over a billion dollars 
a year. There is enough in that one 
statement to make a sermon. I re- 
member preaching a sermon, years 
ago, upon the waste of the swill- 
barrel and many told me it was 
greatly appreciated. Remember that 
leakage and waste are the universal 
enemies of all forms of thrift and

progress. We find it in smoking, 
we find it in drinking, we find in 
homes that we enter thousands of 
little things going to waste for want 
of immediate care. I never see such 
waste but that I think, "A stitch 
in time saves nine." I wish that 
every one fully understood the true 
significance of that statement. 
Thrift never despises little begin- 
nings. 

One day President McKinley and 
Mark Hanna were entering a street 
car. It was when McKinley was a 
congressman, and just after he had 
secured the passage of the McKin- 
ley tariff bill through the House of 
Representatives ; and as they step- 
ped on a car Mr. McKinley paid ten 
cents for tickets for himself and 
Mark Hanna. As soon as they sat 
down Hanna turned to McKinley 
and said : "I wish that I could 
make a tariff bill such as you passed 
through the House today, yet I 
think you are the most wasteful 
man that I ever knew." McKinlev 
asked him why. "Why," Hanna 
said, "you could have bought six 
tickets for a quarter, and you paid 
ten cents for two of them, a clear 
loss of nearlv twenty per cent. No 
wonder you have been poor all your 
life." 

Remember the first hundred dol- 
lars that you save will be the hard- 
est for you to acquire. To do so 
sometimes requires self-sacrifice 
and it always requires self-control. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, I 
have trespassed on the time alloted 
me already. I wish that I had time 
to discuss fully the question of 
thrift. I would like to have the 
principle of thrift made a part of 
vour lives ; for the Lord has prom- 
ised that His people should be 
blessed as no other people in tem- 
poral affairs as well as spiritually ; 



and remember this, that "God helps 
those who help themselves." I trust 
that the Latter-day Saints will by 
honesty, energy and thrift helo 
themselves that our heavenly Fath- 
er can better help them. 

I want to leave with you my tes- 
timony ; for I know that this is the 
work of the Lord. I never felt 
prouder of my standing in the 
Church than I do today. I never 
felt a stronger desire to accomplish 
all that God would have me accom- 
plish than I do at this moment ; and 
I pray that His blessing may be 
upon all the people, not only the 
Latter-day Saints, but all the hon- 
est in heart throughout the world 
and may peace come to the world in 
the Lord's own due time ; may the 
European war be overruled for 
good and the people of the world be 
ultimately blessed through it. God 
knows how this can be brought 
about. May peace ever be with us 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

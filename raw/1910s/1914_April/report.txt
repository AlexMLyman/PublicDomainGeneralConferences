Behold! a royal army 

With banner, sword and shield 
Are marching forth to conquer 

On life's great battlefield.

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Saints manifest admirable qualities, but 
can improve. — Church officers and 
members increasing in unity and good 
works. — Certainty of triumph of God's 
purposes. — Falacious idea that there is 
a limit to God's power. — Interesting 
statistics concerning the Church. — ■ 
Young people should marry at proper 
age, and in the Temple. — Men holding 
Priesthood cannot graduate from duty 
of teaching.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I am very happy to greet you, my 
brethren and sisters, in our gather- 
ing on this beautiful morning, to 
commence our eighty-fourth annual 
conference of the Church. I do not 
know how long I may address you 
this morning, but I sincerely hope 
I may not weary you too long. I 
am very grateful to say that I am in 
the enjoyment of my usual health 
and strength, notwithstanding for 
sometime, like a great many of my 
brethren, I have been "enjoying" a 
bad cold the best I could. It has 
had its effect upon my organs of 
speech, for, notwithstanding the 
cold, I have endeavored to perform 
my duty, and have very frequently 
used my voice to the utmost in ad- 
dressing the quarterly conferences 
of our people, and also many ward 
gatherings as well. 

I am very thankful, indeed, that 
the Lord has preserved us all to 
meet together here this morning in 
His service, from whom we receive 
all good, and in commemoration, 
also, of the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints in this Dispensation of 
the Fulness of Times. I feel, sure 
that during the sessions of this con- 
ference there is in store for us the 
usual outpouring of the good Spirit 
by which we may be strengthened 
in our faith, encouraged in our de- 
termination to continue faithful be- 
fore the Lord, and aided in the per- 
formance of our duties as members 
and officers of the Church, and as 
men and women bearing responsi- 
bilities therein. All these blessings 
that we may resolve again, as we 
no doubt have resolved many times, 
to be more faithful, if possible, in 
the future than we have been in the 
past. It is a fact that however 
good we may be, however careful 
in the observance of the precepts of 



the Gospel, and in the preservation 
of our lives and virtues, there is a 
certain degree of weakness which 
we often call "human weakness" 
pervading our being. Hence, there 
is always opportunity for improve- 
ment over the best that we do. 1 
feel that is the case with me, and 
I believe I am not an exception to 
the general rule. None of us, I 
presume, have reached such degree 
of perfection in all things that we 
can say of a truth that we have not 
neglected any duty required of us 
in the Church, and that we have 
done all that we possibly could do 
for our own good and for the ad- 
vancement of the kingdom of God. 
The fact is, whoever will labor for 
his own welfare, for his own salva- 
tion and upbuilding in the knowl- 
edge of those principles which draw 
men nearer to God and make them 
more like unto Him, fitting them 
better for the performance of the 
duties required at their hands, is in 
like manner building up the Church. 
None of us, I suppose, can do as 
well as would be expected of us by 
those who are perfect in the ob- 
servance of the laws of God. I 
presume that there are very few 
of us today who would be justified 
in claiming that we actually observe 
and are capable of living up to the 
precepts that were taught by the 
Son of God. However, good, hon- 
est and faithful we may be, I doubt 
very much that there are any of us 
who are capable of rightfully as- 
serting that we are living up to all 
the precepts of the Son of God. 
There are some glorious principles 
advocated by Him that I fear it 
would be impossible for me, in my 
present condition and state of mind, 
to observe or comply with. To il- 
lustrate what I desire to express, 
I fear that if a man should smite me 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

on the right cheek that I would not 
feel very willing to turn the other 
cheek also ; or, if a man should sue 
me at the law, unjustly, and take 
away my cloak, that I would will- 
ingly give him my coat also. I 
fear that I cannot pray for my en- 
emies in the same spirit of love, 
kindness, devotion and earnest de- 
sire for the forgiveness and exemp- 
tion of the consequences of their 
transgressions, that I can for my 
friends, or those who love me, and 
are true and faithful to me as I 
would be true and faithful to them. 

And so there are many great 
things, which are almost incompre- 
hensible to mankind as taught by 
the Savior of the world, which lie 
before us, which should be the 
standard of perfection, for which 
we should aim, that we have not 
yet been able to master and to ap- 
ply in ourselves. Yet, I believe that 
there are no better people in the 
world than the Latter-day Saints. 
I do not believe that there are any 
people in all the world, who more 
patiently endures insults, calumnies, 
and misrepresentation than the Lat- 
ter-day Saints do. I do not believe 
that there are a people anywhere 
who would endure the presence of 
the most vicious, wicked falsifiers 
on earth, and allow them to peace- 
fully remain unquestioned in their 
midst, as the Latter-day Saints do 
and are doing right along. And 
yet I am firm in the belief that this 
evil is diminishing, and that "the 
time will come when those who fal- 
sify, who wilfully or ignorantly lie 
and misrepresent the people of God, 
will be ashamed to wag their vile 
tongues, at least in public. _ The 
time will come when they will be 
ashamed of it, and this evil will 
eventually cease. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 



want to say to you, as I have said 
before on occasions like this, (and 
I believe I can say it again as truly 
as ever before) that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
was never in a better condition than 
it is today ; never was more alive to 
the interests of Zion ; never was 
more united, and I believe that there 
never were less of fault to find with 
the people of God than there is to- 
day. I believe we are learnng, and 
while we may be slow in coming to 
the knowledge of the truth, and to 
the acceptance of it all, we are prog- 
ressing, we are growing in the right 
direction; we are learning wisdom, 
learning patience, getting under- 
standing; we are increasing in our 
faith and in unity, and in good 
works ; I believe this with all my 
soul. I believe that your servants, 
the Presidency of the Church ; 
your servants, the Twelve Apostles, 
the Seven Presidents of Seventies, 
and the Presiding Bishopric of the 
Church, never were more faithful 
to you, to your interests and to the 
interest of the kingdom of God, than 
they are today. I don't believe that 
the time ever was when they were 
more united than they are now. I 
believe that the councils of the 
priesthood are united, and that they 
are laboring together more effec- 
tively for their advancement and 
unity, and for the increase of their 
knowledge of the principles of the 
Gospel, than ever before. I can 
say the same, I think, of all aux- 
iliary organizations of the Church. 
I believe that our Relief Society 
is doing a magnificent work among 
the people. I believe that the Gen- 
eral Board of the Relief Society are 
more united than they have been, 
and they are doing better work than 
they have done before; that is; so 
far as I can remember, and I can

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



remember a long way back in rela- 
tion to some of the work that has 
been done by our Relief Societies. 
They are an essential organization 
for the good of Israel, for the wel- 
fare of the sisters, and mothers, and 
the daughters in Zion. They are 
doing a good work, and I believe 
are united more than ever before. I 
think I can say the same of all the 
other organizations that have been 
devised as helps to the priesthood 
for the advancement of the cause of 
Zion. And so I think that the king- 
dom is growing, that the Lord is 
with us, that His power is behind 
and before and above and beneath 
this work, and that it is the power 
of God that sustains it, that causes 
it to grow and to advance in the 
earth, and that is giving it power 
and influence for good among the 
children of men. I believe, too, that 
the power of God will be exerted 
in greater measure at home and 
abroad, in proportion as the faith of 
the Latter-day Saints and their 
good work increase ; and as the 
power of the priesthood and of the 
people of God shall increase in the 
land, so the power of evil and of op- 
position will decrease, until the vic- 
tory will come to the people of God 
in righteousness. I do not expect 
any victory, any triumph, anything 
to boast of, to come to the Latter- 
day Saints, except upon the prin- 
ciples of righteousness and of truth. 
Truth and righteousness will pre- 
vail, and endure. If we will only 
continue to build upon the principles 
of righteousness, of truth, of justice 
and of honor, I say to you there is 
no power beneath the celestial king- 
dom that can stay the progress of 
this work. And as this work shall 
progress, and shall gain power and 
influence among men, so the powers 
of the adversary and of darkness 



will diminish before the advance- 
ment and growth of this kingdom, 
until the kingdom of God, and not 
of men will triumph. 

This is my testimony to you. I 
hardly need to say that I never in 
my life saw the time when I felt 
more sure of the truth that we are 
engaged in that I do today. Never 
in my life did I feel more satisfied, 
or greater assurance in my soul 
of the advancement of the cause of 
Zion, and of the divinity of the work 
that we are engaged in. I know 
that God lives, and I know that He 
is upholding this work, not you, nor 
I, no individual is doing it, no com- 
munity is doing it for themselves. 
We may co-operate, we may be 
united with the power of God, and 
help Him to hasten it on to its con- 
summation, but the honor of the ac- 
complishment of it, of its triumph 
and victory over sin, over doubt, 
over the ignorance of the world, 
will be due to Almighty God, the 
Maker of heaven and earth, the 
founder of the Church and of His 
own kingdom. It will be due to 
Him, and the people of God will ac- 
knowledge it, and will give to Him 
the honor and the glory thereof. 

It is true that we have, now and 
then, here and there, occasionally, 
persons who would, if they possibly 
could, limit the power, the knowl- 
edge, the wisdom of God Almighty, 
to the capacity of men. We have 
a few of them among us, and some 
of "them have been, and may be, 
school teachers. They will tell you 
that the scriptural testimony of the 
miraculous deeds performed by the 
Son of God while He tabernacled 
in the flesh is mere babyism, mere 
symbols, nothing real, only parable, 
that is all. They would make you 
believe that; they would make you 
and me believe, if they could, that

the Lord God never did deal with 
men except by and through man's 
own individual agency and wisdom, 
and that to the extent only of his 
own finite knowledge. They would 
make you believe that the winds and 
the waves are subject to men. They 
would, if they could, make you be- 
lieve that the Son of God, who pos- 
sessed all power, power to raise 
the dead, power to lay down His 
own life and take it up again, power 
to remit sin, power to unstop the 
ears of the deaf, to open the eyes 
of the blind, to cleanse the leper, 
to cast out evil spirits, and do all 
things, they would make you be- 
lieve that all these are simply myths, 
and that God Almighty, who has 
all power, did not do such things. 
He "could mot" turn water into 
wine, all nonsense, ridiculous, they 
say; "could not walk on the wa- 
ter;" no, all nonsense; that the Al- 
mighty "could not do such things" 
any more than men could do them. 
I say again that there are just a few 
ignoramuses, "learned fools," if you 
please, who would make you believe, 
if they could, that Almighty God_ is 
limited in His power to the capacity 
of man. Don't you believe it, not 
for one moment. 

They would make you believe, if 
they could, that the Father and Son 
did not come and reveal themselves 
to Joseph Smith, in person ; that it 
was but the imagination of Joseph 
Smith. We know better. The truth 
is overwhelming to the contrary. 
The testimony of the Spirit of the 
living God bears record to the con- 
trary, and it teaches men that these 
things are true, and that those who 
deny them are simply going outside 
of the truth into the fallacies and 
follies of the philosophies of men. 
They are not willing to abide in the 
solid, simple truth which God has 



revealed for the salvation of the 
souls of men. Beware of men who 
come to you with heresies of this 
kind, who would make you to think 
or feel that the Lord Almighty, who 
made heaven and earth and created 
all things, is limited in His dominion 
over earthly things to the capacities 
of mortal men. They try to make 
you believe that God is too busy and 
too great to trouble about earthly 
things. I am glad that there are 
comparatively few such characters 
in the world, and I hope that they 
will become more and more scarce 
until they are extinct. 

Now,I feel that I must not detain 
you too long. The Presiding Bish- 
op's office has kindly provided a few 
interesting statements in writing, 
which I will read to you with, per- 
haps, some comment as I proceed. 

During the year 1913, there was 
an increase in membership in prac- 
tically all of the stakes of Zion. The 
following items culled from the sta- 
tistical records of the Church are at 
once interesting and instructive. The 
figures refer to the organized stakes 
only, exclusive of the missions : 

"Birth rate among the Latter-day 
Saints, in the stakes, is 37 to the thou- 
sand. 

"The death rate is 9.3 to the thou- 
sand. The average age of death among 
the Latter-day Saints, is 38 years. 

"There are 8 widowers and 24 wid- 
ows to the thousand." 

And these, especially the latter 
class, are members of the Church 
who need the care that the widow 
and the fatherless usually require 
from those who are abundantly sup- 
plied with the necessaries of life, 
for, as a rule, the widow and the 
fatherless are left practically desti- 
tute of this world's goods. 

"Persons over twenty-one years of 
age, and unmarried, are fifty-one to 
the thousand. 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"The marriages were 15 to the thou- 
sand; of these marriages 8 to the thou- 
sand were solemnized in the temples, 
and 7 to the thousand were performed 
through civil ceremony outside the 
temples." 

This condition, among the Latter- 
day Saints, so far as the latter state- 
ment is concerned, should be rem- 
edied as soon as possible. I pre- 
sume the cause of it is that some of 
our young people are not properly 
trained, not properly instructed in 
their duties in the Church, and when 
they arrive at a marriageable age, 
some of them, at least, are not pre- 
pared to receive the indorsement of 
their presiding officers to go into the 
temples. 

While the rate of marriage among 
the members of the Church is per- 
haps as high as that prevailing in 
any other civilized community, it 
should, nevertheless, be higher. Our 
young people should be encouraged 
to marry at the proper age. 

This should be a text for every 
bishop, for every stake president. 
It is not good for man to be alone, 
and it is necessary that our young 
men and women should be properly 
taught the importance, the sacred- 
ness and the duty of marriage. 
Great evils occur among young peo- 
ple through neglect in teaching 
them these principles, and from fail- 
ure to encourage them to the per- 
formance of their duties, in this re- 
spect. 

"During the year, 427 members of 
the Church entered into marriages 
with non-members of the Church; and 
of these 427, it is noted that 398 were 
women." 

So that, it appears distinctly that 
it is the young women who are most 
inclined to follow the outsider, and 
to become associated in marriage 
with non-believers, which is a pity. 



"The number of members of the 
Church divorced during the year is 
163; of this number 59 had been mar- 
ried in the temples, and 104 by civil 
ceremony." 

I think that here is a point worthy 
of observation by the Latter-day 
Saints. Men and women who be- 
come united in the holy bonds of 
wedlock, according to the rites and 
ceremonies of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, enter 
into the solemn relationship with 
better understanding of the duties 
and responsibilities of marriage than 
others do, because they are taught 
more fully the facts in the case. 

"There were excommunicated from 
the Church, in the stakes of Zion, 55 
persons." 

Mostly, I suppose, for being car- 
ried away by every wind of doctrine. 
We have some foolish people who 
take up with any chimera, or fool- 
ish notion that anybody may ad- 
vance to them. They are to be 
pitied. 

"Baptisms into the Church, of chil- 
dren and adults, within the stakes, 
numbered 35 to the thousand. 

"During the year there has been a 
greater proportion of baptisms of 
adults than for several years previous; 
this gratifying result is probably due 
to the more systematic missionary ser- 
vice within the stakes, in which excel- 
lent labor the Seventies have been 
prominent Organized and well di- 
rected labor on the part of the Seven- 
ties has been conducted whereby the 
message of the Gospel has been car- 
ried to many of our non-'Mormon' 
friends who are fellow-members of the 
communities in which our people 
dwell. It is as surely our duty to 
preach the Gospel to non-members of 
the Church with whom we dwell as it 
is to carry the message of truth to the 
nations of the earth. Responsibility 
for this home missionary labor rests 
upon the local authorities — the presi- 
dents and bishops. — under whose di- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



7 



rectiou the Seventies residing in the 
several stakes and wards may be ef- 
fectively engaged, 

"It is gratifying to know, as the 
records show, that through the bene- 
fits of our local option laws, the sa- 
loon has been eliminated in communi- 
ties wherein the Latter-day Saints pre- 
dominate 

"A marked increase in the labors of 
the ward teachers is shown; and one 
of the direct results of this important 
activity is the increase in the attend- 
ance of the Latter-day Saints at their 
Sacrament meetings, and also a 
marked increase of enrollment in all 
the auxiliary organizations of the 
Church. 

"In the Ogden Stake of Zion 93% 
of all the families in the wards were 
visited by the teachers, each month, 
during the year 1913. It is but fair 
to state that this is the best record in 
the Church. 

"Great good has been accomplished 
by the regular visits of the ward bish- 
oprics to the homes of the Saints. This 
has given the bishops a personal in- 
sight into the family organization and 
home life of the people of their wards; 
and it is pleasing to note that in all 
except the largest wards, the respect- 
ive bishoprics have visited at least 
once during the year every family in 
their wards. In the larger wards, the 
bishoprics have very properly called 
to their aid experienced and influential 
brethren to assist in this annual visita- 
tion by going to the homes of the 
members, two or three together, as 
representatives of the bishopric. Ap- 
proximately 60,000 families were thus 
visited, either by the bishoprics in per- 
son or by their specially appointed 
representatives, during the closing 
months of the year 1913." 

I would like to interject here just 
a remark. We have had called to 
our attention, recently, the fact that 
some men who are of long standing 
in the Church — indeed, some of 
them born and reared in the Church, 
and who are occupying prominent 
positions in some of the quorums of 
the priesthood — when their presi- 
dents or their bishops of the wards 
in which they live call upon them to 



visit the Saints, teach the principles 
of the Gospel and perform the duties 
of teachers, they coolly inform their 
bishops that they have graduated 
from that calling, and refuse to act 
as teachers. Brother Charles W. 
Penrose is eighty-two years of age. 
I am going on seventy-six, and I be- 
lieve that I am older than several of 
these good men who have graduated 
from the duties of the Lesser Priest- 
hood, and I went to tell them and 
you that we are not too old to act as 
teachers, if you will call us to do it 
— not one of us. There is never a 
time, there never will come a time 
to those who hold the priesthood in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, when men can say 
of themselves that they have done 
enough. So long as life lasts, and 
so long as we possess ability to do 
good, to labor for the upbuilding of 
Zion and for the benefit of the hu- 
man family, we ought, with willing- 
ness, to yield with alacrity to the re- 
quirements made of us to do our 
duty, little or great. I hope that my 
friends of the Seventies and of the 
High Priests, who have graduated 
from the duties of the Lesser Priest- 
hood, will take to heart what I say 
to them, and learn better, and be 
more valiant in their duties. For it 
may just come to the point that we 
will have to deal with men who 
cease to do their duties, who have 
paid all the tithing they are going 
to pay, who have paid their tithing 
so many years that they have be- 
come old and opulent, having 
plenty of means, and can ride in 
their automobiles, etc. They can't 
afford to pay their tithing because 
they have graduated from it. I say, 
we may have to deal with some of 
these lofty, high-minded brethren, 
by and by, for their fellowship as 
members in the Church. We do not 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



want to do it, because it is all free 
will anyhow ; but when men cease 
to have the free will to do their 
duty as members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ , of Latter-day Saints, 
they ought not to be hoisted into 
responsible positions where, by their 
influence, they will destroy the faith 
of others, and we must see that this 
is not done. 

"As already indicated, the vital sta- 
tistics of the Church in the established 
stakes show a generally good condi- 
tion among the people. As compared 
with the nation as a whole, our com- 
munities show a higher birth rate, a 
lower death rate, and greater average 
duration of life. It is strongly urged 
that strict attention be given to all 
sanitary requirements and rules of 
right living. In some of the sparsely 
settled districts, the people still depend 
upon wells or open streams for their 
drinking water. Stake and ward of- 
ficers should put forth all proper ef- 
fort to secure for their communities a 
properly safe-guarded water supply. 
Strict sanitary observance should char- 
acterize all communities. Among the 
greatest foes to human health are im- 
pure drinking water, poor sanitary 
conditions, and the common house 

fly- 
Now, think of it ! Cleanliness, it 
is said, is a part of godliness. No 
unclean thing — and I think that 
means cleanliness of person, clean- 
liness of body, as well as cleanli- 
ness of heart, and cleanliness of 
spirit — no unclean thing can enter 
into the presence of God. All of us 
should do our utmost to supply our 
homes with pure water for the use 
of the home. We should provide 
for our families, as far as possible, 
every convenience of a sanitary 
character, to preserve life, and 
health, and to avoid exposures to 
colds, to weakness and sickness, in- 
cident to frontier life, in our coun- 
try homes. The idea of going into 
a home where there are children, 



and where the housewife, together 
with the children, many of them, 
have to dwell, and where not even 
the most common necessaries of the 
home are supplied for the comfort 
of the family, and day or night, 
heat or cold they must take to the 
field or back yard, rods away, to 
meet the exigencies of nature — par- 
don the expression. I deplore the 
existence of such conditions. They 
are not found very commonly, but 
where they do exist it is deplorable, 
and men should think and care for 
the welfare, comfort, safety and 
health of their wives and children, 
than to permit them to go on year 
after year in this comfortless way. 

"The Bureau of Information, located 
on the Temple Block, has continued its 
splendid service, in affordine enter- 
tainment and imparting information to 
the many tourists and transients who 
come among us. It reports that up- 
wards of 200,000 visitors were received 
at the Bureau of Information during 
the year. 

"And probably during the present 
3'ear this number' will be practically 
doubled, if not more than doubled, 
from now on until the termination of 
the great Panama Fair at San Fran- 
cisco. 

"The missionary work of the Church 
outside the stakes has been carried on 
with unabated zeal. The number of 
missionaries laboring in the several 
mission fields during the vear approx- 
imated an average of 2000: of this 
number, over 800 went from home to 
the various mission fields during the 
year. Among the missionaries are 
over 100 women, located principally in 
cities and towns where their services 
can be most properly applied. The 
presidents of stakes should feel it their 
duty to have in the mission field not 
less than six to the thousand of their 
stake population, so that the labor 
and the blessing attendant upon this 
great latter-day work may be fairly 
distributed throughout the stakes." 

I hope you will remember that. 

"The following eldfers have been 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

honorably released from their posi- 
tions as mission presidents, and have 
returned from the field since the last 
October conference : Charles H. Hyde, 
from the Australian mission; Roscoe 
W. Eardly, from the Netherlands mis- 
sion; Orson D. Romney, from the New 
Zealand mission; C. Christian Jen- 
son, from the Samoan mission; 
Franklin J. Hewlett, from the South 
African mission; A. Theodore John- 
son, from the Swedish mission. 

The positions thus vacated by the 
brethren named have been filled by 
new appointments. The mission pres- 
idents now in office are as follows: 

European mission, Elder Hyrum 
M. Smith, of the Council of the 
Twelve; Australian mission, Elder 
William W. Taylor; French mission, 
Elder Edgar B. Brossard; Hawaiian 
mission, Elder Samuel E. Wolley; 
Japanese mission, Elder H. Grant 
Ivins; Mexican mission, Elder Rey 
L. Pratt; Netherlands mission, Elder 
LeGrand Richards; New Zealand mis- 
sion, Elder William Gardner; Samoan 
mission, Elder John A. Nelson, Jr.; 
Scandinavian mission. Elder Martin 
Christopherson; South African mis- 
sion, Elder Nicholas G. Smith ; Swed- 
ish mission, Elder Theodore Tobia- 
son ; Swiss and German mission, El- 
der Hyrum W. Valentine ; Tahitian 
mission, Elder Franklin J. Fullmer. 

And within the United States : Cal- 
ifornia mission, Elder Joseph E. Rob- 
inson ; Central States mission, Elder 
Samuel O. Bennion; Eastern States 
mission, Elder Walter P. Monson ; 
Northern States mission, Elder Ger- 
man- E. Ellsworth; North-western 
States mission, Elder Melvin J. Bal- 
lard ; Southern States mission, Elder 
Charles A. Callis ; Western States 
mission, Elder John L. Herrick; Ios- 
epa Colony, Elder T. A. Waddoups. 

"There are now 724 organized 
wards, and in addition; 27 branches, 
within the stakes of Zion. There are 
65 stakes of Zion, and 21 missions, 
aside from the Iosepa Colony. Of 
the 724 wards, 607 own meeting 
houses, most of which are of modern 
construction and have cost from $5,000 
to $35.00 each." 

And some of them a great deal 
more than that. 



"There are 117 wards not yet pro- 
vided with permanent meeting 
houses." 

And we want some of you good 
brethren of the wards, who are en- 
gaged in building meeting houses 
today, to bear in mind these 117 
wards yet unsupplied with meeting 
houses, and that they will be 
calling upon us for help, by and by. 
Make your burdens as light upon 
us as you can, unless you decide to 
increase the tithing. If you will get 
all the non-tithe payers in your 
wards, who claim to be members 
of the Church, to pay a full tithing, 
and everybody else will do like- 
wise, we will not ask you to call 
upon the people to build your meet- 
ing houses. The Trustee-in-Trust 
will do it for you. But we cannot 
do it until more of the people will 
do their duty. 

"During the year 1913, one new 
stake of Zion (Boise stake,) and 26 
rew wr'ls were organized; four new 
stake presidents were appointed and 
installed, also 115 bishops, and 155 ward 
derks." 

So we keep changing all the 
while. Some die, some move away, 
and this creates a necessity for a 
new supply of men to fill these posi- 
tions. 

"The Church has not failed in its 
duty to the worthy poor. The hearts 
of the bishops are always open to 
provide for the needs of those who 
otherwise would be left in want. Our 
splendid Relief Society organization did 
more in aiding the poor and min- 
istering to the needy, during the year 
1913, than in any previous year since 
its organization." 

I think this is a well deserved 
word of credit to the Relief Soci- 
eties of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and possibly

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



if our General Board had been a 
little more active in their efforts 
among the Latter-day Saints, go- 
ing out and setting the proper ex- 
ample before them, even a greater 
work than this might have been ac- 
complished. 

"A very considerable item among 
the many expenditures of the Church 
for benevolent purposes is the aid 'ex- 
tended to our Mexican refugees. 

"The Church has sought to provide, 
as far as possible, mission headquart- 
ers and places of worship in the dif- 
ferent missions as the need for such 
appears. At the present time the mis- 
sions hold, as the property of the 
Church used strictly for missionary 
services and places of worship, houses 
as follows : 



British mission 9 

California mission 5 

Central States mission 10 

Eastern States mission 4 

Hawaiian mission 9 

Iosepa Colony 1 

Japanese mission 1 

Netherlands mission 2 

New Zealand mission 3 

Northern States mission 6 

Northwestern States mission 6 

Samoan mission 8 

Scandinavian mission 6 

Swedish mission 1 

Southern States mission 46 

Tahitian mission 2 

Western States mission.. 3 



All 46 places in the Southern 
States mission, with the exception 
of the headquarters in Chattanooga, 
have been provided for by the mis- 
sion itself. The president of the 
Southern States mission has made 
his mission self-sustaining, and is 
able to send a portion of the tith- 
ings of the people there to the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office, besides. I 
think it is a worthy example for 
some of the rest of our brethren. 

To me these are very interesting 
facts, and I think they are facts that 
everybody in the Church should 
know. I would like to say that the 



books in the Bishop's office are open 
to Latter-day Saints. There isn't 
a Latter-day Saint anywhere who 
may not obtain information with 
reference to these matters and 
others of interest to himself, at any 
time when he desires to obtain them 
for his own information and benefit, 
and for the work of the ministry 
in which he may be engaged. It is 
open to him. 

Now, the Lord bless you. I hope 
you will pardon me for occupying 
so much of your time. God bless 
Zion. My heart is with this work, 
and this people. I love God. I 
know that He is, and I know that 
my Redeemer lives. May the Lord 
help us to abide in the truth and 
be faithful and vigilant and valiant 
unto the winding up of our labor in 
life, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

to Thee."

Missionaries admonished to economize — - 
Political affiliations should not antag- 
onize Church members — Teach the 
Gospel at home to the children — All 
members of the Church should work to 
save souls — Blessings invoked. 

I am sure that we have all been 
edified this morning by the splendid 
discourse delivered by President 
Smith, and by the music we have lis- 
tened to. It is indeed good to be 
here. It is remarkable to me that 
so many df the members of the 
Church are able to be present at the 
opening session of this conference. 
This house is now filled so that if 
those who are standing were seated, 
every seat would be occupied. 

I wonder how many of us have 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



11 



examined ourselves this morning, 
during the remarks of President 
Smith. How many of us have asked 
ourselves the question, "Are the de- 
linquencies referred to in any way 
applicable to me?" For, after all, 
the purpose of our coming together 
is that we may receive the inspira- 
tion of the Spirit of the Lord, and 
that we may be taught the things 
that will be beneficial to us if we 
apply them in our lives. 

From all portions of the world 
comes the glad tidings that investi- 
gation of the truth is increasing. 
From every mission field, without 
exception, comes the request for 
more missionaries than we are able 
to supply, and in many cases they 
are sorely needed. Many of the 
wards keep their full quota of mis- 
sionaries in the field, and are reap- 
ing the benefits that follow such a 
course. 

While speaking on missionary 
work, I desire to call your attention 
to the fact that, in the mission field, 
our representatives are doing a mag- 
nificent work, and the result of every 
effort is manifest in numerous con- 
versions to the truth. I would like 
to direct the attention of Presidents 
of Stakes, Bishops of Wards, and 
parents in Israel to the fact that 
many of our elders are expending 
more money in the mission field than 
they should, and that the excess of 
money they are using is often harm- 
ful to them and to the cause of God. 
Some of our elders , send home for 
funds with the expectation that their 
demand will be met, no matter what 
the financial condition of their fam- 
ily may be. I believe they do this 
thoughtlessly, in most cases, but the 
fact is the elder who expends much 
means in the mission field usually 
Hoes it in a way that it is not fruit- 
ful of blessings to himself, or ben- 



eficial to the Church. We would 
like those in authority in the stakes 
and wards to give this matter atten- 
tion, and see if we cannot impress 
upon the minds of our sons going 
into the world the importance of liv- 
ing as much as possible in the homes 
of the people. That they may teach 
them the truth and confer blessings 
on those who entertain them. 

It is a pleasure to mingle with 
the elders who have filled successful 
missions, who have returned from 
the nations of the earth in honor. 
They bring with them a spirit of 
happiness and satisfaction. They 
come home feeling that they have 
done well, and they know, if they 
have done their duty, that the Lord 
is pleased with them, and with the 
efforts they have put forth to bless 
their fellows. 

From time to time we are arrayed 
against each other in political cam- 
paigns. I don't know another peo- 
ple more intense than we are during 
such periods, and I regret that men 
are sometimes led to say and do 
things that are unworthy of a Lat- 
ter-day Saint. The great political 
parties are necessary. It is import- 
ant that our liberties be preserved, 
and all should be interested, and it 
seems to me that we can be consist- 
ent Church members and take part 
in politics, while we accord to others 
the privileges we claim for our- 
selves. We should be deeply con- 
cerned in the welfare of the nation, 
and sustain good and great men. as 
the Lord has commanded us, in or- 
der that we may continue to enjoy 
freedom. Some of our brethren 
have become so wrapped up in their 
political ambitions that they place 
them in advance of their faith in 
God. Quite recently, one man was 
heard to remark that he could not 
believe in a church which taught 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that the constitution of the United 
States was inspired of God, yet we 
believe it was inspired. This, of 
course, is an extreme case, yet is an 
indication of what we might be 
tempted to say. I would like to ad- 
monish you not to let your political 
ambitions lead up to make remarks 
that would wound your fellows, and 
draw you away from the Church. 
Whenever your politics cause you to 
speak unkindly of your brethren, 
know this, that you are upon dan- 
gerous ground. Remember that, 
after the great political nations of 
this world have crumbled and fallen 
to decay, the Church of Jesus Christ, 
with which you are identified, will 
be in existence, and the Master 
Himself will continue to be its head. 
Let us not become so worked up in 
our feelings that we shut our eyes 
to the greater blessings, to the most 
important thing, the salvation of our 
souls. Let us not ally ourselves 
with bodies of men who would tear 
down and break in pieces this gov- 
ernment, that was founded under 
the inspiration of God the Eternal 
Father. We cannot belong to any 
political party that is opposed to this 
free government and be consistent 
Latter-day Saints. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the unity that exists among you. I 
am gratified as I travel from place 
to place to find in the homes of our 
people the spirit of love and kind- 
ness. They are attending to their 
daily prayers. Their children are 
being taught to pray, and ask a 
blessing upon the food. Fathers and 
mothers are teaching their children 
to honor God and to keep His com- 
mandments. All these things give 
me joy, and I am thankful for the 
peace that I find in such homes. 

In our homes, brethren and sis- 
ters, it is our privilege, nay, it is our 



duty, to call our families together to 
be taught the truths of the Holy 
Scriptures. In every home, children 
should be encouraged to read the 
word of the Lord, as it has been re- 
vealed to us in all dispensations. We 
should read the Bible, the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and the Pearl of Great Price ; 
not only read it in our homes, but 
explain it to our children, that they 
may understand the hand dealings 
of God with the peoples of the earth. 
Let us see if we cannot do more of 
this in the tfuture than we have done 
in the past. Let each one in this 
congregation today ask himself : 
"Have I done my duty in my home 
in reading and in teaching the Gos- 
pel, as it has been revealed through 
the prophets of the Lord?" If we 
have not let us repent of our neglect 
and draw our families around us and 
teach them the truth. 

I would like to suggest that some 
of these older men, who have raised 
their own families, may, with profit, 
go into the homes of their sons and 
daughters and, by right of their 
fatherhood, call those families to- 
gether and teach them the things 
that are necessary for them to know. 
On every hand we can find oppor- 
tunity for the use of the talents our 
Father has blessed us with. Let us 
do individual work with our breth- 
ren and sisters. If we find a man 
or a woman who has not succeeded 
in life, one who is weakening in his 
faith, let us not turn our backs upon 
him ; let us make it a point to visit 
him, and go to him in kindness and 
love, and encourage him to turn 
from the error of his way. The op- 
portunity to do individual work 
among us as a people is present 
everywhere ; and there are few men 
and few women in this Church who 
could not, if they would, reach out 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



13 



a little 'farther from the circle with 
which they are identified, and say 
a kind word, or teach the truth to 
some of our Father's children who 
are not being reached by the organ- 
izations of the Church, because we 
are unable to gather them in. This 
is our Father's work. It is the most 
important thing that we will be iden- 
tified with in this life. All that we 
do to build it up will be profitable to 
us. Every kind act that we perform 
for one of our Father's children is 
but a permanent investment made 
by us that will bear eternal divi- 
dends. We spend our time seeking 
the riches of this life, and on every 
hand opportunities are being ne- 
lgected that would lay up for us 
treasures in heaven, where moth and 
rust do not corrupt nor thieves break 
in and steal. The Lord will not 
hold President Smith responsible for 
the conduct of this great Church, 
only so far as he is required to per- 
form his duties in it, but you and I, 
each and everyone, are responsible 
to the Father of us all for the time 
we expend in this life, and for the 
efforts that we make in one direc- 
tion or another. It is just as import- 
ant that those of us, who may feel 
that we are down in the ranks, 
should be fasting and praying and 
working for the salvation of the 
souls of men, as that those who are 
presiding over us should. It is just 
as important for you and for me to 
let our light so shine that others, 
seeing our good works, may glorify 
our Father in heaven, as that those 
who have been called to preside over 
us in the Church should do so. I am 
afraid some Off us expect others to 
spend all their lives in the interest of 
the Church, many times to the ne- 
glect of their own families, in order 
that this work may continue on to 
the successful fruition ; but forget 



that we ought to do as much as 
they if we expect the blessing. 

Now let us examine ourselves. 
Are we doing as much as we 
should? And if we are not, let us 
turn around and do better. If we 
are doing as we should, if we are 
reaching out in all directions to do 
good to the children of our Father, 
then we will bring to ourselves the 
blessing of an all wise Father, and 
we will rejoice in the good that we 
accomplish here. When we go to 
the other side of the veil, we will 
receive there the thanks and grati- 
tude of those for whom we have la- 
bored in this life. Let us be humble 
and prayerful, living near to our 
Heavenly Father, and evidence our 
belief in the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
by living up to its principles. Let 
us evidence our faith in God, and in 
the work He has given to the earth, 
by a correct and consistent life, for 
after all that is the strongest testi- 
mony that we will be able to bear 
of the truth of this work. 

I am grateful for the companion- 
ship that I have with my brethren 
and sisters in the Church. I am 
grateful that I have been considered 
worthy to have a name in this great 
organization of our Father, and 
thank you one and all for all the 
comfort that you have given me in 
the times that are past, when we 
have had the privilege of meeting 
in your homes in the stakes of Zion, 
I appreciate your consideration and 
kindness to me, and to the brethren 
who come to you, from time to time, 
from the headquarters of the 
Church. 

May the Lord add His blessings ; 
may His peace be upon us ; may the 
spirit of kindness, of love, and of 
charity which we possess lead us to 
our neighbors who are not of our 
faith. May the disposition that we 
manifest to honor all men, and ac- 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cord to them their liberties inspire 
in the hearts of some of those who 
are not of us a desire to do the same. 
May the testimony that we bear, that 
God lives and that Jesus is the 
Christ and the Redeemer of the 
world, find lodgement in the breasts 
of those who do not understand it, 
and, by reason of that testimony, 
may they be brought to a knowl- 
edge of the truth. May this great 
work of our Father, in these last 
days, continue to roll on, not to do 
any man harm but to uplift every 
soul with which it comes in contact. 
May it continue to spread abroad in 
the earth for the lifting up and en- 
couragement of all our Father's 
children, and for the alleviation of 
their distress of mind, and the con- 
ditions they bring upon themselves 
by disobedience to the laws of our 
God. 

May His peace be upon all Israel. 
May His peace be upon the land in 
which we live. May He bless those 
who stand at the head of this gov- 
ernment, that they may be inspired 
to labor for the good and the wel- 
fare of all the people who dwell 
here. May the influence of this na- 
tion be for the liberty and enlight- 
ment of all the nations of the earth ; 
may they see in this great republic, 
the organization which was inspired 
by our Father, that righteousness 
will lead them to better lives, and 
that will bring to them the oppor- 
tunity to worship God according to 
the dictates of their conscience, that 
thereby, they may be able to return 
into His presence. 

May His peace be upon you all, 
and His blessing upon all Israel, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

Afflictions beneficial — Growth of 
" Mormonism " — " Go-to-Meeting- 
Sunday" movement — Religion of 
Christ both spiritual and temporal — 
Figurative sayings of the Savior — ■ 
Actual realities of divine manifesta- 
tions and miracles — Disposition of 
the tithes — The Lord is with His 
Church. 

I am very grateful for the privi- 
lege of attending this conference. I 
always have had thankfulness in my 
heart at every conference that I 
have ever attended. I have very 
little to boast about, but a great deal 
to be thankful for, and today I feel 
more than ever my dependence on 
the Lord, upon His providences and 
mercies for my daily life and health 
and for the exercise of my calling 
in the holy priesthood. I prize my 
standing in the Church and the 
authority bestowed upon me to min- 
ister in the things of the kingdom 
more than anything else. The Lord 
has indeed been good to me all my 
days, and recently, in the afflictions 
that I have passed through in conse- 
quence of some accidents that befell 
me, if that is a proper term to use, 
I felt my dependence upon the Lord 
and I recognize more than ever His 
kindness to me. It is good to know 
that we can draw near to the Lord, 
and sometimes afflictions are need- 
ful that we may feel our dependence 
upon our heavenly Father fully, and 
be made to feel grateful in our souls 
for His kindness and mercies to us. 

I can say, this afternoon, that I 



do feel grateful indeed to my heav- 
enly Father that I am able to be 
here today to listen to the voices of 
His servants, to mingle with the 
Saints, and to feel the sacred influ- 
ence that attends us in our gather- 
ing. For I did feel this morning 
that the Spirit and power of God 
were with us, and I enjoyed im- 
mensely the address that we heard 
from our President. The informa- 
tion that was imparted, as well as his 
own instructions were of very great 
value to us. I am glad that the re- 
port which he read will be printed 
so that we all can read it if we will. 
I hope we are all readers of the Des- 
eret News, as well as other period- 
icals that are published, because in 
that paper we will be likely to re- 
ceive a full report of the address 
that was given to us this morning, 
with the very valuable statistics that 
were read and the instructions that 
were imparted in connection with 
them. 

It is very clear from what we 
heard this morning that Zion is 
growing, and that the work of the 
Lord is spreading throughout the 
world ; that that which is called 
"Mormonism" is not going back- 
ward but is marching forward, and 
not only our numbers are increasing 
but the faithfulness of the members 
of the Church is made more promi- 
nent. I believe that the Church is 
better organized now than ever. 
Our President said the conditions 
are better than ever before, and 
I am sure that what he said is 
correct, and that there is a feeling 
growing in the hearts of the mem- 
bers of this Church, that it is neces- 
sary to their happiness and well be- 
ing and their salvation, to adhere 
strictly to the principles and teach- 
ings of the Church of which they 
are members. It is different with 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us than with people in other denom- 
inations, not that I wish to say any- 
thing deprecatory of them, but in 
our Church the members are ex- 
pected to be religious all the time, 
not merely on Sunday but every day 
of the week, and every moment of 
their lives ; and that while they may 
not be able to live up fully to the 
standard which is set before them, 
they are working up in that direc- 
tion. They are not going backward ; 
they are growing in grace and in the 
knowledge of the truth, end this is 
very cheering. They are growing 
in the duties that belong to them in 
a family capacity. They are grow- 
ing in their attendance at places of 
worship. They are growing in the 
daily practice of the principles that 
conduce to bodily health and to 
spiritual advancement. This is evi- 
dent from the reports that are re- 
ceived from time to time ; and not- 
withstanding the many failures on 
the part of some people and the de- 
partures from the truth which oc- 
casionally occur, yet in the main, in 
the mass, the people called Latter- 
day Saints are advancing. 

They are progressing truly. Not 
in the sense in which some people 
claim the title of "Progressives ;" 
not going back to old, discarded 
and obsolete things, but reaching 
forward on a firm foundation, hav- 
ing planted their feet firmly on the 
rock of Truth. They are reaching 
up to the higher powers, and the 
Lord is with them and their pro- 
gress is sure and steady in an up- 
ward direction. You can progress 
downward as well as progress up- 
ward, but our prize, the prize and 
mark of our high calling is in 
Christ Jesus; in His doctrine, in 
His principles, in His glorious 
example. He is the great exemp- 
lar, and while we lay hold upon the 



truths which He has revealed, both 
in former and in latter days, we can 
imitate, we can emulate and walk 
up to the life and character of our 
Redeemer, that we may indeed be 
like Him, and so by and by become 
fit to dwell in His presence. 

There is a movement on foot in 
the world to try to get people to go 
to church on Sunday. Notice will 
be seen in the Deseret News this 
evening in regard to that matter, 
which is desirable to be made state- 
wide, not only to occur in a few 
places but throughout the state, that 
people will go to church on a cer- 
tain Sunday designated. That is a 
very good movement, so far as it 
goes, and we are in accord with it, 
because we believe in going to 
church every Sunday ; not only one 
particular Sunday in one particu- 
lar month in one particular year, 
but, according to the command- 
ment given to us by the Lord Jesus 
Christ in latter days — I am not 
speaking of the old scripture but 
the revelation of God to us through 
Jesus Christ in the last days — 
which will be found in the fifty- 
ninth section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and in which we are told 
to serve the Lord and worship Him 
at all times, under all circumstances ; 
but on His holy day — He claims this 
seventh day or first day — it de- 
pends upon where you start from, 
to make it the first or seventh — one 
day out of seven at any rate, on His 
day, the day on which He rose 
from the dead, Sunday as we call 
it, the new Sabbath, the Christian 
Sabbath, on that day we are to do 
none other thing but devote our- 
selves to divine worship and ser- 
vice. We may partake of food, 
prepared with singleness of heart, 
but we are not to perform our usual 
labors but to go up to the Lord's 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

house on this, His holy day and 
worship Him in the spirit of holi- 
ness, to offer up our sacraments 
and pay our devotions to the Most 
High, to forgive one another if 
there be differences in our feelings 
with each other, to feel in our 
hearts that we want to bless man- 
kind and to serve the Lord and be- 
come sanctified unto Him. 

To be truly His people we have 
to "seek first the kingdom of God 
and His righteousness," and all 
other things will be added to us in 
the due time of the Lord. Though 
we set our hearts sometimes upon 
the things of this world, they will 
perish with the using and pass away 
like the dream of a night vision ; 
but that which abides and remains 
are the eternal verities, the things 
of God, the principles that go to 
make up His kingdom and the 
righteousness that makes up His 
character. If we serve the Lord 
with all our hearts, and place His 
work first in our souls, and practise 
righteousness according to the pat- 
tern that God reveals, everything 
that is of worth in all the eternities, 
throughout all the regions of space, 
everything that is good and beauti- 
ful and glorious and happif ying, that 
makes for progress, for intelli- 
gence, for light, for wisdom, for 
power and for dominion will be 
ours. All things will be ours, and 
we shall be Christ's and Christ will 
be the Father's. Now that is the 
kind of religion that we have. This 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints embodies these princi- 
ples and it finds rules for our action 
in every department of life. It goes 
down to the commonest and so- 
called lowest things, and it rises to 
the highest. 

Some of our good friends, if I 
may call them such, try to make it 



appear that the Latter-day Saints' 
religion is a mere religion of tem- 
poralities and grosser things. That 
is where they make one of their big 
mistakes. While the Church of 
Christ reaches down to every de- 
partment of life, here on the earth, 
in the flesh, and takes hold of what 
are called temporal things, yet it 
reaches up to the very highest. We 
are told that the priesthood after 
the order of Melchizedek reaches 
up not only to the ministration of 
angels and to the beings that are 
spiritual and to the heavenly Jeru- 
salem, but to Christ, the Redeemer, 
and to God, who is the Father of 
all. Rising up to the highest and 
reaching down to the lowest, the 
religion of the Lord Jesus Christ 
takes it all in and gives us rules 
and regulations for our conduct 
day by day and hour by hour, that 
we may be His people and that we 
may enjoy all there is to be en- 
joyed, both temporal and spiritual, 
and finally be. prepared for the im- 
mediate society and presence of our 
Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, 
His beloved Son, our elder Brother 
in the spirit, and all the good and 
true and the just and the pure from 
God's creations ; to mingle with 
them, to be in their company, to be 
one with them. That is our destiny, 
and in order to reach it, we have to 
bring ourselves in subjection to 
righteous laws and principles and 
orders and rules and ordinances, 
which are all, in their place, neces- 
sary to bring us to the great ultima- 
tum and fulness of glory and of 
power and of dominion and of joy 
which shall be eternal. 

So we want to observe the Sun- 
day services every Sunday. Breth- 
ren and sisters, you that have come 
here to conference today, do not 
forget that. You have heard that told 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a great many times, to carry away 
with you a determination that you 
will not only go to meeting now 
and then, but that you will observe 
the Sunday law that God has re- 
vealed. Not of going to Church for 
one day or one Sunday in the year, 
but regularly on the Lord's day, 
you will consecrate yourselves to 
His service; go up to His holy 
house, be in unison with the Saints, 
partake of the holy sacrament in 
remembrance of His body and of 
His blood shed for the remission of 
sins, and receiving a renewal of His 
Spirit, you may be able to serve 
Him during the coming week, ev- 
ery day, and be under the influence 
and direction of His Spirit; and in 
that you will have joy and peace. 
We want to establish peace in our 
homes. We want to have this Sun- 
day spirit where we dwell. We 
want to be neighborly and kind, and 
have that good Spirit in our hearts 
spoken of by our President this 
morning, that Jesus Christ taught 
in that grand sermon on the mount. 
Not that we want to carry out lit- 
erally, perhaps, everything that He 
said; some sayings of Jesus Christ 
are figurative in their nature. In 
the parables that He gave there are 
figures of speech, but right behind 
them all are facts and truths that 
we want to lay hold of and under- 
stand. 

President Smith spoke this morn- 
ing of the injunction of the Savior, 
"If a man smite thee on the one 
cheek, turn to him the other." We 
may not be able to come up to that 
yet fully in the literal sense, but we 
can live in the spirit of it, and we 
can forgive one another for in- 
juries, and we' can say, "I will not 
seek to do evil to that man that did 
evil to me, or that woman who tried 
to do evil to me, but I will do good 



for evil, and if I can do a good 
turn to the person who injured me, 
I will do it;" that is the spirit we 
should manifest. I remember once 
that back in London we had an old 
veteran of the army who was a 
member of the Church ; he was or- 
dained a priest, and used to go out 
and preach on the street. One Sun- 
day he was preaching and a man 
came up and slapped him in the 
face. "Now," he cried, "if you are 
a Christian, turn the other cheek." 
So he turned it, but exclaimed, ex- 
tending his clenched fist, "Hit again 
and down you go." Well, I sup- 
pose many of us have that kind of 
spirit, but he was willing to -comply 
with the rule, and if the man had 
slapped him on the other cheek I 
think he would have gone down. 
So, as I said, many of the sayings 
of Jesus Christ are couched in fig- 
urative language. 

For instance, "If thy right hand 
offend thee, cut it off." But He did 
not mean that to apply literally to 
the physical hand. It was the spirit 
of it that was intended. If we have 
anybody in the Church who will not 
obey the laws of the Church, who 
will transgress the commandments 
of God, though that person may be 
one with authority and power, hav- 
ing done a great deal of good and 
with a great deal of influence, even 
if we should regard him as the right 
hand of the ward or stake where he 
belongs, yet if he will not be obedi- 
ent to the laws of Christ, he has to 
be severed from the Church. The 
same idea in regard to the saying, 
"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck 
it out." He did not mean for you 
to pull your eye out because it does 
not do its duty properly; but there 
was a great principle lying behind 
these figures of speech. When we 
read the scriptures we should seek 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 



19 



to understand the sense, spirit and 
meaning of the phrases that are 
used. But we have to be very cau- 
tious in regard to that other matter 
that the President was speaking of 
this morning; that some people 
want to make it appear that iaz 
statements in the scriptures con- 
cerning the revelations of God, 
His personal manifestations and 
those events that are called 
miraculous, are only imaginary; 
that the narration of them is 
only figurative. Let us be cautious 
about that. We must understand 
that when it is stated in these latter 
days that the Father and the Son 
appeared to Joseph Smith when he 
was a boy, the account is literally 
true, that they really appeared. He 
did not imagine it ; he did not dream 
it; they manifested themselves to 
him, and what he received was a 
message from the eternal worlds, 
and all the communications to him 
by angelic ministers ; all those ad- 
ministrations of John the Baptist 
and of Peter, James and John, and 
of Elijah, and Moses, and all those 
worthies spoken of as having vis- 
ited the prophet in the Kirtland 
temple, that these were realities. He 
saw them, he heard them. He did 
not evolve the ideas out of his own 
inner consciousness or mind. They 
were not imaginary. And so in re- 
gard to these manifestations in 
ancient times. When Moses went 
up into the mount, and we are told 
that "he' saw the God of Israel," the 
writer narrated a fact. When 
"Moses and Aaron, and Nadab and 
Abihu and seventy of the elders of 
Israel went up into the mount and 
saw the God of Israel," and de- 
scribed Him, what was under His 
feet and told about His hand not be- 
ing laid upon them, they narrated 
what they saw and heard, and the 



statement that is written by Moses 
is a statement of fact, not some- 
thing imaginary. 

These great truths that have come 
from the manifestations of God to 
the human family, abide ; they are 
for our benefit. It is good for us 
to listen to the voice of inspiration 
and of instruction concerning them. 
And in these last days let us under- 
stand fully that the Church to which 
we belong is not founded upon any 
mere imagination or the thoughts 
and ideas and notions of men. It 
has come down out of heaven to 
the earth. The authority of the holy 
priesthood was not here. It did not 
continue from the days of the Sa- 
vior down to the present time, 
through any of the denominations 
claiming succession. The world 
fell into darkness and into corrup- 
tion and abomination, and went 
astray from the Lord. While many 
good men and good women existed 
on the earth, serving the Lord to 
the best of their ability, all author- 
ity and power in the holy priesthood 
were taken away from the earth, 
and the world was left to itself, and 
to the notions and opinions of men, 
and hence the confusion among the 
jarring sects and contending organ- 
izations of the latter times. 

But the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints has come from 
God to man. It was not evolved 
out of the ideas and opinions of 
men. It has not been organized by 
the wisdom of men, but every prin- 
ciple, every ordinance, every doc- 
trine, every form of authority has 
been sent clown in the last days from 
the heavens to the earth, and these 
are all embodied in the splendid or- 
ganization which is called by the 
name of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. It is Christ's 
Church. He made it. He built it 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



up. Through Him came all the rev- 
elations from God to the Church, 
and He is with the Church now. 
And the Holy Ghost, the "person- 
age of spirit," who bears witness of 
the Father and of the Son, is with 
this Church. That divine spirit 
which proceeds from the presence 
of God throughout the immensity 
of space, by which God created all 
things, spiritual as well as tem- 
poral, is in this Church, and is en- 
joyed by the members thereof, ac- 
cording to their faithfulness and 
diligence in seeking after it, and 
after these inspirations and gifts 
and manifestations. The Trinity — 
God — the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost, making one Trinity 
and Deity, are with this Church, 
and they have built it up and they 
are going to stay with it, because a 
majority of the people of this 
Church are going to stay by these 
glorious truths that have been re- 
vealed, and live them in their lives, 
and train up their children in the 
way they should go, so that a purer 
and better and stronger and might- 
ier generation will grow up to carry 
on the work of this kingdom. I re- 
joice in looking forward to the 
prospects of this Church, to its fu- 
ture. It will be great and glorious, 
and the time will come when the 
kingdoms of this world will be- 
come the kingdom of our God and 
His Christ, and He will rule and 
reign from the rivers to the ends of 
the earth, as the ancient prophets 
predicted. 

I thank the Lord for the good 
things we heard this morning in re- 
gard to the progress of this work, 
and I bear testimony that they are 
true. One thing I hope will be im- 
pressed upon the minds of our 
brethren and sisters from the dif- 
ferent parts of Zion, and that is the 



statement that was read this morn- 
ing by the President, that the tithes 
they pay — some of them — that the 
tithes that are collected in the vari- 
ous parts of Zion are expended 
right within the stakes to the ex- 
tent of at least sixty per cent. If I 
were to express my own opinion, I 
would say the percentage is greater, 
and I think it will so be found 
when we get our statistics entirely 
and fully compiled ; but the great 
bulk of the tithing is expended 
right in the stakes where the funds 
are collected. There are applica- 
tions made every day to the Trus- 
tee-in-Trust for means to use in the 
erection or improvement of meeting 
houses and amusement halls, and so 
forth ; so that there is a constant 
drain on the resources of the 
Church for the building up of the 
different stakes and wards of Zion. 
These things may be called tempor- 
al, but they are absolutely essential 
and they are a part of our great 
work, for the Lord has established 
Zion temporally as well as spiritu- 
ally. His power is in it and His 
providences are over it, and He will 
be with it and with every individual 
in it, according to their faith and 
diligence in seeking after Him. 

We believe in the spiritual things 
as well as the temporal things. Part 
of our baptism is spiritual. We are 
baptized in water by burial and 
raising up again for the remission 
of sins, and then we receive the 
Holy Ghost as a gift from God to 
us. It has various manifestations, 
but is the same Spirit. It is the 
light of the Lord. It is the witness 
for God. It enlightens ; it comforts ; 
it heals ; it strengthens, it leads us 
on to progress, to comprehend 
truth as God sees it, and to walk in 
the light thereof, and to become 
sanctified unto Him. By the power 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 21 



of that Spirit our souls can reach up 
to the highest. Don't I know that 
this is a fact? I do. In my ca- 
reer in this Church I have been 
placed many times, especially when 
on foreign missions, in positions 
where I needed to know the mind 
of the Lord, and by faith and 
prayer it has come to me, and I re- 
joice in bearing testimony of it. I 
do not think that I should feel that 
I lived really, if I could not be in 
communion with the higher powers 
by the gift and power of the Holy 
Ghost. The Spirit of God is for us 
all. We are baptized in it when we 
are confirmed, and it is our priv- 
ilege to be guided by it always and 
to walk in its light and to have its 
joy and comfort and inspiration, 
and this can be our continual lot day 
by day. If we will observe the laws 
and commandments and rules and 
regulations given to us in this 
Church, the Lord will be with us ; 
all things will work together for 
our good as individuals. Our very 
trials and difficulties, and the pains 
that we pass through sometimes, 
will inure to our experience and 
growth and benefit, and some day 
we will recognize that "all things 
have been done in the wisdom of 
Him that knoweth all things." 

I feel full of joy and peace this 
afternoon to be in the midst of the 
Saints. I thank God for His good- 
ness to me. I hope to live for the 
truth while my remaining days shall 
be upon the earth, and then when 
my time of departure comes I hope 
to mingle with the blest and labor 
behind the veil, no matter in what 
capacity. As the President showed 
this morning, we are willing to la- 
bor as teachers, or deacons, or do 
anything for the building up of the 
kingdom, either in the body or out 
of the body, wherever we are, wher- 



ever we go. We want to live up to 
our Father and our God, to walk in 
His ways, and observe the laws of 
His righteousness and to prepare 
ourselves eventually for a glorious 
resurrection into His divine pres- 
ence. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful and true, keep our covenants 
and preserve ourselves from the 
evils of this world. May peace be 
in the homes of the Saints. May the 
power of God rest upon these good 
brethren who are here — the Presi- 
dents of Stakes and their counsel- 
ors, the Bishops of wards and their 
counselors, and the teachers and la- 
borers in the vineyard of the Lord 
at home and abroad ; that they may 
carry with them a sacred and holy 
influence, and be able to give coun- 
sel and instruction to the people, 
and answer the numerous questions 
that are arising, many of which 
come up to the First Presidency and 
need not come there, but could go to 
these brethren who preside in the 
wards and stakes of Zion. God 
bless you, my brethren, with wis- 
dom and understanding and inspira- 
tion, and may the light and bless- 
ings of the Lord which we are en- 
joying here in conference, spread 
abroad to the uttermost parts of the 
earth wherever there is a Saint of 
God desiring His blessing. May 
the work continue to increase and 
spread forth and prevail, unto the 
great consummation, when the earth 
shall be redeemed and Christ shall 
be our King, and God, the Father, 
will come and visit His people, and 
be their God, wipe away all tears 
from their eyes, and there shall no 
more be any sorrow or mourning 
or death, but all things shall be light 
and life and blessing and praise 
and glory, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



A soprano solo, "The Lord is my 
Light," was sung by Retta S. 
Payne, of Clearfield. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

To speak or minister in God's name a 
serious responsibility. — Meaning and 
importance of "the new and ever- 
lasting covenant." — Marriage de- 
signed by God to be an eternal re- 
lationship. — God's law of marriage 
changed by men, who limit it to this 
life. 

Brethren and sisters, I will read a 
few words from the Doctrine and 
Covenants, section 132: 

"Behold! mine house is a house of 
order, saith the Lord God, and not a 
house of confusion. 

"Will I accept of an offering, saith 
the Lord, that is not made in my 
name! 

"Or, will I receive at your hands 
that which I have not appointed! 

"And will I appoint unto you, saith 
the Lord, except it be by law, even as 
I and my Father ordained unto you, 
before the world was! 

"I am the Lord thy God, and I give 
unto you this commandment, that no 
man shall come unto the Father but 
by me, or by my word, which is my 
law, saith the Lord; 

"And everything that is in the 
world, whether it be ordained of men, 
by thrones, or principalities, or pow- 
ers, or things of name, whatsoever 
they may be, that are not by me, or 
by my word, saith the Lord, shall be 
thrown down, and shall not remain 
after men are dead, neither in nor after 
the resurrection, saith the Lord your 
God; 

"For whatsoever things remain, are 
by me; and whatsoever things are 
not by me, shall be shaken and de- 
stroyed." 

These very remarkable words 
were given by revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and through 
them we are distinctly given to un- 
derstand that the Lord's house is 
a house of order and that He gov- 



erns by law and not by chance. The 
Lord practically states that it is 
His law, and this might very 
well be applied to the law of the 
Gospel, for that is the law which 
God has given us, and by which He 
governs His people, and builds up 
and establishes His work upon the 
earth. Those who administer in the 
name of the Lord ought to be very 
careful and know of a surety that 
they enjoy divine authority. It is a 
very serious thing to speak in the 
name of the Lord. You will re- 
member what Paul the Apostle said 
upon this subject. He said, "If any 
man preach any other gospel than 
that which I have preached unto 
you, let him be accursed." You see 
from this that it is truly a serious 
and a dangerous thing to preach 
and minister in the name of the 
Lord, without authority. The 
Prophet Isaiah, looking down 
through the centuries, saw a very 
peculiar condition of the people, and 
he used language something like 
this : • 

"The earth also is defiled under the 
inhabitants thereof; because they have 
transgressed the laws, changed the 
ordinance, broken the everlasting 
covenant." 

We know something about the 
laws of God ; they are set forth very 
clearly in the scriptures and also by 
modern revelation, and we know 
also something about the ordinances 
of the Gospel; but what is this new 
and everlasting covenant, that is 
spoken of? Surely it must be an 
interesting question to the world to 
know what that covenant is. It is 
something at least of an enduring 
nature. An everlasting covenant 
must be an eternal covenant, some- 
thing that goes beyond this life, but 
does the world really know what it 
is? In order to understand clearly 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



23 



what Isaiah meant when he said 
that it had been broken, it is only 
necessary to consult modern revela- 
tion. In speaking upon this subject, 
the Lord said to Joseph Smith the 
Prophet : 

"For behold! I reveal unto you a 
new and an everlasting covenant; and 
if ye abide not that covenant, then are 
ye damned; for no one can reject this 
covenant, and be permitted to enter 
into my glory; 

"For all who will have a blessing at 
my hands, shall abide the law which 
was appointed for that blessing, and 
the conditions thereof, as were insti- 
tuted from before the foundation of 
the world: 

"And as pertaining to the new and 
everlasting covenant, it was instituted 
for the fulness of my glory; and he 
that receiveth a fulness thereof, must 
and shall abide the law, or he shall 
be damned, saith the Lord God." 

It is plain from this that the 
everlasting covenant has again been 
revealed to the world in our time ; 
and it involves a fulness of the glory 
of God. So it will be seen that the 
world is in a very serious condition 
if they have violated that covenant. 
Well, now, what is the nature of 
this Covenant? It is nothing more 
nor less, brethren and sisters, than 
the covenant of marriage, and it is 
explained very fully, very beauti- 
fully in the revelation of God, for 
the Lord said unto Joseph : 

"Verily I say unto you, that the 
conditions of this law are these: — All 
covenants, contracts, bonds, obliga- 
tions, oaths, vows, performances, con- 
nections, associations, or exnectations, 
that are not made, and entered into, 
and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of 
promise, of him who is anointed, both 
as well for time and for all eternity, 
and that too most holy, by revela- 
tion and commandment through the 
medium of mine anointed, whom I 
have appointed on the earth to hold 
this power, (and I have appointed un- 
to my servant Joseph to hold this 



power in the last days, and there is 
never but one on the earth at a time, 
on whom this power and the keys of 
this Priesthood are conferred,) are of 
no efficacy, virtue or force, in and 
after the resurrection from the dead; 
for all contracts that are not made un- 
to this end, have an end when men 
are dead." 

Hear it, oh Israel ! That all con- 
tracts, and all engagements that are 
not entered into by appointment of 
God, have an end when men are 
dead. 

"Therefore," said the Lord, "if a 
man marry him a wife in the world, 
and he marry her not by me, nor by 
my word; and he covenant with her 
so long as he is in the world, and she 
with him, their covenant and marriage 
are not of force when they are dead, 
and when they are out of the world; 
therefore, they are not bound by any 
law when they are out of the world; 

"Therefore, when they are out of 
the world, they neither marry, nor are 
given in marriage; but are appointed 
angels in heaven, which angels are 
ministering servants, to minister for 
those who are worthy of a far more 
and an exceeding, and an eternal 
weight of glory; 

"For these angels did not abide my 
law, therefore they cannot be en- 
larged, but remain separately and 
singly, without exaltation, in their 
saved condition, to all eternity, and 
from henceforth are not gods, but 
are angels of God, for ever and ever." 

This, then, is the new and ever- 
lasting covenant which God has re- 
vealed to His people, in our day, a 
covenant that binds men and women 
in marriage to all eternity. We are 
confronted with two covenants, the 
new and everlasting covenant and 
the covenant which is made by 
man. These two covenants are be- 
fore us — and every Latter-day 
Saint who contemplates marriage 
has the choice of two covenants, but 
strange to say that while very many 
of the Latter-day Saints choose the 
everlasting covenant of the Lord, 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there are others who appear to be 
satisfied with the lesser covenant, 
which is only temporary in its char- 
acter. 

Brethren and sisters, this ques- 
tion is not determined by love alone. 
Because a man falls in love with a 
woman, and a woman with the man, 
and they agree to join hands and 
become united in marriage, it does 
not follow that the marriage will 
continue and be of force in the eter- 
nal worlds, and it will not be unless 
it is solemnized for those worlds. 
People have said to me: "Look at 
that couple; look at that man and 
woman ; what a beautiful picture it 
is! Don't you see that the man 
loves the woman ; that the woman 
loves the man; that they are truly 
husband and wife; and that they 
have a family of beautiful children ? 
Surely, when death comes God will 
not separate that couple, God will 
not part the husband and wife from 
each other and from their children, 
although they were united by an 
earthly covenant." We should take 
the right point of view. We can- 
not, surely we cannot attribute it to 
the Lord if they are separated. The 
Lord is not responsible. The Lord 
says, "My house is a house of or- 
der." This is the law. If you obey 
the law you will receive the bless- 
ing. If you reject the law you will 
be damned. Then, if people reject 
the law, though they may love one 
another, if people reject the law, 
though they may be married one to 
another; if people reject the law, 
though they may have had children 
in that marriage, they cannot blame 
the Lord. If in the resurrection 
they are separated from each other, 
from their loved oiies, it is their 
own fault. They had their choice. 
We have our choice. We must re- 
member always that the Lord gov- 



erns by law, and we must give obe- 
dience to His word and to His law, 
else we lose the blessing. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I 
greatly rejoice in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. I rejoice exceedingly 
in this everlasting covenant that 
God has given to His people. In 
it there is beauty, there is power, 
there is glory, there is exaltation 
and eternal life. 

I know that this Gospel is true; 
I know that Jesus is the Christ; 
that this is His work, and that He 
was crucified for the sins of the 
world. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a true prophet of God, and the 
revelations which he has given, and 
his predictions which have been ful- 
filled, amply prove this ; but I know 
it by the testimony and power of 
the Holy Ghost. God bless you, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The East Bountiful First Ward 
choir rendered the anthem, "In Our 
Redeemer's Name."

Sunday desecration denounced. — A 
strong plea for state-wide prohibi- 
tion. — Commendable efforts of the 
Anti-Saloon League. — A prohibition 
amendment to U. S. Constitution

prohibition sentiment in nation. — 
All faithful members of the Church 
staunch prohibitionists. 

I am always pleased when I have 
the opportunity of meeting with the 
Latter-day Saints in any of their 
gatherings. I never attend any of 
our meetings, in the wards or stakes 
or at the general conferences, that I 
am not blessed, instructed and en- 
couraged in the faith of the Gospel ; 
that I do not hear something that 
in very deed feeds me the bread of 
life. I have been pleased and grate-

ful to be present at our conference 
meetings thus far. 

It is said that out of the abund- 
ance of the heart the mouth speak- 
eth. My heart has been set for many 
years firmly and steadfastly upon 
the accomplishment of certain re- 
sults in our fair state. One result 
which I would like to see accomp- 
lished is the doing away with amuse- 
ments upon the Sabbath day. I feel 
that it is a reproach to the Latter- 
day Saints that we should have 
amusements in our towns and cities 
on the day of the Lord. As the 
years come and go, and young men 
and young women go to their ruin 
because of losing their respect for 
the Sabbath, and the sacredness of 
' the day, I 'feel that the men who 
have sat in the legislature, and who 
have failed to protect us against this 
evil, will have much to answer for. 

If the whole of Utah should go 
"dry!" it would be the one great 
thing above all others, to my mind, 
which would be beneficial to this fair 
state of ours, and would add more to 
the health and longevity of its peo- 
ple, and would cause a more won- 
derful increase for good in the ex- 
cellent vital statistics which we 
heard read here today, than any- 
thing I can possibly think of. I be- 
lieve absolutely in the prohibition 
of the manufacture and the sale of 
liquor, and I hope and pray, with 
all the energy with which God has 
endowed me, that this great bless- 
ing for the uplift and for the bet- 
terment of the people of our fair 
state may come to us at no far 
distant day. 

A few months ago it fell to my lot 
to have the privilege of attending 
some of the meetings of a very won- 
derful convention of a number of 
organizations which are engaged in 
the fight against liquor. These were 



the meetings Of the Anti-Saloon 
League, and other temperance or- 
ganizations, at Columbus, Ohio. The 
meetings of the convention lasted 
for several days, sessions being held 
morning, noon and night. It was 
to me a very inspiring sight to wit- 
ness the enthusiasm, the earnestness 
and the determination, as manifested 
by the assembled multitude, run- 
ning into the thousands, who at- 
tended those gatherings. I listened 
with a great deal of pleasure to 
nearly all of the very many inspir- 
ing speeches which were made upon 
that occasion. 

Since coming into the meeting 
this afternoon, I have been glanc- 
ing over one of those speeches to 
mark a few passages to read to 
you, and I find myself almost at a 
loss to pick out which passages I 
would like to read. To be perfectly 
frank with you, I would like to read 
the entire speech, as it is such a 
splendid one, but time will not per- 
mit. The speech was made by Ex- 
Governor J. Frank Hanly, who for 
many years was the governor of In- 
diana. He says, in part, referring 
to the fight for a constitutional 
amendment : 

"It is not partisan, it is civic. It 
is not sectarian, it is catholic. It is 
not sectional, it is national.* * *It 
has been said that the things we seek 
— an amendment to the national con- 
stitution prohibiting throughout the 
United States the manufacture, sale, 
importation, exportation and transpor- 
tation of intoxicating liquors to be 
used as a beverage — is contrary to the 
genius and the spirit of our govern- 
ment, as the constitution gives only 
limited powers to the national gover- 
nment.* * * This I deny. I believe 
in the federal constitution, believe in 
it profoundly.* * * Five times I 
have solemnly sworn to preserve, pro- 
tect and defend it, and I would not 
change in the slightest measure a 
single one of its great fundamental 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



provisions.* * * First. Its repre- 
sentative or Republican character. 
Second. Its trinity of departments 
with their co-ordinate and independ- 
ent powers. Third. Its dual form, or 
system of separate sovereign states 
within a sovereign whole. Fourth. 
The authority of the judiciary to in- 
terpret the constitution and decide the 
constitutionality of laws, state and 
national." 

"Henceforth we will know this cause 
only. For it, whenever necessary, men 
shall be set aside and parties aband- 
oned. * * * Slavery had become 
a national evil, too vast and powerful 
for state control, affecting the nation 
as a whole and imperiling the life of 
the government itself, and the nation 
struck it down, writing its epitaph in 
the blood" of a hundred tragic battle 
fields. As it was with slavery before 
the adoption of the thirteenth amend- 
ment to the constitution, so it is now 
with the liquor traffic. It has out- 
grown state boundaries and become a 
national evil amounting to a menace, 
too powerful for state regulation or 
control, affecting the nation as a whole 
and requiring national jurisdiction and 
treatment. It accomplishes by insi- 
dious means what slavery sought in 
the open, doing by corruption and 
shameless misuse of wealth all slave- 
ry sought by force of arms. It beg- 
gars the individual, burdens the state 
and impoverishes the nation. It capi- 
talizes human weakness and commer- 
cializes human vice. It impairs the 
public health, breaks the public peace 
and debauches the public morals. _ It 
makes cowards of public men, intim- 
idating political parties, bribes, badg- 
ers and dominates the makers, inter- 
preters and administrators of the law, 
and suborns the public press. It claims 
for itself a special right and privilege 
asserted by no other interest in all the 
land — the right and privilege to vio- 
late municipal ordinances at will, to 
infract legislative resolves and enact- 
ments, and to set aside the most sol- 
emn and sacred provisions of constitu- 
tions framed and adopted bv free peo- 
ples." 

With the intelligence with which 
God has endowed me, I believe, be- 
yond the peradventure of a doubt. 



that more evil, suffering and crime 
has come into the world by the use 
of intoxicating liquors, and more 
misery has been brought into homes 
of the people, many, many times 
over, than was ever caused by slave- 
ry. I believe that the greatest 
financial, the greatest moral prob- 
lem that is before the people of the 
United States today is this liquor 
problem. I regret exceedingly that 
the first state-wide "white" spot 
upon the map of the United States 
was not made by the State of Utah. 
However, I rejoice in knowing that 
in every town, in every county, 
when the matter of local option 
came up at the election a couple of 
years ago, that where the Latter- 
day Saints were in the majority, 
with the exception of one town, 
liquor had to go. I rejoice in this 
record made. I rejoice in know- 
ing that today the majority of all 
the people in the United States are 
living in "dry" territory. There 
are ninety-one millions of people 
in the United States, and forty- 
six millions — one million more than 
half are living in "dry" territory. 
Of the area of the United States 
there are two million nine hundred 
and seventy-three thousand square 
miles, and two million one hundred 
and thirty-two thousand square 
miles are in "dry" territory and 
only a little over eight hundred 
thousand in "wet" territory. The 
battle is on and I feel assured that 
it will be won. Why? Because 
I am convinced beyond a doubt that 
our fight is right, and right is bound 
to prevail. I agree with Governor 
Hanly that we, who are converted 
to the benefits of prohibition, shall 
dedicate ourselves to this cause ; 
shall labor for it; shall pledge our 
honor, and also pledge our means 
to accomplish it. 



ELDER HEBER !. GRANT.

I endorse William Jennings 
Bryan's words: 

"A Christianity that does not make a 
man a better citizen would be difficult 
to defend. I shall not attempt to lay 
down rules to cover every phase of 
the liquor question that must be met 
by legislation, but I will venture to 
suggest a principle that is universale 
its application and that cannot be ig- 
nored at any time, at any^ place or 
under any circumstances, viz.: That 
the liquor question is a moral question 
which must be dealt with as a ques- 
tion of conscience and not as a ques- 
tion of profit." 

I have heard Latter-day Saints 
say that we need the saloon to help 
pay our taxes. God pity the- men 
whose consciences have become so 
elastic. President Smith says, "They 
are 'Mormons,' not Latter-day 
Saints." 

Quoting again from Secretary 
Bryan : 

"Whatever decision one reaches as 
to the position he should take on any 
legislative phase of the liquor ques- 
tion he must be able to defend it be- 
fore the bar of his conscience. No 
advantage that he could secure in 
business, no money that he can take 
out of his decision, directly or indi- 
rectly, and no advantage that he can 
secure for his party can be allowed to 
weigh in the balance. Any unit, how- 
ever small or large, should be per- 
mitted to rid itself of the saloon or 
place restrictions upon the sale of liq- 
uor, according to the will of the ma- 
jority." 

And I believe, beyond the perad- 
venture of a doubt, that a majority 
of the citizens of the State of Utah 
is, has always been, and always will 
be, as long as the Latter-day Saints 
are in the majority, against liquor. 
Therefore, I claim, let us have a 
state wide vote and we will have 
prohibition; because then the men 
who are trafficking and dealing in 



this damnable stuff in our cities 
will no longer control our major- 
ity. We are citizens of the United 
States where the majority should 
rule, and all we ask is a fair battle 
and we are sure to win because we 
are right. 

I rejoice in knowing that the 
Church of Jesus Christ df Latter- 
day Saints has taken a positive stand 
on the liquor question. I rejoice in 
knowing that the Lord, Himself, 
has given us a revelation, and that 
every Latter-day Saint in his daily 
life, in his walk, in his conversation, 
if he lives up to the commandments 
of God, is in very deed not only a 
prohibitionist so far as liquor is con- 
cerned, but every true Latter-day 
Saint who does not violate his con- 
science, who does not fail to live 
according to the commandments of 
God, not only leaves liquor alone, 
but he also leaves alone tobacco, tea 
and coffee. I rejoice in knowing 
that the Church, as a Church, has 
set up for us a shining standard, and 
that the very best of us, those who 
live for the highest ideals possible, 
can only hope to come somewhere 
near the standard set up by the 
Church. 

I thank the Lord that out of over 
six thousand men who are today 
representing the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints — two 
thousand as missionaries in the 
world and over four thousand as 
general authorities of the Church, — 
as presidents of stakes and counsel- 
ors, stake clerks, high counselors 
and alternates, bishops and bishops' 
counselors — over six thousand men 
— standing as promulgators of the 
Gospel at home and abroad, — no 
one of them is ever put in office 
or sent on a mission who is not 
pledged upon his honor to obey the 
"Word of Wisdom.' The Church

of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
as I say, has a standard, and it be- 
hooves each and every one of us to 
live up to that standard. May God 
help us to do so is my prayer, and 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The combined choirs sang the 
anthem, "Star of Descending 
Night." 



President Smith, in behalf of the 
congregation, heartily thanked the 
combined choirs of Davis County 
for the splendid musical service ren- 
dered by them during the two meet- 
ings of the Conference today. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph H. Grant. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m. Sunday, April Sth. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, April 
5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

President Smith announced that, 
for the benefit of the great number 
of people unable to obtain admis- 
sion to the Tabernacle, overflow 
meetings will be held in the adjoin- 
ing Assembly Hall this morning, 
and afternoon, and in front of the 
Bureau of Information at 2 p. m. 

The tabernacle choir sang the an- 
them, "The Palms." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Richard W. Young. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Gathered Saints." 

The following letter was read to 
the congregation by Elder Heber J. 
Grant. 

Salt Lake City, Utah, 

April 4, 1914. 
President Joseph F. Smith, and Mem- 
bers of the Church in General Con- 
ference Assembled: 
Dear Brethren and Sisters: I great- 
ly regret my inability to be present, 
and to rejoice with you in the outpour- 
ing of the Holy Spirit which I know 
will characterize this conference as it 
has characterized the conferences of 
the past. My absence from you is due 
to an attack of illness requiring abso- 
lute rest and quiet for a few days. 

I congratulate the Church on its 
continued prosperity as shown by its 
numerical increase in membership, 
and as further evidenced by the im- 
provement of its members in the dif- 
ferent activities of our splendid or 
ganization. This improvement is 
shown in the steady increase of at- 
tendance at Sacrament meetings, quo- 
rum meetings, and other appointed 
gatherings, and in the growing inter- 



est associated with the different aux- 
iliary organizations. 

I bear witness to the earnest devo- 
tion of the Latter-day Saints to their 
Church duties; and commend to them 
a continuation of this action. I under- 
stand there is to be observed a "Go to 
Church Sunday" in the near future, 
and I trust our people will show their 
hearty accord- with this commendable 
movement and that they will observe 
that day together with fifty-one other 
"Go to Church Sundays" during the 
twelve months following. 

The attendance of our people at the 
Temple meetings, and their devotion 
to Temple labor speaks well for the 
Saints, and we have reason to rejoice 
in the earnestness with which this la- 
bor for the living and for the dead is 
maintained. 

The work of the Historian's Office 
has been actively carried on in the col- 
lection and collating of historical facts 
which will prove invaluable both for 
the present and for future generations. 
Our office history has been brought 
into permanent shape down to the 
year 1906. 

With assurances of brotherly affec- 
tion, and with earnest prayers for the 
continued advancement of the Church 
with ever-increasing efficiency in the 
work of the Master, I am 

Your brother in the Gospel, 
Anthon H. Lund. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The Church ordinance for healing.- — 
Misuse of words "appointed unto 
death." — Proper limitations in field 
of ministry. — Officers well trained. — 
Not all healed under administration. 
— Many remarkable healings. 

My brethren and sisters, I will 
need your assistance, your faith and 
prayers, to be able to make you 
hear, and I trust that the Lord will

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bless us in hearing and in speaking, 
that we may be further instructed 
and edified in this conference. My 
mind has been resting upon a sub- 
ject in connection with our doc- 
trines and principles which, al- 
though generally recognized in the 
Church, has not, I fear, been fully 
appreciated, and that is the princi- 
ple of the healing of the sick. 

Having had occasion to give con- 
sideration to this subject lately, I 
desire to express a few of my 
thoughts in regard to the same. I 
believe that this principle has been 
enjoyed quite generally in the 
Church; that it has been enjoyed 
by every family, if not by every in- 
dividual member of the Church. 
There have been very remarkable 
healings, which have sometimes 
been brought to our attention. Some 
have been published, but generally 
the healing of the sick has not been 
commented upon. I think the Lat- 
ter-day Saints should be aroused to 
the fact that this great blessing and 
spirit is in the Church, that we en- 
joy the benefits thereof, and that the 
Lord has so arranged, in the organ- 
ization of the Church, that within 
the reach of every family, in every 
ward, there are those commissioned 
and authorized to administer to the 
sick, that the sick may be healed and 
their lives preserved. But I have 
wondered if the Latter-day Saints, 
on some occasions, have not been 
surprised, and their faith possibly 
weakened, because all are not 
healed, and that we do not always 
receive answers to our prayers. I 
thought I would just read to you 
from the forty-second section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants the word of 
the Lord upon this subject, so that 
we may be prepared in our hearts 
and minds for the conditions that 
obtain, and be willing to acknowl- 
edge the hand of the Lord in the 



experience of those who have not 
faith to be healed. For the time 
comes when men are appointed unto 
death, and the fact that we may be 
finally "appointed unto death" has 
aroused some question in the minds 
of the brethren. It is an expression 
that I always prefer not to mention 
when administering to the sick. In 
asking the Lord to heal our afflicted 
it is not necessary to add, "If they 
be not appointed unto death." In 
fact, I have felt that such an expres- 
sion in our prayers, tends rather to 
weaken the faith of the afflicted, 
and to shake their hope and confi- 
dence. The time will come, how- 
ever ; it will come to you and me, 
as well as it has to those that have 
passed away, when we may be ap- 
pointed unto death, and I under- 
stand that that appointment is when 
fatal sickness is upon us and we 
have not faith to overcome it. At 
such times we may realize, in our 
administrations, that the sickness is 
fatal, and it is not possible to over- 
come it, for we may discover con- 
ditions that inform us in no uncer- 
tain terms that death is at the door. 

We should appreciate the fact 
that the Lord has provided, in the 
organization of this Church, that 
there are elders, including seven- 
ties, high priests and patriarchs, and 
other brethren of the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, always at hand to ad- 
minister to the sick in our wards. 
There are stake authorities who 
may officiate in the stakes and do 
officiate as patriarchs, blessing the 
people, and as stake authorities they 
are at home in any part of the stake. 
Then there are the general authori- 
ties of the Church, with the presi- 
dency thereof, whose jurisdiction 
extends throughout the Church, 
both at home and abroad. But or- 
dinarily the brethren bearing the 
Priesthood are expected to officiate 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



31 



in their own wards. I have thought 
of the wonderful opportunity that 
is provided there for the employ- 
ment and service of the brethren 
bearing the Priesthood. They 
should cultivate the spirit of faith 
and the gift of healing, as well as 
other gifts that pertain to the Gos- 
pel, so that whatever is required in 
a ward, it will not be necessary for 
you to send to a neighboring ward 
for help. We do not have to send 
from one stake to another; for in 
every stake, in every ward in this 
Church, in every branch and in 
every mission, there are those who 
are entitled to administer to the sick 
and have experience therein, as well 
as in administering the Sacrament 
to us on the Sabbath day. These 
services belong to the ward. They 
belong also to the stake, and to the 
Church, and to those who are des- 
ignated as officials in these particu- 
lar positions. 

Sometimes brethren have felt 
that they had a mission and a gift, 
and I believe that men do ; I believe 
that some men have greater faith 
than others. I believe according to 
our living and our conduct and our 
service in the work of the Lord, so 
will our faith increase in the heal- 
ing of the sick, and in other ord- 
inances. But we should understand 
the limit of our jurisdiction and 
ministry. The brethren of the ward 
should not go to their neighbor 
wards. They should not be sent 
for; it is not necessary. And we 
should jealously be prepared our- 
selves for what is required in our 
own wards, in our own stakes. 
Baptisms, confirmations, the bless- 
ing of children, ordinations, and so 
forth, are all taken care of in order. 
The house of God is a house of 
order, so that it is not necessary for 
us to be moving about from place 
to place, from ward to ward. It 



sometimes occurs that brethren are 
inclined to make merchandise of 
their ministry, which is not proper 
to be done. All who are authorized 
should administer to the sick and 
wait upon them gratuitously; it is 
not proper that we should make 
merchandise of that ordinance. 

Presidents of stakes and bishops 
of wards and officials throughout 
the Church should be advised that 
they ought not to send abroad for 
help. We send for physicians, and 
for attorneys, and men in worldly 
affairs, whose jurisdiction extends 
everywhere ; but in our Church af- 
fairs each ward and each stake, as a 
rule, is provided with all officials 
that are necessary for the perform- 
ance of the ordinances required in 
the Church, and to officiate in the 
Priesthood, to anoint with oil, to 
bless the sick, and to pray God for 
their restoration. 

These ordinances belong with the 
people where they live. As a rule 
we would not expect the elders who 
are officials in a ward, or the breth- 
ren who labor in a stake, to follow 
the example of the general authori- 
ties of the Church, for their juris- 
diction reaches all over the world, 
while your jurisdiction extends only 
to where you are called. Men are 
called also to officiate in certain 
positions, such as stake positions, 
and as members of general boards 
for the Sunday Schools, for the Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations, for 
the Relief Societies, and the like, 
and when that is the case they are 
designated, they are appointed and 
set apart for the special ministry 
and labor, and they have their pe- 
culiar and marked responsibilities 
resting upon them in connection 
with these auxiliary organizations. 
We would not expect brethren in 
the missionary field to assume to en- 
ter into wards, nor branches, bap-

tizing, confirming, blessing children, 
ordaining, and the like, only in the 
ministry that really belongs to them. 
And though the general authorities 
of the Church, the Twelve and oth- 
ers, have ample authority in all 
stakes and missions everywhere in 
the world, yet the discipline of the 
Church is so carefully straight that 
when we go into wards and stakes, 
and missions, we always labor in har- 
mony with those who preside. We 
observe order in the official acts that 
are required at our hands, and we 
work in harmony with the people, 
with the common consent of all con- 
cerned. We do not want the breth- 
ren that labor at home and whose 
field is not quite so broad as ours, to 
feel that we are at liberty to do as 
we please ; that is, except we please 
to do exactly what is right. The 
Twelve are subordinate to the coun- 
sels of the presidency of the Church, 
are under their direction and coun- 
sel, and we never outrage order and 
discipline. The chief authorities of 
the Church should be models in all 
these things, and every considera- 
tion and care should be taken by us 
that we receive the approval of the 
Lord, the approval of the Spirit of 
the Lord, and in the hearts of the 
people. We work harmoniously 
with the First Presidency, and we 
are controlled, submissive, obedient, 
listen to counsel, and labor in har- 
mony with the mind and will of the 
Lord. 

I am delighted to make this little 
talk before you leading brethren of 
the stakes of Zion, for we have had 
occasion to consider this matter. As 
I say, we have found occasionally a 
brother who is out of order — not 
very many; it does not frequently 
occur; but it occurs sometimes, as 
referred to in the remarks of the 
President this morning. There are 
people who sometimes get curious 



ideas in their minds, ideas that are 
not tenable, and that are not proper. 
Men sometimes get the thought that 
it is their duty to regulate the 
Church, and to set it in order, and 
to regulate the authorities of the 
Church, and the organization of 
the Church. These instances occur 
occasionally, not very frequently. I 
thank the Lord that we discover, 
when we look over the Church, that 
the brethren quite generally know 
where they belong; they know 
their field, they know their homes, 
they know their limitations ; and the 
presiding authorities in wards, in 
quorums, in the stakes and in the 
missions, know what is required of 
them. They are learning lessons ; 
and we are learning lessons all the 
time. Men are called to fill posi- 
tions in missions, in stakes, and in 
wards, and are frequently changed ; 
hence new men are brought into the 
field, and they are not always sup- 
plied by their predecessors with the 
information that has been in their 
home offices. Consequently we have 
to continue to teach, instruct and 
exhort them, answer their questions 
and train them in the ministry that 
is entrusted to them. But there is 
growth and development, and we 
discover that the Church, as spoken 
of yesterday by the President, is in 
its very best condition, for the rea- 
son that we have been in long train- 
ing. We have been born and reared 
among the Saints, and we have been 
in the ministry and have had great 
experience, and our questions have 
been answered. The doctrines of 
the Church are comprehended and 
thoroughly understood by these 
brethren who preside over us. When 
we gather with this body of men, 
with these trained brethren, tried 
brethren, general authorities of the 
Church, associated with the Presi- 
dency ; and then we go to the fields, 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

we go to the stakes, we go to the 
wards, we find the very choicest and 
most model men have been chosen 
and are employed. The same is true 
of our sisters in the Relief Societies, 
in the Primary Associations, and in 
the Religion Class work. Our 
brethren and sisters are thus being 
well trained. In the quorums and 
classes of the Priesthood they are 
being more thoroughly trained now 
than ever in the Church, and these 
trainings, lessons, instructions, and 
experiences tend to establish the 
Latter-day Saints. But there is, no 
doubt, room for improvement, and 
always will be. 

I want to emphasize one fact, and 
I want to read this scripture now, 
my text, in order to close my re- 
marks, so that the brethren will bear 
in mind and notice how reasonable 
and consistent is this doctrine. 

You will find something about 
the same principle included also in 
the 5th chapter of St. James, in the 
New Testament. And you will find 
the doctrine, also, in regard to the 
healing of the sick, contained in the 
17th. "l8th and 19th chapters of 
III Nephi. Read them at your leis- 
ure, for they are very choice, and 
pertain to the ministry of the Lord 
in the flesh. Here is what the Lord 
says in our day: 

"And whosoever among you are 
sick, and have not faith to be healed, 
but believe, shall be nourished with 
all tenderness with herbs and mild 
food, and that not by the hand of an 
enemy, and the elders of the Church, 
two or more, shall be called, and shall 
pray for and lay their hands upon 
them in my name; and if they die 
they shall die unto me, and if they live 
they shall live unto me." 

The Lord does not expect us all 
to die when we are taken sick ; that 
is quite well understood. Generally 
we are healed, and I suppose that 



each person in this congregation, al- 
most without exception, could bear 
strong testimony to their own heal- 
ing, and some very many times 
healed from serious sickness, re- 
markable healings. 

"Thou shalt live together in love, in- 
somuch that thou shalt weep for the 
loss of them that die, and more espe- 
cially for those that have not hope of 
a glorious resurrection. And it shall 
come to pass that those that die in me 
shall not taste of death, for it shall be 
sweet unto them; and they that die 
not in me, woe unto them, for their 
death is bitter. And again it shall 
come to pass that he that hath faith in 
me to be healed, and is not appointed 
unto death, shall be healed.' 

If they have not fatal sickness 
they may be healed ; if they have fa- 
tal sickness they will die. They have 
been doing so, and you and I will 
do the same, one time. 

"He that hath faith to see shall see; 
he who hath faith to hear shall hear; 
the lame who have faith to leap shall 
leap; and they who have not faith to 
do these things, but believe in me, 
have power to become my sons; and 
inasmuch as they break not my laws, 
thou shalt bear their infirmities." 

Many there are that are infirm in 
their hearing, faulty in their seeing 
and otherwise, and if they will but 
serve the Lord and keep His com- 
mandments they shall become the 
sons of God. They have that power, 
though they may not be able to 
overcome all their infirmities, and 
with them we must bear. You must 
bear with my infirmities, and I must 
bear with yours, for they will abide 
with us if we have not faith to be 
healed. We want the brethren bear- 
ing the Priesthood in every ward in 
Zion to be a little jealous to take 
care of the employment that is fur- 
nished them there in their office as 
teachers, and in administering to

the sick; don't let the people send 
abroad, and don't make merchan- 
dise of your ministry. Attend to 
the ordinance of the healing of the 
sick in your own ward, and the min- 
istering to them, and laying on of 
hands. It should be done in order; 
it should not be done offensively, 
but properly and rightly done, in a 
manner that no one need take ex- 
ception to. I want to make the dec- 
laration that there are elders suffi- 
cient, and high priests, and seven- 
ties and patriarchs, and other breth- 
ren bearing the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood, in every ward in Zion, for all 
the laying on of hands that is re- 
quired ; and the Lord is just as near 
to one ward as another. He is near 
at hand to every one of us. If our 
faith is not quite so strong as our 
neighbor's, we should cultivate it, 
and we should have the experience 
and the practice. We don't send to 
a neighbor ward for somebody to 
administer the Sacrament for us, do 
we ? Nor yet to baptize, nor to con- 
firm, nor to ordain, nor to bless chil- 
dren, or perform any of those or- 
dinances. It is not necessary to do 
so. If the sick want the brethren 
who are general authorities, and 
who are traveling, if you can put the 
sick in their way so that you don't 
do them a hardship, they are always 
willing to bless the sick; and quite 
generally, almost invariably the sick 
are healed under the hands of the 
elders. This Church is remarkable 
therefor. 

Though there may be among us 
some that are a little careless and 
indifferent, they are always aroused 
in case of sickness, in case of death 
and hardships and trial. They are 
aroused at once to seek the Lord, 
and they want the help of those who 
are faithful and worthy. They want 
the assistance of the Holy Priest- 
hood, and they appeal to us, and 



you know, my brethren, you that 
are here today, that the Lord has 
answered the prayers of His ser- 
vants, and the sick have been healed 
and there have been some very re- 
markable healings. Sight has been 
restored to the blind, and hearing 
to the deaf, and health to the sickly 
and the afflicted, and there is not a 
man on this stand, I presume, who 
has not been healed. I presume I 
have been generally as healthy as 
any man upon the stand here, but 
I have had the assistance of the 
Lord to help me on occasions when 
I have needed to be healed, and I 
have been healed very remarkably, 
and instantly, under the hands of 
brethren over whom I presided in 
the Southern States, and in our 
own state, and on different occa- 
sions. And so it has been with you. 
The sick have been healed under 
our hands. They have been re- 
stored and this is the experience 
of every family. I don't have to 
refer you to any one family where 
the sick have been healed, for it is 
manifest in every family; in every 
home. No family is so far away out 
on the borders but what they have 
been found, and the sick have been 
administered to, and they have been 
healed. Yet we who have been 
healed, who have received these re- 
markable manifestations, will pass 
away after a while, when the sick- 
ness is final and fatal, and death has 
been appointed unto us, and it will 
not be appointed to us until the time 
we are required to pass away. 

I took occasion to talk on this 
subject last Sunday in Davis Stake, 
and there were some remarkable 
cases there of the sick that I had 
been acquainted with and that were 
healed, such as Brother John R. 
Barnes who, like King Hezekiah, 
has been given a lease of life of 
about fifteen or eighteen years, and

with prospects of living no one can 
tell how much longer, when he was 
at the point of death. And also the 
late President John W. Hess of Da- 
vis County. It fell to my lot to go 
and ordain him a patriarch when 
he was thought to be lying on his 
death bed, that he should take the 
office with him. He arose from his 
bed and blessed his numerous fam- 
ily, as I understand, almost every 
soul of them, and then he went from 
ward to ward and blessed the peo- 
ple in whole, all that would gather 
to hear him. He raised his hands 
and put blessings upon their heads 
after he had been at the point of 
death. We want to bear these things 
in mind and acknowledge the hand 
of the Lord, and when we offer up 
prayers and acknowledgments to 
the Lord, let us gratefully remem- 
ber the good that we have received 
at His hands. Don't let us forget, 
don't let us lose our faith, don't let 
us wander from the straight and 
narrow path that leads to life, but 
be sons of God, serve and honor 
Him with all our might, mind and 
strength, to our latest day. 

May the blessings of the Lord be 
upon gathered Israel, upon the peo- 
ple in these valleys, these splendid 
valleys, and upon the presiding offi- 
cers in the Church, that they may 
be blessed, that they may be healed 
when they are afflicted, and have 
the same experiences that we have 
had before, be healed and restored, 
that our lives may be perpetuated 
and extended, while the Lord finds 
it profitable for us to live. God bless 
you. The Lord bless these breth- 
ren, presiding brethren that have 
come up here, and who come up 
twice a year to worship the Lord 
and receive instructions. God bless 
you, my brethren. God bless the 
brethren in all the wards and stakes 
in Zion ; and the Lord bless our sis- 



ters in their labor and ministry as 
ministering angels, those that have 
been chosen and have sustained the 
work of the Lord, and have joined 
with their husbands and brothers in 
carrying forward the work of the 
Lord in the heat of the day. They 
have borne a great responsibility. 
They have borne the sons of men, 
the souls of men in this earth, and 
have builded up the kingdom. They 
are entitled to all honor and credit 
and blessing. 

We pray, Father, that Thy Spirit 
may rest abundantly upon these 
gathered people, and upon all Zion, 
and upon the honest in heart, the 
conscientious throughout the earth, 
the friends of the Latter-day Saints, 
those that have the courage to 
speak a good word in our favor, for 
we deserve it, we need it, and are 
entitled to enjoy it. May the bless- 
ings of the Lord be upon us always, 
I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

The Gospel again revealed, the same 
in all ages — The Bible a "measuring 
stick" — The fruits of "Mormonism" 
prove its divinity — The Gospel man- 
ifests the mercy and justice of God 
— New revelation confirmed by the 
old Scriptures — The glorious princi- 
ple of salvation for the dead. 

This certainly is an awe-inspiring 
sight, to see this large building filled 
to its capacity, hundreds of people 
being obliged to stand. 

I can say that I never in my ex- 
perience was able to see more clear- 
ly the beauties of the Gospel, to feel 
its truth more keenly, or to realize 
more fully its saving power than at 
the present time. I rejoice exceed- 
ingly in the knowledge which I have 
of the Gospel, in the testimony I 
have of its truth, in the blessings 
which I have received therein. The 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Gospel which the Lord has revealed 
to us, through the instrumentality 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, is the 
same that was instituted before the 
foundations of the world, and has in 
it the power of God unto salvation, 
unto all those who will receive it 
and obey its laws and precepts. It 
is the same Gospel which was re- 
vealed by the Lord to Father Adam 
and to Enoch, and to Moses, Abra- 
ham, and others of His prophets. It 
is the same that was taught by our 
Savior, and His disciples of the 
primitive church. The Scriptures 
tell us, "There is one body and one 
spirit, even as ye are called in one 
hope of your calling, one Lord, one 
faith, one baptism," and the Apostle 
Paul, in addressing his epistle to the 
Galatians, declared that "though we, 
or an angel from heaven, preach any 
other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, 
let him be accursed. *A.s we said 
before, so say I now again, if any 
man preach any other gospel unto 
you than that ye have received, let 
him be accursed." The deduction 
which I draw from these declara- 
tions is that, though there are many 
religious denominations, there is 
but one true Gospel, and that scrip- 
tural doctrine is one of the strongest 
evidences of the true Gospel. 

Our elders go out into the world 
with the Scriptures, the Bible, as 
the measuring stick recognized by 
all Christians, remembering the say- 
ing of the prophets, "to the law and 
to the testimony, for if they speak 
not according to these it is because 
there is no light in them." They 
teach the doctrines which the Lord 
has revealed to us in these last days, 
and they bring 'forth the Bible, and 
invite men and women to a compari- 
son, and it is discovered that the 
doctrines taught by the elders of 



Israel are identical with those taught 
by Paul and his associate apostles, 
and by the Savior Himself. These 
comparisons accompanied bv the 
Spirit of the Lord, have the result 
of convincing and converting many 
honest souls, numbered by the 
thousands, who have been willing 
to forsake their sins, their former 
faith, their friends, their occupa- 
tions and all for the Gospel's sake. 
On the other hand, our elders, by a 
study of these truths, and compari- 
son of them with the Scriptures, 
have had their testimony strength- 
ened and established, so that such a 
thing as one of these elders being 
led to embrace any one of the re- 
ligions of the world is almost un- 
known in the entire history and ex- 
perience Of the Church, in the 
preaching of the Gospel, and there 
have been many thousands of elders 
engaged in that work. 

There can only be one true Gospel 
of the Redeemer, according to the 
Scriptures, having in it the power of 
God unto salvation, and we have 
strong evidences that the Gospel 
which we teach is that particular 
Gospel. On one occasion the Savior 
gave a test by which false prophets 
might be discerned; said He: 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. 
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or 
figs of thistles? Even so, every good 
tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a 
corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
A good tree cannot bring forth evil 
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit. * * * Wherefore 
by their fruits ye shall know them." 

We have in the New Testament 
the teachings of Jesus and of His 
disciples, who are recognized by all 
good Christians as good trees, figur- 
atively speaking, and the fruit borne 
by them is good fruit, and we prove 
to the world that these fruits and 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



37 



the fruits of "Mormonism," so- 
called, are identical. It only re- 
quires an investigation to reach this 
conclusion, an unbiased, unpreju- 
diced, sincere investigation. Find- 
ing that the fruits of the Gospel, as 
taught by the Latter-day Saints, are 
good, we must accept the tree which 
bore them as being a good tree. 

The Gospel has not always been 
upon the earth; it has been here in 
part at times, and sometimes, per- 
haps, wholly from the earth, the 
authority to preach it, and to admin- 
ister its ordinances, having been 
taken away. In view of the fact, 
recognized by men and women of 
the world everywhere, that millions 
of our Father's children have lived 
when the Gospel was not upon the 
earth, who have died without a 
knowledge of the truth, without a 
knowledge of God, without a knowl- 
edge of the Savior; for religionists 
to teach the doctrine that faith in 
Jesus Christ is necessary to salva- 
tion, and then deny the provision 
which God has made for the salva- 
tion of those who have never known 
of the Gospel, to teach that all those 
who do not confess Him, on any 
count whatever, are lost and 
damned, such teaching is a heresy 
abominable in the sight of God, and 
of honest, thoughtful men and wom- 
en. Through the teaching of such 
doctrines many, no doubt, have been 
led in to infidelity and atheism, and 
others have been made to think of 
God our Father as a monster of in- 
justice and without mercy, rather 
than the loving, merciful Father that 
He is. 

The Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ is founded upon the rock of 
revelation, Jesus Himself being the 
chief corner stone, as it has been 
predicted that it would be. The 
superstructure is composed of truth, 



eternal truth, and righteous princi- 
ples. There is no shade of evil, or 
deception in it, and it will withstand 
the winds, the rains and floods of 
vituperation, df villification, of false- 
hood and persecution, with which it 
may be assailed, because it is found- 
ed upon the rock. God is at the 
helm in this great work, and He has 
made provision for the salvation ot 
all His children who will be saved. 
There are no inconsistencies in the 
plan of life and salvation as it has 
been revealed to us, and it all tends 
to glorify our Father in heaven, 
demonstrates His divine attributes, 
and proves that He is a just, a 
merciful and a loving Father; for, 
notwithstanding that millions have 
died without a knowledge of the 
truth, there are provisions made that 
they shall hear and have the privi- 
lege of obeying it. 

The Scriptures tell us that, "until 
the law, sin was in the world, but 
sin is not imputed where there is no 
law." The Gospel of the Master is 
the law by which all mankind must 
and shall be judged, and of necessity 
it must be taught unto all mankind 
or they could not be judged by it. 

This Gospel having been revealed 
to us from the Lord direct, not given 
of men through their wisdom, and 
what they could glean from the 
Holy Scriptures, it is to us the 
known truth. It is not founded upon 
the Bible, that was not the source of 
inspiration of the Prophet Joseph. 
When occasion arises, as it often 
does, in regard to the interpretation 
of certain Scripture, because many 
plain and percious truths have been 
taken from the Scriptures, as the 
prophets declared they would be, 
and because of mistranslations, we 
go to the W ord of the Lord as it has 
been revealed to us, and learn the 
truth, and then refer to the scripture 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Bible and reconcile that scrip- 
ture with the known truth, and we 
are not in darkness, but constantly in 
the light. So that the Gospel, as we 
have received it, adjusts apparent 
discrepancies of the Scriptures, and 
makes plain the way of life. We 
understand what was meant by Jesus 
going, while His body was in the 
tomb, and preaching to the spirits in 
prison, as Peter says, "For this 
cause was the Gospel preached also 
to them that are dead, that they 
might be judged according to men 
in the flesh, but live according to 
God in the spirit." 

And so with the ordinances of the 
Gospel. Faith is necessary unto sal- 
vation, a condition, and yet it is not 
the only condition, ior the laws and 
ordinances of the Gospel must be 
obeyed. 

"We believe that through the atone- 
ment of Christ all mankind may be 
saved by obedience to the laws and 
ordinances of the Gospel," and not 
without; and, "we believe that the 
first principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel are, first, faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third, 
baptism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins; fourth, the laying- on of 
hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost;" 

These are but the first principles. 
Priesthood, endowments, sealings, 
etc., are necessary to salvation, and 
the Gospel provides that these ordi- 
nances shall be administered in be- 
half of the dead, by proxy. It is 
for this purpose that temples are 
built by the Latter-day Saints, gene- 
alogies of the dead procured, and 
the ordinances performed, the same 
for the dead as for the living. If 
when the Gospel is preached to those 
who are dead, they accept of it, and 
the vicarious work done for them, 
the work done will be binding and 
of force, and we become "saviors 
upon Mt. Zion" through having 



done that work. If the dead reject 
the work done for them, it will be of 
non-effect for their salvation, just 
as the atonement of our Savior re- 
deems us from our sins if we accept 
Him and His atonement, and obey 
Him, but if we reject Him, and 
what He has done for us, that which 
He has done for us, so far as aton- 
ing for our individual sins is con- 
cerned, profits us nothing. Even 
when we have received these ordi- 
nances our salvation is not secured, 
we must go on to perfection, adding 
to our faith virtue, virtue being a 
condition necessary to salvation ; and 
to virtue knowledge, knowledge be- 
ing another condition ; and to knowl- 
edge temperance ; and to temperance 
patience and godliness, and broth- 
erly kindness, and charity, which 
latter is the pure love of Christ. We 
have the promise of the Lord that 
if these things be in us, and abound, 
our minds will not be barren or un- 
fruitful of the knowledge of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, to know whom 
is life eternal. 

God help us to be true and faith- 
ful to these principles, I pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

who would fain have us believe that 
the power of God is no greater than 
the power of man. 

One Sunday evening, in the Eigh- 
teenth ward of this city, while I was 
bishop there, a Primary Association 
conference was in progress, and 
among the exercises was the teach- 
ing, by one of the sisters, of a class 
df little children. She gathered 
them around her upon the stand and 
related to them, in the presence of 
the congregation, the beautiful story 
of the Savior feeding the multitude. 
After the meeting had dispersed, one 
of the mothers, going home with her 
little boy, put him through a course 
of questions in order to ascertain 
what he remembered of the lesson 
that had been taught. 

"What has Sister Pyper been tell- 
ing you?" the mother asked. The 
boy answered, "She taught us about 
the Savior feeding the people." 
"How many people were there?" 
she inquired. "Five thousand," he 
replied. "What did He feed them 
with?" "With five loaves of bread 
and two fishes." The mother then 
said, "Well now, how do you sup- 
pose He could do that ? How could 
He feed a great multitude, five 
thousand people, with only five 
loaves of bread and two fishes?" 
The little fellow was thoughtful -for 
a moment, and then exclaimed, 
"Well, I don't believe those in the 
middle got any." (Laughter.) 

That boy evidently believed, with 
some of our "children of a larger 
growth," that God is no more pow- 
erful than man. he sought a scien- 
tific solution of a miraculous prob- 
lem, and solved it in his own way. 

But all children are not of that 
kind. My experience with little 
boys and girls teaches me that as a 
rule they recognize that there is a 
vast difference between the power of 



God and the power of man. It is 
comparatively easy for them to ac- 
cept the miraculous; they do not 
have the prejudice against it that 
some men and women have. I recall 
another anecdote, which I have re- 
lated before, that will illustrate this 
phase of my subject. 

In the Salt Lake Theatre, many 
years ago, John B. Gough, the great 
temperance orator, was delivering a 
lecture, in the course of which he 
deprecated the practice of endeavor- 
ing to simplify the Bible so that chil- 
dren could understand it. Said he, 
"Let them read the Bible just as it 
is, and they will understand it ; they 
comprehend things much more 
quickly than we give them credit 
for." He illustrated the point with 
this story. Two little boys, one 
named Johnny and the other Billy, 
were playing in the dooryard. 
Johnny had a knife and was sitting 
on the doorstep whittling a stick. 
Billy, who had just caught a fly, 
came up to Johnny with the fly be- 
tween his thumb and finger, remark- 
ing "What a funny thing a fly is !" 
See what lots of legs he's got; and 
every time I blow him he buzzes." 
Here he blew on the fly and put it 
up to his ear to hear it buzz. "I 
wonder how God made him," mused 
Billy. And the great orator paused 
long enough in his narrative to say : 
"Many a learned man has asked the 
same question, and could not answer 
it." "But," he added, "Johnny had 
an idea of how God made the fly. 
He went on whittling his stick, and 
said, 'Well, Billy, God don't make 
flies like men make houses ; when he 
wants flies He says, 'Let there be 
flies,' and then there is flies." 
(Laughter.) 

"That little boy," said Mr. Gough, 
"had been reading the Bible, and he 
believed what he read, and under-

stood it ; it was plain to him that the 
power of God is greater than the 
power of man. He had read that 
beautiful lesson presented at the 
very beginning of the book of Gen- 
esis, 'And God said, Let there be 
light, and there was light." 

When man wants light he must 
strike a match, or press a button, or 
turn a switch, or rub two pieces of 
wood together as do the Indians, in 
order to create a flame. But when 
God wants light, He has only to say, 
Let there be light, and there is light. 
Nay, He would not have to do even 
so much as that, for God Himself is 
Light, dwells in the midst of light, 
in the midst of eternal burnings, and 
He would only have to appear, and 
darkness would flee away. 

We children, we men and women, 
who for the time being have to learn 
like little boys and girls, by crude 
and primitive methods — we are told 
that the time will come when, as the 
reward of obedience, of continued 
faithfulness, our bodies shall be 
filled with light, our eyes be single 
to the glory of God. But we ap- 
proach that condition gradually. We 
are learning how to do things, little 
by little. We do them now in in- 
ferior ways ; but our Heavenly 
Father has learned how to do them 
in a masterful way. Then why 
should we seek to drag Him down, 
and deny His power to do things 
that we are not able to do ? Where 
is the logic of it? 

Why this prejudice against the 
miraculous? Why should any man 
or woman, and particularly any Lat- 
ter-day Saint, take ground of oppo- 
sition against miracles, and try to 
relegate them to the domain of the 
mythical? Where will it stop, if 
you give way to the spirit of skep- 
ticism? Allow yourselves to think 
that Christ never walked upon the 



water, that He never roused Laz- 
arus from the slumber of death, that 
He never did a miracle, never 
brought a dead world to life by the 
shedding of His blood as a ransom 
for sinners — encourage these doubts 
and where will they land you? 
Where will they lead to? They will 
lead you to reject the Redeemer of 
the world ; they will lead you to 
deny, as many do, that such a man 
as Jesus of Nazareth ever, lived. 
Continue giving way to doubt, and 
you will end by doubting your own 
existence — as many do already. 

If there were no ancient miracles, 
there have been no modern miracles. 
If the wonderful works of the Son 
of God are myths, then this whole 
fabric of "Mormonism" crumbles to 
the ground, it has no foundation, for 
it is based upon miracles, ancient 
and modern, and was intended to be 
based upon them. 

How do I know that Joseph Smith 
ever lived? How do I know that 
he was a prophet of God ? Is it be- 
cause my parents knew him — be- 
cause they told me he was a proph- 
et? How many of you ever saw the 
Prophet Joseph Smith ? How many 
here know, by the seeing of the eye 
and the hearing of the ear, that such 
a man lived and labored and died? 
There are two men upon this stand, 
perhaps others, but I know two who, 
as little boys, saw the Prophet 
Joseph — "three, four, five," someone 
behind me says. These five are 
President Joseph F. Smith, Presi- 
dent Francis M. Lyman, Patriarch 
Angus M. Cannon, Elder William 
W. Riter, and Elder Nymphus Mur- 
dock. There may be others, but it 
does not matter — I am not trying 
to make it cumulative. This is the 
point : How do I know that Joseph 
Smith ever lived? Is it because 
these brethren saw him ? I have re-

spect for their testimony; it is one 
of the elements of my own testimony 
concerning this man. But if I know 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet — and 
I do know it — it is because God has 
shown it to me, by the power of His 
Spirit, the spirit of revelation. That 
is how I know it, and that is how 
you know it. We know it by mirac- 
ulous manifestation, or we don't 
know it at all. We are dependent 
upon the miraculous for what we 
know of all such things. Then why 
should we want to tear out from 
under our feet the foundations upon 
which we stand? 

Seven hundred years before the 
birth of the Savior a prophet de- 
clared, in relation to the last days, 
that a work should be done among 
men by the Almighty, even a mar- 
velous work and a wonder, and the 
wisdom of the wise should perish, 
and the understanding df the pru- 
dent should be hid. What fulfils this 
prediction but "Mormonism," God's 
great work of the last days, founded 
upon marvels and wonders? Can. 
you conceive of anything more won- 
derful than the opening of the heav- 
ens at a time when men denied reve- 
lation, denied the visitation of an- 
gels, and declared that the world 
would never have any more of them ; 
when it had lost its knowledge of the 
true God and virtually ruled Him 
out of His own universe ? Can you 
conceive of anything more marvel- 
ous than the opening of the heavens 
and the appearance, the personal ap- 
pearance, of God, the Father and the 
Son, to Joseph Smith, then a little 
boy between fourteen and fifteen 
years otf age? There is the first 
marvel of "Mormonism," there is 
the beginning of the fulfilment of 
Isaiah's prediction concerning the 
marvelous work and wonder. 

At first Joseph's testimony was 



met with scoffing, and he was de- 
nounced as a rogue, as an imposter. 
All sorts of evil stories were circu- 
lated concerning him, in order to 
break down his testimony. "It's all 
of the devil," said a Methodist min- 
ister, to whom he told his story — 
told it in a simple, child-like way, 
declaring that God had appeared to 
him in vision, and had talked with 
Him. The boy never deviated from 
that declaration, and as a man he 
died by it and died for it. 

Gradually the world is beginning 
to concede that Joseph Smith was at 
least sincere, that he really imagined 
that he saw and heard, and one 
great, wise man has capped the cli- 
max of worldly wisdom, in its ef- 
forts to explain away Joseph Smith, 
by asserting that these wonderful 
manifestations, the coming of God 
the Father and the Son, the coming 
of the Angel Moroni, the coming of 
John the Baptist and of Peter, 
James and John, bringing back the 
powers of the priesthood and the 
fulness of the everlasting Gospel, 
that these were all hallucinations, re- 
sulting from an epileptic fit! Was 
there ever a more striking illustra- 
tion of the fulfilment of prophecy — ■ 
"The wisdom of the wise shall per- 
ish, and the understanding of the 
prudent shall be hid"? 

We know that Joseph Smith's tes- 
timony is true; we know it by the 
Holy Ghost ; and that is the strength 
of this Church. It is not the sagac- 
ity of its leaders, it is not its mem- 
bers, that constitutes its strength. 
We are only a handful in the midst 
of many millions. The strength of 
this Church is in the testimony pos- 
sessed by every man and woman be- 
longing to it, that it is indeed the 
work of God. 

Testimonies are of two kinds, di- 
rect and indirect, positive and nega-

tive. Persecution testifies indirectly 
of the truth. "All things bear record 
of me," the Lord says. We only 
have to look around upon the mani- 
festations of nature, and we see and 
hear them testifying of the Creator. 
Every thing made proclaims its 
maker, to those who have eyes to see 
and ears to hear, and who use them 
for those purposes. 

I was once conversing with a gen- 
tleman who expressed* an earnest de- 
sire that the Latter-day Saints 
should co-operate with those rich 
philanthropists who are endeavoring 
to colonize the poor Jews of Chris- 
tian countries — to move them out of 
the large cities — to make farmers 
and artisans of a people who have 
been peddlers, merchants, and 
money changers for centuries. One 
of these colonies, by the way, is in 
central Utah, near the town of Gun- 
nison. This gentleman said to me, 
"I recognize the 'Mormon' people as 
the greatest colonizers in the world, 
and I wonder why you don't see the 
necessity of co-operating with such 
men as Baron Hirsch, who has spent 
millions of wealth endeavoring to 
colonize these Jews, but has failed 
thus far, because of his lack of 
knowledge and experience in colo- 
nizing methods. Why don't you Lat- 
ter-day Saints co-operate with him, 
he to provide the millions, you to 
furnish the experience?" And he 
added, "You could make a stipula- 
tion that every Jew you helped to 
colonize should become a Latter-day 
Saint." (Laughter.) "See how 
that would build up your Church." 

I answered Mr. Davenport — that 
was the gentleman's name — in sub- 
stance as follows : "You remind me 
of a conversation I once had in the 
Eastern States, while upon my first 
mission. I was asked, "Why don't 



you "Mormon" elders fly for higher 
game? Why do you always preach 
to the poor and the lowly? Why 
don't you get up among the high 
and the mighty ? Take Henry Ward 
Beecher, for instance" — he was then 
alive, the great pastor of the Brook- 
lyn Tabernacle — "convert him and 
his whole congregation would flock 
in after him; and just see how that 
would build up your Church !" I 
said to Mr. Davenport, "That is not 
God's way of building up His 
church. The Lord declared by an 
ancient prophet, 'I will take you one 
of a city and two of a family, and I 
will bring you to Zion and give you 
pastors after mine own heart." I 
explained the great problem of the 
dispersion and gathering of Israel, 
whereby the blood of Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob, the blood that be- 
lieves, with spirits answering to that 
blood, who have been dispersed for 
a wise purpose among all nations, 
are now being recalled and brought 
together in a great movement called 
"The Gathering," preparatory to the 
building of the New Jerusalem and 
the glorious coming of the Lord." 
And I added, "God is not anxious 
for great conregations. He is not 
desirous that the Jews, or any other 
people, should make a bargain with 
Him and join His Church -as a busi- 
ness proposition." 

The suggestion reminded me of 
that scene in Shakespeare's "Mer- 
chant of Venice," where poor old 
Shylock stands before the court, 
condemned ! for having conspired 
against the life of a citizen of Ven- 
ice, and the judge decrees in effect: 
"Half of your goods are confiscate 
to the merchant Antonio, whose life 
you sought, and half are confiscate 
to the state of Venice, whose laws 
you have outraged; and, moreover, 
the court decides that you shall

straightway become a Christian." 
( Laughter. ) 

Christians are not made by judic- 
ial decisions, nor are Latter-day 
Saints converted by legislative en- 
actment or by commercial bargain- 
ing. There is but one way to make 
a Latter-day Saint. A man must 
have faith in God, he must repent of 
his sins, he must have his sins 
washed away by baptism at the 
hands of one having divine author- 
ity to administer sacred ordinances ; 
he must have hands laid upon him 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
by that testimony he will know that 
this is God's work, and become a 
full fledged Latter-day Saint. This 
is the strength of the Church — that 
every man, woman and child who 
has obeyed the Gospel knows for 
himself or herself that it is God's 
truth, God's work. This is the rock 
upon which Christ founded His 
Church, and the gates of hell can- 
not prevail against it. Amen.

It is observed that from one end 
of this great auditorium to the other 
all heads are uncovered. The sis- 
ters have voluntarily removed their 
hats so we are confronted by a sea 
of intelligent faces, instead of feath- 
ers and ribbons. Aunt Emmeline 
Wells, President of the Relief So- 
ciety, sets the example. The mem- 
bers of the Tabernacle choir, who 
have 'found it difficult to take care of 
their millinery, have conformed to 
this custom of the Church. The 
President desires me to make this 
comment, and say that the universal 
observance of this custom is very 
much appreciated by the General 
Authorities of the Church. 

The choir rendered the anthem, 



"Mighty Jehovah, Accept Our 
Praises;" A. Clyde Crawford sang 
the bass solo. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith.

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, April 5th, 1914. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Anthony W. Ivins. 

The Murray ward choir pro- 
vided the musical numbers, under 
direction of Wm. F. Robinson, and 
an orchestra conducted by Wm. N. 
Morris. 

The orchestra played while the 
congregation was assembling. . 

The choir and orchestra rendered 
the hymn, "Come, dearest Lord, de- 
scend and dwell." 

Elder Ferdinand F. • Hintze of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Palms," with orchestra and organ 
accompaniment. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

I am very happy, my brethren and 
sisters, to have the privilege of 
meeting with you in conference this 
morning, and I trust that the few 
moments I occupy in speaking to 
you I may be inspired with the 
Spirit of the Lord. I desire an in- 
terest in your sympathy, and in your 
faith and prayers, that the Lord may 
inspire me in whatever I may say. 

I am truly thankful that I had the 
privilege of attending our meetings 
yesterday, and listening to the words 
of inspiration that flowed from the 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



lips of those who addressed us. I 
was particularly interested in the re- 
marks of our beloved President, and 
in the reports that he gave of the 
excellent conditions that exist in the 
Church. It made me glad, it made 
me feel that the work is rolling on- 
ward, and it gave me an assurance 
that truly the words uttered by 
Jesus to Peter upon that memorable 
occasion when he asked his disciples 
"Whom do men say that I am?" 
were being fulfilled. I would like 
to read to you this morning what 
the Savior said to Peter on that oc- 
casion, and comment a little on what 
I believe to be the fulfillment of 
those words in what we are witness- 
ing: 

"When Jesus came into the coasts of 
Caesarea Phillippi, he asked his disci- 
ples, saying, Whom do men sav that 
I the Son of man am? And they said, 
Some say that thou art John the Bap- 
tist, some Elias; and others Jeremias, 
or one of the prophets. He saith unto 
them, But whom say ye that I am? 
And Simon Peter answered and said, 
Thout art the Christ, the son of the 
living God. And Jesus answered and 
said unto him. Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-jona, for flesh and blood hath not 
revealed it unto thee, but my Father 
which is in heaven. And I say also 
unto thee. That thou art Peter, and 
upon this rock I will build my church; 
and the sr-ites of hell shall not prevail 
against it." (Matt. 16:13-18.) 

I reflected yesterday, in listening 
to the report of the President, on 
the fact that it seemed from the very 
incipiency of this work, in this day 
and age in which we live, that the 
gates of hell, in a measure, have 
been against this work. It seems 
as though most all the powers that 
could be brought to bear have been 
used in the effort to retard the prog- 
ress of this work in this age. This 
Church has been organized, in ful- 
fillment of the words of the Savior, 



upon the rock of revelation, and the 
gates Of hell, and all the powers of 
men that can be combined and 
brought to bear against this work, 
will not be able to retard its prog- 
ress. We heard from the lips of our 
President, yesterday, that the Church 
is in a better condition than it ever 
has been since it was organized. 
There are more people living in ac- 
cordance with the doctrines and 
commandments of the Gospel, as 
they are taught to us, than ever be- 
fore ; and the quorums of the priest- 
hood are more united in performing 
their duty, in extending and pro- 
claiming the word to those who 
know not the truth, than they ever 
have been in the past. This is very 
gratifying. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, it 
seems that great powers have been 
brought to bear to retard this work, 
to bring to naught the work of the 
Lord, from the moment that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith announced to 
his friends, and to the world, that 
he had received a vision in which 
he had seen the Father and the Son, 
and in which he had been com- 
manded to organize the Church as 
it was organized by the Savior an- 
ciently. Persecution followed him 
until the day he was martyred, and 
persecution pursued the Church 
from place to place, until the Saints 
were driven across the plains to 
these valleys of the mountains. Not 
only persecutions of wicked men 
were brought to bear against this 
people, but the Saints were brought 
face to face with persecutions, as it 
were, of the elements. It is said 
that the trail of our people across 
the plains could be traced by the 
graves of their loved ones, so many 
perished by the way; and then, of 
course, there were the hardships in- 
cident to redeeming the desert and 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 



45 



laying the foundations of a new 
state. But notwithstanding all these 
things, the Church has come off tri- 
umphant, and the work has pro- 
gressed, and is progressing today in 
the world more than it ever before 
has done. My testimony and firm 
belief is that it will continue to pro- 
gress more and more. 

The work being done in the mis- 
sions today, particularly in the mis- 
sion that I have been engaged in, I 
can testify is very encouraging, and 
the people seem to be very desirous 
of hearing the truth concerning 
"Mormonism." Thus, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that the world is in a 
condition of disbelief in regard to 
the old isms they have before be- 
lieved in, it seems to me that more 
than ever before is the way open to 
the elders of our Church to teach 
the Gospel to the people. 

Now; brethren and sisters, there 
are conditions that exist today, at 
home, that have to be met, and we 
must not believe, as I view it, that 
the persecutions that have been 
brought to bear upon us formerly 
will cease. Conditions confront us 
today that are different from those 
that confronted our fathers, and 
those who crossed the oceans and 
plains, and came to these valleys 
and subdued them, and made it pos- 
sible for us to live here in peace and 
quietude, even in luxury, enjoying 
all the blessings of the Lord. There 
are conditions that we, particularly 
the younger people, have to encoun- 
ter that are just as terrible, just as 
potent in their influence to drag 
down the Church of Christ, and to 
bring to naught His purposes in the 
earth, as were the persecutions and 
influences that were brought to bear 
against our fathers. We must not 
flatter ourselves that we are immune 
to those temptations and persecu- 



tions. We should realize that we 
are surrounded, all the time, by the 
influences of the evil one; and it is 
only those that will set their faces 
as flint against evil that will triumph 
in the end. The Savior said that 
those who endure to the end shall 
be saved ; and those who do not keep 
the commandments of the Lord will 
fall by the wayside. The decree has 
gone forth, and it will be fulfilled, 
that this Church will not be left to 
another people, and that this king- 
dom will increase, and go on to per- 
fection; and the very gates of hell 
shall have no power or influence to 
overthrow the Church. Yet there is 
a possibility of some of us so far 
forgetting ourselves that we will 
slip out, and be left behind. 

I wish to appeal to the young folks, 
and ask, after we have had the ex- 
amples of those who have crossed 
the plains, and subdued the desert, 
and endured the hardships incident 
to settling these valleys, shall we lie 
down before the temptations that 
stare us in the face ? Shall we allow 
the influence of Babylon to come 
among us, and destroy that which 
our fathers built up in our behalf? 
or shall we, the younger generation, 
set our faces' as flint against the 
temptations of the evil one, that are 
ever present wherever the people of 
this earth dwell? Shall we resist 
temptation, and make it possible for 
us to continue with the body of the 
Church, that will not be overpow- 
ered by the influences of the world, 
or be overwhelmed by any wicked 
influence or power under the sun? 
I know there are harmful conditions 
existing here that have to be met. 
I have had the privilege, for the last 
few months, of laboring among the 
young folks in this city, visiting in 
the stake where I reside, as a home 
missionary, and I have seen that the 



46 



LrENERAL CONFERENCE. 



young people have great obstacles 
thrown in their path, and great 
temptations to overcome. I con- 
stantly feel it my duty to raise my 
voice against the possibility of the 
young people yielding to those temp- 
tations and evils. The parents should 
know all the conditions that sur- 
round the young 'folks, and they 
should throw a safeguard around 
their children, our young people, and 
set their faces against the evils of 
the day, and help them to overcome 
these conditions. 

I pray for the youth of Zion. I 
pray that they may have power to 
overcome the obstacles in their 
paths, and be able to keep them- 
selves unspotted from the sins of the 
world and the generation in which 
we live. Wrong conditions are every 
day apparent, they are every day 
with us. It is our privilege and duty 
to live near unto the Lord, and to 
have His Spirit always to be with 
us, to guide us in the ways of all 
truth. I have often had occasion 
to make promise to those in the 
world who embraced our principles 
and became connected with this 
Church, that if they will live accord- 
ing to the dictates of the Spirit that 
they are entitled to, and that they 
receive at their baptism, there is no 
power in or out of the world that 
can take them out of this Church. 
It is only the men and women who 
forget themselves, and who live so 
that the Spirit of God leaves them, 
that the powers of evil can success- 
fully assail and break down their 
faith, and cause them to do those 
things that result in loss of blessings 
that they would otherw'ise be enti- 
tled to. 

I bear my testimony that I know 
this work is true. I know that 
Joseph Smith was raised up in this 
day and generation for the special 



purpose of organizing the Church 
in its purity and fulness, and it ex- 
ists today just as the church existed 
when our Savior established and or- 
ganized it, when He came in the 
meridian of time. I know positively 
that those who have guided the 
Church from the days of Joseph 
Smith the Prophet until the present 
day have been prophets, seers and 
revelators unto the Church. I bear 
testimony that the power of God 
unto salvation is in the Gospel we 
have received. We should live in 
accordance with the teachings that 
we receive from day to day, from 
the living oracles that we have 
among us. The Lord can conduct 
this work without the use of the 
Bible, or the Book of Mormon, or 
any other book. He has seen fit to 
provide us with these books and 
records, for a wise purpose, but we 
should not restrict ourselves -to the 
letter of the word, but should en- 
deavor to live according to the Spirit 
of the Gospel, and according to the 
spirit of the instructions that we re- 
ceive from those who are placed in 
authority over us, whom the Lord 
has placed in our midst to tell us 
what to do. 

I have a testimony that this work 
will continue to progress, and that 
the gates of hell will not prevail 
against it. I know these things be- 
yond the question of a doubt, and 
it is a great consolation to me. I 
thank the Lord for the privilege of 
going into the world and teaching 
the Gospel to people that are sitting 
in darkness. The Savior said, "This 
gospel of the kingdom shall be 
preached in all the world as a wit- 
ness, and then shall the end come." 
God is a just God, and he designs 
to judge the world by this gospel, 
and he will not judge them unless

they have had the privilege of hear- 
ing it. 

In Mexico, where I have been en- 
gaged in missionary work, there are 
millions of people that have not the 
slightest conception of what "Mor- 
monism" is ; in fact they have no 
conception of what true Christianity 
means ; therefore, how can they be- 
lieve Christ taught and lived as He 
did unless these things are taught 
unto them? The missionary work 
in the world is a grand, and great, 
and glorious work, and it is our 
privilege to prepare Ourselves, as 
young men and women, to do this 
work in the world. I believe firmly 
that all those that have this desire in 
their heart will have the privilege of 
carrying the Gospel into the world. 
I can promise all young men and 
women, that if they will accept hum- 
bly, and perform thankfully the du- 
ties of the missionary, that there is 
no labor in their lives that will give 
them more joy. They will not de- 
sire any earthly recompense if they 
will labor faithfully and humbly, 
because the very act Of doing good 
unto others, bringing people from a 
state of darkness into light, is suf- 
ficient recompense for the time and 
trouble spent in performing this 
missionary work. 

I do not desire, my brethren and 
sisters, to prolong my remarks, as 
there are others who will address 
you ; but I desire to say again that I 
am happy to be here, and that I am 
happy to have had the privilege of 
bearing my testimony to you. I 
hope I will remain firm and faithful 
in this testimony, and that we all 
will do likewise, and go on to per- 
fection in this great gospel of pro- 
gression, and eventually be saved in 
the kingdom of our Father in heav- 
en, is the prayer I ask, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

The majority of men and women 
in the world are perfectly willing to 
go to heaven, if they can go on their 
own terms. We discovered from the 
report of President Smith, yester- 
day, that there are some also in the 
Church who would like to go on 
their own terms, who would like to 
lay aside some of the requirements 
the Lord has made and substitute 
their own notions, and they believe 
that their ideas of what they ought 
to do are as good as what the Lord 
has given. We missionaries are con- 
stantly under the necessity of show- 
ing men and women in the world 
that the wisest forms of worship de- 
vised by the wisdom of men are woe- 
fully inefficient, and not to be com- 
pared with the terms given by Him 
who has the right to make the re- 
quirements. 

I have undertaken to illustrate the 
necessity of strict and absolute obe- 
dience to the requirements of the 
Lord, by appealing to the knowledge 
of men and women with respect to 
the necessity rjf yielding obedience 
to the laws of the land, or complying 
technically with the terms of a will. 
If I shall inherit a property granted 
or left to me by my father, grand- 
father, or any one who has a right 
to will or deed, or give to me any- 
thing that he possesses, you who are 
acquainted with matters of this char- 
acter know that if one is possessed 
of property, he has a perfect right 
to state the terms upon which his 
children or descendants shall inherit 



48

the property; and you know also 
that if you wish to inherit such in- 
terests as are left to you in a will 
you must strictly and absolutely 
comply with the terms of that will, 
or you cannot inherit. 

I take it that if there is any hope 
in the human heart of a hereafter, of 
a life beyond this, of a heaven, of a 
place of progress, it has to come 
through the revelations of God to 
man, largely revealed in the teach- 
ings of the Lord Jesus Christ. While 
others have had some faith that 
there is a hereafter, we have been 
given positive and absolute assur- 
ance, by the demonstrations given 
in the power manifest both in the 
preaching and in the miracles, so 
called, in the life of Jesus Christ. 
There are better evidences to believe 
that what He said is true, than to 
believe the statements of any man. 
He spoke not only with authority, 
but acted as possessed with power 
such as no man has ever exhibited 
while upon the earth. I say that if 
we shall inherit salvation, a life be- 
yond this, a glory, it shall be through 
the wonderful and wise provisions 
instituted by the Lord Himself. 

If we believe the Scriptures, we 
shall accept the statement of John, 
that "in the beginning was the 
Word," and by the Word was the 
world made, "and the Word was 
made flesh, and dwelt among us." 
In other words, that Jesus Christ, 
under the direction of His Father, 
was the organizer and builder of 
this world ; that out of the elements 
that existed in space, He, the great 
Master, compounded, produced and 
materialized this substantial world 
npon which you and I live ; that we 
are indebted to Him, and to our 
Father in heaven, for this life that 
we are enjoving, the bodies that we 
have, the beautiful world that we 



inhabit. We sometimes wonder 
where our heaven will be, that is, 
the people of the world wonder. We 
Latter-day Saints have no reason to 
doubt where our heaven will be, for 
the Lord has made known to us, that 
this splendid world that has been 
provided for us will ultimately be 
redeemed, having obeyed the laws of 
its being, and become celestialized, 
the home of celestial beings ; so that 
if we shall ever come into heaven, or 
heavenly conditions, it will be, ulti- 
mately, upon this redeemed world. 
Jesus Christ has been the organizer 
and the builder of it, possessed with 
power to do all that. 

Sometimes I am astonished at the 
expressions of men professing to be- 
lieve in Jesus Christ, and His claim 
to be the Son of God, when they 
doubt that He had the power to turn 
water into wine, and create and ma- 
terialize a few loaves and fishes. 
When I think of their objection, I 
think of the splendid world that has 
been produced by the wonderfully 
marvelous power, ability, and knowl- 
edge such as Jesus Christ exhibited. 
If Jesus had planted a vine, and 
waited until the little grape had de- 
veloped and had absorbed from na- 
ture those particular ingredients 
necessary to produce the wine, it 
would have been considered no mir- 
acle. Or if he had sown a few 
bushels of grain, and waited until 
they had matured and materialized, 
it would have been considered no 
miracle to have gathered it and 
made bread to feed the multitude. 
But where did all that bread come 
from? Where do the millions of 
bushels of wheat that are raised in 
these valleys come from? Who 
brought it here? All the pioneers 
did was to bring a little seed. Where 
do the millions of gallons of wine 
that are produced come from? No 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



49 



man produced it. It was in the ele- 
ments, and the seed possessed the 
power to abstract or draw from the 
soil, and from the atmosphere those 
particular elements that are every- 
where in attendance, provided by 
the great all-wise Providence. Those 
instruments, those seeds, had the 
power to extract from nature her 
resources, and produce, after a sea- 
son, the wine or the bread, through 
that life activity drawing from na- 
ture's resources to feed man and 
beast. Who do you suppose gave to 
the vine its power to work this mir- 
able in nature? Who do you sup- 
pose organized the kernel of grain, 
gave it the power to draw from 
nature those component parts nec- 
essary to make more grain? Why, 
the Creator. Do you not suppose 
that He who organized this splendid 
world knew of plant life? The 
Scriptures tell us that even the herbs 
of the field before they grew were 
organized, prepared to live in this 
world ; and He who organized it 
also organized the plant life, and 
animal life, and assigned to each its 
place and sphere. He who did it, 
who organized the vegetable life, 
the tree, and the kernel of grain, re- 
served to Himself the power to work 
this miracle independent of the vine 
or the kernel of grain. And when I 
look into the splendid world organ- 
ized by His superior power, with 
all its beauty and all is varie- 
ty of life, and then listen to the 
objections of some short-sighted 
individual who doubts His ability, 
after organizing such a splendid 
world, to produce a little wine or 
produce bread, to me it is almost 
ridiculous. 

When I think of this, I also think 
of the objections made on the part 
of those who doubt that there is a 
God in all the universe, and hold 



that nature happens to produce 
these results by some chance or 
other, or in a mysterious or peculiar 
way known only to nature, that she 
assumes to act in that particular 
way. When I think of some of those 
who have traveled around the world, 
and some who have not gone out of 
their own counties, trying to dis- 
cover if perchance God will be seen 
manifest in some state or nation, or 
somewhere else in this world, I won- 
der at their ignorance of the position 
that they occupy when they deny 
that there is a great and mighty 
Creator. If you have traveled 
around the world and have not dis- 
cerned Him, and have not found sat- 
isfactory evidences of His existence, 
or manifestations of His presence in 
this world, you yet are not entitled 
to say He is not. If you are prop- 
erly informed, you will know that 
this is but one of the smallest of all 
the worlds, and that it belongs to 
what is known as our solar system, 
comprising many worlds revolving 
around the sun. We had better, per- 
haps, go out to our big brother 
Jupiter, that is so much larger than 
our world, in an effort to find evi- 
dences of God. If we failed to find 
Him there, we might endeavor to 
explore the sun, the great ruling, 
controlling world in our system, that 
our astronomers tell us is so much 
larger than our earth that it would 
take upwards of three million worlds 
like this to make one the size of the 
sun. And then, if our finite minds 
failed to find sufficient evidences of 
God in that, should we be entitled 
to say that He is not ? No ! Let us 
look still higher, and we will dis- 
cover there are fifty millions of suns 
in the view of man, like unto our 
sun, one rising above the other in 
majesty and power. There are suns 
so great it would take ten thousand 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the size of ours to make one like 

unto those mighty suns, and then if 
we still had not been able to satisfy 
ourselves, or discover sufficient evi- 
dences of the creative power of God, 
are we then entitled to assume that 
we have not found evidences of His 
existence? No, for with all the 
power you might have to discover 
these, you might justifiably conclude 
that there are innumerable millions 
of worlds that man cannot see. If a 
man started out to reach the nearest 
of those worlds outside of our solar 
system, they are so far away that 
it would require over four years, 
traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles 
per second, the rate that light trav- 
els, before he would reach any of 
them; and if he tried to search 
further in the universe, it would take 
unlimited millions of years, travel- 
ing at the rate of 186,000 miles per 
second. It would be about as easy 
for him to find the extent of the uni- 
verse as it would for him, if he were 
traveling up the Mississippi Valley 
in an airship, far above the earth, to 
discover a mustard seed hidden in 
that valley. 

For a puny man, able to travel 
only a little way around this world, 
to assume to be so great, so wise and 
so mighty that he can declare that 
God is not, reduces him to such an 
insignificant atom, so little, so small, 
that he, if he could only see himself, 
would be utterly disgusted with his 
supposed wisdom. The wisest and 
greatest men in science have always 
been the humblest. It was Sir Isaac 
Newton, who had advanced further 
than most men, who humbly said, I 
have been but as a child playing 
upon the sea shore ; and have suc- 
ceeded in discovering a few puny 
pebbles and shells, but the mighty 
ocean lies before me unexplored. 
The great man is the humble man, 



and he knows that he don't know it 
all. When men begin trying to dis- 
cover, as they say, the origin of life 
upon this world, they manifest the 
lack of sufficient reasoning power, 
they should remember that in the 
midst of this creation there are 
worlds infinitely older than ours. It 
is absurd to try to account for the 
origin of life on our earth, just as 
absurd as it would be to come to 
Salt Lake City to find evidences of 
the earliest existence of human life 
upon the American continent. We 
would naturally begin such research 
in those places where people lived 
before they came to this city. Like- 
wise in the mighty universe, we 
would have to go to those worlds 
that are older than ours to discover 
some df those secret wonders of na- 
ture that we try to discover on this 
earth. In the meantime, would it 
not be wise for us to listen to the 
words of those who are better in- 
formed than we are, to obtain infor- 
mation upon conditions in the worlds 
that existed prior to the organiza- 
tion of this world ? Surely it would 
be wise to listen to some of their 
suggestions and advice with respect 
to these matters. 

There are men who are forming 
all sorts of schemes for their own 
salvation and exaltation; but I as- 
sert that Jesus Christ had the right 
to designate the way by which you 
and I may inherit the salvation that 
we desire, and that we may have 
eternal life and being upon another 
world, or this world, we are indebt- 
ed to His wise and wonderful pro- 
visions. He has a right to say what 
I shall do; and if I shall inherit I 
must obey absolutely that which He 
has required. I am not dictator in 
the case ; I have no right to demand 
the estate. As before remarked, 
perchance my father, or my grand- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



51 



father, leaving an estate, leaving a 
will decreeing upon what terms I 
may inherit, may have specified some 
terms that I do not like, but I cannot 
inherit unless I shall comply tech- 
nically and strictly with the terms 
df the will. And so, though I may 
feel that there are some things in 
the Gospel that I do not under- 
stand, or that to me might seem un- 
necessary, or undesirable, I have no 
right to absolve them, or lay aside 
the terms provided by the one who 
has the right to specify what should 
be followed. Yet many assume to 
say we do not know whether these 
are the correct terms or not. There 
are numerous churches, each con- 
tending they have the correct plan. 
They arrogate the right, and they 
are interpreting according to their 
own will, and adding to the con- 
fusion. How eminently necessary 
it is that the true will may be made 
known, and all of its terms made 
perfectly clear and plain. After all 
the evidences of doubt which have 
gathered around this will, through 
the notions and interpretations of 
men, how important are the words 
of the Master, coming direct, ring- 
ing through the courts of glory, to 
us anew, giving the exact terms of 
that will, making it plain, clear of 
all doubt, and specifying with cer- 
tainty what the requirements are. 
And if I discover the terms of the 
will (I am speaking as an illustra- 
tion), can I legally inherit property 
without I comply with those terms 
on my own part? No; I must find 
some legally appointed judge, who 
has the right and authority to ad- 
minister on that will, and I must go 
to him in a judicial court, and there 
comply with the terms of the will, 
and have the judge certify that I 
have done it, and by his decree that 
I have complied with the terms 



legally, he may give me title to the 
property. Seeking to evade those 
proceedings would not give me title 
nor claim. 

Just so it is with men and women 
in the world with respect to the 
words prescribed by Jesus Christ, 
the terms by which they may inherit 
eternal life and the blessings of 
heaven, the beautiful and splendid 
celestial world that He is providing 
for us. I must not only know what 
the words of the will are, but I 
must find the legally appointed ser- 
vants of God who have the right 
and the authority to administer the 
terms of that will. I cannot do it by 
finding some man who claims a 
right without divine appointment. 
I must find those who are legally 
appointed and rightfully constituted 
as the delegated authorities of heav- 
en. I assert to the world, to all 
churches and to all men, that here 
has been restored and established 
the authority of the holy priesthood, 
the only men delegated by God to 
administer the terms of this will to 
man. In the priesthood of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, are the rightfully consti- 
tuted and delegated authorities. 
These bearers of this priesthood can 
trace through the hands of one, two, 
or three men the authority that has 
come upon them directly from Peter, 
James, and John, who received their 
divine appointment under the ad- 
ministration of Jesus Christ Him- 
self. I cannot get legal title to these 
blessings and ignore this priesthood 
established by God. I . shall dis- 
cover, too, that I will not be able to 
do anything that the Lord has re- 
quired at my hands without com- 
pliance with His way, His terms. 
If I undertake to produce electricity, 
and abridge some of the essential 
things necessary to its production, 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will I get electricity? If in the 
realm of chemistry, I undertake to 
ignore some of the well known and 
established principles by which I 
shall produce certain chemical re- 
sults, will I get the results? So on 
the farm, if I neglect to use some 
of the methods well known to be 
necessary in the cultivation otf the 
soil, shall I get the results? or in 
any field of activity? No. Law 
rules and priciples govern every- 
where ; and I will discover that 
there are rules, laws, and principles, 
with respect to men, that have been 
divinely established, and not formu- 
lated out of caprice. Jesus Christ 
said, "I came not to do my own 
will, but the will of the father who 
sent me." The law that He an- 
nounced and established, was under 
the direction of the Father, and so 
even the Father could not abridge 
it, or make it null and void. He 
complied with it Himself, and 
through compliance with it became 
God. Jesus is the Christ, and you 
and I will discover that it is neces- 
sary for us to comply strictly with 
His law in order that we may in- 
herit. 

I suppose there are some in the 
Church who will excuse themselves, 
and say on account of some good 
they do, "I am a pretty good man, 
I go to meeting, I look after the 
sick ; but I smoke once in a while, 
I drink a little, I take a glass of beer 
sometimes, I pay a little tithing, one 
hundred dollars a year, I think that 
is pretty good, I will come out all 
right." By such conduct we excuse 
ourselves, trying to deceive our- 
selves by only partly complying. 
There is a scripture that is not thor- 
oughly understood, wherein Jesus 
said, If ye fail in the least of these, 
ye are guilty of breaking the whole. 
Now I want to say what appeals to 



me with respect to that matter. I 
do not think that if a man keeps 
two-thirds of the commandments of 
the Lord that he is as bad off as the 
man that is not keeping any. There 
are those who assert that all roads 
lead to heaven. But there are many- 
roads that lead to Salt Lake City, or 
to New York, and no matter which 
road you take, it will bring you 
there. I am perfectly agreed with 
my friends that every man that does 
some good, that good will take him 
so far on the way toward the goal 
of salvation, part of the way. Some 
of us get just about one-half the 
way, some of us two-thirds ; but 
until we get to the goal we do not 
get what we are seeking for. We 
discover that all men who do good 
are led toward God. Nevertheless, 
I must comply with each and every 
requirement_made if I wish to attain 
eternal life. While there may be 
many other ways that lead into a 
place, I cannot enter only by the 
straight and narrow gate ; and I 
must pass muster before I enter and 
meet all the requirements and con- 
ditions. If I have gone two-thirds 
df the way, there is just that much 
less for me to do; and there is just 
that much encouragement for the 
man or woman until they comply 
with all, but they <do not get the de- 
sired results. Just as in the case 
of the electricity, I may comply 
with two-thirds of the requirements 
to produce electricity; I may com- 
ply with nine-tenths, but I do not 
get it until I have complied with all. 
I am just that much nearer the goal, 
but I don't get the result until I 
comply strictly and absolutely with 
the law. So I say again that it is 
necessary that I shall be a strict ob- 
server in this regard. 

Jesus did not require anything 
that was unnecessary, in one single 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



53 



thing. How can I expect to inherit 
the place promised by obedience to 
the law of tithing, except I keep 
that law? I am deceiving myself if 
I am only a tithe payer on account. 
The grand and glorious principle is 
that I am an honest tithe payer, and 
that I pay the full tenth. And the 
greatest asset is in the training of 
the man and the woman that are 
found complying with this principle, 
better and greater than possessing 
much land in. these splendid valleys. 
While the world may build splendid 
cities, and railroads, and accomplish 
other enterprises of a wonderful 
character, they may be morally 
weak. The greatest asset of this 
Church today is the splendid man- 
hood and womanhood this Church is 
building, the training and perfecting 
of men and women through obedi- 
ence to the Gospel. I appeal to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that you 
shall not treat lightly a single re- 
quirement made, and that we shall 
be strict observers df those obliga- 
tons enjoined upon us. We deceive 
ourselves if we think we can get the 
results, the promised blessings, ex- 
cept we comply with the laws on 
which they are predicated. 

The Lord bless us and give us 
strength and courage to comply with 
these requirements, not minimize 
one of them, but so live faithfully 
in the observance of our part in the 
stewardship over which we preside, 
that it can truly be said of us: 
"Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant ; thou hast been faithful 
over a few things, I will make thee 
ruler over many." Nevetheless, 
never shall we hear these words, in 
time or eternity, until we have been 
faithful, strictly and absolutely, ac- 
cording to the requirements. God 
bless us to have faith in these things, 
and enable us to live so that we will 



comply even with that which we 
have not yet seen, that may be re- 
quired, and trust the promises that 
have been made by Him whose 
promises never fail, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURBIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

In standing in your presence, 
brethren and sisters, I do so in the 
hope that through the blessings of 
the Lord I may discharge this duty 
acceptably to my Father in heaven, 
and to the good and blessing of all 
those who are gathered together in 
this' meeting of the general confer- 
ence. My heart has been made glad 
in listening to the words that have 
been spoken to us by President Rey 
L. Pratt, of the Mexican mission, 
and by President Melvin J. Ballard 
of the Northwestern States Mis- 
sion. The words of one of the in- 
spired writers have been forcibly im- 
pressed upon my mind. The doc- 
trine that has been taught unto us 
this morning is not the doctrine of 
the men who have been teaching 
us. It is the doctrine of our Father 
in heaven ; and the only way where- 
by men can understand and know 
the truth of the doctrine, is by re- 
ceiving and testing the principles 
that have been expounded. When 
the Redeemer of men tarried in the 
flesh and undertook to teach men 
the way of salvation, He could only 
make them a promise of this char- 
acter. He was looked upon as an 
imposter. Men did not believe that 
it was possible for one of so lowly 
an origin to be the Great Redeemer 
and deliverer for whom they had 
been looking for ages. His words 
have been in my mind, He could 
only say to them : "My doctrine 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is not Mine, but His that sent me. 
If any man will do His will, he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it 
be of God, or whether I speak of 
Myself." 

My brethren and sisters, I thank 
the Lord that in my own experi- 
ences I have demonstrated the truth 
of this announcement made ages 
ago, and I take it that every Lat- 
ter-day Saint, every missionary, 
every man, and every woman, who 
have taken upon them the name of 
the Redeemer of the world, in the 
way that has been appointed by the 
great law giver, have had like ex- 
periences, and they have learned the 
absolute truth of these things be- 
cause they have lived in harmony 
with the principles of the Gospel. 
They have had evidences come to 
them by the divine aid of the Holy 
Spirit that have swept away all 
doubt, and that have made them 
know in very deed, that the doc- 
trines that they have attempted to 
put into practice are necessary and 
constitute the saving principles of 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I have been greatly impressed, 
my brethren and sisters, with the 
manifestations of that spirit of kind- 
ness and forgiveness, that is taught 
in the Gospel, through meeting quite 
recently in Arizona, many of our 
people who have been expelled from 
their homes in Mexico. I found 
among them a wonderful spirit of 
forbearance. It has been marvel- 
ous to me to listen to their words 
of kindness, and the manner in 
which they defend the people who 
are responsible for their expulsion 
from their homes at the present 
time. 

While sitting here, listening to 
the words of President Pratt, in re- 
lation to the persecution and oppo- 
sition that have been brought to 



bear against the work of God, I 
could not help but think of one very 
remarkable and unexpected testi- 
mony concerning our vitality and 
wonderful growth that I heard from 
one of our faith, many years ago, 
when I was laboring abroad as a 
missionary. Our indifference at 
times gives cause for fear that we 
ourselves, here at home, under Gos- 
pel influences, and under the guid- 
ance of those who have been author- 
ized to teach and instruct in the way 
of salvation, we, ofttimes do not 
appreciate the marvelous manifesta- 
tions of the divine favor of our Cre- 
ator. The matter to which I have 
made reference occurred in a lecture 
that was delivered by a man who 
has been world-renowned in his 
time, Charles H. Bradlaugh one oc- 
cupying a position among the Brit- 
ish people similar to that that has 
been occupied by Robert G. Inger- 
sol in America. I was at one time 
invited, with other missionaries, to 
attend a lecture delivered by this 
noted man in the city of Bristol. His 
theme was "Is Christianity a Per- 
secuting Religion?" He gave 
abundant evidence of being familiar 
with the religious history of the 
world, particularly those portions of 
religious history that have been 
made during periods of persecution. 
It is a, sad thing to know that there 
have been dreadful deeds committed 
in the name of religion. Those who 
have professed to be ministers of the 
gospel have ruthlessly murdered 
their fellowmen in the name of the 
lowly Nazarine. In the name of the 
Being of all beings who has ever 
lived upon this earth who has stood 
for peace, who has been the embodi- 
ment of forbearance, and charity, 
and love. Who has taught the doc- 
trine that we have heard announced 
in this conference, that when we are 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



55 



smitten upon one cheek we should 
turn the others also. In His name 
so-called religious teachers have 
been guilty of some of the most 
dreadful deeds that blacken the 
pages of history. Possibly there 
have been men in times past who 
have felt that they were doing God's 
service when they persecuted those 
who did not see and understand, 
and believe as they understood. This 
noted lecturer was familiar with all 
such pages of history, and he 
brought to the attention of the gen- 
tlemen who were gathered together 
to hear him, many very dreadful 
stories. An opportunity was given 
at the close of the lecture for those 
who were present, to propound 
questions, among others a young 
man arose and asked if it was not 
true that in the commencement of 
the ministry of the Lord Jesus 
Christ He stood practically alone, 
and that He was from the ranks 
of the lowly, and that those who 
gave attention to His testimony 
were drawn from the same ranks; 
that He and they were without 
power ; that they were few in num- 
ber and were without worldly influ- 
ence, and also without wealth. The 
answer was that was the condition. 
Then this question was propounded. 
"Was there not arrayed against this 
lowly individual, and the people who 
had been drawn to Him from the 
ranks of the poor, who, like Him- 
self, were without power and influ- 
ence, the might of the great Roman 
empire, and was it not the decree 
and the determination of those who 
were in authority to crush out the 
religion of the Nazarine, and to 
destroy those who had given alle- 
giance to Him?" The answer was 
frankly given, that that was the con- 
dition. Then the young man asked, 
"How do you account for the pres- 



ervation of the early Christian 
Church in the face of this deadly op- 
position, if there be no God ; if there 
w,as no hand of providence extended 
over them how is it that they were 
preserved? It is the story df the 
world that when great strength and 
might is arrayed against weakness, 
weakness must give way, and be 
destroyed, and that strength and 
might prevail. How is it those early 
Christians were not destroyed?" I 
was very interested in the question. 
I wondered how it could be an- 
swered, because a very wonderful 
story of remarkable preservation 
has been written concerning the 
early Christian church. When Mr. 
Bradlaugh arose to make answer, 
he said, "Young man, away out in 
the western part of America there 
can be found a people who have had 
similar experiences to those of the 
early Christians, a people who have 
had arrayed against them the might 
of one of the mightiest of nations, 
a people who have had arrayed 
against them the religious preju- 
dices of all other peoples, and yet 
in spite of all opposition, in spite of 
this prejudice and religious hate, 
that people have made remarkable 
headway, and the history that they 
have written during recent years is 
more remarkable than anything that 
has been written concerning the 
early Christian Church. I speak, he 
said, of the 'Mormon' Church of 
Utah. Do you think that because of 
their preservation there is any evi- 
dence that the power of God has 
been extended over them, and that 
the great being whom you worship 
as Father and God, who created this 
earth upon which we dwell, has had 
His hand made manifest in their 
preservation ?" Of course there went 
forth from that gathering of peo- 
ple, when this statement was made, 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a titter of laughter. Who was there 
in that gathering that could say that 
the great God was interested in the 
"Mormon" people? Who was there 
that could feel that because their 
wonderful history paralleled the 
history of the early Christians that 
there was a living God who had de- 
creed that they should be preserved, 
just as those early Christians had 
been preserved, until the work that 
our Father had designed in the mer- 
idian of time had been by them fully 
accomplished? In my judgment it 
was not wisdom for me at the time 
to take any part in the discussion, 
as I was a guest of the chairman of 
that meeting, and in fact had been 
inlformed that discussion was not 
permitted. A question could be 
propounded and the answer would 
be given according to the view point 
of the lecturer. When the answer 
was given by the lecturer the ques- 
tion was closed. In my soul on the 
occasion named, there came a very 
great joy, my brethren and sisters, 
I was filled with happiness to know 
that when one of those men of the 
world, who was well posted in his- 
tory, and who was recognized in- 
tellectually as a giant among men, 
when such a man sought for a relig- 
ion and people to parallel the history 
of early Christians, he found my 
people. He brought the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to 
the attention of the audience, and 
bore record that our history was the 
history that paralleled the story of 
the early persecution and opposition 
to the Church of Christ in the mer- 
idian of time. 

I thank God that the same forces 
are in operation today that operated 
in that day, that the same Being has 
revealed the everlasting Gospel that 
planted His Gospel in the meridian 
of time, and that He has established 



this work in this our dispensation 
with a great promise, a promise 
that has been so often sounded in 
our ears, the promise that never in 
this age shall the cause of truth be 
overcome, or given to another peo- 
ple. God has planted this glorious 
work. He cries to men, He cries 
to you and to me to test the doc- 
trines- of His Gospel. He does not 
demand anything of any one of us 
beyond our power, only that we 
shall, in a spirit of humility, with a 
feeling of proper anxiety in our 
souls, seek to know the truth, and 
give those things that He has re- 
vealed an honest, fair test. The Lord 
God of heaven has Himself pledged 
to every man, and to every woman 
who will thus seek to understand 
the truth, the promise that he or she 
shall discover it. This knowledge 
is not to come by means of scientific 
discovery, or by the ideas that have 
taken possession df men in these 
latter times, educationally; but in 
the only way that God has ever 
given, that is, by the revelation of 
the Lord God to the individual, 
through the manifestations of the 
Holy Spirit, thereby dispelling dark- 
ness through the power of the Holy 
Ghost, that truth may burst into 
the soul, and that the human mind 
may be lit up by the inspiration and 
power of God, and be made to know 
that God lives, that He is our Fath- 
er, and that He has in very deed re- 
vealed the way of salvation. 

To my soul this knowledge has 
come ; I desire to repent, and to have 
faith and confidence in my Father 
in heaven, and I bear record of the 
truth of this work. This work that 
He has commanded shall be herald- 
ed among the nations. That re- 
sponsibility has come unto us, that 
we shall go to every nation and to 
every kindred and to every tongue 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

and to every people, sounding the 
message of the Gospel, and calling 
men to repentance, and point out to 
all the way of everlasting life. Every 
soul who has tested the message has 
been made to know the truth, and 
in that manner the knowledge of 
this work, its truth and power, has 
come to me. I bear this record, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, my Savior. 
Amen. 

The anthem, "Gog and Magog," 
was rendered. 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

May the blessings of heaven go 
with you, my brethren and sisters, 
as you disperse from this meeting. 

Believe in the Lord. Believe that 
He is, and that we are His children. 
Believe in Him as the Creator of 
the universe, the heavens above us 
and the earth upon which we dwell. 
Let us put our trust in Him. Cry to 
Him continually. Pray to Him in 
your fields that the harvest may be 
abundant; as you attend your flocks 
and herds, that there may be in- 
crease ; as you transact the business 
of your stores and counting houses, 
or whatever vocation the Lord has 
given you to labor in, let that labor 
be performed in His name, and with 
faith in Him. He does control the 
destinies of men and of nations. His 
kingdom will come and His will be 
done upon earth as it is in heaven. 
Every man and woman who have 
put their trust in Him, who have 
taken upon them the name of His 
only begotten Son, the Redeemer of 
the world, and entered into cove- 
nant that they will serve Him and 
keep His commandments, if they 
keep those covenants shall be 
brought back into His presence and 



be crowned with glory, immortality 
and everlasting life, and shall be re- 
deemed from death. 

I pray the blessings of the Lord 
upon our brethren and sisters who 
have furnished this splendid musical 
program, and all others of His peo- 
ple who are here, and those who are 
away from us. May God's blessing 
be with His Church eveyrwhere, I 
pray through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The anthem, "Hosannah," was 
rendered. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Roscoe W. Eardley. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Heber J. 
Grant presided. 

The Ogden Tabernacle choir fur- 
nished the musical service, under 
direction of Joseph Ballantyne, 
Samuel Whitaker, organist. 

Lillian Scott and the choir sang, 
"There is a green hill far away." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Hugh J. Cannon. 

Robert Binnie and the choir sang 
"Nazareth." 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

A few months ago the men of 
this nation, having an income of 
three thousand dollars per annum 
or more, were engaged in the duty 
of listing, under oath, their income 
during the months preceding, their 
worldly blessings, and I thought 
that if we of the Church, were to 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



list, under the same circumstances, 
and with the same obligation resting 
upon us, to make a true and com- 
plete inventory, all t he blessings 
which have come to us from "Mor- 
monism," that the schedule would 
indeed be a lengthy and imposing 
one. We would have to list, to be- 
gin with, I presume, a correct idea 
of deity, which has come to us from 
"Mormonism," even in the first rev- 
elation to the Prophet Joseph, as 
mentioned in the meeting this morn- 
ing, a knowledge of Deity such as 
set forth in the sermon of Elder B. 
H. Roberts, reproduced in the Des- 
eret News last evening. I shall not 
undertake in the time I have at my 
disposal to go into details in refer- 
ence to that subject, but just refer 
in a general way to the matters that 
are elucidated and set forth in that 
splendid talk. So we would have 
to credit to "Mormonism" a new 
volume of scripture, even the Book 
of Mormon, a book attested by the 
direct testimony of twelve credible 
witnesses, unimpeached and unim- 
peachable, competent witnesses al- 
together trustworthy, and attested 
by strong internal evidences. The 
work of the great sculptor attests 
itself. The work of the great artist 
likewise, or of the great poet. So 
the work of the great prophet speaks 
for itself. There are some things 
that cannot be fabricated in this 
world, and a volume of holy writ is 
one of those things that cannot be 
produced by fraud or deception. 
This morning as Elder O. F. Whit- 
ney mentioned the efforts to account 
for "Mormonism," I thought of 
similar accusations made against 
Christianity, and the way such argu- 
ments have been met. One writer 
argues thus : 

"Upon the theory that Christ was a 



mythical person, the result of the fancy 
and fairy stories of His disciples after 
His death, then we must conclude that 
the leader of the greatest movement for 
the converting, purifying, inspiring and 
uplifting of the race which the world has 
ever known is the prophet of myth, 
fancy, over-wrought imagination and 
pious deception. If this be true then it 
is also true that error is better than truth 
and the race moves upward under the 
beneficent influence of falsehood. But this 
is absurd, and the theory which forces 
such conclusions must be rejected." 

There would be listed also the 
Doctrine and Covenants, a modern 
volume of scripture. And in this con- 
nection, we might also note the fact 
that to "Mormonism" is due the be- 
lief, in modern times, in revelation, 
discarding the notion as expressed 
by one that "God is an absentee 
Deity, sitting idly since the first cre- 
ation morn on the outside of His 
world watching it go without con- 
cern." The truth is that in all ages 
of the world, the progress of man- 
kind has been guided and led by 
revelation, revelation that came not 
prematurely nor tardily, but just at 
the right time to be in advance of 
and lead the progress of mankind. 
And just as it was necessary for the 
Old Testament Scriptures to be sup- 
plemented by the revelations of the 
New, so it was likewise necessary 
for the revelations of the Jewish 
scriptures to be supplemented by the 
revelations contained in the Book 
of Mormon, the volume of Nephite 
scripture, and this Book of Cove- 
nants, containing modern revela- 
tions. As the information to the 
followers of Moses was not suffi- 
cient to guide those of the Christian 
dispensation, so the light of the 
Christian dispensation obscured as 
it had been through the centuries 
that had elapsed, was not sufficient 
for the guidance of the children of 
our Father in modern times. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



59 



There would be placed also in 
your schedule another volume of 
scripture, small, but nevertheless im- 
portant, the Pearl of Great Price, 
giving some ancient but very im- 
portant information concerning the 
universe, and concerning God's pur- 
poses in peopling this world of ours. 
That book is also well established, 
so well established that meddlesome 
priests cannot overthrow it. As 
well might the birds peck at the 
foundations of our magnificant 
granite-built temple to undermine it 
as for meddlesome priests to un- 
dertake to overthrow "Mormon- 
ism" by trying to pry out any of 
its foundation stones. The result 
of such an effort, recently, as in all 
by-gone years, has been that "Mor- 
monism" appears stronger than ever 
before. Just as the story goes of 
the resident of the cyclone district 
building a rock fence six feet wide 
and four feet high. He gave as 
the explanation for such dimensions 
if the cyclone turned it over, it 
would be two feet higher than be- 
fore. And so in our experiences, 
whenever any of the foundation 
principles of "Mormonism" are 
turned over, they are discovered to 
be many feet higher than they were 
before. 

And so the Church organization 
has been declared by a learned pro- 
fessor of one of our great univer- 
sities to be one of the great and 
strong organizations of the world. 

There would be listed also the 
authorized officers of this organ- 
ization, men not accomplishing 
things by their own power or tak- 
ing credit to themselves for work 
accomplished through them, but re- 
ceiving power from, and giving 
credit to the Father, whose work 
it is and under whose guidance they 
labor. 



And to "Mormonism" should be 
credited also the right idea in ref- 
erence to authority or priesthood, 
placing affairs pertaining to the 
kingdom of our Father, religious 
affairs, upon the same well known 
plan that our earthly affairs are 
placed upon, no principle being bet- 
ter understood or as generally acted 
upon in this world of ours, in either 
business or governmental affairs 
than that one cannot be an agent of 
the principal without the author- 
ization or the ratification of the 
principal. And so we recognize this 
truth as an important principle, that 
no man can take this honor upon 
himself save he be called of God as 
was Aaron, recognizing also the 
words of the Savior, "Ye have not 
chosen Me, but I have chosen you, 
and ordained you' that ye shall go 
and bring forth fruit, and that your 
fruit should remain." As indicated 
by the remarks of the brethren dur- 
ing this conference, the result of 
these added volumes of scripture is 
to not do away with the Bible, but 
to supplement and make its precious 
parts more plain and more em- 
phatic. And as the result of this 
splendid organization and the priest- 
hood operating in the offices ap- 
pointed by the Almighty, the fruits 
of "Mormonism" are good indeed. 

We heard yesterday some vital 
statistics, which only took a few 
minutes to read. But do we realize 
the import of some of those import- 
ant vital statistics given by Presi- 
dent Smith in reference to the birth 
rate ? Do you know the significance 
of that little figure as to the birth- 
rate in our Church, of 37 per thou- 
sand. Do you know that in England 
and Wales, when they had reached 
the very high water-mark of high 
birth rate in those lands, in the year 
1876, since which time the rate has 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been steadily declining at a very rap- 
id rate, that then the birth rate stood 
at that time a few points below that 
of the Church for the year 1913, 
the birth rate of England and Wales 
in the year 1876 being 36.3 as 
against 37 as given by President 
Smith as for the Church for last 
year? 

On this same subject, to indicate 
its importance, let me refer to the 
remarks of the Archbishop of York, 
in his presidental address given at 
the church congress, held Oct. 1, 
1912, in which he said: "There is 
a serious and steady decline in the 
birth rate of the people," and, "we 
are confronted by a formidable na- 
tional danger." Likewise, the Bish- 
op of London, in his address of Oct. 
12, 1911, says: "It is proved as 
completely as anything can be that 
the cause for this ( referring to the 
declining birthrate) is a deliberate 
limitation of families," the cause of 
which he puts down to the "miser- 
able doctrine of comfort." He inti- 
mates that the cure is to live the 
simpler, harder life our fathers 
lived when they made Britain what 
it is today." Also Father Bernard 
Vaughan, in a speech given by him 
July 14, 1908, referred to wives re- 
fusing the privilege of motherhood 
for numerous things mentioned by 
him, among them being : wishing to 
avoid being bored with the nursery ; 
because there was no room in their 
flat; because they were not strong 
enough to bear what they did not 
like to bear, etc. When that condi- 
tion arrived, he said, it was time to 
"read the riot act," an expression 
peculiarly English. Also Dr. C. J. 
Trimble, upon the same subject, de- 
clared that the declining birth rate 
as a national catastrophe, and 
called it social suicide. In our 



Church statistics there is this conse- 
quence, if you notice, that while 
there is a high birth rate there is a 
low death rate. And writers upon 
this subject, as for instance, the one 
in the Nineteenth Century maga- 
zine for February last, say that as a 
rule where there is a high birth rate 
there is invariably a high death rate, 
and conversely, with a low birth rate 
as a rule there is a low death rate. 
The justification which some have 
for the low birth rate is to secure a 
low death rate. But here this rule 
does not work in the Church, for 
while we have a high birth rate 
there is a very low death rate. 

Time will not permit to inventory 
all the things that can be credited 
to "Mormonism." You in making 
up your list might include all that 
has been said during the conference 
by the presidency of the Church and 
the council of the Twelve up to this 
good time, and all that shall be said 
peculiar to "Mormonism" during 
the balance of these conference 
meetings, and then the half will not 
be told. There will be much after- 
wards to add to your account of the 
spiritual and temporal blessings 
which "Mormonism" has brought 
unto men, and you may not under- 
take to make any fine distinctions 
in drawing the line between the 
temporal and the spiritual, because 
some of them you shall find in the 
twilight zone, and you can no more 
separate them than you can take any 
point of time and say this is where 
daylight ceases and that where dark- 
ness begins. . 

You can give "Mormonism" 
credit for its people being a frugal, 
industrious people, a God-fearing, a 
faith-promoting, a child-rearing, 
home-building, colonizing people, a 
people of honesty and integrity and

of general worth as citizens of this 
country of ours, — a people who 
stand for temperance. The Church 
stands for settling things in the right 
way, and until a question is settled 
right it is not settled ; and we might 
bear that in mind in connection with 
the courageous and splendid talk of 
Elder Grant yesterday on the tem- 
perance question, and we should 
realize, to begin with, that it will 
take manhood, courage and deter- 
mination to settle the saloon ques- 
tion as it should be settled, and until 
that question is settled right it is 
not settled at all. As the poet 
says : 

"However the battle is ended, 

Though proudly the victor comes, 
With fluttering flags and prancing 
steeds 

And echoing roll of drums, 
Till the truth proclaims the motto — 
In letters of living light, 

No question is ever settled 
Until it is settled right. 

"Thougfi the heel of the strong op- 
pressor, 

May grind the weak in the dust 
And the voices of fame with one ac- 
claim 

May call him great and just, 
Let those who appiaud take warn- 
ing, 

And keep this motto in sight, 
No question is ever settled, 
Until it is settled right. 

"Let those who have failed take cour- 
age, 

Though the enemy seems to have 
won, 

Though his ranks are strong, if he be 
in the wrong, » 

The battle is not yet done; 
For sure as the morning follows 

The darkest hour of the night, 
No question is ever settled, 

Until it is settled right. 

"O man bowed down with labor, 

O woman young yet old, 
O heart oppressed in the toiler's 
breast 

And crushed by the power of gold, 



Keep on with your weary battle 
Against triumphant might, 

No question is ever settled, 
Until it is settled right." 

To conclude the line of thought 
that I started with, in this income 
schedule, of which we have been 
speaking, one may deduct certain 
expenses, taxes, interests, etc., the 
draw-backs, so to speak, in order to 
get your net assets ; so when you 
get your list completed of the bene- 
fits that have come to you from 
''Mormonism,'' charge up or deduct 
will you, for the purpose of ascer- 
taining your net income from "Mor- 
monism" all the possible draw- 
backs. Charge up against it, if you 
please, what you have paid for 
tithing, if you think that a burden 
or loss. If it is not to your pleas- 
ure, a joy and a profit to make these 
payments, then deduct them from 
your schedule. Likewise your mis- 
sionary effort and expenditures in 
that direction. Still you shall find 
there is a large net asset to you 
from the Gospel, if you are living 
up to your privileges, if you are 
incorporating into your lives all 
the good things that you are en- 
titled to take from. "Mormonism," 
making them a part of your lives. 
By the way, our missionary system 
would have to be listed as one of 
the best sustained efforts at altru- 
ism upon a large scale, considering 
the number of people, that the 
world in all its history has ever 
seen. 

May the Lord assist us to appre- 
ciate the good that the Gospel has 
conferred upon us, and will con- 
fer upon us, if we are willing that 
it shall come into our lives and 
bless us with its sublime teachings 
and its life-giving principles and 
precepts, I pray in the name of Je- 
sus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOS. S. GEDDES 

(President of Oneida Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I presume many of you would be 
better acquainted with my father 
than you are with me, a remark I 
am led to make after the introduc- 
tion I have had. My father was 
one of the early pioneers, one who 
labored upon the foundation of this 
beautiful temple. I feel very proud 
of my father and my mother. 
When my father was about 14 
years of age, he listened to the' testi- 
mony of two humble elders in the 
city of Glasgow, Scotland. He be- 
came their fast friend, and a con- 
vert to the doctrine. When he went 
home to acquaint his parents of 
what he had done, the door was 
closed in his face; thus demon- 
strating and proving what the 
Master said, "He that will not 
leave father and mother, houses and 
lands, wives and children for My 
sake is not worthy of Me." I feel 
to praise the Lord every day that 
I live that my father, then a boy, 
had integrity to stand for the 
Church, and to stand by the testi- 
mony that God the eternal Father 
had given unto him. I feel that 
I cannot live long enough in the 
world to repay my father and 
mother for what they have done 
for me, and I feel what little time 
I have to labor here upon the earth 
that I want to devote my life and 
labors and all the Lord has blessed 
me with, and all He may bless me 
with in the future, for the upbuild- 
ing of His kingdom. 

I do not believe in long sermons. 
I believe that actions speak so much 
louder than words that we can 
scarcely hear what we say when 
placed in comparison with what we 
do. I remember one of our re- 



turned elders, Elder Heber Q. Hale, 
who has now been placed as presi- 
dent of one of the newly organized 
stakes, in Boise, Idaho. In giving 
his report he said he had been away 
from home upwards of three years, 
and the greatest sermon he had 
preached while away was one with- 
out words. When he landed in 
Germany, some of the elders 
warned him about what he should 
say and do, especially what he 
should do, because he could not yet 
say much. So, when a cup of tea 
was placed before him, he could not 
tell the good lady he did not drink 
tea; he could not explain the rea- 
son why. The tea was finally re- 
moved, and a cup of coffee placed 
instead thereof. He could not tell 
why he did not drink that. Neith- 
er could he tell why he did not 
drink the beer, when that was 
placed by his plate; but he thus 
preached one of the most powerful 
discourses that he preached while 
upon his mission, and it was one 
without words, for within a few 
days Brother Hale had the privilege 
of leading that good lady and all 
her family into the waters of bap- 
tism. 

I remember while in the South- 
ern States a little incident that hap- 
pened Jn my own experience, if 
you will pardon a reference to it. 
After traveling nearly all day with- 
out food, we of course were hun- 
gry, and we began to try to get 
entertainment for the night. We 
overtook a gentleman, and he of- 
fered entertainment at his home. 
We discovered, however, before 
long, that he was somewhat under 
the influence of liquor. We did not 
mind that so much, because we 
were hungry, and wanted to get a 
night's entertainment. Before we 
reached his home, he warned us 



ELDER JOSEPH S. GEDDES. 



against his good wife, she did not 
like the "Mormons." We did not 
care so much about that, because 
we had been used to that kind of 
treatment. He put us into a little 
room to wait until supper was 
ready. After supper was made 
ready, he came and led us across 
a long piazza, and took us, I think, 
into one of the old plantation man- 
sions that was used in slavery times, 
for the dining room was a very nar- 
row, long hall, with a simple table 
that I think they used years ago 
in the times of slavery. Seated 
away on the other end was his good 
lady and a plate next to hers for 
him. And down at the other end 
were two places for the "Mormon" 
elders. We did not say much, but 
we preached just the same. Finally 
the good lady noticed that we did 
not drink out of the little white cup 
and saucer. Finally she whispered 
to her husband. Said he to us: 
"Don't you gentlemen drink tea?" 
"No, sir." "What will you take; 
will you have a cup of coffee?" 
"No, sir, we do not drink coffee." 
"Will you have a glass of wine or 
beer?" "No, sir, we do not drink 
wine or beer." Then the good lady 
spoke up and said, "John, I wish 
you were more like these men." The 
ice was broken; the sermon had 
been preached. This lady was a 
teacher, teaching hygiene to her 
students, which offered us a splen- 
did opportunity to explain why we 
did not use these things. Arrange- 
ments had been made for the hus- 
band to go and get a neighbor to 
come and stay with her while he 
went to the club. After supper, 
the good lady said, "John, you need 
not go for our neighbor; I am not 
afraid of such men as these." She 
took us into her parlor and enter- 
tained us royally until about 11 



o'clock while the husband was off at 
the club. 

Another incident. A young man 
was working one time out in a rail- 
road camp. You who have been 
there will perhaps appreciate the 
kind of people who are generally 
found there. But before this young 
man was allowed to go, his father 
said: "Son, you may go provided 
you will always remember who you 
are, and what your father and 
mother have done for you." He 
consented and went, and of course 
there were all kinds oif talk, pro- 
fanity, swearing, chewing tobacco, 
drinking, telling vulgar stories and 
such like things. The boss, how- 
ever, noticed one boy who seemed 
to be different to all the others. 
One Sunday, one of the number 
who had been used to speaking, 
mounted a table and began to tell 
all about the "Mormons," and Pres- 
ident Brigham Young. Some of 
them' knew this boy was a "Mor- 
mon" and they began to twit him — ■ 
"Will you stand for that? Why 
don't you defend yourself and your 
people?" Perhaps the boy had 
never preached in his life. They 
brought him up to the front, and 
when the boss saw the boy he said : 
"What! and is he a 'Mormon?' and 
is it his people you have been talk- 
ing about? Get down, sir, off that 
table; you don't need to tell me 
these people are such a people. If 
he is a 'Mormon' would to the Lord 
you were all 'Mormons.' Come 
down, sir !" The boy had defended 
his people as Jesus defended Him- 
self when John the Baptist having 
been cast into prison sent messen- 
gers to inquire if he was really the 
Christ or whether they should look 
for another. The Savior did not 
boast at all, who He was, but He 
merely referred to His life and His

labors, and He said, "This will testi- 
fy to John who I am and what I 
am." 

"Now, I feel, my brethren and 
sisters, that my time is about up. 
I am interested in the work of the 
Lord. My stake is located in 
southern Idaho. The northern 
boundary of Utah is our southern 
line. We are bounded on the south 
by the Benson stake, on the west by 
the Malad, on the north by the Po- 
catello and Bannock, and on the 
east by the Bear Lake stake ; so you 
see Oneida is located on the map 
directly in the center of the earth, 
and all the important stakes are 
close by and paying- tribute to it 
(laughter). 

We are trying to teach our peo- 
ple the ways of the Lord. We are 
taking up a labor with our priest- 
hood. We feel that there is no 
labor that is equally important, or 
more important than the one de- 
volving upon the teachers, whose 
duty it is, according to what the 
Lord says, to be with the Church 
always and to strengthen them, and 
to see that no iniquity abounds, no 
evil speaking, no lying nor back- 
biting, and that everybody attends 
to their duties. What a wonderful 
responsibility ! I used to think the 
Bishop was the biggest man in all 
the Church, but I have about con- 
cluded that he is not half so big a 
man as the elder or the teacher, 
whose duty it is to .see that no in- 
iquity abounds in the Church. There 
is not much left for the Bishop to 
do. 

I, too, was wonderfully impressed 
with the discourse of Brother He- 
ber J. Grant yesterday. I stand 
for prohibition individually. I be- 
lieve that it will extend to the 
county, to the state, and to the na- 
tion, and it should be world-wide. 



I have always maintained that it 
was a reflection upon Latter-day 
Saints that saloons should exist in 
any of our cities or towns. 

May the Lord bless Israel. May 
the Lord bless our fathers and our 
mothers, whose locks are growing 
grey, and though they may have a 
few failings, their integrity, their 
life's labors stand out in such bold 
relief to me that I cannot see their 
failings. The Lord has a wonder- 
ful crown of righteousness for our 
fathers and our mothers, though 
they may have their weaknesses, 
and I feel that in order for us to 
be half as good as our fathers and 
our mothers, we must be twice as 
good as we are. 

May the Lord bless us. May we 
be the salt of the earth. We are 
trying to teach our people that they 
should live such a life that no man 
holding a portion of the priesthood 
could walk down the sidewalk un- 
less he blesses somebody, not in 
what we shall say, but the very in- 
fluence that he bears, everybody 
pointing to him, "There is a man 
of God ; there is a good man." And 
so we can let our light so shine that 
all men may see our good works, 
and God our Eternal Father will 
be glad of it. 

May we all prove true to the 
trust. May we feel that we are liv- 
ing today, and while our fathers 
have fought the good fight, have 
filled their course, and have done a 
marvel and a wonder, yet today 
the responsibility rests upon you 
and me. How are we making good ? 
is the question. I feel there never 
was a time in the history of the 
Church when it needed stronger 
men and stronger women than it 
does today, because of the thousand 
and one temptations coming in so 
many ways that our fathers and 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON.

mothers did not know of. Lucifer 
in the last days is set loose upon the 
Latter-day Saints, and his tempta- 
tions are so nearly like the genuine. 
There is such duplicity that it is 
going to deceive the very elect, if 
it were possible. 

The Lord bless us, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I am truly happy, my brethren 
and sisters, to have the privilege of 
meeting with you, and partaking of 
the sweet influence, the inspiration 
of the Spirit of the Lord, which has 
characterized the various meetings 
and the teachings of this conference. 
To one who has been away in the 
world, striving to gain an audience 
of those who do not know the Lord, 
no sweeter joy can come into his 
life than to look into the faces of his 
brethren and sisters, in such vast 
numbers as we have at this confer- 
ence. These conferences have al- 
ways been well attended, which is 
merely an expression of the integ- 
rity of heart of this people, who have 
made covenants with our Heavenly 
Father. For the true Latter-day 
Saint to come to conference twice 
a year, besides attending to his du- 
ties and services in his ward, and in 
the stake of Zion where he lives, is 
a privilege wherein our souls find a 
sweet expression. 

When I look into your faces, I 
realize that there is a soul to this 
vast meeting, which is of a higher 
order than, perhaps, that of any in- 
dividual in the congregation. We 
all have our faults and failings, but 



not all have the same faults. When 
we consider the virtues of each in- 
dividual here today, I want to say 
that the aggregate will make a char- 
acter and soul to this meeting typi- 
fying, to an extent, the life, soul, 
and character of our Lord and Mas- 
ter. There is virtue in the heart of 
each one who has sought communi- 
cation with his Heavenly Father, by 
the inspiration of God's Holy Spirit. 

We hold a position in the world I 
sometimes think, that is not fully 
realized by us as Latter-day Saints. 
When I looked over the morning 
meeting in the Tabernacle, and look 
over this congregation today, I see 
many brethren holding the priest- 
hood, whose wives and children will 
be partakers of that priesthood with 
them, and it causes my heart to re- 
joice. I wonder, Do we really sense 
the obligation placed upon us, when 
the priesthood was conferred upon 
us, or do we look upon priesthood 
as merely a calling, an honor and 
not one of service ? I do not believe 
that the Lord has given the priest- 
hood for no purpose. There are 
certain requirements in that priest- 
hood which we are called upon to 
magnify. When your sons and hus- 
bands go out and face a wicked 
world, raise up their voices in de- 
claring that the heavens have been 
opened, and the Gospel has been re- 
stored in its infinite purity, I tell 
you, my brethren and sisters, there 
is an inspiration to me that is not 
equaled by anything else that I have 
beheld in my life. You have young 
men in the Eastern States Mission, 
and it seems that the powers of the 
adversary are arrayed against the 
work. There are lecturers talking 
for money and for effect, trying to 
poison the minds of the people 
against this work. 

Our position in this world, my 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brethren and sisters, is not one of 
destruction ; it is the most construc- 
tive work that was ever inaugur- 
ated. God has called upon us, not 
only to go and preach the Gospel, 
that it might be said that we have 
fulfilled a two, three, or five years' 
mission, but that we have labored 
in the service of the Most High to 
bring souls unto God. It has been 
a joy to me to go and herald this 
Gospel to the world, to lift my voice 
in defense of what I know is right, 
what God has revealed unto me. I 
should be untrue to every sacred 
sentiment of my heart were I to say, 
when a call comes to me, that there 
are others much healthier than I. 
who are better prepared with this 
world's goods, better able from an 
educational standpoint to bear wit- 
ness of the divinity of this work. I 
must be true to every true sentiment 
of my heart. 

God has not given us priesthood 
that we may only go to our classes 
and answer "present" once a week. 
There may be some, perhaps, who 
have this idea concerning their call- 
ing in the priesthood. We are that 
"peculiar people, a royal priesthood, 
and holy nation," because we are 
called upon to bear this Gospel unto 
the world. At the time that great 
tragedy was committed by Cain, the 
first capital criminal, the Lord asked 
him, "Where is thy brother?" he 
answered, "Am I my brother's 
keeper." We have sufficient exam- 
ples in holy writ to show that it is 
the duty of every individual child of 
our Heavenly Father, who has re- 
ceived testimony of the truth, to 
bear witness unto his neighbors. It 
is not necessary to go into the world, 
cross the seas, or into some foreign 
country to warn another, nor to 
magnify your priesthood and call- 
ing; but it is equally our duty right 



here at home, here where charity, 
the love of human souls, can be in- 
creased in the hearts of the children 
of men. 

The Lord, in speaking throug-h 
His Prophet Ezekiel, says: 

"Son of man, I have made thee a 
watchman unto the house of Israel; 
therefore hear the word at my mouth, 
and give them warning from me. 
When I say unto the wicked, Thou 
shalt surely die, and thou givest him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn the 
wicked from his wicked way, to save 
his life; the same wicked man shall 
die in his iniquity; but his blood will 
I require at thine hand. Yet if thou 
warn the wicked, and he turn not from 
his wickedness, nor from his wicked 
way, he shall die in his iniquity; but 
thou hast delivered thy soul." 

We have also in modern revela- 
tion, as contained in the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, wherein 
the Lord says that every one who is 
warned must warn his neighbor. 
Does it not appear to you, then, that 
I am my brother's keeper? An in- 
dividual who would forsake that re- 
sponsibility, and partake of the spirit 
that was manifest by Cain on the 
occasion that I have mentioned, I 
tell you that he is not acting accord- 
ing to the spirit of the Gospel, or the 
word of the Lord. We have im- 
posed upon us a great obligation in 
"bearing the vessels of the Lord" 
before the world, even though this 
life may be spent away from friends 
and relatives, the comforts of home, 
and pleasant surroundings. Presi- 
dent Geddes has told us he respected 
his father because he had shown that 
he was willing to leave father and 
mother, houses and lands, wife and 
children, for the Gospel's sake. 
There is something in such a nature 
that is devoutly to be admired. 

When I think upon the release 
which came to my predecessor, Pres- 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 



67 



Ident Ben E. Rich, it fills my heart 
with joy to know that that valiant 
defender of the faith received his 
release from God, our Heavenly 
Father. If it is pleasing unto Him, 
and I have 'found favor in the eyes 
of the Lord, through the sincerity of 
my heart, I hope that my release 
may come as President Rich's came. 
I am interested in this work. My 
heart is in it, my all. I have laid all 
on the altar of sacrifice, to go into 
the world to proclaim this Gospel of 
life and salvation. 

Upon one occasion the question 
was asked the Lord and Master by 
the Pharisees who came unto him 
tauntingly: "Master, is it right to 
pay tribute to Caesar or no?" The 
Master, with diplomacy, yet with 
wisdom and inspiration, said : 
"Bring me a penny." And as He 
took the penny, and held it in His 
hand He said "Whose is this image 
and superscription?" And they said 
unto him, Caesar's. And Jesus an- 
swering said unto them, Render to 
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, 
and to God the things that are 
God's." When I look into your 
countenances, I see the image, the 
superscription of God. We are sim- 
ple coin current that is passing, do- 
ing good that we could not other- 
wise do. We have come forth from 
the mint of the Gods, and passed 
current, and done the good that was 
designed in our coming to this earth, 
then we shall return and be re- 
deemed. I sincerely trust that we 
will look upon the doing of these 
things as a sacred obligation we owe 
to mankind. 

I have much to be thankful for. 
My father, who was a jailer, had 
the privilege of hearing the Gospel 
preached through prison bars, where 
there were three elders incarcerated 
for the testimony of Jesus. Their 



audience was one boy, 19 years of 
age. He went to the head jailer and 
told him that those men were not 
wicked, as they had been accused, 
and the result was that the elders 
were released. Two of them are still 
living, the other has gone to his re- 
ward. 

My brethren and sisters, I know 
that the Gospel is true. I do not 
know how I can find words to ex- 
press the gratitude in my heart for 
being born and raised under the 
covenant, and to my Heavenly 
Father for the testimony which has 
been given me. I hope to always 
remain true to it. Perhaps I could 
make you understand what the Gos- 
pel means to me when I tell you how 
I feel when I look into the aged face 
of my dear old mother, when I com- 
prehend the loving affection that she 
extended to me in my childhood. 
When retiring at night she would 
have me kneel at her side and taught 
me to pray to my Heavenly Father 
to guide and teach me in my boy- 
hood days. When I went upon my 
first mission, she enjoined me in 
these words : "Always keep your 
eye on the First Presidency of the 
Church; where these men lead you 
must follow." That principle has 
been burned deep in my nature, by 
the loving words of that mother. If 
you could understand what my 
father and my mother have done for 
me, you would understand how I 
regard the Gospel. The influence 
and teaching of my father and 
mother have placed me in a position 
to appreciate the blessings of the 
Gospel. I want to say that my 
earthly father has not been more 
kind to me, though he was the em- 
bodiment of affection, than has my 
Heavenly Father, whose merciful 
blessings that have been given unto 
me from time to time, are priceless.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



When I look upon the sacrifice that 
was made by my father in leaving 
his home in the old country, and 
walking across the plains a humble 
Norwegian boy, who could not say 
a word of English, and then realize 
that he has raised a family of 26 
children, I feel that I want to praise 
the Lord all the days of my life for 
such parentage. 

The priesthood which has been 
given unto us is most sacred, and I 
feel that when we understand the 
full import of our calling we will 
be more diligent, and more faithful, 
and the question will never pass our 
lips, "Am I my brother's keeper?" 

I desire to read to you a passage 
of modern scripture : 

''Behold, there are many called, but 
few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? Because their hearts are 
set so much upon the things of this 
world, and aspire to the honors of 
men, that they do not learn this one 
lesson, that the rights of the priest- 
hood are inseparably connected with 
the powers of heaven, and that the 
powers of heaven cannot be controlled 
nor handled only upon the principles 
of righteousness. That they may be 
conferred upon us, it is true; but when 
we undertake to cover our sins, or to 
gratify our pride, our vain ambition, 
or to exercise control, or dominion, or 
compulsion, upon the souls of the 
children of men, in any degree of un 
. righteousness, behold the heavens 
withdraw themselves; the Spirit of 
the Lord is grieved, and when it is 
withdrawn, amen to the priesthood or 
the authority of that man. Behold, 
ere he is aware, he is left unto him- 
self, to kick against the pricks, to per- 
secute the saints and to fight against 
God. We have learned by sad ex- 
perience, that it is the nature and dis- 
position of almost all men, as soon as 
they get a little authoritv. as they 
suppose, they will immediately begin 
to exercise unrighteous dominion. 
Hence many are called, but few are 
chosen. No power or influence can 
or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the priesthood, only by persuasion, bv 



long suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness, and by love unfeigned; by 
kindness, and pure knowledge, which 
shall greatly enlarge the soul without 
hypocrisy, and without guile, reprov- 
ing betimes with sharpness, when 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and 
then showing forth afterwards an in- 
crease of love toward him whom thou 
hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to 
be his enemy; and that he may know 
that thy faithfulness is stronger than 
the cords of death; let thy bowels also 
be full of charity towards all men, and 
to the household of faith, and let vir- 
tue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, 
then shall thy confidence wax strong 
in the presence of God, and the doc- 
trine of the priesthood shall distill 
upon thy soul as the dews from 
heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy 
constant companion, and thy sceptre 
an unchanging sceptre of righteous- 
ness and truth, and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and with- 
out compulsory means it shall flow 
unto thee for ever and ever." 

O what a magnificent key to those 
who hold the authority of the holy 
priesthood ! How many of the in- 
habitants of Zion have the patience 
and love that they should have to- 
ward those who may have sinned, 
some young man or young woman 
who may have gone into by and for- 
bidden paths. Have we oppressed, 
or has unrighteous dominion been 
exercised in such cases? Or has 
there been mercy and love extended 
to such to keep them within the 
bonds of the covenant? I tell you, 
my brethren and sisters, there is 
much required of us who have made 
covenants with our Heavenly 
Father. 

May God's blessings rest upon us 
all, that when we shall look back 
upon our lives we may feel a sense 
of satisfaction, having appreciated 
the truths that have been revealed 
from heaven. When we shall be 
brought to stand before the great 
Judge, to account for the deeds done

in the body, may it be said of us, 
"Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant ; thou hast been faithful over 
a few things, I will make thee ruler 
over many." May this be our happy 
lot, and that we may enter into the 
glory of the celestial abode, I ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER LUCIUS N. MAUSDEN. 

(President of Parowan Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is truly 
a pleasure for me to speak to you a 
few moments upon this occasion. I 
trust that the few moments I occupy 
that I may be inspired by that same 
spirit which has been with our breth- 
ren during our conference, arid dur- 
ing this meeting. I appreciate very 
much that our stake has been rec- 
ognized during this conference ; not 
that I wish to appear before you, 
but Parowan Stake is one of the 
older stakes of Zion. While it is 
one of the old stakes, I am only new 
in the work. I am pleased to report 
to you that we have a lot of good 
brethren and sisters in the Parowan 
stake of Zion, and it is a pleasure to 
work among them. 

I am pleased to meet with you in 
our general conferences, from time 
to time, and partake of the spirit 
which prevails at these gatherings. 
I might mention one thing, about 
the only thought that I wish to 
speak about, and that is a thing that 
prevails to some extent in our stake. 
It is that, in traveling through the 
stake and getting acquainted with 
the people, I notice we are not 
studying the Bible, the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and the Pearl of Great Price, 



as much as we should do. You 
know we have been told the glory of 
God is intelligence. I believe that 
through the study of these books we 
will gain much intelligence. I be- 
lieve that it is a great mistake for 
families in our community to re- 
frain from studying these books. We 
are now advocating the study of 
these church works in our stake, and 
I trust that our talk will not be in 
vain. I noticed Elder George Albert 
Smith's remarks in yesterday's meet- 
ing, that he mentioned this same 
thing, and I take it, my brethren and 
sister, that we are not the only 
stake making this regretable mis- 
take. 

Progression and advancement in 
a financial way are all right, but we 
have too many brethren and sisters 
in our stake that pay little or no at- 
tention to becoming familiar with 
the principles of the Gospel. Many 
go to their labors from day to day 
and think but little about studying 
the principles of life and salvation, 
and I think that should be regarded 
as most important. It has been said, 
"What doth it profit a man if he 
gains the whole world and loses his 
own soul?" This is in my opiniori, 
my brethren and sisters, a most im- 
portant question. I trust that it will 
be the effort of every stake presi- 
dency and of every bishop in the 
Church, where these conditions pre- 
vail, to try and better the conditions 
in this regard. 

My testimony is that the Gospel is 
true ; that the Savior came upon this 
earth and sacrificed His life, and 
made salvation possible to all. I 
sometimes think that we hardly ap- 
preciate that great fact. 

Let us investigate the principles 
of the Gospel. Study the Bible, the 
Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and the Pearl of Great

Price. I do not know of any better 
way to get the spirit of our office 
and calling than to study up these 
principles, and try to live in accord- 
ance therewith. May God bless us 
in all our efforts, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

David Starr Jordan's writings con- 
firming value of the Word of Wis- 
dom — Card playing denounced. 

I might incidentally remark that 
our clocks are both five minutes too 
fast. I thought I would give you 
this information to save your time 
and prevent you looking at them 
so often, as it is my intention to 
speak until four by our clocks, 
which will leave five minutes for 
prayer and singing. 

Some of the remarks made today 
have called to my mind a subject 
upon which I had no intention of 
speaking. I hold in my hand a little 
book written by David Starr Jordan, 
"The Strength of Being Clean." 
The retail price, I believe, is thirty- 
five cents, but if you purchase the 
book, one hundred copies at a time 
you can get it for twenty-five cents. 
I have given away at least a couple 
of hundred copies. 

There are many people who, if the 
servants of the Lord preach to them 
year after year, what is said has no 
particular effect upon them. But 
these same people, if they receive 
advice of some man of worldly wis- 
dom, immediately follow it. I re- 
member going to Sanpete county 
and preaching a sermon upon the 
Word of Wisdom. Subsequently I 
learned that a good sister who heard 
my sermon was taken sick and wired 
for a doctor to come from Salt Lake 
City, by special engine, and it cost 



her several hundred dollars to learn 
from this doctor that she was drink- 
ing too much tea, and unless she 
quit, would be sure to die. She ac- 
cepted his advice and got well. Had 
she listened to my advice which 
would have cost her nothing, she 
would have saved several hundred 
dollars, to say nothing about being 
in perfect harmony with the teach- 
ings of the Lord, as revealed in the 
Word of Wisdom. We sing more 
than we do any other hymn, ''We 
thank thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
to guide us in these latter days." I 
recommend that some of the Saints 
add, "provided he doesn't guide us- 
to keep the word of wisdom." 

I have been much pleased with the 
book, "The Strength of Being 
Clean." I understand that President 
Joseph F. Smith says it is one of the 
strongest ever written by a non- 
member of the Church in vindication 
of the Word of Wisdom. Mr. Jor- 
dan was for years the President of 
the Leland-Stanford, Jr., University 
of California. The Latter-day 
Saints should be grateful to this 
great educator, one of the greatest 
in our country, for writing a book 
which confirms the teachings of 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet; an 
"ignoramus" in the estimation of 
many people. 

Mr. Jordan says : 

"It is vulgar to like poor music, to 
read weak books, to feed on sensa- 
tional newspapers, to trust to patent 
medicines, to find amusement in trashy 
novels, to enjoy vulgar theaters, to- 
find pleasure in cheap jokes, to tol- 
erate coarseness and looseness in any 
of its myriad forms.* * * 

It is the hope of civilization that 
our republic may outgrow the tolera- 
tion of vulgarity, but that is still a 
long way in the future.* * * 

"A form of vulgarity is profanity. 
This is the sign of a dull, coarse, un- 
refined nature. * * *

or vigor or exhilaration, when the 
real warmth or vigor or exhilaration 
does not exist. Tobacco gives a feel- 
ing of rest which is not restfulness. 
The use of opium seems to intensify 
the imagination, giving its clumsy 
wings a wonderous • power of flight. 
It destroys the sense of time and 
space, but it is in time and space alone 
that man has his being. Cocaine 
gives a strength which is not strength. 
Strychnine quickens the motor re- 
sponse which follows sensation. Cof- 
fee and tea, like alcohol, enable one 
to borrow from his future store of 
force for present purposes, and none 
of these make any provision for pay- 
ing back the loan. 

''People who borrow and do not pay 
back, are classed among the dishonest. 
The Lord has loaned us our bodies, 
and it is our duty to return them to 
Him when the battle of life is ended, 
without their having been polluted by 
our breaking His commandments. 

"One and all these various drugs 
tend to give the impression of a pow- 
er or a pleasure, or an activity, which 
we do not possess. One and all their 
function is to force the nervous sys- 
tem to lie. One and all the result of 
their habitual use is to render the 
nervous system incapable of ever tell- 
ing the truth. One and all their sup- 
posed pleasures are followed by a re- 
action of subiective pains as spurious 
and as unreal as the pleasures which 
thev follow. Each or tliem, if used to 
excess, brings in time insanity, inca- 
pacity, and death. With each of them, 
the first use makes the second easier. 
To yield to temptation makes it easier 
to yield again. The weakening effect 
on the will is greater than the iniury 
to the body. In fact, the harm alco- 
holic and similar excesses do to the 
body is wholly secondary. It is the 
visible reflex of the harm alreadv done 
to the nervous system." 

I heard that a non-"Mormon" 
banker in Salt Lake said he would 
be willing to employ a gentile boy 
who' drank or smoked, but he would 
not think of employing a "Mormon" 
boy who did these things, because he 
had been taught better all his life 
and would, therefore, be violating 



the teachings of his parents, and his 
Church, as well as his own con- 
science. A young man who did this, 
he did not wish in his bank. "Obe- 
dience is better than sacrifice, and to 
hearken than the fat of rams." If 
we could implaint this teaching in 
the hearts of our children it would 
be a magnificent lesson. 

We, as a people have been told 
not to play cards. Ever since I 
can remember, the Presidency of the 
Church and others have been writ- 
ing and talking against card play- 
ing. Many fathers and mothers say, 
"Oh, there is no harm in cards," and 
they let their children play. Re- 
cently a daughter of mine, and her 
cousin went to a social gathering at 
a Latter-day Saint home, and they' 
were the only ones who did not 
play cards. Upon another occa- 
sion, this same daughter was again 
in a Latter-day Saint home, and in 
the room where she was, when re- 
freshments were served, she was 
the only one who did not drink tea 
or coffee. Again I say, "Obedience 
is better than sacrifice." It is a 
serious thing for parents to set ex- 
amples before their children con- 
trary to the commandments of the 
Lord and instructions of His ser- 
vants, no matter how insignificant 
they may think these command- 
ments are. While card playing may 
be considered harmless, yet it is a 
very serious matter to the young 
man or young woman who indulges 
this habit in disobedience to the in- 
structions of parents or the servants 
of the Lord. It is well for parents 
to teach their children obedience,, 
both by precept and example. 

Quoting again from Mr. Jordan : 

"It is not for you to seek pleasure 
and strength in drugs, whose only 
function is to deceive you, whose gifts

"A man ought to be stronger than any- 
thing that can happen to him. He is 
the strong man who can say no. He 
is the wise man who, for all his life, 
can keep mind and soul and body 
clean. 

" 'I know of no more encouraging 
fact,' — says Thoreau, 'than the abil- 
ity of a man to elevate his life by 
conscious endeavor. It is something 
to paint a particular picture, or to 
carve a statue, and so make a few ob- 
jects beautiful. It is far more glor- 
ious to carve and paint the very at- 
mosphere and medium through which ■ 
we look. This morally we can do.' " 

"So far as the drink of the drunkards 
is concerned, prohibition does not pro- 
hibit. But to clean up a town, to free 
from corrosion, saves men, and boys 
and girls, too, from vice, and who 
shall say that moral sanitation is not 
as much the duty of the community as 
physical sanitation? 

"The city of the future will not per- 
mit the existence of slums and dives 
and tippling-houses. It will prohibit 
their existence for the same reason 
that it now prohibits pig-pens and 
dung-heaps and cesspools. For where 
all these things are, slums and cess- 
pools, saloons and pig-pens, there the 
people grow weak and die." 

Lo and behold! I have got 
through, and it is not yet four 
o'clock. The Lord bless you. Amen. 

Walter Stevens and the choir 
sang, "See now the altar." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder John M. Young. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 2 
p. m. Elder Benjamin Goddard 
presided. 

The Thirty-first ward choir ren- 
dered the musical selections ; H. E. 
Dewsnup, conductor. 



The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Come, come ye Saints." 

Elder James T. Simpkins offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir and congregation sang" 
the hymn, "Oh ! ye mountains high." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(President of Bureau of Information.) 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
think any of us anticipated this 
morning that the weather would 
permit of an open-air meeting. The 
Lord, however, has been very good 
to us, especially in view of the fact 
that it is impossible to accomo- 
date you in the Tabernacle or in the 
Assembly Hall, and other available 
halls are too far distant. 

We are very glad that you are 
willing to come here, and to stand 
and enjoy the service that has been 
appointed for your benefit by Presi- 
dent Smith. Our brethren who 
have been called to address you, 
come before you in all humility and 
meekness, relying upon your faith 
and sustaining influence, and pray- 
ers that the Lord will bless us in our 
gathering together. 

I suggest to you one thought, in 
connection with our meeting here, 
and the other assemblies that are be- 
ing held on this block. The work 
of the Lord in the latter days had a 
very small beginning. The Church 
was organized in 1830, with six 
members. The growth has been 
steady and sure since then. The 
work spread from city to city, from 
state to state, until subsequently the 
Gospel was carried to distant lands, 
and now, in fulfillment of prophecy, 
our elders are going forth, carrying 
the message unto all nations, in ac- 
cordance with the Master's injunc- 
tion that "this Gospel of the King- 
dom shall be preached as a witness 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



73 



unto all nations, and then shall the 
end come." The growth of our work 
in other lands has also been slow, 
but just as sure, and our member- 
ship has increased year by year, un- 
til today we are assured that the 
Church is permanently established 
in the earth. 

God has indeed fulfilled His word. 
I desire to read one passage from 
Daniel 2nd chap., with reference 
to the work of the Lord in the lat- 
ter day, "And in the days of these 
kings, shall the God of heaven set 
up a kingdom, which shall never be 
destroyed : and the kingdom shall 
not be left to other people." Hav- 
ing this in mind, permit me to im- 
press upon you the permanency of 
this work. I had the honor last 
evening of attending a mission re- 
union. When that particular mis- 
sion was first opened, one elder la- 
bored alone in that land for several 
years, proclaiming the Gospel, bear- 
ing his testimony, but finding none 
to accept the truth. Afterwards, 
two elders labored there, but years 
passed before the truth entered per- 
manently into the hearts of the peo- 
ple. At the present time, on that 
little island of the sea, we have a 
membership of five thousand people. 
Elders have continued laboring 
there, year after year, and last even- 
ing in the gathering referred to, 
when elders who had labored in that 
land amongst the natives were asked 
to join in song, they met on the 
stand, fifty strong, young men and 
old men, filled with faith, earnest 
in the work, having a testimony of 
the truth, and as they stood there, 
singing the songs of Zion, the re- 
mark was made, "If, in the Provi- 
dence of the Almighty, it were nec- 
essary for every elder now in that 
missionary field to be removed, here 
is a force of men strong enough to 



man the mission, who would readily 
respond to the call, and, in an ex- 
igency, would take hold of the work 
in that far distant land." 

This is but an illustration of all 
other missions that have been estab- 
lished under the inspiration of the 
Almighty. I, therefore, rejoice with 
you in these evidences of the per- 
manency of this work. God has es- 
tablished it and will sustain it. It 
"shall never be destroyed, nor be 
given to another people." We are 
engaged in this work, it belongs to 
the Saints, and the Lord has raised 
up prophets to direct it and has 
given unto them the inspiration of 
His Spirit. In this audience, are 
men of almost every nationality, wo- 
men almost from every country, 
who are here by virtue of the work 
that has been done in their respec- 
tive lands by elders of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I pray that God will bless us in 
this gathering. I ask you to join in 
praying that the Lord will bless 
these speakers, and sustain them, 
for they have not come of their own 
will, but because a servant of God 
has said, "the people on the outside 
cannot be taught this afternoon, un- 
less you go out to them, the build- 
ings being 'crowded to their ut- 
most capacity." They are here in 
response to that call, and I bespeak 
for them your kind attention and 
your prayerful assistance. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Historian.) 

My brethren and sisters and 
friends, outdoor preaching, is not 
my forte, but I will do the best I 
can. I have a reputation of being a 
rapid speaker, but rapidity is scarce- 
ly what is needed on this occa- 
sion. What I desire just now is the

Spirit of God to assist me, and a 
frill volume of voice, in order that I 
may make those hear who stand 
far in the rear. I also trust that 
the elements will favor us, and that 
the rain will not pour down upon 
us from the clouds hanging at this 
moment so threatening overhead. 

I was deeply impressed when we 
sang our opening hymn, "Come, 
come, ye Saints," as it reminded me 
of an event that took place 48 years 
ago. I crossed the plains and moun- 
tains in 1866 with an ox train, 
which brought me together with a 
number of other emigrants from the 
Missouri river to the Valley of the 
Great Salt Lake. I feel thankful 
to the Lord now that I came to 
Utah in 1866. Had my coming 
been delayed till the following year, 
I would not have had the experi- 
ence of traveling all the way across 
the plains with ox teams, for in 
1867 the Union Pacific Railroad 
had been built for a distance of 300 
miles westward from the Missouri 
river. The next year (1868) that 
road had been built two-thirds of 
the way across the plains and moun- 
tains, and overland travel with ox 
teams was abandoned altogether in 
1869. Since, then, immigrants have 
come to the Valley of the Great Salt 
Lake in railway trains. 

But this song, "Come, come ye 
Saints," as well as the other one we 
sang today, "O, ye mountains 
high," we sang again and again on 
the plains in 1866 as we trudged 
along on our weary way toward 
this city, living part of the time on 
half rations. We longed for Zion, 
and we sang these songs of Zion 
with great earnestness and feeling. 
I do not think the late William 
Clayton, who composed the song, 
"Come, come ye Saint," could have 
had more of the spirit of it than we 



had, who sang it nineteen years la- 
ter. 

I have often reflected upon what 
God has done for this people — the 
Latter-day Saints — not only in the 
growth of the community, as was 
referred to by Brother Goddard in 
his opening speech, but upon the 
experiences they have had in the 
countries or places in which they 
have dwelt since the Church was 
first organized. I have often ex- 
plained: "How marvelous are the 
works of the Almighty!" 

The Lord in the beginning want- 
ed His people to become closely as- 
sociated together as a community 
or a religious body. The Church 
was only a few months old when a 
commandment was given through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith for the 
Saints to gather together, and the 
Lord gave a promise by revelation 
that He would give them a land 
which they could call their own, a 
land of inheritance. This was noth- 
ing new. The Children of Israel 
many centuries ago, were likewise 
given such a land, a land of prom- 
ise. We even are told in the Holy 
Scripture that Abraham, when liv- 
ing childless in Chaldea, was com- 
manded to leave his native country 
and journey to a strange land, 
which the Lord would give him and 
his posterity. Abraham had no son 
at that time; his son, Isaac, the 
child of promise, being born after- 
wards. 

I refer to this for the purpose of 
showing you that the gathering to- 
gether of the people of God is an 
old doctrine. We also have the 
City of Enoch as an example. But 
in the dispensation in which we live 
we find this recorded that the Lord, 
in 1831, pointed out Jackson Coun- 
ty, Missouri, as a gathering place 
for His Saints. Western Missouri

was at that time almost uninhabited, 
but it was -a beautiful country, 
abounding with meadows and 
woodland, and fertile as any lands 
in the great West, and when Sid- 
ney Rigdon was commanded by 
revelation to make a description of 
it, he utterly failed. The land was 
so beautiful that the pen picture he 
attempted to draw of it did not be- 
gin to do justice to it. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints settled in that coun- 
try, and everything looked promis- 
ing with them for two or three 
years. About 1500 members of the 
Church gathered into Jackson Coun- 
ty during the years 1831, 4832 and 
1833, and began to cultivate the 
soil; they also established a print- 
ing office, opened a store, built 
mills, and made other improve- 
ments, and conditions seemed to in- 
dicate that they would flourish and 
prosper. But in the midst of their 
prosperity the Lord predicted for 
them through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith "much tribulation," and 
when this prophecy commenced to 
be fulfilled, the Saints began to 
move into less desirable and poorer 
counties. 

I pass over the short sojourn of 
our people in Clay County, on the 
opposite side of the Missouri river, 
into which they were driven in 1833 
by the Jackson County mob. The 
Saints had not lived there very long 
when prospects for trouble were 
again in plain sight. The Missour- 
ians told the Saints substantially 
this : "You cannot live here. We 
do not want you to stay in Clay 
County." "But," said they, point- 
ing to a country lying about 60 
miles in a northeasterly direction, 
"yonder is a prairie country. If 
you are willing to go out there and 
settle by yourselves, you are wel- 
come ; there we will not molest 



you." To accept of this offer was 
apparently the best the Saints could 
do under the circumstances. The 
country suggested was a naked 
prairie, and the Missourians did not 
think at that time that the prairies 
of Missouri could produce much. 
Nevertheless, the Saints went in 
and settled what soon became Cald- 
well County. And what happened? 
Of course these things are recorded 
in Church history, and are not al- 
together new to you ; suffice it to 
say, that in two or three years the 
Saints numbered as many thou- 
sands in Caldwell County, and the 
adjoining county of Daviess, as 
they had numbered hundreds in 
Jackson County ; and lo and be- 
hold, the prairies of Caldwell Coun- 
ty seemed to become even more pro- 
ductive than the rich, fertile lands 
in Jackson County, or Clay Coun- 
ty. This was one of the Saints' 
early experiences; ,in trusting the 
Lord. They learned this lesson, 
that when God chooses to pour down 
the blessings of heaven upon His 
people, He can do so anywhere, no 
matter where they live — in a timber 
country, a prairie country, or a 
desert. 

You know what happened after 
the Saints began to prosper in Cald- 
well County. When the Missour- 
ians saw how our people prog- 
ressed, how they had built up the 
beautiful little city of Far West, 
and even commenced the erection 
of a Temple there, Gov. Boggs took 
sides with the mob against the 
"Mormons," which resulted in their 
expulsion from Missouri in 1838 
and 1839. 

What happened next? The Lat- 
ter-day Saints, now numbering 
nearly 15,000 people in Missouri 
alone, had to seek a new home. But 
where could they go? They had 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



scarcely anything but their bare 
hands to depend upon. Many of 
them were indeed glad to escape 
' from Missouri with nothing but the 
clothes they wore on their backs, 
and many of them had to trudge on 
foot for 200 miles, some nearly 300 
miles, before they could reach the 
border of the State and cross over 
the Mississippi river into Illinois. 
The people of the town of Quincy 
were kind to our people. Their 
hearts were touched because of the 
sufferings the exiles had endured. 
They called meetings and contrib- 
uted clothing and food for the suf- 
ferers. But the Saints did not want 
to live on charity, or remain in this 
helpless condition. The authorities 
of the Church, the spiritual and 
temporal leaders of the people, 
therefore, cast their eyes around to 
find a country where they could lo- 
cate a new Stake of Zion. About 
fifty miles above Quincy there was 
a little, struggling village called 
Commerce. Several attempts had 
been made to settle the place, but 
they had failed, though the people 
who tried it came from the East 
well supplied with everything nec- 
essary to establish a colony; they 
had plenty of teams, agricultural 
implements, and everything that 
was necessary for founding a set- 
tlement. But instead of building 
up the contemplated city of Com- 
merce on the banks of the river, 
they built up a grave yard, in fact, 
an extensive cemetery, on the side 
hill. The place was so unhealthful, 
that malarial diseases broke out, 
and laid the people low ; hence they 
had become discouraged and want- 
ed to move away. And when the 
Latter-day Saints sent a committee 
to look at the country, these older 
settlers were perfectly willing to 
sell out for a song; their great de- 



sire was to get away from the un- 
healthful place. 

What could the Saints naturally 
expect in Commerce? If healthy, 
well-to-do people could not make 
a success there, what would become 
of the poor exiles who came from 
Missouri bleeding and poverty- 
stricken? But the Saints relied 
upon God Almighty; the same God 
who had sustained them in Cald- 
well, and changed that country 
from a naked prairie to well culti- 
vated fields, still ruled and con- 
trolled the elements ; our brethren 
had confidence in Him and knew 
that He could remove the curse 
from Commerce and make it habit- 
able for His Saints, if He chose to 
do so. I shall not enter into de- 
tails, but simply remind you of the 
fact that where these people from 
the East, well provided with every- 
thing needed, could not build a vil- 
lage, the Saints in six years built 
up a beautiful city which, at one 
time, had nearly 20,000 inhabitants. 
.In the midst of that city they built 
a beautiful Temple and erected 
many other good and substantial 
buildings. Those who visit Nauvoo 
today will find that the best build- 
ings there now are those erected 
by the Latter-day Saints seventy 
years ago. 

I refer to these things, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to show what won- 
ders God has wrought. Although 
He allows the sun to shine upon 
the wicked and good alike, and per- 
mits the rain to fall all over the 
earth, there is a difference, a signal 
difference, between a people who 
disobey God's will, and a peoDle 
who will serve Him and keep His 
commandments. He can lead them 
into any country, poor or fertile, and 
bless that country for their sake, 
and make it fit for their habitation. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

Continuing my story, let me di- 
rect your attention to more recent 
events. The Saints lived in Nau- 
voo six or seven years. While 
there, the mob killed our Prophet 
and Patriarch ; and when the wick- 
ed saw that the death of these men 
had not destroyed the work of God, 
they became more furious than 
ever, and did not rest until they had 
driven about 20,000 Saints into the 
wilderness, far beyond the borders 
of civilization The people of Illi- 
nois witnessed the exiled Saints 
disappear on the prairies of Iowa, 
going toward the land of the set- 
ting sun. 

Those were perilous times, my 
brethren and sisters. The exodus 
of the Latter-day Saints from Nau- 
voo, and their experiences in the 
wilderness for a number of years 
before they arrived in this Valley, 
forms one of the most interesting 
chapters in the history of the world. 
With tears in their eyes the Saints, 
as they went westward, frequently 
looked back toward their beautiful 
Nauvoo. Some of them wept like 
the Children of Israel, when Nebu- 
chednezzar took them captives into 
Babylon. The Latter-day Saints 
were not captives, but they had 
been despoiled of their homes, like 
the Israelites were in the days of 
their captivity. 

What happened next? The Lat- 
ter-day Saints came into the wilder- 
ness, into the Great American Des- 
ert. It was not even the prairies 
of Caldwell now. It was not even 
an unhealthful Commerce. The 
soil in their eastern homes was com- 
paratively fertile, but in this Great 
American Desert, to which they 
now had come, everything was ab- 
solutely barren and forbidding. Be- 
fore the pioneers of 1847 arrived 
here, a few mountaineers, acquaint- 



ed with the valleys of the Great Salt 
Lake, told President Brigham 
Young that it was folly for him 
to think for one moment of locat- 
ing white people in this valley, 
where a few straggling bands of 
Indians of the lowest grade could 
not get a living from the soil. Were 
it not for the fish' found in the Utah 
Lake, the Timpanogas river, and 
other mountain streams, and what 
game they could find in the moun- 
tains, these natives would perish 
through starvation. And of course 
white people could not subsist on 
that kind of fare. The mountain- 
eers were united in saying that noth- 
ing that would sustain life could 
grow in the Valley of the Great 
Salt Lake. One of the trappers 
who heard that President Brigham 
Young was coming to this desert 
country with a colony of whites, 
promptly informed him that it did 
not rain in the regions of the Great 
Salt Lake between April and Oc- 
tober, and consequently breadstuffs 
could not be raised. 

But the pioneers of 1847, relying 
upon the Lord, sang with cheerful 
hearts, "Come, come ye Saints, no 
toil nor labor fear, But with joy 
wend your way." * * * We'll 
find the place which God for us pre- 
pared, far away in the West." 

The first thing the pioneers did 
after their arrival on this ground 
upon which we now stand, was to 
raise their hands toward heaven and 
dedicate the land for the gathering 
of the Saints. They, no doubt, re- 
membered when praying, how they 
had been driven from their homes 
in Jackson County ; how they had 
been robbed of their possessions in 
Clay, Caldwell and Daviess coun- 
ties, Missouri, and how they had 
been driven from their homes in 
Hancock County, Illinois, into the 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wilderness, into the desert ; and now 
they importuned at the throne of 
grace for special blessings upon 
the desert lands. 

From the little beginning by the 
"'Mormon" pioneers in 1847, we 
have now these valleys filled with 
Latter-day Saints. I have traveled 
in many parts of the world and 
seen many countries, but I will say 
this to you, that this valley is one 
of the prettiest spots on earth. A 
greater transfiguration than that 
which has taken place in this valley 
since the pioneer days can scarcely 
be imagined; in fact, I think it has 
no equal in any part of the world . I 
know of«no other place where you 
'can ascend to a certain height, as 
you can here, as for instance to the 
top of Ensign Peak, or perhaps to 
the top of the Capitol building now 
being erected, and behold such a 
beautiful city, with such lovely sur- 
roundings as here. Behold the val- 
ley as it lies stretched out before 
you surrounded with grand and 
picturesque mountains and with the 
Great Salt Lake on the west ; and I 
defy any one who has traveled to 
mention a landscape more beautiful 
and delightful, or a valley more fer- 
tile than the one we have here, 
which until recently was a part of 
the Great American desert. 

What has the Lord wrought? A 
miracle ! It is not altogether the 
water. It is true we have learned 
the art of irrigation here, something 
that our people did not need on 
the prairies of Caldwell or in Illi- 
nois. But we believe that our 
Father in heaven had compassion, 
upon His persecuted 'people. In 
connection with the work of the 
pioneers in their home-making, irri- 
gating, planting and building, God 
was kind to them and commanded 
the earth by His power to yield 



forth in abundance to sustain the 
lives of His persecuted people. 
From the little handful that came 
here in 1847, we have grown to 
nearly half a million, in Utah, Idaho 
and the surrounding country. The 
724 wards or settlements, which are 
now (inhabited by (the Latter-day 
Saints, represent in part the result 
of the little beginning made by those 
persecuted people who were not per- 
mitted to possess their homes in the 
States of Illinois or Missouri. 

We who came here later, and 
those who have been born here, dis- 
cover, as we open our eyes to take 
in the situation, that we are located 
in one of the most desirable lands 
upon the face of the earth, and our 
hearts are filled with thanksgiving 
to God and to our parents, who 
"builded better than they knew." I 
was a little white-haired boy when 
I first came to this valley with my 
parents, they having embraced the 
Gospel in a foreign land and 
brought their family here. And 
what does this mean to me. Hap- 
piness, prosperity and possibilities. 
I have also been the means of bring- 
ing into the world a family of chil- 
dren, sons and daughters, who when 
they opened their eyes in the world, 
here, found themselves with their 
parents in a goodly land, in a land 
of Prophets and Apostles, in the 
midst of a God-fearing people, and 
in a land that is blessed above all 
other lands upon the face of the 
earth. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
shall simply refer to one point more 
in proof of what I am saying, and 
then I am through. I visited Pal- 
estine a few years ago, and you 
know Palestine is the country 
known at one time as a land flow- 
ing with milk and honey, figura- 
tively speaking. I traveled through 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

that country from the heights of 
Galilee down to the lower regions 
around the Dead Sea; I visited most 
of the little valleys of Jndea and 
Samaria, and I know pretty well the 
location of the most interesting 
points in that country. But Pales- 
tine is not a country today about 
which you can say it flows with milk 
and honey. What has happened? 
What has caused the change when 
that land is no longer a blessed 
country ; it cannot today sustain half 
the inhabitants who dwell there. It 
is not only a question of 'a seven 
years famine : it would be famine 
continuously, if the inhabitants 
could not get bread from Poland, 
Russia, or some other country where 
corn and food is more plentiful than 
in Palestine. The land is defiled, 
because of the inhabitants thereof, 
because "they have transgressed the 
law, changed the ordinance and 
broken the everlasting covenant." 
Palestine apparently is under a 
curse, but that curse will be taken 
away when the sons and daughters 
of Zion, or the Children of Israel, 
on their return from their long dis- 
persion, shall sing praises to their 
God, and serve the God of Abra- 
ham, Isaac and Jacob, like in the 
days of old. 

And the same can be said about 
the waste places of Zion in our own 
day. The beautiful Nauvoo, that 
was once the largest city in the State 
of Illinois, larger than Chicago or 
Springfield, the State capital, at the 
time the Saints lived in Illinois, is 
today a little, neglected village. 
What has happened? Icarians, fru- 
gal German colonists and others 
who have tried to build up a city 
there have failed in their attempts. 
Nauvoo has gone down completely 
and like the curse that has rested 
on the land of Canaan for centuries, 



so it seems as though a curse rests 
upon Nauvoo and its surroundings 
today. The Lord has not forgotten 
that once there lived in that place a 
God-fearing people, who were 
driven away by mobs. Men who 
did not fear God took away from 
the Saints of the Most High their 
inheritances, and the curse is upon 
the land to this day, the same as the 
land of Palestine. At least, that is 
the impression I had when I visited 
Nauvoo a number of years ago, and 
something similar could be said of 
the change that has come to those 
parts of Missouri where the Saints 
once dwelt. 

In conclusion I thank God for our 
mountain home. I appreciate God's 
blessings upon us here, not only as 
manifested in the numerical growth 
of the Church, but in the blessings 
that have come to the soil upon 
which we dwell, upon the land which 
has been dedicated as a land of Zion 
and a home for the Saints. God 
grant that these beautiful valleys 
may always continue a land of Zion 
to the Latter-day Saints, 1 ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Edna Evans sang, "Kind words 
are sweet tones of the heart." 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
pleased to have the privilege of ad- 
dressing you for a short time, upon 
the principles of the Gospel which 
are near and dear to the hearts of 
all Latter-day Saints. I am not 
afraid that I cannot occupy the 
time, but I do tremble when I ap- 
pear before an audience for fear I 
might not be an instrument in the 
hands of God in conveying to them 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the bread of life. So, I pray that 
the Spirit of our Father shall be 
with us here to-day, and shall be 
with what I shall be led to say to 
you, that your time may not be 
spent in vain, and that I will not 
be abjudged guilty of wasting your 
time. 

There has been reference made to 
the great "Go-to-Church Move- 
ment," that is to be inaugurated in 
this city on the 26th of April, if I 
am informed correctly. That move- 
ment, like many other great things, 
was started in Chicago. The first 
"Go-to-Church" day was February 
the first, this year. It was estimated 
that over a million people who were 
not churchgoing people found them- 
selves inside of some church build- 
ing on that clay. We were invited 
with the rest of the churches, by 
circular letter, to join in the move- 
ment to induce people to go to 
church. We were likewise asked 
to pay for some advertising in the 
paper, since the big papers of that 
city were giving much space to 
move the people to attend services 
on that day. We forwarded our 
check, together with the ad. that we 
desired run in behalf of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
One month after the movement was 
over we received a communication 
from the chairman of the committee 
reading : 

"Dear Sir : In closing up the matter 
pertaining to the "Go-to-Church Sun- 
day" campaign, I find among the papers 
your check, which is enclosed herewith. 
The advertisement which you ordered 
was not run because the committee voted 
that it should be excluded on the 
grounds that your organization was 
reither Catholic, Protestant nor Jew- 
ish." 

This committee was made up of 
representative ministers of eighteen 



different churches including Jews, 
Catholics and Protestants. 

If the Latter-day Saints in this 
city, of this State are treated in a 
like manner, you will not be per- 
mitted to participate in the great 
movement which has received such 
hearty support in this conference. 
Some may say we are Protestants in 
every sense of the word, protesting 
against all churches in all the earth. 
But, I prefer to state it in another 
way. Instead of protesting against 
Catholic ami Protestant denom- 
inations, or against the Jews, we 
carry a message of peace, and a 
proclamation to the world that God 
our Father has again revealed Him- 
self, and the true character of His 
Son, to the children of men. We 
have been commissioned to proclaim 
that revelation to all the world, not 
as a protest against the doctrines 
they are teaching, but in love and 
peace, even the love that Christ felt 
for the people who really believed 
in Him and His true character, 
when He walked with His disciples. 
We have been authorized to pro- 
claim the wonderful work that God 
has established in the earth. I thank 
God that we do not belong to the 
Catholic denomination or to any of 
the denominations who have re- 
ceived their authority if they have 
at all, from the Catholic Church. I 
thank God, likewise, that my lot is 
not cast among the Jews of this day, 
but that I am favored to be a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, with a testi- 
mony that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that He has estab- 
lished His Church in the earth for 
the salvation of all men who will 
believe in Him and keep His com- 
mandments, and prepare themselves 
to enjoy all that He has promised to 
the faithful. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

I was especially impressed with 
one reference made by President 
Joseph F. Smith today, in connec- 
tion with the great work of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and that was, in 
regard to the salvation for the dead. 
Latter-day Saints, as you know, be- 
lieve that not only those who hear 
and obey the Gospel of Jesus while 
they live in the earth shall be saved, 
but all mankind who have ever 
lived upon the arth, or who now 
live, or who ever will live upon the 
earth, shall have an equal chance to 
hear the name of Christ, to hear the 
Gospel of Jesus taught, and have 
a chance to accept or reject the 
same. Thus the love of Christ is 
shown more beautifully than ever 
man has taught it before. His love 
and His Gospel is proclaimed to all 
earth's inhabitants, reaching not 
only the living but the dead, also. 
Three weeks ago, in the city of 
Chicago, at least five different 
churches taught a similar doctrine 
to their congregations, under the 
headings of "A Second Chance," or 
"The Dead shall hear the Voice of 
God," or "Greater Love of Christ." 
Thus you can see how the leaven of 
the Gospel is taking possession of 
the hearts of the people of the earth. 
I rejoice in it, and shall rejoice more 
when they shall look for the true 
authority to administer in the laws 
and ordinances of the Gospel, when 
they shall seek men who have the 
right to go into the waters of bap- 
tism and say in all truth : "Having 
been commissioned of Jesus Christ 
I baptize you in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost." That they cannot say 
today, for they have not been com- 
missioned, they have not been or- 
dained; they have no right to say 
unto the people that they have been 
so ordained ; they have no right to 



baptize men and women into the 
Church of Christ, for He has not so 
designated them. 

Latter-day Saints sometimes think 
that they are doing all there is to be 
done concerning the salvation of the 
dead. But when I look around in 
this great nation of ours, and see 
how the leaven of the Gospel is 
working, I am almost lead to pro- 
claim that "the children of the world 
are wiser in their generation than 
the children of light," for the people 
of the world are doing a marvel- 
ous work connected with the salva- 
tion of the children of our Father. 
Many have had planted in their 
hearts the love of God and the love 
of their fellow men, reaching not 
only to the living but to the dead. 
They do not recognize their efforts 
as a work for the salvation of the 
dead, but such it is nevertheless. 
Since the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
has been restored, and the Prophet 
Elijah has come, the hearts of the 
children have been turned toward 
their dead relatives. While they 
have not understood that there shall 
be baptism for their dead kindred, 
they feel that they should gather 
their names and genealogies and re- 
cord them in books. I sometimes be- 
lieve that they have done that work 
better than we have done it, using 
better books and spending more 
money for that purpose. 

There was not much done, how- 
ever, of a permanent nature, in this 
nation, looking to the gathering of 
genealogies, until after the dedica- 
tion of the Salt Lake Temple. There 
were few organizations with this ob- 
ject in view, but one is really sur- 
prised to see in the great libraries 
of the nation the work now being 
done. I have some items here that 
I gathered a few weeks ago in visit- 
ing one of the greatest genealogical 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



libraries in the world, and I would 
like to give part of them for the 
consideration of the Latter-day 
Saints. I believe that we are inter- 
ested in this subject more vitally 
than any other people in the earth ; 
because we have more light on the 
subject. We have a better reason 
for gathering genealogies of the 
dead than any other people in the 
world. They gather it for decency 
sake, as one genealogist put it, while 
we do it in the spirit of saviors to 
the dead. They do it from personal 
pride, and the spirit that a man 
who cannot trace his genealogy is 
like a mongrel among stock, who 
had no pedigree. One librarian 
told me all decent people now a days 
know who their parents are, like- 
wise their grandparents, and great- 
grandparents, because the world 
over, respectable people keep sac- 
redly such records, and as soon as 
possible, publish them in good books 
for generations yet unborn. 

One of the first organizations of 
that character established in this 
country, is entitled, "The New Eng- 
land Historical and Genealogical 
Society," organized in the year 
1844, just eight years after the com- 
ing of Elijah. They gave this rea- 
son for establishing this organiza- 
tion : "There is no work of the kind 
in the country, and one seems to 
be much needed, for the period has 
arrived when an awakened and 
great interest is felt in this country 
in the pursuit of genealogical re- 
search." With the exception of one 
or two small or minor organiza- 
tions having for their object the 
gathering of genealogies ; the work 
was limited to this one organization. 
But following the dedication of the 
Salt Lake Temple, when Wilford 
Woodruff said in his dedicatorial 
prayer that he had turned the last 



key turning the hearts of the fathers 
to the children, and the hearts of 
the children to the fathers in this 
earth, praying God to hasten the 
great day of the salvation of the 
dead, a number of such organiza- 
tions have been established. I have 
the names of seven genealogical 
periodicals that are now published. 
After 1893, it seems that the great 
movement began in earnest. I will 
read a list of the organizations and 
periodicals that were established im- 
mediately after the dedication of the 
Salt Lake Temple : 

"The Newbury Library," in Chi- 
cago, one of the largest of its kind 
in the world, was organized in No- 
vember, 1893. A large and active 
organization for genealogical work 
was inaugurated November 1893, 
entitled, "The Genealogical Society 
of New Hampshire." "The May- 
flower Descendants," was organized 
in 1894. The "Virginia Magazine 
of Historical Biographies," in 1894. 
"The Colonial Order," in 1894 
"The Military Order of Foreign 
Wars," in 1894. "The National So- 
ciety of New England," in 1895. 
"The Colonial Society," in 1895. 
The "National Society of Children 
of American Revolution." in 1895. 
"The American Historical Regis- 
ter," in 1895. "The Genealogical 
Society of Pennsylvania," in 1895. 
"The Genealogical Society of Syr- 
acuse, New York," in 1895. "The 
Mayflower Descendants Quarterly," 
in 1898. "Old Northwest Society 
of Columbia," in 1899. "Medford 
Historical Record of Massachus- 
sets," in 1898. "Devon Record So- 
ciety," in 1904. "Maryland His- 
torical Magazine," in 1906. "New 
England Family History," in 1907. 
and "Massachussets Magazine 
Quarterly," in 1908. Probably there 
have never been, in such a short

83 



period in the world's history, so 
many societies organized for gath- 
ering together names and geneal- 
ogies. As I said before, they have 
some other objects, but the great 
object'as understood by the Latter- 
day Saints, is that some day the peo- 
ple of the earth may go to the House 
of the Lord, and, with these records, 
gathered by the children of the 
world, at great expense of time and 
means, perform a work for their 
dead relatives. When they meet 
those relatives on the other side, 
they can say that they had worked 
to secure the salvation of those who 
had no chance to hear the word of 
God in this life. 

Truly the Lord has turned the 
hearts of the children to their par- 
ents, and the hearts of our fore- 
fathers who are dead have been 
turned to us. I believe that they 
are near us, and that they are trying 
their best to influence us to do that 
which will open the prison doors, 
and give them a chance to enter into 
a broader life and grander work 
which will prepare us and them for 
•greater happiness in the life to 
come ; this is the greater love that is 
moving the living and the dead. 

I rejoice in my testimony of the 
'Gospel. I thank God for the priv- 
ilege that I have had in the mission 
field, of laboring with thousands of 
your missionary sons and daughters. 
I know that the mothers and fathers 
of Zion are the true nobility of the 
earth. They have noble sons and 
daughters who are not afraid to pro- 
claim to the world, under inspira- 
tion of the Spirit of God, that God 
lives, and His Son Jesus is the Sav- 
ior of the world. I would like to 
say, my brethren and sisters, that 
we have every reason to hold up 
our heads and rejoice, because of the 
■testimony that God has given us, be- 



cause of the revelations of his Son 
that have come into our hearts, that 
He is the Savior of the world and 
Redeemer of mankind, and that the 
hour is come when the living and 
the dead shall hear His voice and re- 
ceive salvation through His won- 
derful love. 

I ask the peace and blessings of 
heaven to be upon us. May the spirit 
of this great work, not only for the 
salvation of the dead, but the salva- 
tion of the living, take possession of 
us. May we be diligent, even as 
diligent as the world is, in recording 
the genealogies of our friends and 
relatives in books, so we shall be 
able to trace our ancestry in written 
records away back to the beginning, 
and find that we all have come from 
a noble race of sires. May God 
grant us His peace and favor, and 
may He prosper Zion, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

EIDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and 
sisters, that I shall have an interest 
in your faith and prayers. I have 
been suffering with a severe cold, 
and have not recovered sufficient to 
speak clearly. I hope and pray that 
the Lord will strengthen my voice, 
and that the time allotted to me 
shall not be considered wasted, but 
that our gathering here this after- 
noon will be a spiritual feast, and 
that we shall continue to enjoy the 
splendid spirit that has prevailed. 
I rejoice in the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer of the world. I have been 
permitted to take a part in the min- 
istry of the Son of God, and have 
been able to bear testimony to thou- 
sands of the children of men who 
have not learned to love the Lord

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as have the Latter-day Saints, 
neither have become acquainted 
with the fulness of the Gospel that 
the Lord has revealed. 

The "Mormon" people have been 
maligned ; men's minds have been 
turned against them, as the result of 
missionary work done by emis- 
saries of the adversary, who have 
taught the people of the world 
things that are not true, and have 
been active in discouraging anything 
that would lead people to think fa- 
vorably of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, as taught by the Latter-day 
Saints. I had occasion to listen to 
the recital of a story, a few days ago, 
by a lady who had been teaching 
school, in this country, who had 
gone into one of the States of the 
Union and was giving an address, 
the subject being, "Mormonism, and 
Life among the Mormons." She 
led her audience to believe that the 
"Mormons" in Utah have no edu- 
cational system at all, that they are 
an ignorant class of people, that they 
are not making any effort to en- 
lighten the minds of the children in 
that land called Utah; and many 
other things that would create en- 
mity in the minds of people. A 
gentleman, from Utah, who had 
listened to the discourse, asked her 
concerning the school systems in 
Utah, the rank of this State of ours 
as among other states; pinning her 
down to prove what she had said. 
She was surrounded by about twen- 
ty ministers, and they were all an- 
xious that she should defend her 
statement, but she could not do it. 
Afterwards, she sought that gen- 
tleman and asked him not to make a 
report of it, for she wanted to go 
back to Utah, where she had some 
very dear friends. This is only one 
instance out of many, in which au- 
diences are misinformed. 



I tell you there are very many 
good men and good women in the 
world. They don't live perfect lives, 
it is true, but they are honorable, so 
far as men of the world are con- 
cerned. It is a trick of the* adver- 
sary to keep men and women from 
investigating the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. If they could have the veil 
drawn from their eyes, and could 
see this country of ours, the great 
commonwealth that has been estab- 
lished here, as one of the results of 
the appearance of the Father and 
the Son to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, they would be led to more 
carefully investigate the history of 
the "Mormons." We rejoice that 
we are not afraid of the truth, we 
are not afraid to have our true his- 
tory investigated and read by all the 
men and women of the earth. We 
desire them to understand what we 
are doing, that it takes money, that 
it takes self-sacrifice all the time to 
keep this latter-day work before the 
people. It is cheerfully done, with- 
out any hope of remuneration in this 
life. Men lay down their lives for 
the testimony of Jesus, for the wit- 
ness of the truth that they bear, in- 
viting men to read and investigate. 
We do not baptize people without 
giving them a chance to investigate 
the Gospel that we preach. We de- 
clare that the Gospel is for the liv- 
ing and for the dead, and that they 
must receive the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer before they can enter into 
the presence of our God ; that the 
Lord does not save any man in ig- 
norance, but that man must be en- 
lightened ; that they will not be con- 
signed to an everlasting torment, 
until they have had the privilege of 
receiving or rejecting the Gospel 
of the Redeemer of the world. 

A lady came to Independence, 
Missouri, to visit us, and she told 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



85 



me that she had belonged to a cer- 
tain church all her life, was baptized 
into it when a child. She had be- 
lieved it was the Church of God, and 
had enjoyed herself many times in 
the meetings of that congregation, 
etc. She said that two Elders, some 
two or three years ago, had visited 
her home and they had left a few 
tracts and books for her to read, 
and had borne their testimony that 
the doctrines stated therein were of 
the Lord, and included His Gospel 
and she read them. She had buried 
her father and husband, and often 
wondered if she would meet them 
again. In one of the tracts it was de- 
clared that the Gospel had been 
preached by the Christ to those that 
are dead. She became interested, 
and began to study, and, in the 
course of two years, she was con- 
verted to the Gospel. She came 
to me and said: "I have found 
a cousin of mine, that I never 
knew until a short time ago, 
who has a book containing names 
of eight thousand of my dead kin- 
dred, on my father's sde. Origin- 
ally they landed in Jamestown with 
the early settlers of this country. 
I feel that I cannot rest until I have 
commenced the work of redemp- 
tion for them, until, the Temple 
work has been begun in their be- 
half, until I have been an instrument 
for their redemption." This Gos- 
pel plan gave her new life, told her 
she had something great to live for ; 
and she was so happy she felt like 
weeping, because of this glorious re- 
sult of the visit of these two Elders. 

Most men will accept the truth 
when they understand it. Take any 
man in general and preach some- 
thing to him absolutely contrary to 
his views and he will resent it, nine- 
ty-nine times out of a hundred, and 
emphatically declare that he doesn't 



believe it. But when he is calmly rea- 
soned with, and shown wherein his 
views can be bettered, he will read 
and listen, and eventually, the leaven 
of the Gospel enters his soul. How 
many men and women gathered 
from the different parts of the earth 
are witness of this. Ofttimes the^ 
mother of a family receives the Gos- 
pel first, and she never ceases to 
labor with her loved ones until she 
gets them into the Church. Occas- 
ionally it is the daughter, sometimes 
it is the son, or father, and they also 
labor with their loved ones, relatives 
and neighbors, to get them to be- 
come members of the Church. We 
are witnesses of this, hundreds who 
are here on these grounds today. 
Honest hearted men accept the truth 
when it is presented to them, when 
prejudice has been allayed. We 
must make friends and acquantances 
first, and then they understand our 
true motives, and the spirit of preju- 
dice that has been planted by Luci- 
fer will be allayed, and he shall not 
have power always to deceive the 
children of men. 

My brethren and sisters, we need 
make no apology for anything the 
Lord has revealed. In very deed He 
appeared to Joseph Smith, revealed 
Himself, spoke to him as one man 
speaks to another, said to him, 
"These denominations have a form 
of godliness, but they have not the 
power thereof." Why should He 
not appear to men today as much 
as at any time in the history of this 
world ? He appeared to Moses. All 
people, who are Christians, and 
many who are not, naturally believe 
that. He loves His children today 
as much as He did then. The 
world's inhabitants have increased, 
and the works of God are growing 
greater, and so His love must be 
greater than in any period of the

world's history. As the men and 
women come and go through this 
Temple Block, from one season to 
another, and are shown through 
these buildings, and go back to their 
homes, and are met by the Elders of 
Israel and the Sisters of Zion who 
bear their testimony to them, preju- 
dice shall be allayed, and men and 
women will acknowledge the truth, 
and seek after their dead, and the 
work for the glory of God shall be 
consummated and fulfilled. The 
Lord bless us. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O, say what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 

And priceless the value of truth will 
be, when 

The proud monarch's costliest dia-

teaches gives them eyes." I should 
like to say a word this afternoon to 
the Church teachers who are sup- 
posed to be giving "eyes to the 
blind." I pray that the same in- 
spiration that has actuated this 
conference thus far may be present 
with us this afternoon in rich abund- 
ance. • 

In a thoughtful little work enti- 
tled "The Religion Worth Having," 
Thomas Nixon Carver has given 
several sociological marks of what 
he considers the true church. Among 
other things I find this comparison : 

"Everyone is familiar with the in- 
tense struggle for existence that is 
carried on among the trees of the for- 
est. It is asserted that the struggle 
is so intense and the issue of life and 
death is so sharply drawn among the 
young pines of a thicket, that the cut- 
ting of an inch from the top of one 
of them will doom it to ultimate ex- 
tinction. Even that slight difference 
puts it at a disadvantage, and it never 
regains what was lost, but falls farther 
and farther behind and is eventually 
killed by its less unfortunate rivals. 
Now let us imagine," he continues, "that 
these trees were conscious beings and 
capable of having a religion. Let us 
suppose farther that one set of trees 
possessed a religion which stimulated 
growth and helped them in the strug- 
gle for soil and light, while another 
possessed a religion which retarded 
growth and hindered in the struggle, 
is there any doubt as to which of these 
religions would ultimately dominate 
the forest? Those trees which happen 
to possess the religion which helped 
them would survive, and those which 
happen to possess the kind of religion

which hinders them would perish, and 
their religion would perish with them." 
"The issues of life and death," he con- 
tinues, "is never so sharply drawn 
among human beings as among the 
trees of the forest, but in the long run 
the results appear to be very much 
the same," and then "If that be true 
it will follow that the religion which 
best fits men for the struggle with the 
forces of the world, which enables them 
to survive in this struggle, will event 
ually be left in possession of the world." 

I am grateful for membership in 
a church whose religion fits men for 
the struggle with the forces of the 
world, and which enables them to 
survive in this struggle. One of 
these acting forces is the responsi- 
bility of teaching, and the oppor- 
tunity afforded for so many to share 
this responsibility. There are others, 
too, just as effective. For example, 
much might be said about the ac- 
complishment of the Church in en- 
abling men to get dominion over the 
forces of nature, in other words, the 
efficiency . of the Church to supply 
the material needs of mankind. 
Though this phase of our religion is 
glorious to contemplate, and will 
establish in the minds of thinking 
men the superiority of this divine 
organization over the man-made or- 
ganizations, I shall merely mention 
it as one of the many commendable 
features which fit our men in the 
struggle with nature's forces. 
Neither shall I dwell upon the social 
efficiency nor the opportunities 
which the men and women in the 
various organizations have of ex- 
erting an influence upon the young 
people and upon their associates. I 
might say, however, in passing, that 
since I came into this building this 
afternoon, my attention has been 
called to an illustration of the effi- 
ciency of the stake organization in 
reaching the young people. A note 
was passed to me just as I entered, 



giving a new plan adopted in one 
of our leading stakes of controlling 
the exercises and the amusements of 
all the young people in that stake. 
All organizations have agreed to 
close evening entertainments at an 
early hour in the night, that nothing 
in that stake should be in operation 
after 10 o clock. One young man 
who first rebelled against the rule, 
but later favored it, said in answer 
to the question, "Well, what do you 
think of this new rule?" "Why," 
he replied, "I have this to say, all 
my meanness in the past was done 
after 10 o'clock at night." But of 
the social, efficiency I am not going 
to say anything this afternoon, 
merely mention it and suggest that 
anybody who will give thought to it, 
and examine the divine organiza- 
tion, and the opportunity that men 
and women have of controlling their 
young people as social beings, will 
be convinced of the efficacy and su- 
periority of the Church in this re- 
gard. But I said I would like to 
draw attention to the teaching force 
of the Church. 

Luther once said : "Count it one 
of the highest virtues upon earth to 
educate faithfully the children of 
others which so few, and scarcely 
any, do their own." The obligation 
of teaching is placed by the Church 
first upon the parents. Fathers and 
mothers are accepted absolutely as 
teachers and the responsibility 
thereof has been placed upon them 
by divine command. But beside 
these there is an army of men and 
women, and boys and girls, who 
have accepted the responsibility of 
teaching. In the priesthood quo- 
rums alone the number runs into 
the thousands. Among these there 
are selected not a few thousand to 
act as instructors of the youth. 
There are, approximately, six thous- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and such officers and teachers in the 
quorums; over one thousand teach- 
ing the high priests; over fifteen 
hundred teaching the seventies; 
over fifteen hundred teaching the 
elders, and so on to the priests, 
teachers and deacons, making a 
total of over six thousand officers 
and teachers. With them should be 
numbered the thousands of young 
men and young women associated 
with the mothers of the Relief So- 
ciety who, too, have joined the ranks 
of teachers. Indeed the last report 
shows that there are over fifty-six 
thousand officers and teachers in the 
various auxiliary organizations of 
the Church, not including the ward 
teachers. Of course, some of these 
teachers of the quorums are also 
ward teachers, so the latter cannot 
be counted without duplication. 
Neither does the number 56,000 in- 
clude the vast army of all the men 
and boys who have been ordained 
to the priesthood, every one of 
whom has the responsibility of 
teaching his fellowmen. If you in- 
clude all who hold the priesthood, 
and to that number add mothers 
and young men and young women 
in the Relief Socity, the Sunday 
Schools, the Mutuals,,the Primary, 
and the Religion Class, you have 
an army of over one hundred thous- 
and teachers who have the privilege 
of working or taking upon them- 
selves what Luther calls "the high- 
est virtue upon earth." Several 
years ago while attending a con- 
ference such as this, I heard Presi- 
dent Smith deliver a sermon bearing 
on the importance of the office of 
teacher, in which he, too, empha- 
sized the responsibility and virtue 
of this great calling. "The church 
needs," he concluded in substance, 
"efficient men and women who will 
be teachers of our children." 



Now I ask you — for I have the 
time merely to make the suggestion 
— in furnishing opportunity for so 
many to get the development that 
comes to the true teacher, think 
what the Church is doing in en- 
abling this army of teachers as in- 
dividuals to become strong in the 
battle against the forces of the 
world? First, it places upon them 
the obligation of teaching their fel- 
low men by example ; and there is 
no better safe-guard placed upon an 
honest man or a sincere woman. 
Second, it develops the divine at- 
tribute of love for others. Jesus 
said to one of His apostles, "Simon, 
son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more 
than these?" "Yea Lord, Thou 
knowest I love Thee." "Feed my 
lambs." Before He gave the divine 
injunction to Peter and the others 
to teach, He preceded it by the nec- 
essary qualification of love, "Simon, 
son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more 
than these ?" We shall not discuss 
now, what "these" signifies, but the 
significance is deeper than some of 
us think. But love should precede 
the responsibility of feeding those 
lambs. These hundred thousand 
must have in their hearts the love of 
teaching, the love of fellow men ; 
and these officers who sit before me 
who call the young men and young 
women into this service, should ask 
them their willingness, their accept- 
ance of this responsibility, impress- 
ing upon those so called the neces- 
sity of developing the divine attri- 
bute of love. 

Then there is a third requirement ; 
viz., purity of life. I cannot im- 
agine a boy who has soiled himself 
teaching, successfully, purity to 
boys. I cannot imagine a man who 
has doubt in his mind about the ex- 
istence of God, teaching impressive- 
ly the existence of a Deity to young 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



89 



boys and girls. He cannot do it. If 
he act the hypocrite and attempt so 
to teach, what he is will speak 
louder than- what he says; and that 
is the danger, fathers and mothers, 
of getting doubting men as teachers 
of your children. The poison sinks 
into the little beings, and uncon- 
sciously they become sick in spirit, 
because of the poison which the 
man in whom they have confidence 
has insiduously instilled into their 
souls. But the thought of any of 
this army's attempting to teach the 
youth faith in God, when they 
haven't it is irreconcilable with con- 
sistency, if not indeed unthinkable. 
So the third qualification is purity of 
life and faith in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Finally, it gives them an 
opportunity to serve their fellow 
men, therein magnify the calling 
which has come to them, and indeed 
prove that they are real disciples of 
Christ. "Inasmuch as ye do it unto 
the least of these my children, ye 
have done it unto Me." Thus the 
principle, the divine principle of 
service, is instilled in their minds. 

Now I ask you to think of the 
effect upon society, if every one of 
these teachers, every one, will suc- 
ceed in influencing only one other 
to love, to have that same purity of 
life, and that same desire to serve 
fellow men as he has. It means, at 
once, that there would be two hun- 
dred thousand such men and women 
in this community. And such a con- 
summation is not idealistic or im- 
aginative; it is a condition that can 
come, that ought to be. One hun- 
dred thousand men and women who 
keep the word of wisdom as faith- 
fully as the three times sixty-six 
stake presidencies keep it or the 
three times seven hundred twenty- 
four bishoprics, just as faithfully as 
the members of the general boards, 



just as faithfully as the officers 
throughout the Church. That is 
what it means; think what it con- 
templates ! 

God help our teachers to feel the 
responsibility that comes to them, 
and to remember that responsibility 
is not measured alone by what they 
do, but by the opportunities that 
have come to them to know good 
from evil. Oh, how mighty then 
becomes the responsibility of a 
teacher. 

Not long ago I noticed a young 
girl in her teens put forth a special 
effort to accost the little boy that 
was by my side. I did not know 
her, cannot call her name today, but 
I could see she wanted to recognize 
that boy, and I noticed that he was 
glad when he saw her to reciprocate 
or to return her salutation. As we 
passed I said, "Who is she?" "She 
is my religion class teacher." "What 
is her name ?" "I don't know what 
her name is, but oh, she is a dandy !" 
He used an incorrect word, evident- 
ly did not know its true meaning, 
but the significance he gave the 
word I knew, and the expression on 
his face I read, and in my heart I 
thanked the young girl for the in- 
fluence she has over that boy. Only 
in her teens, but what that girl will 
say to him in his religion class he 
will accept as gospel truth ; what she 
does in her life he will emulate ; and 
that young girl carries the responsi- 
bility, in a way, of molding my boy's 
character ; and the one hundred 
thousand in this Church carry the 
same responsibility. 

Well might the prophet say then : 

"Oh ye that embark in the seivice 
of God, see that ye serve Him with all 
your heart, might, mind and strength, 
.that ye may stand blameless before 
God at the last day; for behold the 
field is white all ready to harvest and

lo! he that thrusteth in his sickle with 
his might, the same layeth up in store 
that he perish not, but bringeth salva- 
tion to his soul; and faith, hope, char- 
ity, and love, with an eye single to the 
glory of God, qualify him for the 
work. Remember faith, virtue, knowl- 
edge, temperance, patience, brotherly 
kindness, godliness, chanty, humility, 
diligence." 

May these things be in you and 
abound, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

Example of faithful men and women 
an inspiration to others— Progres- 
sion evident, but opportunity for 
further improvement — Saints should 
not need to be admonished to live 
aright. 

In my travels in the various 
stakes of Zion, meeting with the 
people in their conferences, and _m 
talking and discussing matters with 
presidents of stakes, I think I have 
discovered, to a very large degree, 
the truth of the remarks made at 
this conference regarding the 
o-rowth and development of the 
Church I believe, most sincerely, 
that we are today better prepared 
to serve the Lord and keep His 
commandments in the spirit and un- 
derstanding thereof, than ever- be- 
fore in the -history of the Church. 1 
believe this condition is due to many 
causes, chief among them the fact 
that we are led and directed by the 
Spirit of the Lord. It is due also 
to the fact that we have the experi- 
ence of the past to profit by, and the 
inspiration of those who have gone 
before, to direct us. It is due large- 
ly as we have heard, to the efficien- 
cy of those who are called and ap- 
pointed to stand as presidents of 
stakes and counselors, members of 



high councils, bishops and bishops' 
counselors,' and in various other 
callings in the priesthood, and in the 
various organizations of the Church. 
These men and women — for we 
have organizations for our sisters — 
are presided over by those who have 
faith, who are true to the gospel 
principles, who have within them 
the spirit of the Gospel and a testi- 
mony of the truth. They are im- 
parting these principles to the peo- 
ple and encouraging them in keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord. 
I also feel that the visits that are 
made by the presiding brethren in 
the various stakes and wards aid to 
a large degree in this direction of 
development and growth among the 
people. 

We are advancing, we are gaining 
in knowledge, in wisdom, and in 
power. This is as it should be, and 
as it will always be in the church 
and kingdom of our Father; for 
there must be progression, there 
must be advancement. Knowledge 
will be poured down upon this peo- 
ple and the Lord will make known 
unto us from time to time, through 
revelation, and the spirit of inspira- 
tion, many things that are for our 
good, when we are prepared and 
ready to receive them. I speak gen- 
erally of the Church ; but notwith- 
standing all our advancement, in- 
crease of faith and diligence, there 
is still great room for improvement. 
There are many among us who are 
not living up to their duties, accept- 
ing their callings and magnifying 
them as they should do. There are 
many among us who fall short and 
fail in various ways in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord to that 
extent of which they are capable. It 
is of this class that I desire to speak, 
and to say something this afternoon 
that will perhaps be helpful to them. 



ELDER JOSEPH P. SMITH, JR.

I desire to read a few verses from 
section fifty-eight of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, beginning with the 
twenty-sixth verse : 

"For behold, it is not meet that I 
should command in all things, for he 
that is compelled in all things, the 
same is a slothful and not a wise ser- 
vant; wherefore he receiveth no re- 
ward. 

"Verily I say, men should be anx- 
iously engaged in a good cause, and 
do many things of their own free will, 
and bring to pass much righteousness; 

"For the power is in them, wherein 
they are asrents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall 
in nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doeth not anvthing 
until he is commanded, and receiveth 
a commandment with doubtful heart, 
and keepeth it with slothfulness, the 
same is damned." 

I consider this a very important 
passage of scripture. While we 
have among us, as we have heard, 
one hundred thousand teachers who 
are instructing the people and di- 
recting them in the Gospel, never- 
theless we should keep in mind this 
truth, that there is much that we can 
do individually as members of the 
Church without the necessity of be- 
ing taught by our instructors. The 
Lord expects it of us. Tt ought not 
be necessary for the teachers to 
rorae into my home to teach me the 
law of tithing. It should not be nec- 
essary for them to come to me and 
mv family and teach us the word of 
wisdom. ' It should not be necessary 
for them to call upon us to teach 
us the necessity of prayer, or of 
fasting, or any other of these sim- 
ple and fundamental principles of the 
Gospel. We ought to know enough 
from what we have constantly 
been taught and the knowledge 
we have from our natural under- 
standing of the scriptures as we are 
guided by the Spirit of the Lord, to 



do these things without being taught 
or commanded more than to follow 
the general commandment as it is 
written in the scriptures. While it 
is necessary, of course, that the 
teachers visit in the homes of the 
people, to see that there is no in- 
iquity in the Church, no back-biting, 
fault finding, no envy, no strife, and 
that all the members do their duty, 
yet I say we should so live that 
when they come to us to teach us, 
we can tell them with a clear con- 
science that we are performing these 
labors and accepting these principles 
with an eye single to the glory of 
God. I feel this to be our duty as 
members in the Church. It should 
not be necessary that we be con- 
tinually taught and admonished in 
these simple truths in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. We ought to so pre- 
pare ourselves through study and 
through faith, through observance 
of the law of the Gospel, through at- 
tendance at meetings and the mag- 
nifying of our callings generally, to 
know what the Lord expects at our 
hands without the necessity of some- 
one telling us. 

The Lord has promised that the 
time shall come when every man 
shall be his own teacher, that is, he 
will know because of righteous liv- 
ing what to do. He will be so filled 
with the Spirit of the Lord that he 
will be guided and directed in doing 
right without the necessity of some- 
one coming into his home to set it in 
order. Now is a good time for us 
to begin. Let every man set his 
house in order, and see that his 
family is taught the principles of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ ; that they 
keep the word of wisdom ; that they 
abstain from the use of strong 
drink, from the use of tea, from the 
use of coffee, tobacco and other 
stimulants and narcotics which tend 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to destroy and to break down rather 
than to build up the system. Let 
them teach in their homes faith in 
God — for we all know it is neces- 
sary that faith should be taught 
among the people. I believe, of 
course, that in this regard we are 
far ahead of any other people in the 
world. We have greater faith be- 
cause we have a better understand- 
ing of the truth, and because we 
are to a greater extent striving to 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord. But I am impressed with an 
expression of the Savior's. I think 
it is found in the eighteenth chapter 
of Luke. Speaking of the latter 
times, in one of His discourses He 
said to the people : "When the Son 
of man cometh shall He find faith 
on the earth?" I think the proper 
answer to the question is that if He 
finds faith on the earth it will not be 
to any great extent ; and I believe 
that the condition in the world today 
proves that this is what He had in 
mind. But we should be faithful, 
we should have knowledge, we 
should have understanding and be 
prepared to give a reason for the 
hope that is within us, and walk 
uprightly and justly before the 
Lord, and keep the commandments 
as they have been given to us. This 
is our duty as it is recorded here in 
the fifty-ninth section : "Wherefore 
I give unto them [that is the people] 
a commandment, saying thus : Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with 
all thy heart, with all they might, 
mind, and strength ; and in the name 
of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve 
Him." This is our duty as Latter- 
day Saints. This is the great com- 
* mandment and if we will put into 
practice this commandment which 
has been reiterated unto us in this 
dispensation, and love our neighbors 



as ourselves, we need have no fear 
regarding our salvation. 

I pray that when we go to our 
homes we will remember the things 
we have heard and put into practice 
the teachings that have been im- 
parted and will yet be imparted here 
during the conference. I hope we 
will also carry these instructions to 
those who are not so fortunate as we 
are, and are not here to be fed the 
words of eternal life, and teach 
them, that faith may abound in the 
hearts of the people, and truth pre- 
vail among them, that we may stand 
united as one body, worshiping the 
Lord and keeping His command- 
ments, because we love to do so. 
This is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the conclusion of his remarks 
Elder Smith read the report of the 
auditing committee, so that those 
unable to attend the session on Mon- 
day, the 6th, at the time of transac- 
tion of other business, should have 
the privilege of hearing it. The re- 
port appears in full in statement of 
proceedings on April 6th.

"Ode to the Pioneers," was sung

Phenomenal nature of these great 
Conferences — Simplicity of our 
teachings — Oratory and eloquence — 
People who tire of sound doctrine — 
Vagaries of higher criticism — The 
Latter-day Saints accept the Bible 
as the word of God— The Philo- 
sophical Society of Great Britain, a 
Christian organization — The mira- 
cles of the Bible believed in by 
leaders among men — Not unscien- 
tific to accept the simple Gospel of 
Christ. 

These great gatherings of the 
Church have come to be looked upon 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



93 



as a very remarkable phenomenon. 
It is indeed something to be won- 
dered at, that men and women in 
such great numbers will leave their 
employment and at very consider- 
able sacrifice of time and money 
come up from the stakes both near 
and afar off, twice a year, to this ap- 
pointed place, the block upon which 
stands the great house of the Lord, 
and remain in session for three or 
more days, receiving instructions 
and admonition, and occasionally 
good and well intended rebuke, in 
order that they may be the better 
fitted for their duties as professing 
Latter-day Saints. It cannot be that 
curiosity brings them here, for the 
many decades through which this 
custom has continued must have 
abolished the element of novelty. 
Nor do I think the people come to 
be entertained, certainly not to be 
amused. It is true we have the 
privilege of listening to music of the 
very highest order — music of prayer 
and praise; and great shall be the 
blessing that shall come to every one 
of our talented singers and mu- 
sicians who are so ready and will- 
ing to use their God-given gift in 
praise and worship. We do not 
come to be impressed by pulpit ora- 
tory. There is none of the attrac- 
tiveness of oratorical display about 
the addresses that are delivered 
from this stand. I have rejoiced 
many times and do now rejoice, that 
our public speaking in the Church of 
Jesus Christ is devoid of those char- 
acteristics usually classed under the 
name of oratory. Oratory too often 
means little more than the sounding 
of brass and the tinkling of cymbals 
to tickle the ears. I do rejoice, 
however, in the eloquence of those 
who speak under the influence of the 
Spirit of God. Oratory is addressed 
to the ears ; eloquence given of God, 



to the heart. I cannot conclude oth- 
erwise than that our people thus 
come together so willingly and so 
eagerly because they receive some- 
thing worth the coming. They find 
it pays them to come ; they go away 
satisfied. If they went otherwise 
they would be less inclined to come 
back again, and we know that every 
recurrence of the conference, both 
at the April and at the October sea- 
son is marked by the gathering of 
these great concourses of people 
who have come up from all parts of 
the land of Israel. I feel that they 
come to hear the word of God, pro- 
claimed in its simplicity; and it is 
the simplicity of the word that 
pleases the people, and that carries 
it home to their hearts. I call to 
mind that it was predicted by the 
inspired apostle of old that the day 
would come when people would tire 
of simplicity, and would look for 
something other than the eloquence 
of truth. Paul in writing to his be- 
loved son in Christ, as he called 
him, Timothy, admonished him as 
to his duties ; and as I read in the 
fourth chapter of the second epistle 
that passed between these two 
worthy ministers of Christ, Paul 
said : 

"I charge thee therefore before God, 
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall 
judge the quick and the dead at His 
appearing and His kingdom, Preach the 
word ; be instant in season, out of sea- 
son ; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all 
long suffering and doctrine. 

"For the time will come when they 
will not endure sound doctrine ; but after 
their own lusts shall they heap to them- 
selves teachers, having itching ears ; 

''And they shall turn away their ears 
from the truth, and shall be turned unto 
f ciblcs 

"But watch thou in all things, endure 
afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, 
and make full proof of thy ministry." 

Who can doubt that this predic- 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion has seen fulfillment and that the 
fact of its fulfillment is apparent to- 
day? Many there be who will no 
longer endure sound doctrine, but 
turn away after fables that tickle 
their ears and please their fancy, and 
demand of them none of that self- 
denial, sacrifice and earnest effort 
so characteristic of the requirements 
made of those who have taken upon 
themselves the name of Christ. 

Our attention was called in the 
opening session of this conference 
to the dangers of our being led 
astray by those who would make be- 
lieve that the very word of God 
itself is a fable, a collection of myths 
and legends, meaning not what it 
says but what men may fancy or 
would suppose. There be men who 
have arrogated to themselves the 
claim of superiority, who pronounce 
themselves higher critics of the 
scriptures of Almighty God, and 
proclaim that the scriptures mean 
not what they say. Right glad am 
I that my people are pleased with 
sound doctrine ; that the wholesome 
food of the Gospel is still sweet in 
their mouths. There are some who 
would make it appear that it is to- 
day an evidence of inferior percep- 
tion to accept the word of God for 
just what it professes to be, and that 
one is not up with the times unless 
he can read between the lines and 
unless he can perceive the meta- 
phorical and the figurative in the 
Holy Scriptures. There are parts 
of the Bible that are plainly figura- 
tive ; but no one who can read can 
be in doubt as to when a figure is 
used, and as to when the plain truth 
is declared in the simplest of lan- 
guage. Parables there are, and of 
great value are the lessons set forth 
thereby. But there is no parable, 
there is no metaphor in the plain 
declarations of the scriptures as to 



what is the price of salvation. 

I don't believe the Latter-day 
Saints are influenced by these vag- 
aries of the so-called higher criti- 
cism of the sriptures. I believe our 
people stand upon the platform of 
the word of God as it has been de- 
lievered unto them through the 
mouths of men who have been em- 
powered and directed to declare it 
unto them. But there are some, par- 
ticularly of our younger people, who 
perhaps are inclined to believe that 
it is a little superior to profess doubt 
as to the truth and plain meaning of 
the Holy Scriptures. To them let 
me say, it is not the leaders in 
thought in the world today who are 
doubting the scriptures, and read- 
ing into them a meaning that was 
never intended. The majority of 
the really great men, great thinkers, 
men who have influence amongst 
their fellows, accept the scriptures 
in their literalness and simplicity. 

There is now in existence a so- 
ciety known as the Philosophical 
Society of Great Britain. It em- 
braces not only subjects of the King 
of England, but men in many other 
nations. It is known also by an- 
other name, given in honor of the 
late Empress Queen who was its 
patron for many years, The Vic- 
toria Institute. Upon its rolls you 
will find the names of many of the 
leading scientists of the world, 
philosophers, literary men, theo- 
logians. The conditions attendant 
upon membership in that great asso- 
ciation are precise. The first is that 
the candidate shall be a man or 
woman of recognized ability. The 
second is that he shall be without 
reservation a Christian, believing 
that Jesus Christ was in very truth 
the Son of God, that He was born 
of the Virgin Mary, that He lived 
as the scriptures declare He did, that

He did suffer death and that He 
did literally come forth from the 
tomb, an immortalized Being. And 
that society whose president today 
is the Lord Chancellor of England, 
whose honorary president and pa- 
tron is the King, declares that it has 
no time to go over the ground again 
and thresh the old straw and win- 
now the old chaff of infidelity, or of 
questions that arise respecting the 
integrity of the Holy Scriptures. 
Men who will not accept Christ as 
the Redeemer of mankind can have 
no place there ; and yet I am told 
that it belittles one in the eyes of 
learned men to accept the plain and 
simple declarations of the scriptures 
with respect to the mission of the 
divine Son of God. 

I have been told that no really 
great mind can believe for a moment 
in the actuality of the miracles re- 
corded in the New Testament, par- 
ticularly those attributed to the 
Christ Himself. Yet that body of 
men, amongst whom are some of 
the most prominent of the leaders of 
men in the world, have but recently 
put themselves upon record. The 
subject of the miracles of the New 
Testament has been investigated 
scientifically, and according to the 
accepted canons of analysis, and the 
report unanimously adopted and put 
upon record by the Philosophical 
Society of Great Britain, is that the 
miracles of the Testament from that 
of Cana in Galilee to the greatest 
miracle of all, the coming forth of 
the Christ from the tomb on the res- 
urrection morn, are attested by evi- 
dence that is as trustworthy and in 
•every way as acceptable as the evi- 
dence attesting any event of past 
history; and the Philosophical So- 
ciety of Great Britain declares its 
acceptance of the miracles of the 
Bible as the very manifestation of 



the power of God. Those men are 
not above saying that because they 
can't perform such miracles, no such 
miracles were ever performed ; but 
they proclaim that to say they can- 
not understand them is no argument 
that they did not take place. I am 
inclined to accept the opinions of 
such men as those before the opin- 
ions of little-great men who seek to 
stir up doubt in the minds of those 
who believe in God and in His Son 
Jesus Christ. Most pernicious is 
the effect that such have upon chil- 
dren and young people of immature 
l^owers who cannot analyze for 
themselves and who follow their 
teachers and are impressed by those 
who instruct them in more things 
than the mere subjects which are set 
down on the program. 

Young Latter-day Saints, I say 
unto you as I have said before, it is 
not unscientific to believe in God, 
the very Eternal Father, nor in 
Jesus Christ as the one and only 
Redeemer of mankind, ft is not 
unphilosophical to accept the scrip- 
tural record of His birth, of His life, 
of His death, of His resurrection. I 
have met men of science and philos- 
ophy in many lands, and have dis- 
cussed the scriptures with them, and 
I testify to you I never yet have had 
to take a back seat nor to bow my 
head because of the principles which 
I profess to believe, nor because I 
was a Latter-day Saint. I have 
found the teachings of my Church, 
which is your Church and the 
Church of Jesus Christ, to be abreast 
of the very best of scientific concep- 
tion, discovery and teaching of the 
day. Beware of these who come 
telling you that you are behind the 
times in accepting the faith of your 
fathers. 

I am most happy to add my testi- 
mony to those to which we have lis- m

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tened in the course of this confer- 
ence, most grateful that the Lord 
has been with us in these meetings, 
and I recognize in it a fulfillment 
of His glorious promise while He 
lived in the flesh when He declared : 
"Where two or three are gathered 
together in my name, there am I in 
their midst." He has been in the 
congregations of the Saints who 
have assembled here, and the result 
is inspiration in the words of those 
who have spoken and who have in- 
structed us. While perchance we 
have heard nothing that is strictly 
novel or new, nothing that we may 
not have heard before, we have been 
reminded of those things that are 
most precious pertaining to the du- 
ties that shall save — the neglect of 
which shall condemn. I rejoice with 
my brethren who have already ex- 
presse_d their joy that the Gospel re- 
vealed unto man fits man to his en- 
vironment and enables him to meet 
the exigencies of the present day. 
Its scriptures are not alone the 
scriptures of the past but those of 
the very day in which we live. 

Is it not strange that this people 
who a few years ago were severely 
arraigned and criticized because in 
their declaration of faith they said, 
"We believe the Bible to be the word 
■of God as far as it is translated cor- 
rectly," should now be criticized be- 
cause of their literal acceptance of 
that volume of holy writ. We ac- 
cept it for what it is. We believe 



that other scriptures are necessary, 
and we affirm that other scriptures 
have been written, and that yet oth- 
ers shall be written ; but the Church 
of Jesus Christ stands for the in- 
tegrity of the Holy Bible, and de- 
fends it against the attacks and the 
assaults of those who would make 
you believe that it is but a compila- 
tion of fairy stories that pleased the 
people in by-gone centuries, but that 
are not adapted to the greater and 
higher development of the present 
day. The Bible and other scriptures 
given of God will always be up to 
date in their fundamental principles, 
and other scriptures will be given as 
occasion may require, to meet the 
condition of the advancing years. 
Let us go hence with the spirit of 
the conference burning in our 
hearts, that we may shed light and 
warmth in our homes and impart 
it unto those who have not been 
privileged to meet with us here. We 
are simple minded enough, child-like 
enough, thank God, to believe that 
He meant what He said when He 
spoke of old, and that He means 
what He says when He speaks to- 
day. God be with you. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Oh, 
beauty of holiness." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph E. Cardon. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Monday, April 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Monday, 
April 6th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Lars 
P. Overson. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

The Spirit of God, like a fire is burn- 
ing! 

The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth; 

The visions and blessings of old are 
returning, 
And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I copy the following incident, 
from the writings of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith : 

"In February, 1841, the City Council 
of Nauvoo, established and organized 
an institution of learning, to be known as 
the University of the City of Nauvoo, 
to be under the control and management 
of a Board of Trustees, consisting of a 
Chancelor, a Registrar, and 25 Regents, 
which board shall be a Body Corporate, 
and Political, with perpetual successors. 

"These officers shall be known as the 
Chancelor. and Regents of the Univer- 
sity, of the City of Nauvoo. These 
Regents of the University, will have 
the general supervision of all matters 
educational, from the common school, up 
to the highest branches of a most lib- 

•95- 



eral collegiate course. The Regency, will 
establish a regular system of education, 
and advance the pupil from Teacher 
to Professor, until the regular gradua- 
tion is accomplished, and the education 
of the pupil is completed." 

Daniel H. Wells, though not a 
member of the - Church at that 
time, was appointed one of the 
regents of this University, thus ex- 
emplifying, the good judgment of 
the Prophet, in his selection, rec- 
ognizing talent and ability outside 
of the members of the Church. 

Thus early was proposed by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and the lead- 
ing brethren of Nauvoo, the grade 
system for schools, centered around 
a magnificient university, which 
would have done credit to any com- 
munity. Although the prophet's life 
was taken, and the Saints driven 
from Nauvoo, before this univer- 
sity could be completed, the plans 
and ideas were remembered by Pres- 
ident Brigham Young, and his 
brethren, and were perfected in 
Great Salt Lake City. In 1850 the 
University of Desert was sucessful- 
ly started, which institution in- 
creased in growth and magnitude, 
until it culminated and stands to- 
day, a noble monument of learning 
to the people of Utah, as the "U. of 
U," one of the greatest in the inter- 
mountain region. 

About two years ago, Elder Bur- 
rel Chandler, of Saint George Stake, 
wrote a letter to President Joseph 
F. Smith, enquiring as to the num- 
ber of nations of the earth, who had 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



received the Gospel, and I had the 
pleasure, by invitation of the Presi- 
dent, to answer the letter. The fol- 
lowing are the prominent nations of 
the 'earth who have received the 
Gospel : 

United States of America, (mean- 
ing our Republic) ; also Old Mex- 
ico, the Hawaiian Islands, Finland, 
Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Ger- 
many, France, Norway, Italy, Hin- 
dostan, Australia, Canada, Great 
Britain, (including Ireland, Scot- 
land and Wales), the Netherlands, 
Switzerland, Denmark, South Afri- 
ca, Turkey, Samoa, Tahiti, or the 
Society Islands, Belgium, Rumania, 
Egypt, Iceland, Bulgaria, Japan 
and Greece. 

The Book of Mormon has been 
translated into the following nation- 
al and tribal languages : 

First 
published 
in 

1. English, . . 1830 

2. Danish, 1851 

3. French, -1832 

4. German, 1852 

5. Italian, 1852 

6. Welsh, 1852 

7. Hawaiian, 1855 

8. Swedish 1878 

9. Spanish, 1886 

10. Maori 1889 

11. Dutch, 1890 

12. Samoan, 1903 

13. Tahitian, 1904 

14. Turkish, 906 

15. Japanese, 1909 

The Book of Mormon has also 
been translated, but not yet pub- 
lished, in Hindostanee, Modern 
Tewish, snd Greek. 

Of all the recent translations of 
this sacred volume, the Japanese 
translation has been considered, I 
believe, the most difficult. During 
the administration of President Lo- 
renzo Snow, a mission was organ- 



ized and appointed to Japan, and 
Apostle Heber J. Grant was as- 
signed to the presidency of that mis- 
sion. He, with his feilow mission- 
aries, arrived in that land and es- 
tablished the mission, and Elder 
Grant remained there a couple of 
years or more, as president of the 
mission. On his release from that 
labor, to return home, he left as the 
mission president. Elder Ho.race S. 
Ensign, who in his turn, presided 
for two years. On Brother En- 
sign's release from that mission, the 
presidency was given to Elder Alma 
O, Taylor, who labored there nine 
and one-half years, and during his 
presidency, the Book of Mormon 
was translated into the Japanese lan- 
guage. Brother Taylor informed 
me that because of the magnitude of 
the labor of translation he found it 
necessary to devote his energies al- 
most entirely to acquiring the lan- 
guage as nearly perfect as possible, 
in order to enable him to properly 
undertake the great work ; and that 
he called to his aid some of the best 
scholars of the nation, to assist in 
the construction, and proof-reading, 
before its publication, succeeding 
thus in getting it as near correctly 
translated as it was possible to do. 

The progress and advancement of 
the Church is undeniable. The suc- 
cess of the Prophet Joseph in trans- 
lating the Book of Mormon, from 
the records committed to him by the 
Nephite prophet, is beyond question, 
and no successful contradiction has 
ever been raised against the truth 
of that record, or its faithful and 
correct translation from the re- 
formed Egyptian, as represented by 
the character of the hieroglyphics 
found upon the plates. I quote 
from the Book of the Prophet .Mor- 
mon, chapter 9, verses 32 and 33, 
as follows: 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



99 



"And now behold we have written this 
record according to our knowledge, of 
that which is called among us the re- 
formed Egyptian, being handed down 
and altered by us according to our 
manner of speech." 

In First Nephi, 1st chapter, 2nd 
and 3rd verses, we also read : 

"Yea, T make a record in the language 
of my father, which consists of the 
learning of the Jews and the language 
of the Egyptians, and I know that the 
record which T make is true, and I make 
it with mine own hand." 

Without fear of contradiction, it 
may he trnlv said that the Prophet 
Toseph became a successful trans- 
lator, being assisted in this work 
by the insoiration of the Spirit of the 
Lord, and, by earnest study and ap- 
plication on his part. He was not 
only enabled to translate the Book 
of Mormon, from the reformed 
Egyptian, but also to translate the 
Book of Abraham, as found in the 
Pearl of Great Price, a volume 
edited and compiled by Apostle F. 
D. Richards, which Pearl of Great 
Price has been and is accepted as 
one of the text books of the Church. 
The writings of Moses, another of 
the Books contained in this sacred 
volume, was "revealed to Joseoh, 
the Seer, in December, 1830." The 
Book of Abraham was translated by 
Joseph Smith, the Seer, from an- 
cient records that were found in 
the catacombs of Egypt (entitled, 
"the writings of Abraham while he 
was in Egvpt." This is a quota- 
tion from the record called the Book 
of Abraham, written by his own 
hand, upon papyrus. Although, re- 
cently, a minister of a Christian 
Church has presumed to criticise 
adversely, especially this Book of 
Abraham, his efforts have only in- 
duced a more careful, perusal and 
more thorough study of this valu- 



able work, which has brought an 
increase of testimony of its divinity 
to the mind and heart of every 
true Latter-day Saint. Let me say 
here that the statements of the crit- 
ics he selected, consisting of pro- 
fessed scientific Egyptologists, has 
done this minister no credit, as they 
have not agreed, but have rendered 
diverse and contradictory opinions 
as to the interpretation of the pic- 
ture plates published in connection 
with the Book of Abraham, by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

During a recent visit here of Gen- 
eral Washington Gardner, the Com- 
mander-in-chief of the Grand Army 
of the Republic of the United 
States, I had the pleasure of meet- 
ing that gentleman on several occa- 
sions, and by his invitation accom- 
panied him to Fort Douglas, with 
other members of the Utah divi- 
sion of the Garnd Army. During 
our short visit to the post, Gen- 
eral Gardner became acquainted 
with the commanding officer at the 
post, and some of his associates, 
and also was received and feated 
here by different political and lo- 
cal organizations. I noticed, on the 
occasions when he was as an hon- 
ored guest of these societies, when 
refreshments were offered to him. 
in the shape of cigars, wine, or 
strong drink of any kind, he invar- 
iably refused such things. After 
we had passed out of one of the 
gatherings. I said to him, "You 
never smoke. General?" "Never, 
never smoked a cigar in my life." 
"I notice that you also refused wine, 
or strong drink?" "I never drink 
wine, or beer, or liquor of any kind, 
nor use tobacco in any shape or 
form." T was exceedingly gratified 
by his statements on this matter, and 
I felt to congratulate him in the 
abstemious life that he had led. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



attribute his excellent physical con- 
dition, and bodily health, as a re- 
sult of his proper habits of life. 
He seemed to be a perfect embodi- 
ment of a soldier and a gentleman. 
He requested that I arrange, if pos- 
sible, a meeting fo.r him with Pres- 
ident Smith. I was enabled to do 
this, through the courtesy of Pres- 
ident Smith, and when we left the 
president's office by the general's 
request, I conducted him to Presi- 
dent Brigham Young's grave. Gen- 
eral ' Gardner said that he recog- 
nized in the great pioneer of the 
"Mormon" people a very able gen- 
eral, a man of marked ability, dis- 
played in leading his people to this 
land, then a desert, and the suc- 
cess that they have achieved in- es- 
tablishing great cities and commu- 
nities in this distant mountain re- 
gion. He also requested me to fur- 
nish him some literature of the 
Church. I made this request known 
to President Smith, and he said, 
"Select the textbooks of the Church, 
in as nice form as you. can find them, 
and bring them to the office ;" 
this was done and in the books he 
placed his autograph. The selec- 
tion consisted of the Old and New 
Testaments, King James' transla- 
tion — in an elegent cover of limp 
morocco; the Book of Covenants, 
combining also the Pearl of Great 
Price ; and the Book of Mormon, in 
similar binding. In these three vol- 
umes President Smith placed his au- 
tograph, ' artd when I presented the 
books from President Smith to Gen- 
eral Gardner he expressed himself 
as much delighted with the present. 
He added, "As soon as I return 
home,' or as soon as I have the op- 
portunity, I' pledge you my wOrd 
I will read these books and note 
their contents 1 carefully. ' I wish 
you would return, my sincere thanks 



to President Smith, and to your peo- 
ple generally, for the kindness they 
have shown to me since my arrival 
here in Utah. And," said he, "I 
never have received, in any state 
of the Union, a reception so grand, 
so heartily tendered, or more accep- 
table to me, as I have here in Utah, 
and especially in Salt Lake City. 
The large number of school children 
who appeared in the parade, and the 
numbers you have enrolled in your 
schools, is a revelation to me of your 
great prospects for the future." 

I bear my testimony to you to- 
day, my brethren and sisters, that 
Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet 
of God. The Lord designated him 
as the Prophet of the last dispensa- 
tion, and committed to him the keys 
of His kingdom. He stands as the 
president, prophet, seer and reve- 
lator of this the dispensation of the 
fulness of times. Although he suf- 
fered a martyr's death, many years 
ago, the work of the Lord has con- 
tinued in the hands of the able men 
who have been inspired by the same 
prophetic ministry, and today our 
leaders are inspired and blest with 
the spirit of their calling and mis- 
sion. I testify to you that "Mor- 
monism" is true, and that the glory 
of God's Kingdom will be realized; 
and, if the people are faithful, they 
will be partakers of the excellent 
results that shall come to them by 
keeping the commandments of the 
Lord. God bless you forever, my 
brethren and sisters, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. . 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

On one occasion a woman 
brought her two sons into the pres- 
ence of the Christ, and asked for 
them an appointment from the Mas- 
ter, that one might sit upon His 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



101 



right hand and the other upon His 
left when He should come in His 
kingdom. Jesus inquired of these 
candidates for this high honor 
if they were able to drink of 
the cup that He must drink of, 
and be baptized with the bap- 
tism which He must be baptized 
with, and they expressed confi- 
dence in their ability to do that. 
He finally told them that they 
should indeed have that honor, but 
to say who should sit upon His 
right hand and upon His left was 
not His to give, but it should be 
given to those who should be ap- 
pointed of God His Father. The 
course pursued by these two breth- 
ren and their mother greatly in- 
censed the rest of the disciples, and 
I presume they made their vexation 
known, whereupon Christ called 
them all into His presence, and He 
said unto them : 

"Ye know that the princes ot the 
gentiles exercise dominion over them, 
and they that are great exercise au- 
thority upon them. 

"But it shall not be so among you; 
but whosoever will be great among 
you, let him be your minister; 

"And whosoever will be chief among 
you, let him be your servant; 

"Even as the Son of man came not 
to be ministered unto, but to minis- 
ter, and to give His life a ransom for 
many." (St. Matt. 20:25-28.) 

This circumstance and these in- 
structions connected with it mark 
off in sharp contrast the nature of 
the kingdom of the Christ and the 
kingdoms of this world. In one is 
the mastery by domination, of rule 
by what men call "effective govern- 
ment," which rests on force ; in the 
other, in the kingdom of the Christ, 
is pre-eminence through service 
and the rule of what men call "mor- 
al government," which has for its 
high principles, rule through knowl- 



edge, persuasion, love. One is the 
authority of force ; the other is the 
authority of persuasion. The one 
ministers to pride, in him who ex- 
ercises it, the other begets true 
meekness. 

On another occasion one came to 
the Messiah and would know what 
was the greatest commandment, 
and the Christ made a reply which 
in effect set forth that love of God 
and love of man were the two great 
commandments on which hung all 
the law and all the prophets ; in- 
deed, the Master blended them into 
one great and first law of the king- 
dom of heaven, circumscribing all 
other laws. It is pretty generally 
recognized that love of man and 
love of God is most effectively, and 
perhaps only effectively, expressed 
in terms of service for man and 
service for God. Yet we should be 
reminded by the saying of Paul that 
God is not worshiped by men's 
hands, as if He needed anything, 
seeing He giveth to all life and 
breath; so that about the only 
way in which men can effectively 
express their love for God is 
through service to the children of 
God, to men. ■ 

Of late my labors as one of the 
assistant historians in the Church 
have led me over the field where 
the membership of the Church of 
Christ are seen rendering great ser- 
vice to each other and to the world ; 
and it seems to me that we all to- 
day may be instructed and encour- 
aged by contemplation of some of 
that service that the Church in days 
past has rendered unto the children 
of men. 

I observe, in my historical work, 
that some hand has so shaped the 
destinies of the Latter-day Saints 
that they, have been very much em- 
ployed in rendering service to each 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other, and to the world. Of course, 
the reception of the great truths 
that God revealed in the early days 
of the Church to the Prophet and 
his associates, as soon as the Church 
was organized, and the Priesthood 
began to take on something like 
regular form, and began the exer- 
cise of its functions, there was first 
of all the duty of making proclama- 
tion of those things that had been 
received, the Gospel, to those by 
whom the Saints were surrounded, 
and the organization of the first few 
branches of the Church took place. 
Then, in obedience to this principle 
of service, a mission to the Laman- 
ites was projected, and a number of 
brethren, headed by Oliver Cow- 
dery, began the missionary work of 
the Church, being sent first to the 
Lamanites, the remnants of the old 
races of the land. They began their 
westward journey, visiting Indian 
tribes by the way, until they reached 
Kirtland, where they halted, condi- 
tions being favorable to build up a 
church, and then continued their 
mission to the frontiers of the Unit- 
ed States, where there had been 
gathered many thousands of the 
remnants of the land, and to them 
they made their appeal with the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, thus render- 
ing service in the work of the min- 
istry to that fallen people. 

Meantime, western Missouri had 
been designated by revelation as 
the place for the gathering of the 
Saints, and to this point the Saints 
in the East began moving. The 
Colesville branch moved bodily, and 
those who had means in that branch 
very generously assisted those who 
had no means to make that very 
great journey overland from New 
York by way of Kirtland, to the 
frontiers of the United States, then 
in western Missouri. So that they 



found it necessary to bear each 
other's burdens and to 'assist each 
other in this first effort at gathering 
to the center place of Zion. 

After three years the inhabitants 
of western Missouri rose up against 
the Saints and expelled them from 
Jackson county, twelve hundred 
men, women and children, stripped 
of their possessions and compelled 
to bivouac on the Missouri bottoms 
in an inclement season of the year. 
Appeal was made to the eastern 
branches to give service to these un- 
fortunate brethren and sisters, and 
to relieve them in their distress. 
Men were called upon to make a 
march from the eastern branches 
to western Missouri to do what 
they could to reinstate these ex- 
iles to their lands and to their 
homes. And thus these circum- 
stances contributed to bringing to 
pass the service of one part of the 
people of God to the other part who 
were in distress. 

Five years later a mightier upris- 
ing took place against the Latter-day 
Saints in Missouri, and this time, 
instead of twelve hundred being ex- 
iled, between twelve and fifteen 
thousand were dispossessed of their 
lands, and exiled ; and in these cir- 
cumstances the Saints were again 
called upon to make sacrifices for 
and to assist each other in bearing 
these heavy burdens that had come 
upon them by reason of their perse- 
cutions. There were, during that 
period of time, some wonderful men 
developed, men who acquired wis- 
dom by reason of the experiences 
forced upon them. Those were days 
of education, these experiences led 
to the development of the future 
leaders in Israel, who, by an' 1 by, 
were going to take part i- ■> till 
greater exodus than that which 
had taken place from Miss- ?ix

or seven years after this expulsion 
from Missouri, a still greater ex- 
pulsion took place, expatriation, in 
fact , from the confines of the 
United States, about twenty thou- 
sand people were this time exiled 
from the State of Illinois and the 
surrounding states, and compelled 
to begin that wonderful march west- 
ward, which is the astonishment of 
our age in its great achievement, in 
the wisdom manifest in conducting 
the great exodus; under the in- 
spired leadership of the apostles of 
God that great body of people were 
converted into an industrial column, 
which marched through the state of 
Iowa, and under circumstances the 
most discouraging, demonstrated its 
power to be self-sustaining, and by 
its industry and mutual sacrifices 
Israel was preserved, though in his 
tents and in traveling wagon trains. 

It is one of the most wonderful 
spectacles of American history, this 
community on wheels, yet held to- 
gether in solidarity, and effective- 
ness of working power, keeping up 
a system of government which pro- 
tected the community in its rights, 
and preserved them as an orderly 
people. The wonder of that will 
grow more and more as we become 
further and further removed from 
it, and look upon it from a true per- 
spective, and realize its mighty 
achievements. 

Finally, coming to the frontiers of 
the United States, there was the 
stretch of a thousand miles of wil- 
derness, through which this great 
people must be brought. The pio- 
neer company made its dash into the 
wilderness and led the way, and es- 
tablished itself here in these moun- 
tains. No sooner established here 
than it began the work of carrying 
out the great covenant that had been 
made in the temple of God, among 



the leaders of this people, before 
their departure from the City Beau- 
tiful, on the banks of the Father of 
W aters — Nauvoo ; a covenant which 
bound those entering into it never 
to cease their efforts until every 
faithful member of the Church who 
desired to gather' to the new home 
— yet to be founded — never to cease 
their efforts until every member of 
the Church desiring it, should be 
brought to the new gathering place 
of the Church. And this covenant 
the people kept, and through about 
eight or ten years the work of gath- 
ering that remnant from the banks 
of the Missouri continued until I 
believe the covenant of the people 
of God was kept, and kept by sacri- 
fice, kept by continuous, unselfish 
service, which bore record of the 
love of God that was in the hearts 
of the Latter-day Saints of that 
period. 

While doing this wonderful 
thing of transplanting a great 
people from the East through a 
thousand miles of wilderness to 
the W est, the work of preaching the 
Gospel to the world was still cheer- 
fully carried on. No sooner had 
the nucleus been established in this 
Salt Lake and adjoining valleys, 
than the Church seemed to be awak- 
ened, especially in the year 1849, to 
that responsibility that always rests 
upon the Church of Christ, viz., to 
make known the truths of the Gos- 
pel to other people; for when this 
Gospel was restored to the earth 
in the new dispensation, it came 
with the spirit that was in the mis- 
sion of that angel who restored it, 
of whom it is said, when describing 
his advent to the earth in the last 
days, .he came "having the ever- 
lasting Gospel, which was to be 
preached to every nation and kin- 
dred and tongue and people," and 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I say, no sooner had the feet of our 
people been planted in these valleys 
than an awakening seemed to come 
to the Church, and a very wonder- 
ful thing happened, and a very 
great manifestation was given to 
the world, of the existence of the 
love of God in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints, by their willing- 
ness to to serve their fellow men. 
The year 1849 is perhaps in 
many respects the most won- 
derful year of our experience. 
Judge ye of it as I outline what was 
begun in that year. At the October 
conference of 1849, Brother Charles 
C. Rich, one of the Twelve Apos- 
tles, was called to join Amasa Ly- 
man, already in California, to as- 
sist him in gathering up and locat- 
ing the Latter-day Saints upon the 
Pacific coast, and to institute disci- 
pline in their midst, and so far as 
possible hold them together in 
groups until a gathering place could 
be established convenient for them. 
Before these two brethren com- 
pleted their mission they made the 
purchase of the San Bernardino 
ranch of between 80,000 and 100,- 
000 acres of the choicest part of 
southern California. The presiding 
brethren in Zion-here designed that 
there should be established a line of 
settlements, of which the one upon 
the coast would be the terminus, 
and from that through the eight 
hundred miles between here and 
there should be a line of settlements 
established, which would afford a 
line of travel that should be shorter 
and safer than the one across the 
plains, through the great tribes of 
Indians inhabiting those plains. 

That same conference appointed 
an apostle to carry the Gospel to 
the people of France, Elder John 
Taylor received the appointment. 
His work extended also into Ger- 



many, and before his return he su- 
perintended the translation and the 
publication of the Book of Mor- 
mon, both into the French and into 
the German language. 

At that same conference, Octo- 
ber, 1849, Lorenzo Snow was called 
to establish the work in Italy. He 
was successful in his mission, and 
the work extended from there to> 
Switzerland, and acting under the 
advice of his fellow apostles in Eng- 
land, missionaries under his direc- 
tion were sent to India, and the 
work began in that distant land. 

In addition to this that great 
apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Erastus Snow, was sent to the 
Scandinavian people, and he estab- 
lished a mission in that land and 
had translated the Book of Mormon 
into that language. That mission 
has been continuous and fruitful 
from that day until the present 
time. 

That year, also, Addison Pratt, 
after being taken up here to the 
summit of what, to me, is a sacred 
mountain, Ensign Peak, where he 
received the holy ordinances of the 
house of God, he returned upon his 
mission to the islands of the sea. It 
is possible in this hurried survey 
that I may have omitted some of 
the missions that started in that 
year of grace, 1849, but if I have I 
will beg leave to print them in the 
record of this conference. 

[Elder Orson Pratt had been sent 
to England in 1848 to take charge 
of the British Mission. The Octo- 
ber conference of 1849 appointed. 
Elder Franklin D. Richards to join 
him in his ministry, so that these 
appointments are connected with 
the period here considered. Elder 
Pratt held the presidency of the 
British Mission from August, 1848, 
to January, 1851. As Elder Rich- 



ELDER BRIG HAM. H. ROBERTS. 



105 



ards arrived in England in March, 
1850, Elder Pratt had his assistance 
about ten months, and during the 
presidency of Orson Pratt, aided by 
Elder Richards to the extent of time 
noted, the Millennial Star increased 
in circulation from 3,700 to 22,000 ; 
5,000 were emigrated from the 
British Mission to America, and 
21,000 were brought into the 
Church.] 

I merely wanted to call your at- 
tention to enough that was done at 
that time, to show you what great 
service the Church of Christ was 
giving to the world by sending these 
apostles, strong in the Spirit of God, 
and in their labors reflecting the 
spirit of the mission of their Mas- 
ter, in carrying the message that 
had been given to the Church, to 
all the nations of the earth. I select 
this year in which to point out these 
things to you because it stands in 
such marked contrast to the spirit 
of the world manifested at that par- 
ticular time; and what the spirit of 
the world would lead men to do un- 
der the circumstances in which these 
men wrought out their service for 
their fellow men and for God. 

The year 1849, you remember, 
was the year of the gold discovery 
in California. A Mormon, albeit, 
not a very faithful one by that time, 
but nevertheless a Mormon elder 
(Samuel Brannan), taking a vial 
of gold dust in one hand, and 
swinging his hat with the other, 
rushed down the streets of San 
Francisco, crying, "Gold ! gold ! 
gold from the American River !" 
His cry of gold in a few days 
emptied San Francisco. Lawyers 
left their offices, merchants left 
their business, physicians left their 
patients, in a mad rush for the 
American River at the magic cry of 
"Gold ;" and pretty soon that cry of 



"Gold' echoed and re-echoed, not 
only through the states of our own 
nation, but even in foreign lands, 
and presently the world witnessed 
a mad rush from every direction 
and from nearly all lands, for the 
gold fields of California. They went 
in various ways, some of them by 
the way of the Isthmus of Panama, 
leaving the Atlantic and crossing 
the isthmus to the Pacific, and com- 
ing up the coast to San Francisco 
Bay. Others came overland; some 
of them went by the northern route, 
Bear River Valley and Fort Hall. 
About twenty thousand of them, in 
the summer of 1849, passed 
through our then little frontier vil- 
lage of Salt Lake City. But while 
the world was thus going mad in 
this rush for gold, and all seemed 
bound for the golden shores of Cal- 
ifornia, here in these new frontier 
settlements of ours, where we were 
so near the new "Eldorado," the 
Church of Christ was sending men 
eastward, not for gold, but seeking 
the souls of men and the salvation 
and redemption of the world! 

Does it not stand out in marked 
contrast, this difference between the 
selfish spirit that moves men and 
the Spirit of God that moves the ser- 
vants of God in the accomplishment 
of His work? And we give in our 
history this magnificent proof that 
this little people at that time, robbed 
and peeled repeatedly of all they 
possessed, and while yet making- 
their weary way to these valleys, a 
thousand miles from the frontiers 
of our country, yet they gave this 
magnificent evidence of love of 
God that was in their hearts, and 
that kind of work, that manifesta- 
tion of love of God, through service 
to man, has been going on in vari- 
ous degrees from that time until the 
present time. There has never been 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a time, there has never been years 
of dearth, when the Church of 
Christ has not given that kind of 
service to the inhabitants of the 
earth, that evidence of love of God 
and love of man. 

In the first years of our experi- 
ence in these mountains — Pardon 
me, please ; I have formed that 
habit of calling these things "ours," 
although, of course, they were hap- 
pening before I was born, but I 
have lived so much in these things 
that it seems to me that I have been 
a member of the Church from the 
day it was organized until now, and 
so you must pardon me if, unwit- 
tingly, I identify myself with these 
movements. 

Well, through the first years of 
our experience, then, as a Church, in 
bringing the people from foreign 
lands and from our own land to 
these mountains, the method at first 
was to bring them to the Missouri 
frontiers, to purchase cattle and 
wagons in the east, and then giving 
to the companies men of more or 
less experience to pilot them to the 
valleys of the mountains. In 1860, 
however, a circumstance happened 
to change that system, and widened, 
as you will see in a moment, wid- 
ened the field for service unto the 
people of God. In that year, 1860, 
Brother Joseph W. Young, a neph- 
ew of President Young, a man of 
rare skill and ability as a plains cap- 
tain, took a train of twenty-nine 
wagons from our valley after 
freight, and made the journey to 
the Missouri River and back again 
the same season, with the same 
teams. It occurred to President 
Young that if Joseph W. Young 
could successfully do that, it could 
be done by others and in other years 
as well as in 1860. The poor who 
were desirous of coming to Zion 



could be sent for from these val- 
leys and brought back by the same 
teams. The community had more 
teams and wagons than it had 
money to expend for this purpose, 
and therefore this new system of 
emigrating the poor from the Mis- 
souri frontiers was inaugurated. 
Brother Joseph W.Young preached 
on the stand after his return, early 
in October of the year 1860 — he 
preached a discourse on what he 
called "A Treatise on Ox-Team- 
ology," or the art of so treating cat- 
tle that they would be able to make 
a journey to the Missouri River and 
back again without materially in- 
juring them. And so from then 
until the advent of the railroad into 
our valley the work of bringing the 
immigrating poor was carried on 
in that manner ; and the amount of 
it, when you come to group it to- 
gether, is really surprising. Listen : 
In 1861 two hundred wagons 
with four yoke of oxen to the 
wagon, divided into four com- 
panies, with about two hun- 
dred and fifty men performed 
the service, in the year 1861. In 
1862, two hundred and sixty-two 
wagons were sent to the frontier, 
divided into six companies ; there 
were two hundred and ninety-three 
men, two thousand eight hundred 
and eighty oxen, the trains taking 
with them the provisions necessary 
both for the journey to the east and 
the return journey with the emi- 
grants to the west. 

In 1863, three hundred and 
eighty-four wagons, divided into 
ten companies, were sent to the 
Missouri River ; there were four 
hundred and eighty-eight men, 
three thousand six hundred and 
four oxen. Ten captains were nec- 
essary to conduct the trains. 

In 1864 one hundred and seventy 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



107 



wagons were sent, one thousand 
seven hundred and seventeen oxen, 
and two hundred and seventy-seven 
men were engaged in that service 
that year. 

In 1865, as a consequence of local 
conditions, no teams were sent east, 
but in 1866 three hundred and nine- 
ty-seven wagons were sent, and 
sixty-two more wagons were auth- 
orized to be purchased when the 
trains arrived in the East. There 
were four hundred and fifty-six 
teamsters, and forty-nine guards- 
men, mounted, with eighty-nine 
horses, one hundred and thirty-four 
mules, three thousand and forty-two 
oxen. In addition to that, a relief 
train had to be sent to meet the in- 
coming emigrants. 

In 1867, no ox teams were sent 
to the East, but in 1868 an extraor- 
dinary effort was made to gather 
the poor. Seventy thousand dollars 
was raised in this community to 
help gather the poor, and five hun- 
dred wagons, in ten companies, 
went to the railroad terminus, and 
that year about four thousand of 
poor Saints, chiefly from the Brit- 
ish Isles, were brought across the 
mountains and into this city. 

This service was rendered, not 
for earthly reward, but was gratui- 
tous service to fellow men, service 
to the poor, who needed the help. 
In those years when this little com- 
munity was engaged in that great, 
generous work, the people in for- 
eign nations wanting lands were 
brought from afar to lands wanting 
hands, and from that emigration 
hundreds and thousands, redeemed 
from poverty and the workshops of 
the old world, were brought here 
and made the land owners in the 
new west, in the commonwealth of 
Utah. 

I want to halt long enough to pay 



just a little tribute of appreciation 
to this kind of service. Rough ser- 
vice it was, involving exposure to 
storms and to fatigue and danger, 
to nights of watchfulness, to ex- 
posure from Indian attacks, to con- 
stant labor clay by day, to exposure 
to inclement seasons and hardships, 
that brought many of those who 
rendered this high service to God 
and fellow men to a crippled and 
decrepit, premature old age. I 
want to express my gratitude, as 
one who received benefits from this 
kind of service, rendered by this 
noble body of men who year after 
\er* gave their service that the poor 
might be gathered, and to say that 
this service has been and is as ac- 
ceptable, in my judgment, to Al- 
mighty God as the more genteel 
service, if you please to regard it 
so, of preaching the Gospel among 
the nations of the earth. Every 
service that is rendered to humanity 
in the name of God is holy service 
in the sight of God, no matter how 
rough it may be, or how uncoiuh 
may be those who render it. And I 
want to say a word for that brave 
band of men who were the plains 
captains during these days — noble 
men they were, generals in their 
sphere, wise and courageous and 
worthy of all honor in the Church 
of the Christ, loved of God, blessed 
of Him, because they gave forth 
evidence that they loved God and 
loved fellow men, and gave the best 
of evidence of the fact in that they 
served, at great self-sacrifice and in 
the midst of constant danger — their 
fellow men and God. 

Not only was the Church in these 
years called upon for that kind of 
service, but the Church, at least the 
citizens of Utah — and in the years 
of which I am speaking they con- 
stituted the Church, because we 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



were nearly all "Mormons" in those 
days, and the citizenship of our ter- 
ritory was practically "Mormon ;" 
so when we say citizens in those 
days we mean the Church, practical- 
ly. Well, they were not only called 
upon to do the kind of service just 
described, but they were called upon 
also to do other service, namely, to 
protect themselves and each other 
against the wrath and jealousy and 
savagery of the Indian tribes by 
whom they were surrounded. When 
the outbreak came which marked 
the beginning of what is called in 
our annals the "Black Hawk War," 
the people appealed to the governor 
of the state, and through the gov- 
ernor of the state and the Indian 
agents — at that time Colonel O. H. 
Irish and Colonel F. H. Head — 
these agents appealed to the United 
States military authorities, for as- 
sistance. When Colonel Irish made 
the application to the authorities at 
Camp Douglas he was told by the 
officer commanding that if the dis- 
turbances were away from the mail 
routes and the telegraph lines he 
had no authority to render the as- 
sistance. In the other case the of- 
ficer commanding, when appealed 
to by Colonel Head, said he would 
refer it to the military authorities in 
the east, and at that time General 
Sherman was in command of the 
western department. When the 
question was put up to him he an- 
swered that the people must depend 
upon themselves to make the In- 
dians behave at Salina. And so, 
not being granted the assistance 
and protection properly asked for, 
we had to rely upon our own peo- 
ple — the Latter-day Saints — to aid 
each other. According to the re- 
port that was made by Colonel John 
R. Winder to the commanding gen- 
eral of the Utah militia, and which 



finally Adjutant General H. B. 
Clawson presented to the secretary 
of war, when asking for reimburse- 
ment for this service — according to 
those reports five hundred men 
were called into the field against 
the Indians for three months, in 
1865. In 1866 two thousand five 
hundred men were called, many of 
them from the northern counties, 
to go to the assistance of the south- 
ern counties, and they served for 
six months. In 1867, one thousand 
five hundred were called into the 
service, also for six months. This 
is the kind of service that the coun- 
ties in the north were called upon 
to render to the brethren in distress 
in the south. The 'aggregate of this 
service, as computed by soldier ser- 
vice generally, amounted to $1,121,- 
000. The legislature memorailized 
Congress for an appropriation of 
$1,500,000 to cover these expenses. 
We petitioned, and have pleaded 
for this measure of justice, but so 
far in vain ; and so we will have to 
charge it up to the account of ser- 
vice unrewarded, so far as this 
wCrld is concerned, service given 
willingly and involving great risks 
on the part of those who gave it, 
for the assistance of fellow men of 
the household of faith. 

Well, of course — I beg your par- 
don, I had no idea so much time 
had elapsed — but let me, in conclu- 
sion, make this brief application of 
all this, for surely there would be 
no reason of speaking of it if one 
did not have an application for it. 
Briefly, then, in conclusion; the 
days of emigrating the poor by 
means of ox teams, the days of fur- 
nishing the teams and the drivers 
and the supplies for that service, are 
past; the days of fighting the In- 
dians are past ; but the obligation of 
service to the world continues to 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



109 



rest upon the Church of Christ. The 
form of the service may have 
changed, but the need of it and the 
obligation of it remain. I tell you 
what we have been trying to do 
among our quorums of seventies, 
we have been preaching with more 
or less earnestness the necessity of 
seventies making sacrifice for the 
work of God. Of course, the 
Saints are making very great sac- 
rifice in the way of means and the 
service of men in preaching the 
Gospel abroad. But what we need, 
in my judgment, for the mission 
fields of the world, is men of more 
mature years, men of experience, to 
go upon second and third missions, 
in order to "age up" somewhat the 
various missions of the Church, and 
to give a more seasoned ministry to 
the world, and thereby also a more 
effective ministry. This will involve 
our seventies in making sacrifices, 
but if we make sacrifices for the 
work of God, be assured the work is 
worthy of all that we can give to it 
in the way of sacrifice and service, 
and we want to keep the record of 
our service to fellow men up to as 
high a standard of efficiency and 
largeness as it has been in the past. 
The Lord bless you. Amen.

ple souls who stray, was sung, as a

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

President Smith desired me to 
read this letter, signed by James 
.M. Kirkham, chairman of the Utah 
Development League: 

President Joseph F. Smith, Salt 
LakV City, Utah: 

Dear Brother Smith : Referring to 
the clean town contest which I talked 



with you about, the committee who 
has this matter in charge is trying to 
create a spirit among all the cities and 
towns of this state to clean up and 
beautify their homes and surround- 
ings. To do this a clean town contest 
has been planned. Although the Utah 
Development league, which consists 
of a central organization of all the 
commercial clubs of the state, are 
taking the lead in the matter, we hope 
to bring into active service in this 
campaign all the different societies and 
civic clubs, schools, agricultural clubs, 
and those who have in charge the city 
beautiful movement and vacant lot 
campaign. 

I do not know of a greater service 
that can be done the state than this 
movement properly carried out. The 
scoring of the different towns will be 
done by some person from outside the 
state in order that there can be no 
question of favoritism. 

Of the 100 points about 65 will be 
for sanitary conditions, while the re- 
maining 35 points will be for, physical 
conditions. This movement can be 
successful only by the united -co-oper- 
ation of every one. 

The fly crusade will be part of the 
general scheme in the state-wide clean 
up. 

Each town will be asked to arrange 
for a suitable prize for the cleanest 
back yard, stables, corrals and general 
surroundings, also prizes for the most 
beautiful flower garden and lawns, etc. 

We hope to create civic pride even 
among those who are now leaders and 
in this way arouse the dormant peo- 
ple who have not taken part in a 
movement of this kind before. 

The state board of health is respon- 
sible for the statement that several 
hundred deaths could be prevented if 
proper sanitary conditions existed. Be- 
sides this there is the misery and suf- 
fering of many people who do not die 
but who become subject to sickness 
be'--'"se of contagious diseases. 

The towns of the state will be di- 
vided into five classes according to the 
ponrlation.- the suitable nrizes will be 
given to each city in its class that 
scores the highest. 

Commencing with April 11th many 
of the largest towns have planned for 
r> whole week of clean up. Wed n es- 
rlpir April. 15th. which is Arbor Dnv 
be set aside as a special day in 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this movement. Governor William 
bpry will issue a proclamation to that 
etfect. Mayor Park and . leaders in 
other cities will issue similar procla- 
mations asking t\\c people that they 
hold meetings and programs, emphas- 
izing the importance of a general 
clean up throughout the state. 

This week will be the beginning of 
what we hope will be a general clean 
up program to be carried on through- 
out the year. The value of cleanliness 
1 shall not presume to discuss, because 
you know that cleanliness is a part of 
Godliness. 

1 want to assure you that any assis- 
tance you can give us in the way of 
indorsing this movement and saying 
something to emphasize its import- 
ance when you have an opportunity 
will be greatly apprecated. 
Very truly, 

In behalf of the Committee. 
James M. Kirkham, 

Chairman. 

I am very thankful this morn- 
ing, notwithstanding the condition 
of my physical body, that I have 
been busily engaged cleaning up 
my own door-yard. I could not 
get the boy to do it, so I got busy 
and did it myself. (Laughter.) I 
am pretty near dead tired as a re- 
sult of it; but I am grateful, for 
this suggestion to the Latter-day 
Saints, as to the "Clean town Con- 
test." 

In our beauitful Utah many of 
the homes and farms are old fash- 
ioned. There is very little intense 
farming. Some people declare that 
nearly everybody is slipshod, barns, 
houses, outbuldings are fast going 
to ruin. The front yards are weed- 
grown, the fences down and hid by 
weeds, no flowers, no lawns, no 
vegetable gardens, no family orch- 
ards, and if there is, the trees are 
old, sickly and neglected. The fact 
is, no more beautiful valley, no bet- 
ter place has God's people ever 
found. No people have been more 
greatly favored during last year, as 



to climate. The past winter has 
been unexecelled, it has been just 
lovely. There is no need to go to 
California, or to the East, North, 
or South. I have made enquiries, 
and am posted. As the saying is,' 
we have all countries and climates 
"skinned to death." 

What we need is old time enthu- 
siasm. We should make a strong 
appeal to the rising generation and 
get the boys and girls to use their 
heads, and go to work with their 
hands. We need practical educa- 
tion, ambition, push. The whole 
family ought to work, none should 
be ashamed of work, but all should 
roll up their sleeves and dig. The 
key of success is: "We're not 
afraid of work." There should be 
no aged father or mother bent 
with hard work, who could say: 
Our boys and girls are educated 
so much that they go away from 
the home and farm. The ranch and 
farm just about keep me and the 
old lady now that the children are 
gone. We appeal to their children 
to give them a lift occasionally. 
Let the cry go out to all, and create 
a desire among the citizens of our 
cities and towns to clean up and' 
beautify the old homesteads and 
surroundings. Certain it is that 
some of our homes, outbuildings 
and fences need whitewashing 
awfully bad. 

I visited my mother's home town 
in Hopewell. New Jersey, in 1884, 
and I found there was no home, no- 
outbuilding, no fence that was not 
painted, or whitewashed. 

Now, brethren and sisters, 
awake, and make a good try-out in 
following this suggestion. No great- 
er blessing can come to this people 
than a thorough and general cleans- 
ing of homes and surroundings. 
The Lord bless you all. Amen.

There is beauty all around, 

When there's love at home; 
There is joy in ev'ry sound, 

When there's love at home. 
Peace and plenty here abide, 
Smiling sweet on ev'ry side, 
Time doth softly, sweetly glide, 
When there's love at home.

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
my dependence upon the Lord this 
afternoon, more than I ever did 
before, it seems to me, and I sin- 
cerely hope that the Lord will favor 
me with His Spirit to say a few 
beneficial words while I stand before 
you. 

T have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
snirit of this conference. Tt has 
been to me faith-promoting. When 
President Smith was speaking at the 
opening session, I recognized the 



spirit of inspiration which rested 
upon him. The high standard, that 
has been raised up in this dispen- 
sation of the Lord's providences un- 
to His people, is something worthy 
of consideration by all the peoples 
of the earth. It seems to me that 
in the life of our Redeemer the ex- 
ample was set for all mankind, and 
whereas we may fall short of those 
perfections which were illustrated 
in His divine life, nevertheless we 
have a standard raised up by which 
we are to be measured. In order 
that we may approach His perfec- 
tions, the Gospel has been delivered 
to the children of men, and in it we 
have been admonished to be perfect 
even as our Father in heaven is 
perfect. No one realizes more than 
I do myself the weaknesses by which 
we are beset at every hand. Some- 
times we hear one say that we ought 
not to preach anything that we do 
not practice. It seems to me that 
that is not altogether correct, but 
I do endorse the doctrine that we 
ought not to preach anything that 
we do not try to do, even though we 
may not completely succeed in com- 
ing to that degree of excellence. We 
should preach Christ and Him cru- 
cified. We should preach the ex- 
cellence of His life, whether or not 
we are able to come up to His stand- 
ard completely. We are living in a 
world of sin. We are exposed to 
the temptations of the world. We 
have our weaknesses and our imper- 
fections. Nevertheless we have de- 
livered unto us the power of God 
unto salvation, and that power of 
God is the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and obedience to that will 
perfect us in our lives. Neverthe- 
less there is sin in the world, and 
none of us are perfect. We have 
our weaknesses and our imperfec- 
tions, but we ought not to glory in 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them. We ought not to think that 
they are justified, or that we are 
justified in doing anything that is 
wrong. We are only in the right at- 
titude when we are engaged in the 
fight against sin. 

It is a great warfare that is being 
carried on in this world. It is the 
power of God versus the power of 
the adversary. It is truth versus 
error. It is righteousness against 
sin ; and only he has his feet plant- 
ed in the straight and narrow way 
that is striving and endeavoring to 
overcome his weaknesses and im- 
perfections. Neither ought we to 
judge one another, and think be- 
cause some one may not be as near 
perfect as we consider ourselves to 
be, that he is therefore lost. Each 
man and each woman, each child 
of God has his own battle to fight. 
They have their own environment in 
which they move. They have the 
particular training that they have 
received from their parents. Some 
have had greater advantages than 
others ; and we are not in a position 
to judge any one. We are scarcely 
able to judge even ourselves. But 
we ought to be engaged in fighting 
sin, at the same time being full of 
love and charity towards all men, 
whether they be sinners or not. All 
men are to a certain degree sinners ; 
and this question of sin is to be re- 
garded pretty much in the same 
light as we regard sicknetes and 
disease. We may loathe and hate 
sin and yet be full of love and char- 
ity towards the sinner, just as we 
may loathe and despise disease and 
pain, and at the same time be full 
of love and charity towards those 
who are afflicted; and our purpose 
should be to bring relief both to the 
sinner and to the afflicted. 

There is an analogy between these 
two propositions, between sin and 



sickness. In each case, in both 
cases, it is required that they should 
have proper treatment. In the case 
of a man or a woman who has been 
afflicted with some bodily ailment, 
what a splendid thing it is to call 
someone in who is skilled in the 
art of bringing relief, some physi- 
cian or doctor who can bring relief 
to suffering humanity. It is also 
essential and requisite that those 
who are afflicted with sin should 
have relief brought to them ; and 
what a blessed service it is when 
we can render relief, bring restora- 
tion unto a state of righteousness to 
him that is afflicted with sin. There 
are a great many maladies both 
physical and spiritual. The Lord, 
however, has given a remedy for 
every evil, for every affliction. The 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is 
a panacea for every affliction of the 
soul of man. We ought to prac- 
tice and obey that Gospel, apply it 
to everything in our lives, that we 
may be healed from the afflictions 
of sin. The whole world lieth in 
sin, under the bondage of sin, and 
we are not relieved from that bond- 
age until we shall overcome evil, 
even the sins with which we are 
afflicted. If the Gospel be applied 
to each and every one of us, and 
we obey its principles, its precepts, 
it will heal us spiritually, and finally 
bring us back into the presence of 
God, sound and whole, and free 
every whit from all the contagions 
and diseases of sin that are found 
in the world today. 

My brethren and sisters, I realize 
that the moments here are very 
precious so I will close, and in con- 
clusion let me 1 bear my testimony 
that I know that this Gospel, which 
has been restored in the day and 
age in which we live,- through the 
instrumentality of the prophet Jo- 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



113 



seph Smith, has within it the power 
of God to heal the sick, to heal the 
afflicted, whether it be from sin or 
from . sickness. I pray the Lord 
that He will guide us by His Holy 
Spirit, and finally bring us back into 
His presence, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MTJERIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that the few words I utter upon this 
occasion, may be directed by the 
same good spirit that has been so 
abundantly manifest in the remarks 
that have been made by the breth- 
ren who have been called to speak 
to the people, in the various ses- 
sions of this general conference. 

As I was coming up Main Street 
on Saturday morning, on my way to 
attend the opening session of the 
conference, I joined a brother who 
was also wending his way towards 
this Tabernacle. He smilingly said 
to me, "Well, brother Joseph, I sup- 
pose we are going to have the very 
best conference that has ever been 
held." These words of the brother 
referred to, brought to my mind 
remarks that were made in my hear- 
ing, by one of the counselors in a 
stake presidency, at a stake confer- 
ence that I attended a few months 
ago. He declared in that meeting 
that he felt the stake conference, 
then convened, was one of the best 
they had ever held. After making 
this statement, he said that when 
he returned from Salt Lake City 
after attending the October confer- 
ence last year, his family wanted to 
know what kind of a conference 
had been held, and how he had en- 
joyed himself. His answer was, "It 
was the best conference I have ever 
attended." Then the young peo- 



ple in the home laughed and said, 
"Why, father, you have made that 
statement after every conference 
you have ever attended." I was 
made glad, my brethren and sisters, 
when I listened to that declaration. 
This man was a man of years and 
of long experience. He was en- 
gaged in teaching the Gospel when 
I was a little child, a man under 
whose direction I had come in my 
Sunday School studies in the days 
of my boyhood ; I was made glad in 
my soul that after all the years of 
experience which -he had had in 
the Church, that the doctrines of the 
Gospel were still so sweet that he 
could say, after more than a half a 
century of experience, and after be- 
ing in attendance again and again 
at conference meetings for about 
that length of time — for he has been 
in regular attendance at these con- 
ferences, and he is sitting in this 
congregation this afternoon — that 
this last conference was the best one 
in his experience. I would not be 
at all surprised if he were to report 
when he has opportunity that he has 
again attended the best conference 
he had ever attended. I do not 
know that one conference is really 
better than another; but there is 
something to be very grateful for, 
that at every conference we always 
have a spirit of joy and always feel 
that we have reason for great hap- 
piness. We feel fully satisfied with 
the sound of the Gospel, the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of the Gospel 
that are expounded in our hearing 
at these gatherings and at other 
times even though we may have 
heard them frequently before, they 
are always fresh, they are always 
satisfying, and always fill us with 
gratitude, thanksgiving and praise. 

I attended a conference recently, 
my brethren and sisters, where the 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



stake president reported that an 
earnest effort had been made by the 
ward teachers within the confines 
of that stake during the nine 
months of the year that had then 
passed away, to carry the Gospel 
to the homes of the people resident 
within the stake. The brethren en- 
gaged in this labor had been in- 
structed to visit all the people, not 
only the Latter-day Saints but to 
visit the people who were not of 
our faith. If non-members of the 
Church cared to hear anything in 
relation to the principles of the 
Gospel, the teachers were to ex- 
pound the Gospel to them. If they 
did not want the Gospel, but de- 
sired to unite with the people in 
civic movements, or in other good 
directions in which all the- people 
unite, to talk with them in relation 
to such matters. The president re- 
ported that these teachers were 
well received and as a result of 
their ministry in thus visiting the 
homes of the people, there had been 
over forty adult baptisms in that 
stake during nine months. I thought 
that was a very remarkable and 
commendable report; it was some- 
thing for the brethren who had en- 
gaged in the labor to feel exceed- 
ingly proud of. You know it has 
been written in the revelations that 
have come from our Father in 
heaven in this latter dispensation, 
that if a man were to spend his en- 
tire lifetime in the preaching of the 
word of the Lord, and the result of 
his ministry should be the salvation 
of one soul, how great would be his 
joy with that soul in the kingdom 
of God. I believe in this doctrine. 
I have had some experience in the 
preaching of the Gospel, and now 
and then have discovered that the 
Lord has so used me in teaching 
the way of salvation, that the hearts 



of men have been touched, and a 
few have been brought to investi- 
gate the great message that has 
been revealed from on high for the 
salvation of the human family. ■ I 
know whenever such information 
has come to me it has filled my soul 
with that joy that passes all un- 
derstanding. 

At another conference that I at- 
tended not long ago I heard the 
stake president report the labors of 
missionaries something after the 
manner of the report that was made 
by President Smith, regarding these 
Church activities. This president 
reported that in the stake of Zion 
over which he presided they had 
been utilizing the Seventies and the 
Elders in the preaching of the Gos- 
pel, and that an earnest home mis- 
sionary labor had been accomp- 
lished. These missionaries had 
gone among the people much in the 
same manner as our missionaries go 
abroad in the various missions of 
the world. They had literature to 
deliver to the people. They held 
cottage meetings, and other meet- 
ings, as they had opportunity. They 
taught the principles of the Gospel 
at the fireside, and wherever they 
could make an opening, and in that 
stake of Zion the report was made 
that there had been between forty 
and fifty baptisms of adult persons, 
individuals that were actual con- 
verts from indifference, from the 
religious follies that are in theworld, 
to the truth as it has been revealed. 

I mention these matters for the 
purpose, my brethren and sisters, 
of drawing the attention of men 
who hold responsible and presiding 
positions in the quorums of the Holy 
Priesthood, and particularly to 
those who preside in the quorums 
of the seventy, to the possibility of 
■iving souls here at home, that they

may be alive to the opportunity that 
abounds on every hand for mission- 
ary labor in the stakes of Zion. We 
have a great missionary field right 
here at our doors. Men and wo- 
men in large numbers have been 
drawn from the various nations of 
the earth by the mysterious provi- 
dences of our Father in heaven, and 
have located in the wards and stakes 
of Zion. We should feel that we 
are under responsibility to carry the 
principles of the Gospel to all these 
people who are not of the faith. We 
should be constantly on the alert 
and anxious to formulate plans, 
under proper direction, and proper 
authority, for the spreading of the 
word of the Lord, that those who 
are here within our gates may hear 
the sound of the Gospel and have 
no opportunity in the future, either 
in this time, or in the life that is to 
come, to rise up in judgment against 
us and say, that nothwithstanding 
the precious truth that had been 
committed into our care, and the 
nearness of these men to many who 
hold the priesthood, no effort had 
been made to convert them. I heard 
a stake president say that a neigh- 
bor, a man resident within his stake, 
who was visited when upon his 
death-bed by elders of the Church 
and heard something in relation to 
the principles of the Gospel, he 
wanted, then, to know how it was — 
if the story relative to the restora- 
tion of the Gospel that was being 
told was true, if the heavens had 
been opened, if holy angels had 
come with divine authority and had 
conferred that authority upon men, 
and his neighbors held that author- 
ity — how it was that they had not 
exerted themselves long before to 
make him acquainted with that fact. 
He atmeared, according to the re- 
port of this president, to be con- 



cerned about the matter. He 
seemed to feel that possibly the 
story was true, that God had re- 
vealed Himself ; that the message of 
the everlasting Gospel had been 
committed to men upon the earth ; 
and he was in distress because he 
was conscious of the fact that he 
would not have opportunity to re- 
ceive that message, as he was then 
upon his death-bed. Of course we 
do not know what his feelings 
migh have been under other circum- 
stances ; but we really ought to 
know that the giving of the author- 
ity of the Holy Priesthood is most 
precious, and that with that au- 
thority is a very grave responsibil- 
ity. Men should be earnestly en- 
gaged in seeking to bring to pass 
righteousness, of their own voli- 
tion, by virtue of the agency with 
which God has blessed them, acting 
and laboring always under the au- 
thority of those who preside in the 
local subdivisions of the Church. I 
am very glad to know that there has 
been an unusual effort, during re- 
cent years, to utilize more fully the 
labors of the Seventies and other 
men who hold this precious author- 
ity in the preaching of the word of 
the Lord at home. I trust that 
there is a disposition on the part 
of all these men to recognize lo- 
cal authority ; that there are none 
of them graduates in the sense that 
has been spoken of during this con- 
ference, but that they are all stu- 
dents, that they are all ambitious 
to learn the things of God, that they 
are all anxious to utilize the infor- 
mation that may come to them as 
the result of research and study 
for the advantage and well being 
of their fellows. For it is for this 
purpose that we have been given 
authority. For this purpose God has 
called us to His ministry, and He 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



has laid upon our shoulders the 
responsibility of carrying the mes- 
sage of the Gospel to all men. 

I pray that the priesthood may 
feel this obligation more and more 
right here at home, and that there 
may not be found in any ward, or 
in any stake of Zion, any person not 
a member of the Church who can 
justly say, now or hereafter, that we 
have not appreciated our responsi- 
bility, and that we have not sought 
to magnify our calling in seeking 
after the souls of men in the fear of 
the Lord. May we so utilize our 
time and powers that have been 
committed unto us, that all men 
shall be left without excuse, and 
that we ourselves shall be received 
in due time by our Father in heaven 
with the plaudit, "Well done thou 
good and faithful servant, enter in- 
to the joy of thy Lord." God bless 
us, and help us to be faithful and 
true to the covenants we have made, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. , 

A soprano solo, "Thy will be 
done," was sung by Sister Josie 
Hinckley. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have enjoyed very much, and I 
have no doubt you have also, the 
timely instructions of this confer- 
ence, and I trust that we appreciate 
the importance of the many valu- 
able things already given unto us. 
Yesterday, at one of the overflow 
meetings, I made the assertion with- 
out argument that we had in our 
missionary system one of the best 
sustained efforts of altruism upon 
a large scale, considering the num- 
ber of people that the world in all 
its history has ever seen. I thank 



Brother Roberts for making the ar- 
gument supporting today, the state- 
ment thus made yesterday. 

Some one has said that the king- 
dom of heaven is not for the most 
learned but for the best, and that 
the best is the most unselfish; that 
loving, constant, continuous and 
voluntary self-sacrifice for the good 
of others is the glory of man. 

We might emphasize for a mo- 
ment another phase of that splendid 
chapter of service that was so ably 
reviewed today by Elder B. H. 
Roberts, and that is the effect which 
that service has had upon the in- 
dividuals participating therein, and 
also upon their posterity as well as 
upon those whom they served. The 
result of the efforts of the brethren 
in making that sacrifice in going 
from Kirtland to Missouri in Zion's 
camp but enabled them and others 
to perform in a better way that 
other sacrifice, that other great 
journey which they were to make 
from Missouri to Illionis ; and their 
experience in making that migra- 
tion enabled them to perform in a 
better way the higher sacrifice which 
they were to later make in moving 
from Illinois to the Rocky Moun- 
tains. And the experiences of the 
brethren in making that journey 
across the wilderness of a thousand 
miles enabled them to perform in a 
splendid way that service of colo- 
nization which was so well per- 
formed up and down this chain of 
mountain valleys, and which has 
made of the "Mormon" people, the 
world's foremost colonizers. In 
looking over the audience today and 
seeing here and there individuals 
whom I know have made a sublime 
sacrifice for the good of the Church 
and for the good of others, I felt 
how insignificant is anything that 
I have performed for the Church. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

The Lord, in a revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, said: 
"Wherefore be not weary in well 
doing, for you are laying the foun- 
dation of a great work; and be- 
hold, from things that are small 
proceedeth that which is great." I 
am a great believer in the truth that 
none of these acts of loving service 
and sacrifice can be performed with- 
out there being a permanent re- 
ward, permanent results left. 

In enumerating today, the effort 
put forth in driving the oxen, I 
thought also of that other service 
where men really performed the 
part of oxen in hitching themselves 
to the hand-carts and making the 
same journey across the plains. 
Perhaps they thought in making 
that -wonderful sacrifice that there 
would be no results except their 
passage to the mountains and yet 
an impress has been left upon their 
children and upon their children's 
children that time will not efface. 
I have heard strong men and strong 
women say that when they contem- 
plated the grand sacrifice of their 
father or mother, in making that 
hand-cart journey across the plains, 
they felt that there was no sacrifice 
too great for them to make for the 
Church; that if they were to live 
many years, and be able to crowd 
into each day a hundred times more 
good than they were now accomp- 
lishing that still they would be un- 
worthy of that father and mother 
who had the faith and the courage 
to perform that wonderful work. 
Many of these acts of heroism, the 
fruitage of this wonderful service 
for others, have never been writ- 
ten. Occasionally we hear of some 
of these instances. I was with our 
state superintendent of schools, 
who was recently called home, in 
the last journey that he made to St. 



George, and heard his last speech 
and testimony. He told of his fath- 
er, a convert from that same Scan- 
dinavian country to which Brother 
Erastus Snow was called, indeed 
his people were converts of the 
preaching of brother Erastus Snow. 
Superintendent Nelson told the 
story of how his father waded the 
Sevier river during high water, 
having for his protection a rope 
tied about his body, and held for his 
protection by one of his sons upon 
the shore ; in order to carry a let- 
ter containing the money for the ed- 
ucation of his son to the postoffice. 
upon the other side of the river, 

I was impressed as a boy in read- 
ing of how Leonidas, at the pass of 
Thermopolae with his little band of 
Spartans, had withstood a whole 
army and how he probably would 
have succeeded permanently had it 
not been for a traitor in showing 
the enemy a secret pass around the 
one guarded. I was likewise im- 
pressed with the legendary hero 
Horatius who, at the bridge, kept 
back the Etruscan hordes; but I 
have been more thrilled in reading 
of some of the heroic services of 
our own boys in connection with 
this pioneer work, of the sublime 
service performed by those three 
boys who carried across the Sweet- 
water those same hand-cart people 
who were too emaciated, who were 
too much enfeebled by starvation 
and who were too poorly clad to 
venture into the ice cold water. 
Those boys carried, one by one, that 
large company of hand-cart people 
across that freezing river with its 
ice floes. There are only a few of 
these heroic acts that have been 
put into print. Many of the things 
performed by the pioneer fathers 
and by their pioneer children have 
not yet been written ; but an impress 



Ua 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



has been left upon the world by 
these services of self-sacrifice, and 
from thing's which are small pro- 
ceedeth that which is great. It has 
been particularly true in this mis- 
sionary service. The tracts, in the 
wrecked vessel, have not been per- 
manently destroyed, but they have 
been washed upon the shore to dry, 
and have been read by the inhabit- 
ants of the land, preparing them for 
other Gospel messages to come. 
The text announced before the 
meeting was broken up, the chance 
text announced has found root and 
has borne fruitage. The scrap. of 
paper, containing a portion of a 
sermon, rolling upon the desert, has 
been picked up and converts made 
to the Church. The missionaries 
have not been able to reap the har- 
vest in the evening of their morn- 
ing's planting, and generally they 
have not expected it. We should 
not be impatient of results nor ex- 
pect to find, at once, the fruitage, 
of our labors. If we had the his- 
tory of those who have been con- 
verted to the Church, we would 
have in almost each instance a sub- 
lime story reading almost like a 
romance, of how a single word 
struck home and brought them into 
the Church, and of the sacrifices 
they made in order to live their re- 
ligion and to gather to Zion. Those 
examples in the lives of the people 
have been impressed upon their 
children and will be upon their chil- 
dren's children. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to appreciate the importance of 
serving in this cause, of realizing, 
with the revelation, that indeed we 
are laying the foundation of a great 
work, and that it is an honor to take 
part in this work, and that from 
things that are small proceedeth 
that which is great, or as the great 



poet has expressed it, "Behold, on 
what a slender thread hang ever- 
lasting things." That has been 
true with the Gospel in the past, 
and no doubt will be in the future. 
These examples of patience and en- 
durance and of devotion for the 
good of others will not be lost to 
the world by any means. I have 
heard great men testify as to the 
impression that a very small but 
faithful act had upon them. The 
constant offering of the fast day 
donation, a very small offering 
taken to the fast meeting yet the 
constancy of some faithful devoted 
brother in making, in his poverty, 
the simple offering, not once or 
twice but each succeeding fast day, 
year after year, has left an impres- 
sion upon strong men. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us in our work of devoting our 
time, our lives if necessary, for the 
welfare and good of others, I pray 
in the names of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

This has been a magnificent con- 
ference and I am grateful that I 
have been able to hear almost every 
sermon delivered from this stand. 
I have been impressed with the 
words of every servant of God who 
has spoken, and my testimony is that 
the Lord has been with this people 
in the past, and has been with them 
in this conference, and is with them 
today. ' 

I have just finished the reading of 
a book which is to me one of the 
marvelous works of the twentieth 
century, namely, "The Truth of Re- 
ligion," by Adolph Eucken, of the 
University of Jena in Germany. It 
is a work for which Professor Euc- 
ken was awarded the Nobel prize in 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG.

1908, and has been pronounced by 
leading universities of Germany, as 
well as the Imperial Scientific So- 
ciety of Germany, as one of the most 
marvelous contributions to religious 
thought in the history of the race. 
In this book Professor Eucken has 
made a marvelous deduction to the 
effect that the world, during the 
twentieth century, will wend its way 
back to a belief in Jesus the Christ, 
and that, when the purer Gospel of 
Christ comes again to the hearts 
of men, that Gospel will express it- 
self through a magnificent co-oper- 
ative institution, which shall be 
known as a church of the Most 
High. In other words, Professor 
Eucken has, unconsciously, given us 
the great thought that we have been 
bearing testimony to for nearly one 
hundred years, namely, that the 
principles of Jesus Christ, and that 
th? great plan of God for His chil- 
dren, will find expression through a 
splendid organization of men who 
are acting harmoniously with one 
another, and are keeping their souls 
tuned to God and the infinite. 

During this conference the great 
theme, seemingly, has been the testi- 
mony that Jesus the Christ has 
lived, and has brought life to the 
world, salvation, and redemption, 
through the Gospel plan of salva- 
tion, and I have rejoiced in this 
great message. It was only recently 
declared by a fellow worker of 
mine, and a classmate at Columbia 
University, that if Dr. William 
James, of Harvard College, had 
come to Utah before he died, he 
would have found a society that, 
above all other human societies, il- 
lustrates better the theory of prag* 
matism, brought out by that great 
psychologist than any other society 
on the earth today. William James 
before he died, — and he is recog- 



nized as the greatest American phil- 
osopher that we have had — declared 
that there must be a splendid belief 
in God, that this idea of man's re- 
lationship to Deity must come back 
again, as it is after all the most po- 
tential and the greatest influence 
for morality that has ever been 
given to the human race. When 
men learn that their institutions — ■ 
their economic, civic, political, so- 
cial and ethical institutions — must be 
in accord with some divine belief 
in man's power and his relationship 
to God, then men will have a truer 
religion, a better outlook on life, and 
men will begin to grow into their 
greater power of intellectual and 
ethical development. 

This book, in a sense, has been 
an exposition of great fundamentals 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, al- 
though unconsciously done. It is 
my firm belief and testimony that 
the intelligent of the world are to- 
day turning their faces to the light, 
by virtue of the hunger of their 
souls. Philosophy of man will never 
satisfy the longing that is natural 
to the human being, will never sa- 
tisfiy that longing for God, 'and 
for a knowledge of man's relation- 
ship to his Creator. I believe, my 
brethren and sisters, that the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ is the most mag- 
nificent example — I mean the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ as we under- 
stand it, and as we know it to be 
true — is the most magnificent ex- 
ample of what modern sociologists 
in their philosophy declare to be 
high-minded and critical intellect- 
ual type of philosophy. Professor 
Franklin Henry Gidding, who over 
a year ago spoke from this pulpit, 
declared that he believes that the 
American people will yet raise up 
a fine tvpe of critical intellectual 
mind. By this he means men who

know life, men who understand 
life in its bigness and its glorious- 
ness, and by understanding it live 
life according to the majesty of 
their divine beings. 

It is my testimony, and I take 
always the deepest pleasure in giv- 
ing it, that the Prophet Joseph was 
a type of the critical, intellectual 
mind which is the dream of some 
philosophers ; that type of mind, 
that wishes truth and works for 
truth, and is open to truth, know- 
ing that truth is power and that 
power is intelligence. I say this 
here because I do not wish the 
Prophet Joseph Smith misunder- 
stood, though he had no formal 
schooling. That is why I believe 
he rose to be such a magnificent 
character before the world. His 
mind was never injured by some 
little or petty pedagogical principle 
that would have warped his being. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ 
stands for truth in its reality; it 
stands for truth in its ideality, and 
takes that stand which Professor 
Eucken has announced, in that 
book which received the world's 
prize, that for a religion to become 
permanent it must make for right- 
eousness, and righteousness in re- 
ligion will come when every man, 
woman and child shall realize his 
own personal responsibility to his 
God, and will place himself before 
his Maker as one who believes in 
the divinty of his own soul. There- 
fore I believe the time will come 
when there will be a monument, a 
gracious and great monument, 
reared to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; and on that monument a 
sentence something like this will 
be inscribed: "To the memory of 
Joseph Smith, who was the agent 
of God to open the heavens to the 
children of men and give the mean- 



ing of the Godhead and man's re- 
lationship to his God." Amen. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB1EY. 

"Mormonism" not an "easy" religion. 
— Obedience and endurance requis- 
ites of Christ's followers. — A sensi- 
ble communism, the United Order. 

Our conference has been one, I 
know, that all who have attended 
have had occasion to thoroughly en- 
joy. The world has been looking 
in years past for an easy religion, 
and wherever religion has been 
made easy enough it has usually 
found some converts, although as 
a rule that kind of religion does not 
hold converts very long. But "Mor- 
monism" is not that kind of relig- 
ion. We have heard, and in a very 
splendid manner too, of the amount 
of service that is extended by the 
members and officers of the Church 
in the way of helping one another 
and helping mankind. All of this 
is true. The Gospel is something 
that partakes of the spirit of help- 
fulness, rendering assistance in 
some way or other, even though it 
be through sacrifice, to those whom 
w e are associated with, and to those 
to whom we are sent ; but we ought 
not to forget this further fact that 
this Gospel is an exacting religion. 
It demands of me and you that we 
shall prepare ourselves, and that we 
shall work out our salvation. In the 
scheme of things, it is not appointed 
in the principles of the Gospel that 
man can be saved except by his 
own exertion. The tendency today 
in the world is to make religion easy 
for everybody. 

I rejoice in the thought that the 
world is growing better in so many 
ways; that we have good hospitals, 
good schools ; that we have so 
many things that are helpful and

that go to assist, especially the poor- 
er classes. All that is good; we 
have more of that as a people in 
proportion to our numbers, far 
more than any other people in the 
world ; but I want to impress upon 
your minds, in the moment or two 
that I stand before you, this fact: 
That this is not an easy religion. 
"Blessed and holy are they who 
come up out of much tribulation." 
Don't forget that. And they did not 
do it themselves ; the honor and 
glory of it was not to themselves, 
but they had washed their robes 
white in the blood of the lamb. He 
was their Savior. He it was they 
had held to, as to the iron rod ; and 
it was through the trouble and trial, 
the sweat, and experience in every 
form that they gained knowledge, 
and added line upon line and pre- 
cept upon precept. Every day and 
every year they so lived that they 
became molded a little more into the ■ 
likeness of the Son of God Himself; 
We may think that we can vote and 
by passing laws, by the initiative or 
referendum or some other way, vote 
this' man and the other man into 
beds of ease and into flowery places, 
and all will come without his effort. 
If it should, he would not be fit 
tp receive it. You can't bless your 
own son and help him unless he is 
willing to help himself. It can't be 
done. You can't bless a body of 
people unless they are willing to 
help themselves. The Lord helps 
those, and only those, who help 
themselves. He can't help a man who 
won't help himself. A man who will 
not say, "Yes, I am willing to go 
down into the waters of baptism," 
but refuses to go, the Lord can't help 
that man any further on that prin- 
ciple. He must help himself. You 
must work out your own salvation in 
fear and trembling before the Lord. 



Let us remember that we have got 
a whole lot to do ourselves, every 
individual for himself — not only 
to help others, but to help ourselves 
as well. 

I know people think that we are 
advancing, and we are advancing, 
until ultimately the United Order 
will be realized. There are at work 
influences in the world — and they 
are appointed of the Lord, I be- 
lieve, — which are making for right- 
eousness, and which will make for 
a communism, for a building up 
of a society that will make it easier 
for the Lord's plan to be estab- 
lished, namely, the United Order. 
We are not ready for that yet, but it 
will come ; but remember this, that 
when it does come, the individual 
man, the individual woman, must 
save himself or herself, must develop 
and grow and become like unto the 
Master. There is no other way, ex- 
cept only through hard, bitter, and 
sore experience. You will not get 
it any other way ; it will not come 
so easy. 

I remember hearing a story told 
of a brother down in St. George, 
when they tried, in a small way, 
the United Order there. Some of 
the people had taken care of their 
grapes and made a little home made 
wine ; but this brother had not. He 
had been careless and negligent. 
When the Order came, the wine 
was shared out, passed around, 
and each one took his share ; and 
I remember the story of him 
saying : "Hey ! This order is a 
fine thing" — he was an English 
brother ; he says, "I tell you, I could 
wish this were come twenty years 
since." Of course he would have 
been drinking somebody else's wine 
and living off of somebody else's la- 
bor twenty years before that, if it 
had come. Salvation does not come 



VZ2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that way. The United Order will 
not bring things that way. It does 
not mean a long table and every one 
eating the same kind of food, and 
every one living in the same kind 
of house. The United Order when 
it does come, I think, will mean in- 
dividuality, personal effort, per- 
sonal salvation, with you in your 
stewardship, me in mine, every man 
appointed in his place to work in 
his stewardship. Then the surplus 
will go for those who are not so 
well situated, and who need help. 
They will be taken and directed, 
"Here, my brother, you take this 
little plot of ground," or "You take 
this little part of business. Here is 
means enough for- you and you de- 
velop it, make it grow, keep it out 
of debt, and work at it." And then 
he will develop it, don't you see? 
But if, according to the idea of 
some of our friends, that all you 
need to do is to divide and to keep 
on dividing, why of course they 
could wish that kind of a thing 
were here a long while before. 

Lay not that flattering unction 
to your souls that there is any other 
way to gain salvation, in the king- 
dom of God, except by rising, when 
you fall. You stumble, of course; 
we all do; but rise up again, my 
brother, press on, persevere in la- 
bor, in toil, in earnestness, in dili- 
gence, in the sweat of thy face, do- 
ing thy part, toiling, persevering; 
press on and on ; add line upon line, 
and precept upon precept ; gain in- 
tellligence and knowledge, and mak- 
ing this person — you, me, the indi- 
vidual person, year by year, a little 
more like unto the Master, the Son 
of God. So shall we progress and 
become like Him; and only so, 
whether in the United Order or 
any other way. God bless you. 
Amen. 



PATRIARCH HYRTJM G. SMITH. 

I, too, my brethren and sisters, 
rejoice in the spirit of this confer- 
ence, in the instructions that have 
been given; and can bear my testi- 
mony that I know the Lord has 
been with us, by His Holy Spirit, 
to indite the same. I know that the 
Lord is pleased "with those who 
work, not only for themselves but 
for others. I rejoice in having the 
privilege to do my part in the work 
of salvation. I rejoice in the testi- 
monies that have come to me, con- 
cerning the means and opportunity 
for salvation. I believe in the plan 
of redemption that has been made 
known in these last days unto the 
Latter-day Saints. I know from 
my experience, and from the testi- 
mony that has come to me, through 
the promptings of the Holy Spirit, 
that it is the true plan of life and 
salvation, and all of those who will 
accept the same, and obey the prin- 
ciples thereof, will gain that eternal 
salvation which we are all working 
for. That is my testimony. 

I rejoice in the privilege of asso- 
ciating with the men whom the 
Lord has called in this present time, 
to stand at the head of this great 
work. I pray that the spirit of the 
Lord will be with them; and may 
His blessings be with all Israel, 
and those especially who are called 
to responsible places in the work 
of the Lord. 

I have rejoiced in the songs of 
praise that have been sung in this 
conference. I have rejoiced in the 
testimonies that have been borne. 
My heart has been touched with the 
words of kindness concerning those 
who have devotedly labored for 
our welfare; and that the young 
and rising generation are receiving 
°-zh splendid opportunities for 



PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH.

progress in this present time. I 
would like to exhort the youth of 
Zion to follow more closely in the 
footsteps of these men and women 
who have gone before us, who have 
diligently labored, and truly have 
eaten their bread by the sweat of 
their brow, who have incessantly 
toiled in these valleys of the moun- 
tains, and have cleared away the 
roughness thereof, so that their chil- 
dren are now rejoicing in the pro- 
ductive gardens, and beauties of 
these valleys, and the fruits of the 
land. I would like to exhort the 
younger people that when we are 
gathering and garnering the fruits 
that we are now enjoying, that we 
will not forget the Lord, nor our 
parents, — those who have so toiled 
for us that these blessings have 
been made comparatively easy. I be- 
lieve, as our beloved bishop has 
said, that only those who do work, 
are entitled to receive the blessing, 
and that we ought not to think of 
gaining a salvation in ease. 

I am grateful to have the privi- 
lege of going about in the stakes 
of Zion, visiting and getting ac- 
quainted with those whom the Lord 
has called into responsible places 
in the midst of His people. My 
particular mission has called me to 
associate with men who are the 
fathers of this people, who have 
won their places and standing in 
the Church through constant and 
persistent labor. They are the men 
whom the Lord has chosen, whom 
He has honored with responsibility, 
who. after their labors ar° almost at 
an end, have been allowed to step 
up and take seats of honor and 
comparative ease. I rejoice, my 
brethren and sisters, that w r e have 
men in our midst who can stand 
up in the congregations of Tsrael 
and testify that, through all these 



years of toil and labor, the Lord has 
been with them, and that the honor 
and glory is not theirs, but is the 
glory and the work of the Lord. 

May His Spirit be with these 
honorable men and women ; sus- 
tain them in their callings and re- 
sponsibilities ; that in the end they 
may triumph in the glory of the 
Lord. May His work in the earth 
triumph ; and when He comes in 
His glory, I trust He will be pleased 
with us, and that He will not put 
off that glorious day upon our ac- 
count ; but that we, through the 
inspiration, received in the lessons 
of life that He has given to us, will 
be accepted as His chosen children, 
that we may not turn away from 
that responsibility but live up to it, 
keeping every precept, accepting 
every truth and living in very deed 
as His children. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters ; may you take to your 
homes the admonitions and exhor- 
tations imparted at this conference; 
that you parents may teach your 
children the truths of the Gospel, 
and not come under condemnation 
for neglect thereof. May the youth 
of Israel, the young and rising gen- 
eration of today, listen to the teach- 
ings of their parents, and heed the 
admonitions of those who are called 
into responsible places in the Holy 
Priesthood. May the blessings of 
heaven attend you all, my brethren 
and sisters, especially ! those to 
whom responsibility has come, that 
the work of the Lord may triumph, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

AUDITORS' REPORT.

follows : 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The undersigned Church Audit- 
ing Committee, having completed 
their 1913 audit of the books and 
accounts of the Trustee-in-Trust 
and of the Presiding Bishopric,

have made a careful and searching 
examination of the receipts and dis- 
bursements of the funds of the 
Church as disclosed by the books of 
the respective offices and find them 
in a most excellent condition. They 
not only disclose a full, frank and 
intelligent statement of every item 
of receipt and expenditure, but they 
also manifest the exercise of careful 
business methods, coupled with a 
broad, charitable, Christian-like 
spirit in the management of the 
tithing and other income of the 
Church. It therefore affords us 
much pleasure to certify to you and 
to the Latter-day Saints that we 
have nothing but commendation for

EliDEE ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

My brethren and sisters : I re- 
joice in the blessings of this confer- 
ence. I thank the Lord that now 
that we are about to conclude its 
meetings, another chapter in the 
history of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints has 
been written, gone into history. We 
can never live the past six months 
over again. Our works, individual- 



ly, and collectively, as individuals 
and a Church have been performed, 
and we now begin a new era. Six 
months hence we shall meet to- 
gether again; I pray the Lord that 
when that time comes it may be 
said, as it has been truthfully said, 
now, that we have continued on the 
road of progression in which the 
Church has been traveling from the 
day of its inception in 1830, until 
now. So, my brethren and sisters, 
may the work of the Lord grow. 
May it continue to spread. May 
the voice of the elders of Israel be 
heard in every land and clime, bear- 
ing witness of the divinity of the 
mission of the Prophet Joseph, and 
the restoration of the Gospel in this 
dispensation for the redemption of 
the covenant people of the Lord. 
May the blessing of the Lord go 
with you to your homes, be with 
you in your avocations ; may it be 
with your families and all that per- 
tains to you, I pray through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

I feel quite certain that the spirit 
and feeling and earnest desires 
which have been made manifest 
during the meetings of this con- 
ference, are all pleasing and ac- 
ceptable to the Lord. I am satis- 
fied that He has approved the 
words that have been spoken, the 
counsels that have been given, and 
the admonitions that have been of- 
fered to the people of the Lord. 
In conclusion, I desire simply to 
say : God bless all Israel, and may 
the Lord especially bless those on 
whom rests the responsibility of 
presiding in the various organiza- 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions of the Church, and especially 
those on whom rests the very great 
responsibility of presiding over the 
stakes of Zion, the presidents and 
their counselors, and the members 
of the various high councils of the 
sixty-five stakes of Zion ; all the 
bishops and their counselors, in the 
seven hundred and twenty-four 
wards organized in the Church, as 
well as those who are presiding 
over the various branches of the 
Church and over all the missions in 
the world. The Lord bless them ; 
give them wisdom, judgment, dis- 
cernment, purity of heart, and 
power of government and of coun- 
sel, that they may be potent in the 
guiding of the affairs of the Church 
in all the departments of the 
Church in which they are concerned 
and over which they are called to 
preside. The Lord bless our auxil- 
iary organizations, and those who 
stand as presidents and directors in 
them, that they may also accomp- 
lish very much in the direction of 
their labors for the good of the 
youth of Zion and of the children of

"WILD ROSES," by Prof. Howard R. Driggs 

Deals with the wild West during that fascinating time when the 
forces of civilization were just breaking into the beautiful moun- 
tain valleys near the Yellowstone country. The author, who took 
active part in this picturesque drama, caught its spirit first hand 
and reflects it truly, vividly, with artistic skill. Price, $1.25 net; 
by mail, $1.35. 

"THE SPOKEN WORD," by John Henry Evans 

Prof. Evans, head of the department of English in the Latter-day 
Saints University, had in mind two thoughts or motives in the 
writing of his little volume: one, the contests in the Mutual Im- 
provement Associations in story-telling, public-speaking and de- 
bating; the other, the needs of the young missionary who has to 
speak in public, and the religious teacher who is required to tell 
stories to her class in the Sunday School, the Primary Association, 
or the Religion Class. Price, 75c postpaid. 

"JESUS THE CHRIST," by Dr. James E. Talmage 

A study of the Messiah and His mission, according to Holy Scrip-

It is with a grateful heart thatl 
greet you, my brethren and sisters, 
at the opening session of this con- 
ference, the 87th semi-annual gen- 
eral conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
It is worthy of note that this build- 
ing is so well filled with our people 
this morning. To me it is a good 
omen and I feel very grateful in- 
deed to meet you here, to see you, 
to look into your faces, and to feel 
that. I am in the presence of a vast 
audience of men and women who 
have come here today because of 
their faith in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and because of their love, 
devotion and integrity 'to the work 
of the Lord. I feel to thank you 
for your presence and for the in- 
fluence for good that will be felt, 
not only today, but hereafter, be- 
cause of the presence of so many 
members of the Church this morn- 
ing. I feel thankful that I am per- 
mitted to be with you, and that the 
Lord has preserved my life and 
given me the goodly measure of 
vigor, health and strength that I 
possess. Above all things, I thank 
God that I am still in the faith of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, that I 
still love the work of the Lord, that 
I believe in it with all my soul. 

My only regret is that I am not 
capable of doing more for its ad- 
vancement, its development, and 
the increased faith and devotion of 
its members throughout all the 
world. I regret that I have not 
greater power to labor for the 



spread of the light, wisdom and in- 
telligence that are to be obtained 
by all who will receive the gospel. 
It is a joy to me always to have 
the privilege of meeting with men 
and women who have embraced the 
truth and who are true to it in their 
daily life, for after all, we establish 
the standard of our integrity and 
our fidelity to the truth by our daily 
works. The tree is known by its 
fruits, and we do not gather grapes 
of thorns nor figs of thistles. When 
you see a number of individuals, a 
community, or an f entire people, 
who have embraced the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, consistent with their 
professions, true to their covenants, 
true in every respect to their faith, 
you will see men and women who 
are bearing good fruit and worthy 
in all respects. The religion which 
we have espoused is not a Sunday 
religion ; it is not a mere profes- 
sion ; it is a most — I was going to 
say — a most terrible reality — and I 
believe I would be justified in using 
that expression, because it savors of 
life unto life or of death unto death. 
If it is, and pardon me for using 
that expression, if it is what we 
profess it to be, what we have em-, 
braced it for, what we believe it to 
be as members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
it is the most important thing in 
the world to us, and the results to 
us in this world and in the world 
to come will depend upon our in- 
tegrity to the truth and our con- 
sistency in observing its precepts, 
in abiding by its principles and its 
requirements. We believe in the 
divinity of the mission of Jesus of 
Nazareth, the Son of God, the one 
and only son begotten of God, and 
who possessed in himself the power 
of life, the power over death, and 
yet who yielded that power to be- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



come a sacrifice for a broken law 
and for the redemption of the chil- 
dren of men from temporal death. 
As it was brought upon them with- 
out any act of theirs, so they are 
removed from the results and con- 
sequences of it through the right- 
eousness of the Son of God, and 
the power which was given to him. 
I hold, therefore, that there is no 
people professing to be believers in 
the divine mission of Jesus Christ 
who are more devoutly, sincerely 
and consistently, believers in Christ, 
than are the Latter-day Saints, and 
that there is not a people in all the 
world better entitled to the name of 
"Christians" than are the Latter- 
day Saints. Our faith in him lies 
at the foundation of our religion, 
the foundation of our hope for re- 
mission of sins and for exaltation 
after death and for the resurrection 
from death to everlasting life. Our 
faith in the doctrines that have been 
restored through the instrumental- 
ity of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
confirms and strengthens us and es- 
tablishes beyond a question or 
doubt, our faith and belief in the 
divine mission of the Son of God. 
Joseph Smith was the instrument 
chosen of God and endowed with 
His authority to restore the holy 
priesthood, the power of God to 
bind on earth and in heaven, to 
loose on earth and in heaven, — the 
power of the priesthood by which 
men may perform ordinances of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ for the sal- 
vation of mankind. Through 
Joseph' Smith the gospel of repent- 
ance, baptism in water for the re- 
mission of sins, the baptism of the 
Holy Ghost and by fire have been 
restored, and the knowledge that 
Jesus is the Christ, the only begot- 
ten Son of God, is made manifest 
through the spirit of truth. We 



are obligated to this humble servant 
that the Lord chose to lay the 
foundation of this work for the or- 
dinances of the gospel of the Son 
of God, then and still unknown to 
the world, by which we may become 
united together as families, as kin- 
dreds, under the bonds of the new 
and everlasting covenant, for time 
and for all eternity. We are obli- 
gated to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
as an instrument in the hand of the 
Lord, for the knowledge that we 
possess of the work which is neces- 
sary to be done in the house of 
God, for the salvation of the living 
and the redemption of the dead, and 
for the eternal union of souls who 
are united in this life by the power 
of God under the bond of the ever- 
lasting covenant. We are indebted, 
or obligated at least, to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith as the instrument in 
the hands of God, for the knowl- 
edge^ we now possess that a man 
cannot be exalted into the presence 
of God and the full enjoyment of 
his glory, alone. It was not de- 
signed for the man to be alone, for 
the man is not without the woman, 
neither the woman without the man, 
in the Lord. 

I might devote my time this 
morning speaking to you of the 
conditions as I understand them of 
the Church throughout the world. 
I feel that it is scarcely necessary 
for me to devote much time, how- 
ever, to that subject. Most of you 
are well acquainted with the condi- 
tions of the work of the Lord that 
we are engaged in throughout the 
world. I believe that the cause of 
Zion is sacred in the sight of the 
Lord, that his eye is upon his peo- 
ple and that his power is working 
in their midst and in the midst of 
the earth for the accomplishment of 
his purpose, for be it known, or let

me say it, although it is known, that 
it is not the work of man, but it is 
the work of God, and He it is that 
is doing it, not man. We give to 
the Lord the credit this morning 
for the presence of this vast multi- 
tude of men holding the priesthood 
after the order of the Son of God. 
We are grateful for the instrument 
that the Lord has chosen to bring 
to pass these results, to help, at 
'least, to bring them to pass, but we 
are more grateful to the Lord him- 
self for the power that he is wield- 
ing and the work that he is doing 
by his Spirit shedding light and 
truth abroadi in the hearts of his 
people and hovering over the hearts 
and minds of the people of the 
world, waiting to enter when they 
are ready to receive the truth and 
hearken to his word. I rejoice in 
these things. I am happy to say 
that we have confidence, I would 
say unlimited confidence, in our 
fellow-workers in the cause of 
Zion. I look at our boys that are 
presiding over the various missions 
in various parts of the world, and 
so; far as we know, and we have 
good reason to be well acquainted 
with them, they are young men 
after God's own heart, true as steel, 
pure as angels in their lives, up- 
right, virtuous, strong in the truth 
and equal to their tasks by the help 
of the Lord, desiring only to per- 
form the duties that are enjoined 
upon them in the fields of labor to 
which they have been appointed and 
where they are devoting their en- 
ergies and their knowledge. 

We reflect upon those who have 
been called to preside over the 
various stakes of Zion, and I may 
say the same of them, with very 
little exception — I would scarcely 
perhaps be justified in saying that 
there was any exception, but there 



is not the same perfection in the 
knowledge of duty and in tlje exe- 
cution of that duty in the perform- 
ance of the labor required at their 
hands in some of the presidents of 
the stakes of Zion, that we find in 
others. In other words, we have 
some young and inexperienced men 
engaged in that work. They have 
much to learn yet to become equal in 
all respects to those who have had 
years of experience in the perform- 
ance of the same duties. But we 
have confidence in them ; we believe 
they will improve where improve- 
ment is needed ; w,e believe they will 
learn their duties where they fail 
to understand it as they should, and 
they have our confidence and our 
support and our prayers that they 
may succeed and not fail. 

We have great respect for our 
bishops, the bishops of the wards 
of the Church, very numerous now, 
but we have one cause for regret 
with reference to the disposition we 
see exhibited too often among the 
bishoprics. It is a common saying 
that once a bishop, always a bishop. 
When a man is ordained a bishop 
and is set apart to the office of 
bishop, as president of a ward, he 
is entrusted with very responsible 
duties, he hecomes a father to the 
people, he is their guardian, their 
watchman upon their tower. It is 
his duty to be acquainted with every 
member of the Church in his ward. 
It is his duty to minister to every 
member and every unit of the mem- 
bership of his ward, not only to the 
heads of families but to each of the 
children of the families as well, who 
dwell in his ward. It is his duty to 
look after the poor, the needy, the 
sick and the afflicted, not that he 
himself is expected to do everything 
that is to be done in his ward, not 
at all ; but through the agencies that 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



he may call to his support to per- 
form the duties that are requisite 
to be performed in the ward, he is 
thoroughly, or ought to be thor- 
oughly provided with means to visit 
every family and to know the status 
and standing of every member in 
his ward ; to know whether his peo- 
ple are living their religion or not ; 
whether they are doing their duty ; 
whether they are liable to wander 
away from their duty or from their 
faithfulness in the Church. In too 
many instances, we find that our 
bishops are not instant in season 
and out of season, in the perform- 
ance of their duties in this regard. 
We call for elders to go abroad to 
preach the gospel. We send out 
instructions to the bishops inform- 
ing them as to the character of the 
men we require for missionary ser- 
vice, men who are sober, who are 
intelligent, who are well and hearty, 
not diseased, not crippled, who have 
faith in their hearts and the love of 
truth in their souls, and keep the 
word of wisdom, attend to their 
Sabbath duties as well as to all their 
other duties that belong to member- 
ship in the Church. And yet too 
often, we receive reports from our 
bishops informing us that such and 
such a youth or man had been se- 
lected for a mission and so far as 
they know, he is all right, and when 
we further inquire into it, we dis- 
cover that he does not keep the 
word of wisdom ; we discover that 
he is financially unable to fill a mis- 
sion or that he is not physically able 
to go. We discover sometimes that 
a youth is the head in his family, in 
other words, his father is dead, his 
mother is a widow and it requires 
all his energy to provide for his 
mother and the younger children, 
and yet he is recommended to go 
on a mission by the bishop without 



inquiring into it. That is why I say 
we have some regrets with refer- 
ence to the faithfulness, competency 
and diligence of some of our bish- 
ops in looking into the affairs of the 
people of their wards. Another 
source of regret is that we have too 
many of our bishops who want to 
quit the bishopric. They want to 
resign, to give the duty of the bish- 
opric over to somebody else. They 
get tired of it. Of course it is a 
labor, it is a great responsibility, 
and when a man becomes incapable 
of performing the duties of a bishop 
and the president of the stake is at- 
tending to his duty, he will consult 
with him and recommend that he be 
honorably released. Let him be 
honorably released, without the ne- 
cessity of resigning; and so the 
presidents of stakes should do their 
duty in their stakes, as well as the 
bishops should do their duty in their 
wards. It is a common saying and 
perhaps a vulgar one, that the Lord 
hates a quitter, and I must say to 
you, that it does not strike me as 
the right thing for a man to quit 
doing his duty as long as he is able 
and it is expected of him to do it. 
He should do it until he is disquali- 
fied by illness or age or other in- 
capacity and then the presiding offi- 
cers of the stake should know his 
condition and should recommend 
his honorable release and, the ap- 
pointment of some one capable to 
succeed him. 

Now, I did not intend to en- 
ter into this subject. I thought 
when I come in this morning 
that if I could stand up here 
and bear my testimony to the truth 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
express my gratitude for the love 
of God upon all his people, that it 
would be sufficient for me, and let 
the younger men, such as Brother 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Penrose, do the heft of the teaching 
and preaching and exhortation, cor- 
rection and . admonition to the 
Saints and the officers of the 
Church. 

I hope the Lord will give me suf- 
ficient strength, mental and physi- 
cal, and sufficient influence of his 
Holy Spirit that I shall be able at 
least to set an example of rightful- 
ness and of righteousness before my 
associates in life, and thus by ex- 
ample, preach the truth as long as 
I- draw breath. I do not want to 
quit the service of God, nor the ser- 
vice of his people, nor do I want to 
quit observance of the ordinances 
and precepts of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, nor do I want to become in- 
different or thoughtless and care- 
less with respect to these sacred du- 
ties and the principles of the gospel. 

The work for our dead, which 
the Prophet Joseph laid upon us 
with more than ordinary injunction, 
instructing us that we should look 
after those of our' kinsfolk, and our 
ancestors who have died without the 
knowledge of the gospel, should not 
be neglected. We should avail our- 
selves of those sacred and potent 
ordinances of the gospel which 
have been revealed as essential to 
the happiness, salvation and re- 
demption of those who have lived 
in this world when they could not 
learn the gospel and have died with- 
out the knowledge of it, and are 
now waiting for us, their children, 
who are living in an age when these 
ordinances can be performed, to do 
the work necessary for their release 
from the prison-house. Through 
our efforts in their behalf their 
chains of bondage will fall from 
them, and the darkness surrounding 
them will clear away, that light may 
shine upon them and they shall hear 
in the spirit world of the work that 



has been done for them by their 
children here, and will rejoice with 
you in your performance of these 
duties. 

Again, and without desire to mul- 
tiply words, I bear my testimony to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that 
God lives, that his Son lives, and I 
say to you in connection with this 
thought and this testimony that I 
accept without recourse, without 
any hesitancy or doubt upon my 
mind, the statement that was made 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith with 
reference to God and to his only 
begotten Son, that "The Father has 
a body of flesh and bones as tangi- 
ble as man's ; The Son also : but the 
Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh 
and bones, but is a personage of 
Spirit," and man is made in their 
image. We also accept without any 
question the doctrines we have 
been taught by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and by the Son of God him- 
self, that we pray to God, the Eter- 
nal Father, in the name of his only 
begotten Son, to whom also our 
father Adam and his posterity have 
prayed from the beginning. If Lat- 
ter-day Saints will take these simple 
statements of fact, given to us in the 
doctrine of Christ and restored and 
renewed to us in the testimony of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, it would 
settle many a question that is being 
foolishly asked today. There are 
many things yet to be revealed. 
There are things to be revealed 
which God will make known in his 
own due time which we do not now 
understand. For my own part, 
there is as much already revealed 
as it seems possible for me to un- 
derstand. If I could only grasp all 
that God has revealed, and compre- 
hend it as I should and apply it in 
righteousness in my life, I think I 
should then be prepared for some- 



PRESIDENT JO SEPH F. SMITH. 



thing more, if I was still worthy 
of it. Why, bless your souls, there 
are people among us that are wor- 
rying and fretting over things that 
have never been revealed to the 
children of men, and these very 
people do not even keep the word 
of wisdom, do not even pay their 
tithing, and as a rule, the man that 
does not pay his tithing and that 
does not keep the word of wisdom 
is the man that is everlastingly 
quizzing and asking questions about 
things he does not understand. If 
men would pay their tithing, if they 
would keep the word of wisdom, if 
they would say their prayers, if 
they would devote their lives to 
works of righteousness in the earth 
and study the gospel for themselves 
and obey it, they would have less 
necessity for asking questions, and 
don't forgeti the fact that they 
would know things better than they 
do. 

The Lord bless you. From the 
depths of my soul, I bless you ; I 
hold the right, the keys and the 
authority of the patriarchal Priest- 
hood in the Church. I have a right 
to pronounce patriarchal blessings, 
because I hold the keys and author- 
ity to do it. It is given to me and 
my associates to ordain patriarchs 
and set them apart to give blessings 
to the people to comfort them by 
promises made in wisdom and the 
inspiration of the Spirit of God, of 
the favor and mercies of the Lord 
that they may be stronger in good 
works, that their hopes may be 
realized and their faith increased. 
And I bless you, my brethren and 
sisters in the cause of Zion, with 
all my soul and by the authority of 
the priesthood that I hold. I hold 
the priesthood of the apostleship, I 
hold the high priesthood which is 
after the order of the Son of God, 



which is at the foundation of all 
priesthood and is the greatest of all 
priesthoods because the apostle 
and the high priest and the seventy 
derive their authority and their 
privileges from the priesthood 
which is after the order of the Son 
of God. All authority comes out 
of that high priesthood. I proph- 
esy that the blessing of the Lord 
will be upon his people throughout 
the extent of our glorious land, and 
upon the people of this nation, if 
they will do right. The blessings 
of the Lord will be more particu- 
larly poured out upon the Latter- 
day Saints if they will live their re- 
ligion as they should. The idea of 
a Latter-day Saint quarreling with 
his neighbor, haling him before his 
bishop for trial. Why, bless your 
souls, what is the use of it? I never 
had to do a thing of that kind. I 
have, I think, suffered some things 
that might have justified me com- 
plaining to my bishop and asking 
the bishop to see if he could make 
my neighbor do his duty, but I 
haven't had occasion sufficient to do 
it and I have never done it. I have 
never been under the necessity of 
going before the high council with 
my troubles. My religion teaches 
me a better way than that. I would 
rather yield to injustice than try to 
exact every pound of flesh, so to 
speak. And I do not think it is 
necessary for Latter-day Saints to 
get so far apart in their judgment, 
in their likes and dislikes, in their 
desire to claim something they think 
is theirs, as to go to law for the 
court to set him right. Give and 
take. Be reconciled with each 
other. Do not go to the courts of 
the Church nor to the courts of the 
land for litigation. Settle your own 
troubles, and difficulties ; and as 
Bishop Hunter used to say, which is 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



an axiom, that cannot be disputed, 
there is only one way in which a dif- 
ficulty existing between man and 
man can be truly settled, and that 
is when they get together and settle 
it between them. The courts can- 
not settle troubles between me and 
my brother. If they decide against 
him, and in my favor, of course I 
receive it with gladness, and praise 
the judge because he has favored 
me, but my brother rejects the de- 
cision, and while I may feel it is 
settled, my brother is not satisfied 
at all, and condemns the decision, 
and is embittered against me. So 
the only way to settle a trouble be- 
tween brethren is for them to get 
together and settle it between them- 
selves and let it be settled fully and 
forever. If we have the spirit of 
the gospel in our hearts, if we have 
the love of truth abiding in our 
souls, if we half love our neighbors 
as we love ourselves ; and especially 
if we love God with all our hearts 
and mind and strength, we can 
easily give and take until we can 
settle troubles existing between 
neighbors and brothers without 
anybody else coming in to help us 
do it. I have often been called 
upon to help others settle their 
troubles, but I have never had to 
ask anybody else to come and help 
me settle mine. I think we ought 
to live our religion. We should 
keep the commandments of God. 
We should possess and enjoy the 
spirit; of the gospel in our hearts 
and bear the fruits of the spirit in 
our lives ; faith, hope and charity, 
love, humility and forgiveness in 
our souls one for another, and 
avoid, as far as possible, the spirit 
of accusation, of contention, that 
leads to strife, to confusion and 
division among men, and the spirit 
of hatred. Oh, banish hatred from 



you. Hatred harbored in our hearts, 
or envy or jealousy, will injure 
those who permit them to abide in 
their souls and rancor in their 
thoughts a thousand-fold more than 
it will injure others. So let us 
banish those things from our hearts, 
and from our thoughts. Let us live 
righteous lives, let the husband love 
his wife and be true and kind to 
her, and the wife be true and kind 
to her husband, and they be true and 
loving and solicitous; for the wel- 
fare of their children ; let them be 
united as a family unit in the 
Church and as that condition ex- 
tends abroad to the borders of 
Zion, we will have the millennial 
reign among us, and there will be 
peace on earth and good will to men 
everywhere. 

The Lord bless you, and I hope 
you will pardon me for occupying 
so much of your time. 

I have a few little items that I 
have jotted down which I will take 
the pains to read for the informa- 
tion of the conference: 

In the British Mission, Elder 
Hyrum M. Smith has been honora- 
bly released and is succeeded by 
Elder George F. Richards. His son, 
George F., Jr., also accompanying 
him on his mission to Great Britain. 

In the Netherlands Mission, Elder 
LeGrande Richards has also been 
honorably released and succeeded 
by Elder John A. Butterworth, who 
was laboring as a missionary in the 
mission when Brother Richards was 
released. 

In the New Zealand Mission, 
Elder William Gardner has been 
honorably released and is succeeded 
by Elder James N. Lambert, a 
young man born and reared in our 
city here. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



In the Samoan Mission, Elder 
John A. Nelson, Jr., has been hon- 
orably released and is succeeded by 
Elder Ernest Wright. 

In the Swedish Mission, Elder 
Theodore Tobiason has been hon- 
orably released and is succeeded by 
Elder Andrew P. Anderson. 

In the Swiss and German Mis- 
sion, we are endeavoring to release 
Elder Hyrum W. Valentine, and 
have already sent Brother Angus J, 
Cannon, a son of President George 
Q. Cannon, to succeed him. He has 
met with an obstruction on his way 
to Switzerland, and therefore the 
release of Brother Valentine is de- 
• layed, but we hope Brother Cannon 
will get through before long and 
that Brother Valentine and his wife 
will be safely headed toward home. 

The Tonga Mission has been or- 
ganized with Elder Willard L. 
Smith as president. This mission 
has been associated with the Sa- 
moan Mission from the beginning, 
but it is so far away from the head- 
quarters of the Samoan Mission, 
that we have concluded it best to 
make a separate mission of it. 

The presidencies of the follow- 
ing stakes have been reorganized: 
Beaver Stake, Bannock Stake, Big 
Horn Stake, Panguitch Stake 
and Parowan Stake. Forty-six 
bishops and sixty-eight ward clerks 
have been appointed since last April. 
This is one of the things I had in 
my mind, it is too many changes, 
if we could '' avoid it. I might 
suggest in connection with this 
thought that if the presidents of the 
stakes would be a little more cau- 
tious and pay a little better regard 
to the suitableness of the man 
chosen to act as a bishop, to his 
qualifications in every way, and 



especially to his status as a resident 
in the ward, so he will not be under 
the necessity of pulling up, after he 
has been bishop a few months, and 
moving off somewhere, necessitat- 
ing a change in the bishopric, I 
think that we would perhaps be able 
to save some of these numerous 
changes ini the bishoprics of our 
wards. 

There have been twenty new 
wards organized since last April 
conference, and all these new wards 
need houses of worship, and of 
course, the first thing they think of 
is to build a meetinghouse, and they 
look to the Trustee-in-trust to help 
them very materially in the building 
of them. So we have applications 
from all quarters, not only among 
the well established stakes and 
wards who have had meetinghouses 
in the past, but from these new 
stakes, and quite a number of our 
older wards, well established, who 
have had meetinghouses for many 
years, have come to the conclusion 
that the old houses are not quite 
good enough and they must have 
new ones, and so we are called upon 
to contribute to them as well as to 
the building up of the new 
wards. 

There are now seventy-two or- 
ganized stakes of Zion, with eight 
hundred and sixteen wards and in- 
dependent branches, and there are 
twenty-two missions in the Church. 

The Lord bless you, is my prayer, 
and I humbly ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A baritone solo, entitled, "The 
Seer, the Seer, - Joseph the Seer," 
was sung by Anthony C. Lund, 
conductor of the Tabernacle Choir.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 

A plea to have the Saints attend Sac- 
rament meetings more freely — Rea- 
sons why it is profitable and re- 
quired that the Saints shall go to 
the house of prayer — Strict sacred- 
ness of the Sabbath with Ancient 
Israel — How Sabbath meetings may 
be made more attractive — Signifi- 
cance of the Sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper — The conflict be- 
tween Luther and Zwingli — Cove- 
nants made in partaking of the Sac- 
rament — The great commandment, 
and all others given by the Savior 
to be observed by the Saints. 

I hope that while I shall stand be- 
fore you and address you a short 
time that I may not draw your 
minds away from the excellent 
things that have been spoken to us 
this morning by our President. The 
remarks were timely, and we all 
feel we ought to follow them. If 
we do, I know they will be a bless- 
ing and a benefit. 

The other day I asked a bishop's 
counselor about his ward, and want- 
ed to know wherein the members 
of the ward needed the most en- 
couragement. He answered, in at- 
tendance at sacrament meetings; 
adding, that while they had large 
meetings, still the percentage was 
low. It has also been the report 
from a great many places, that the 
percentage of attendance at sacra- 
ment meetings is low. I would like 
to plead with the Saints to give this 
matter more thought and try to 
raise the; percentage of their at- 
tendance ; by this I mean that they 
will do their duty in attending their 
meetings. If we are not present at 
our meetings when we have the op- 
portunity we deprive ourselves of 
great blessings ; in fact, we will be 
starving spiritually. At our meet- 
ings we receive instruction, encour- 
agement to do right, and we enjoy 



the influence of the Spirit of God 
that is present, and make up our 
minds that we will live better lives. 
If we do not go to meetings we lose 
these things ; and as our minds are 
active, they are apt to he engaged 
with other subjects and thoughts in- 
stead of those that should be had on 
a Sunday. 

I would like to read what the 
Lord says in this regard. You will 
find it on page 224 in the Doctrine 
and Covenants. The Lord says : 

"And that thou mayest more fully 
keep thyself unspotted from the 
world, thou shalt go to the house of 
prayer and offer up thy sacraments on 
my holy day; for verily this is a day 
appointed unto you to rest from your 
labors, and to pay thy devotions to 
the Most High; nevertheless, thy 
vows shall be offered up in righteous- 
ness on all days and at all times; but 
remember that on this the Lord's day, 
thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy 
sacraments unto the Most High, con- 
fessing thy sins unto thy brethren, 
and before the Lord. And on this day 
thou shalt do none other thing, only 
let thy food be prepared with single- 
ness of heart that thy fasting may be 
perfect, or, in other words, that thy 
joy may be full." 

This is the Lord's command to us, 
that on the Sabbath day we shall 
rest from all other labors, and go 
to the house of God. His object in 
wanting us to rest one day in seven 
is for our benefit, as it is found to 
be physiologically true that men 
who work six days in the week and 
rest on the seventh can do more 
than those who work constantly. The 
Lord also wanted us to have our 
minds directed on things that are of 
greater value to us than simply the 
things that we can produce by our 
hands' labor. He commands us to 
go to the house of prayer.' Why? 
That we might keep ourselves more 
fully unspotted from the world. By 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

attending our meetings and listen- 
ing to what is said to us, partaking 
of the sacrament and renewing our 
covenants we get more strength to 
keep ourselves unspotted from the 
world. This is the great object in 
attending meetings, and as the Lord 
has commanded it, let us obey his 
command. 

Let us not look upon the com- 
mandment to keep the Sabbath day 
holy as a small one that it doesn't 
matter much if we violate. If we 
read the scriptures we will learn 
how important it was held to ob- 
serve the Sabbath in Old Testament 
times. There is an instance of a 
man being punished with death for 
transgressing this commandment, 
and ancient Israel was very careful 
in observing the Sabbath day. We 
read in history how Jersualem was 
taken by its enemies simply because 
the people considered it a sin to 
fight on the Sabbath day. The 
Egyptian king, Ptolemy Soter took 
Jerusalem in this way. Antiochus 
sent one of his generals to Jeru- 
salem for the purpose of besieging 
it. When the Sabbath came he ' 
knew that the Jews, on account of 
their religious scruples, would not 
fight, so he and his soldiers entered 
the city, and, fearing no resistance, 
cruelly slew men, women and chil- 
dren. We rather consider this as 
too strict an interpretation of the 
law, but such a sacredness sur- 
rounded the Sabbath in the minds 
of the Jews that they were not will- 
ing even to defend themselves when 
they believed it would be breaking 
the Sabbath. 

Not so, however, today, in the 
Christian world, for we find that 
some of the greatest battles are 
fought on Sunday, or the Lord's 
day. I bring this up, brethren and 
sisters, to show you how important 



this commandment was held to be 
in old Israel. I fear that the Sab- 
bath is no1< held sacred enough 
among us as a people, who ought, 
indeed, to pay attention" to this day 
and make it a day of rest and wor- 
ship. 

How can we make our meetings 
attractive? Why, by going there 
and filling up the meetinghouse. 
Let there be no empty benches, for 
they are very discouraging to the 
speaker. Let us feel that every one 
of us owes it to his fellow wor- 
shipers to go to the house of prayer 
and occupy his seat there, thus help- 
ing to make a large meeting, and by 
doing so giving more support to 
him who shall address us. Again, 
we open our meetings by singing, 
and singing is elevating and refin- 
ing, it encourages us to faithfulness, 
especially when the music is ac- 
companied by words of godliness, 
such as are contained in our hymns. 
We want to encourage good singing 
in our meetings. We have a great 
many excellent choirs throughout 
Zion, and I wish to say to the bish- 
ops, encourage good choirs ; have 
men that can lead them, and get 
some of your good singers together 
in the choir, thus giving joy to the 
Saints, and at the same time making 
the meetings more attractive. In 
the, larger settlements it is not so 
difficult to have a choir, but in 
smaller settlements it is, perhaps, 
not so easy to get together brethren 
and sisters who can sing, or to get 
a competent leader ; yet the bishops 
ought to do what they can along 
this line. If you haven't a chorister, 
try to induce such a one to move 
into your ward, even if you have 
to give him some advantages. It 
may be that you have a school 
teacher who can teach music and 
thus help you to make a choir; but, 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



by all means, try to have good sing- 
ing in your meetings. 

When you received the gospel 
abroad how you loved to attend 
your meetings ! I have seen Saints, 
old and young, walk many miles to 
attend meetings with brethren and 
sisters, who likewise lived a long 
distance from the place of meeting, 
and all rejoiced in the privelege of 
coming together to .enjoy the spirit 
of the gospel, and hear the teach- 
ings of the servants of the Lord. 
Generally each one would bring a 
hymn-book, so as to take part in 
the singing, a custom very general 
in the missions; but here at home, 
very few take hymn-books with 
them to meeting, and some do not 
even own a hymn-book. Now this 
should not be. Bring your hymn- 
books along to the meetings, and 
when you hear the choir sing you 
will be much more edified by fol- 
lowing the words in the book, and 
your hearts will be lifted up not 
only by the melody, but also by the 
good words that are being sung. 
I would ask the Saints to give this 
a little more attention and to take 
their hymn-books with them to 
meetings. 

The meetings are opened with an 
invocation. All should unite in 
earnest prayer with the elder who 
is called upon to be mouth. Some- 
times when there are sick in the 
ward these may be remembered in 
the prayer, and the congregation 
join in asking the Lord for their 
recovery. There is much power in 
the united exercise of faith and 
prayer. 

Generally, after the opening of 
the meeting the sacrament of the 
Lord's supper is administered. It 
is one of the most sacred acts we 
can perform. When the emblems 
— the bread and water — are passed 



around let us not partake of them 
thoughtlessly, but let our minds be 
turned to the meaning of the sac- 
rament, and go back to Calvary, 
and, with grateful hearts, remember 
what our Master and Savior suf- 
fered and did for us, as has been 
alluded to by our President, how 
the Savior voluntarily gave his life 
for his brethren. We should be 
imbued with that thought when we 
partake of the bread and likewise 
when we drink of the cup, and be 
thankful to the Lord that we have 
the privilege of worshiping him and 
of partaking of these sacred things. 
We should weigh every word in the 
prayers of dedication of these em- 
blems. The prayers are short, but 
very comprehensive. 

In the blessing of the bread we 
make three covenants: We cove- 
nant with the Lord that we will take 
upon us the name of his Son. Do 
you realize how much is contained 
in this covenant? Taking upon us 
the name of Christ doesn't mean 
alone that we will be called Chris- 
tians, but it means that we will de- 
serve taking upon us that name, 
that our works and words may all 
be in accord with him whose name 
we have taken upon us. Think of 
this, and when you say "Amen" to 
that prayer, realize that you have 
promised that you will walk in the 
footsteps of him wno suffered for 
us, that you will show unto the 
world that you will bear his name 
rightfully, that men may not point 
a finger at you, and say that you 
are calling yourself a follower of 
Christ, but are going contrary to 
his life and example. You also make 
covenant that you will remember 
him. This was really the object of 
instituting the sacrament. Recall 
the conditions that existed when 
Jesus came upon the earth. Up to 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

that time the prescribed sacrifices 
had been made by the priests in the 
temple, and these sacrifices all 
pointed forward to the great sacri- 
fice that he should make. In fact, 
the efficacy of these sacrifices, to 
obtain forgiveness of sins for those 
in whose favor they were offered, 
depended upon the great sacrifice 
which Jesus was to come and make ; 
and hence during those ages that 
preceded his coming upon the earth, 
the sacrifices and worship in the 
temples, all pointed forward to his 
great sacrifice. On the Thursday 
evening, the night before his cruci- 
fixion, when the all-atoning sacri- 
fice was made, he instituted, instead 
of an ordinance to look forward, 
one that should make men look back 
unto the great sacrifice accom- 
plished. To me the institution of 
the Lord's supper is strong evidence 
of the divinity and foreknowledge 
of the Savior, and what could be 
more impressive and powerful to 
call to mind the sublime sacrifice he 
made than that of partaking of 
broken bread to remember his body ; 
and drinking- from the cup to re- 
member his blood that was shed for 
all for the remission of sins? Jesus 
knew that abstract teaching might 
easily be forgotten, that men would 
remember the concrete better, and 
hence many of his excellent lessons 
were given in parables, and that this 
the greatest event might he vividly 
impressed on all, he gave this glori- 
ous ordinance in a tangible form, 
to look at and partake of. 

There has been considerable dif- 
ference of opinion in regard to his 
meaning of the phrase, "This is my 
body," when he said to his disciples, 
"Take, eat, this is my body," and 
also when he gave to them the cup 
and said, "Drink ye all of it, for 
this is my blood of the new testa- 



ment, which is shed for many for 
the remission of sins." A great 
number of Christian sects and de- 
nominations claim that this did not 
signify that the bread and wine 
were emblems, but that we partake 
really of his flesh and blood, in the 
administration of the sacrament. 
Transsubstantiation means that the 
bread changes by the blessing into 
his flesh, and the wine into his 
blood. This is not our opinion. We 
believe that the bread and wine are 
simply emblems of his body and 
blood. If we could imagine our- 
selves in that sacred, room where 
he and his disciples were having the 
last evening together, where they 
partook of the paschal meal, and 
where he instituted this holy ordi- 
nance, we should see him then 
standing before the disciples, say- 
ing to them of the bread, "This is 
my body," and 1 of the contents of 
the cup, "This is my blood," and 
yet we should see him standing in 
the full vigor of health and the 
blood circulating in his veins. It 
was not his blood in the cup, for 
he calls it at the very same time, 
"this fruit of the vine." It was 
wine he gave unto them, but it rep- 
resented' his blood that was to be 
shed for the remission of sins. 

When the reformation took place 
in Germany and the surrounding 
states, Luther retained the old doc- 
trine that, "This is my body," meant 
that the bread changed to flesh. 
When he met Zwingli, who started 
the Reformed religion, their friends 
wanted to bring them together to 
be reconciled on this important 
point. But Luther simply wrote 
with chalk on an altar cloth : "This 
is my body. I cannot change my 
mind on this point." Zwingli held 
that Jesus merely meant that the 
bread signified the body of Christ. 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Luther said we must not change 
and give another meaning to the 
words of Jesus, they must be un- 
derstood as spoken. Zwingli asked 
him then : "Does this extend also 
to his last words on the cross, when 
he said to his beloved apostle John, 
'Behold thy mother,' pointing to 
his beloved mother Mary, and when 
he said to his mother, 'Behold thy 
son,' pointing to John?" Zwingli 
said that Jesus certainly meant that 
John should be as a son to Jesus' 
mother, and so when Jesus said 
about the bread, "This is my body," 
he meant that the bread signified 
that his body would be hung upon 
the cross, and when he said about 
the wine, "This is my blood," it sig- 
nified his blood that was shed for 
us. To us this is clear. 

I was trained in a Lutheran 
school, and I remember our teacher 
was once explaining to us the dif- 
ference between the teachings of 
Luther and Zwingli, the pupils said 
to him: "Teacher, it seems to us 
that Zwingli was right." He looked 
at them disgusted and said that 
when their minds got broader they 
would understand more about it. I 
don't think that understanding 
would come on this point — only as 
men force themselves to believe it. 
Luther held to this doctrine so firm- 
ly that he said: "I would rather 
drink blood with the . Pope than 
drink wine with Zwingli!" 

Now, brethren and sisters, we 
partake of the sacrament to remem- 
ber the sacrifice of our Savior and 
to remember him. This is what he 
asks us to do. Whenever we put 
out our hands to take the bread, let 
the thought go with it, "His body 
suffered upon the cross for us;" 
and when we drink of the cup, let 



our thought likewise be of his . 
blood that was shed for us, for the 
remission of sins. 

We do not partake of the sacra- 
ment for the remission of sins, as 
they do in many of the different 
churches. We believe that baptism 
was instituted for the remission of 
sins, and that having received the 
Spirit of God, if we humbly repent 
of what wrongs we have done, and 
earnestly seek the Lord's forgiv- 
eness, that forgiveness may come 
to us. 

In speaking about the different 
covenants we make in the sacra- 
ment, a great covenant is also made 
wherein we promise that we will 
keep the commandments which 
Jesus has given us. We all believe 
in keeping the ten commandments, 
or ought to do so, at least, but did' 
Jesus give us any others? Read 
the Sermon. on the Mount, one of 
the best sermons ever delivered, 
full of good instruction unto his 
disciples and the whole world, and 
you may put together all that he 
taught into the words, "Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart, and with all thy soul, and 
with all thy strength, and with all 
thy might ; and thy neighbor as thy- 
self." He made that generalization, 
one of the greatest ever made; all 
commandments can come under it, 
and he emphasized this once to the 
Prophet Joseph by saying, that "ex- 
cept ye love one another yet are not 
mine." Now we promise to keep 
his commandments and that in- 
cludes this great commandment, 
sometimes pretty hard to keep, but 
we make the covenant, when we 
partake of the sacrament, that we 
will keep his commandments. We 
should study all the other com- 
mandments that are given, and be 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

ready and yield obedience unto 
them. 

I see the time has expired. I feel 
happy to be present. I feel happy 
that I am a member of the Church 
of Christ. I thank the Lord that 
the light of ,the gospel has shone in 
my heart and that I have learned a 
few of the principles pertaining to 
eternal salvation ; and I believe that 
you all feel the same way. The 
Lord bless you, and help us to- 
gether to serve him and to fulfil our 
mission upon the earth to his honor, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, 
"O say, what is truth." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Daniel Heiner, president of 
the Morgan Stake of Zion. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

President Joseph F. Smith pre- 
sided and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn "Now let Us rejoice." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Stephen L. Chipman, president of 
the Alpine Stake of Zion. 

Shanna Tout, of Idaho, sang a 
solo, "Thou wilt keep him in per- 
fect peace, whose mind is staid on 
thee." 

PREST. CHARLES W.PENROSE. 

A firm foundation — Definite under- 
standing of Deity — Joseph the Seer 
— Our pre-existent state — Seek after 
good and you will find it — The spirit 
sphere — Resurrection of Sons of 
Perdition — Power and eternity of 
the Priesthood — Eternal judgment — 



Settlement of difficulties and dis- 
putes — Justice and equity to prevail. 

"Thou wilt keep him in perfect 
peace whose mind is stayed on 
thee." Yes. If there are any peo- 
ple in the world who enjoy more 
perfect peace than do the Latter- 
day Saints I have not become 
acquainted with them, either per- 
sonally or by investigation. We 
certainly should put our trust in the 
Lord, and I believe we do to a very 
large extent, and in that we find 
peace. 

If we have had any doubts in 
regard to God, his personality and 
his will concerning his children, 
they were dissipated when we re- 
ceived the gospel revealed in the lat- 
ter-days through the prophet Joseph 
Joseph Smith. Our feet have been 
placed upon the firm foundation. 
We know that God is the Lord, and 
we are perfectly satisfied, I believe, 
in the truth of the enunciation made 
by our President this morning, that 
the Father is a personage, not a 
mere spiritual imaginary breath, and 
that Jesus Christ of Nazareth, born 
of the Virgin Mary, is his only be- 
gotten Son in the flesh, and that we 
are made in their image, as re- 
vealed in scripture, both ancient and 
modern, and when we pray, we 
pray to him to whom Jesus Christ 
prayed, whom he taught his dis- 
ciples to pray to as our Father in 
heaven, and to whom Adam prayed 
in the Garden of Eden and taught 
his children to pray to. This is 
made very clear in the book called 
the Pearl of Great Price, the word 
of the Lord given to Moses, also in 
the word of the Lord given, pre- 
viously to that, to Enoch. These 
things are very clear and plain to 
us by the revelations given in the 
latter days through the prophet 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Joseph Smith ; and while we do 
not worship Joseph Smith, we do 
worship, with him, the great Eter- 
nal Father, the great Elohim, that 
Being spoken of by the psalmist 
when he said : "God standeth in 
the congregation of the mighty. He 
judgeth among the gods." Paul 
had reference to him when he said, 
there were "gods many, and lords 
many, both in heaven and on earth, 
but to us, there is one God, even 
the Father, and one Lord, Jesus 
Christ ;" and to them we pay ador- 
ation. We also! pay homage in a 
large degree, or should do so, to the 
man chosen of God in the latter 
days, when he was but a boy, to be- 
gin to lay the foundations of the 
latter-day work, to represent the 
Lord in the ushering in of "the dis- 
pensation of the fullness of times." 
My heart goes out to him when 
we sing "Praise to the man who 
communed with Jehovah! Jesus 
anointed that prophet and seer, 
Blessed to open the last dispensa- 
tion, Kings shall extol him and Na- 
tions revere." While Brother Tony 
Lund, this morning, was singing 
the beautiful song, composed by 
President John Taylor, who partly 
suffered martyrdom with the proph- 
et, "The seer, the seer, Joseph the 
seer!" every word and every tone 
went into my heart ; and there is a 
peculiarity about this to me : From 
the very first time I read anything 
about Joseph Smith, when I was 
but a boy, there seemed to go from 
me to him a responding chord in 
my soul. When I have stood out 
in the world, in the streets and in 
the halls of the people, and borne 
testimony that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the living God, it seemed 
as though there was an awakening 
in my whole nature in bearing that 
testimony, an affinity between me 



anrl the prophet whom I never saw, 
with my natural eyes. I believe that 
Joseph Smith was one of the 
mighty that we read about in 
ancient and, in some places, in 
modern scripture. He was one of 
the mighty ones and was reserved 
to come on the earth ih the latter 
^avs, in this last dispensation, to be 
the instrument in the hands of the 
T^athpr and of the Son, to re-estab- 
lish the Church of Christ and to in- 
troduce into the world principles, 
the knowledge of which had been 
lost for ages, and to reveal the 
word of the Lord especially for this 
generation, that a people might be 
prepared for the establishment of 
the kingdom of God, the kingdom 
of our Lord Jesus Christ. I be- 
lieve that he is one of the great and 
mighty spirits that ministered be- 
fore the Lord. 

The full history of our pre-exist- 
ent state, any of us, anybody that 
has been living in the flesh on the 
earth has not been given to us. The 
Lord has not been pleased to reveal 
very much concerning it, but the 
fact has been made so clear and 
patent to our minds that we have 
become established in the faith that 
we lived before we came here, and, 
therefore, we shall live after we 
leave' here ; that we are the sons and 
daughters of that great and mighty 
Being, who possessed the fullness 
of intelligence and was the great- 
est of all the intelligences that ex- 
isted in that state. He is the Being 
whom we worship; to him we owe 
our personal, organized, conscious 
existence and condition. He begat 
us : we are his children, and, there- 
fore, w.e owe full allegiance to him. 
And we have learned through the 
revelations of God in the latter 
days, particularly in the 76th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

that the worlds that have been cre- 
ated have inhabitants and that they 
are "begotten sons and daughters 
unto God." No matter who may 
have been their immediate progeni- 
tors, they all center up to the great 
Eternal Father, Jesus Christ's 
Father, Jesus 'Christ's God, and our 
Father and our God; and when we 
pray, we pray to him, and to him 
we owe full allegiance because he is 
our God and our King and our Cre- 
ator and our Father. Of course, 
when I use the term "creator," or 
"creation," I take the interpreta- 
tion of the prophet Joseph Smith,- 
who said the term meant organizer, 
or organization, as the case might 
be. The term "create" had been 
used to signify something made out 
of nothing, and the prophet Joseph 
dissipated that fallacy while he 
dwelt with us in the flesh. So we 
understand that when, the word 
"create" is used, it means to organ- 
ize, to bring together existent, eter- 
nally existent atoms for the spe- 
cial purpose for which they are 
organized. Now these are among 
a great number of truths that the 
Lord has revealed to us through the 
prophet Joseph Smith, and we 
should keep that in mind and re- 
member him, as we should always 
remember Jesus, the Savior, the 
Christ, as taught to us this morning 
by President Lund in his remarks 
concerning the form used in the 
Sacrament. We should always re- 
member him, not that we desire to 
bow down and worship him, but we 
should honor him in his place, as we 
should all who are called upon to 
occupy a similar position succeeding 
him in the ministry. 

I was pleased to hear the testi- 
mony of President Smith, this 
morning, concerning his holding the 
keys which were revealed' to the 



prophet Joseph Smith and have 
been handed own to his successors ; 
and Joseph F. Smith holds them 
today, as Joseph the prophet held 
them, and he stands at our head as 
the President of the Church, and we 
look to him as the end of contro- 
versy. We ought not really to have 
controversy in our Church, because 
the revelations of God are so clear 
and plain to us, if we will read them 
with an understanding mind and a 
desire to receive them as they are 
given. We should not read to find 
fault or to pick flaws or to make ap- 
parent contradictions, but receive 
them in our souls and not only "re- 
ceive" but "conceive" the word of 
life as brother Heber C. Kimball 
used to teach. Some of our breth- 
ren get so anxious to make apparent 
contradictions that they will take 
passages of scripture from ancient 
and from modern writ, and I was 
going to say, invent, and put them 
in such a position that they appear 
to conflict, and then they want the 
President of the Church to ex- 
pound the matter to them' and to 
search through the scriptures and 
point out to them where they can 
find support for their notions and 
ideas. 

The President alluded to some of 
these things this morning, and the 
counsel he gave to us is very perti- 
nent and very necessary at the 
present time, and if our brethren, 
and some few of our sisters, per- 
haps, would quit this quibbling, 
when they search, when they seek, 
they will be sure to find. If they 
are seeking for contradictions, they 
will find them, but if they are seek- 
ing for the word of life, they will 
find it, and they will rejoice therein, 
and everything will be clear and 
plain before their minds. In that I 
delight, and I rejoice in the gospel 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of Jesus Christ as it has been re- 
vealed to us in these latter days be- 
cause of its plainness. I am one 
with the prophet Nephi in this re- 
spect. He said, "My soul delight- 
eth in plainness," and this has been 
a joy to me ever since I first heard 
the gospel. 

When I first learned anything 
about such a person as Joseph Smith 
I read about him in a book written 
by a Frenchman, who was present 
when Joseph Smith preached to 
some Indians, and he related the 
circumstances and there was some- 
thing in that narration that fasci- 
nated me before I heard the gospel 
preached in the latter days ; and 
then when I did hear it, that same 
feeling and spirit entered my soul, 
and I desired to know more about 
this Joseph Smith. I thank God 
that I did learn about him ; I thank 
God that when I heard the gospel 
preached, it found a place in my 
soul, I was prepared for it in that 
singular and simple way, and ever 
since that time there is something 
about the very name of Joseph 
Smith and his work and mission 
which thrills me in every part of 
my nature. I rejoice in bearing 
testimony, as I have done in many 
countries and at many times that 
Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet 
of the living God, that he lived a 
prophet, that he died — that is, his 
spirit left his body — as a prophet, 
that he is still ministering in that 
capacity where he has gone in a 
sphere shut out from our gaze, like 
our former estate is shut out from 
our vision. But he lives and he will 
be troubled no more by the tyrants 
that followed him ; he will be 
troubled no more with the false re- 
ports that were raised against his 
character ; he is troubled no more 



with the conflicts of life, for he had 
to fight up-stream all the time as he 
struggled along from year to year. 
But he has gone from the gaze of 
the world and from our gaze, for a 
time, and now is working in the 
world behind the veil, in that vast 
sphere where there are so many of 
the children of God who have 
lived in the flesh and have gone be- 
fore us. His work is there now, 
while our work is still here, for a 
time, on this earth ; and he has left 
us a legacy in regard to those of our 
ancestors who did not receive the 
gospel. 

There is a great and glorious 
work given to the Latter-day Saints, 
not only to carry or send the gospel 
to all the nations of the earth, to 
every nation and kindred and 
tongue and people, but to labor for 
the salvation of their dead pro- 
genitors. What a mighty work is 
to be done for them, and how lit- 
tle we know of their actual condi- 
tion behind the veil ! No doubt what 
is revealed about the world of 
spirits is clear and true, so far as it 
goes. It is plain that when the spirit 
of man, which is the real person- 
ality, leaves the body, that spirit 
goes where it should go. There 
is a sort of preliminary judgment. 
We are told that we go home to 
the God that gave us life, just as we 
read in the old scriptures, "Then 
shall the dust return to the earth as 
it was, and the spirit shall return 
to God who gave it." Not that 
that means that we go to heaven, as 
is taught in the Christian world, in 
the immediate society and presence 
of the Father, but, we are told, we 
are consigned either to one part of 
that spirit world or to another, to 
the Paradise of God where the 
good go, where they rest from their 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



19 



toils and sorrows and labors and 
troubles, from all the evils that be- 
set them through the flesh. Freed 
from the body they are able to re- 
ceive further light and intelligence 
and to use the experience that they 
have gained for the benefit of one 
another, and also, like the Savior, 
for the benefit of those that go to 
the other part of that great world 
of spirits, the world where the 
wicked go and the corrupt. I have 
often thought it must be an aw- 
ful time as well as an awful 
place for the corrupt and wicked 
and abominable who loved and 
made a lie, while they dwelt in the 
flesh, and who committed all kinds 
of iniquity and corruption, when 
they are thus gathered together. 
What a company ! What associa- 
tions ! What misery there must be 
among them ! The good are gath- 
ered in Paradise, and the wicked 
are in Hades together. - 

Well, there is indeed a great field 
of labor for the sons of God, and 
perhaps the daughters of God, after 
they leave the body. They still are 
in the image of the Father and of 
the Son, and they have a work to 
perform in the great plan of human 
redemption ; for the time is to come 
when all shall be redeemed who 
can be redeemed. God is a great 
economist. Everything that can be 
saved will be saved, and only that 
which cannot be saved will be lost. 
This is because of the operation 
of eternal principles. After defy- 
ing the truth and loving lies, fight- 
ing against that which they once 
testified and knew to be true, being 
obsessed with malice and murder, 
justice claims them and because of 
that, they are not in the plan of re- 
demption ; they cannot receive the 
glory that shall come, even to the 
corrupt who repent and are raised 



to the telestial glory. They will 
not inherit even that glory. Quite 
a number of our brethren get 
tangled up about what is said of 
these "Sons of Perdition." In the 
76th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants we are told that all the 
rest but these sons of perdition 
shall come forth and be redeemed. 
That means they shall come forth 
in one of the three degrees of 
glory, the celestial or the terrestrial 
or the telestial. They have an idea 
that the sons of perdition will not 
be resurrected, because it says there 
that "all the rest shall be brought 
forth." 

I want to read to you just one 
verse from the Doctrine and. Cove- 
nants that I hope will set that little 
matter at rest so that there will be 
no misunderstanding or dispute con- 
cerning it. It is in the 88th section, 
which is a most glorious revelation 
from God to the prophet Joseph 
Smith. They are all good, they are 
all glorious, but there are some 
more especially so to me, and this 
is one of them. I regard the 76th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants as the most glorious revela- 
tion concerning the future condi- 
tion of mankind that has ever been 
put into print. I hope you have 
read it, all of you, and that you 
still will read it, and that those who 
have not studied it will study it 
thoroughly. Now I will not read 
the whole of this section that re- 
lates to the resurrection. You will 
find it from the 25th to the 31st 
verses of this 88th section about 
the celestial glory and the terres- 
trial glory and the telestial glory as 
you will also read about them in the 
76th section. This is a later rev- 
elation. Now, after speaking of 
those that shall come forth and be 
quickened by the celestial glory, 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and then those that shall come 
forth, being quickened by the ter- 
restrial glory, and the rest who 
shall receive the telestial glory, it 
says in the 32nd verse. 

"And they who remain shall also 
be quickened ; nevertheless, they 
shall return again to their own 
place, to enjoy that which they are 
willing to receive, because they 
were not willing to enjoy that which 
thev might have received." 

This shows that there are four 
groups of resurrected beings, those 
that are quickened by the celes- 
tial glory, because they obeyed ce- 
lestial laws, those who are quick- 
ened by the terrestial glory because 
they received not the gospel in the 
flesh and yet many of them were 
honorable people — they shall be 
quickened by the terrestial glory, 
and then the rest that remain, the 
corrupt and the wicked and the 
abominable, who, after having paid 
the uttermost farthing, of their 
debts of sin, are brought forth, they 
also shall be quickened and receive 
the telestial glory. But then those 
that remain, who are they? They 
are those that are not redeemed into 
one of these glories. In the due 
time of the Lord they also shall be 
ouickened, but they shall return to 
their own place, and that "own 
place," we are told, is with the 
devil and his angels, and the height 
and the extent and the depth and 
the end of their punishment no man 
knoweth, for the Lord does not re- 
veal it except to a very few, and 
tb.en he shuts up the vision he says. 
So now, brethren, if any of you 
have got a little tangled up over 
these passages of scripture, in the 
76th section let that pass and take 
this that I have just read to you, 
and read that with the other, and 



you will have the matter all 
straight. 

In these plain and simple things 
which we have received from God, 
from the great Eternal Father by 
revelation through his Prophets, 
and particularly through the great 
Prophet of the latter days, Joseph 
Smith, they certainly ought to place 
us on a firm foundation and give us 
rest and peace in our souls. Therein 
is one of the grand heauties of the 
Church to which we belong, the 
rioctrines that we have received. 
We know, we are convinced of 
them, we are not in any doubt about 
them if we have received them in 
the right spirit. They have estab- 
lished themselves in our very being, 
they are a part of us. We live in 
them, and they live in us, as min- 
isters of the Lord, setting that 
which the Lord has revealed for us 
to do, first in all our labors and 
duties. I thank the Lord that that 
ideal was planted in my soul when 
I received the gospel in my boy- 
hood, that this was the first thing 
under the sun, above father or 
mother or wife or children or 
houses or lands or possessions of 
any kind that is earthly, the king- 
dom first, the truth triumphant, the 
truth before all things, to learn it 
and to live it. 

This has been my desire from the 
very beginning, and I have tried to 
carry it out in my life, and therein 
I have had inexpressable joy and 
intense satisfaction. The confi- 
dence that I have and have felt in 
regard to this work has been a joy 
to me so that I know that my Re- 
deemer liveth, and that he shall 
stand on the earth in the latter days 
and bring glory and honor and full 
reward to all who serve him and 
keep the commandments which he 
has given to us, which are the com- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



21 



mandments of the Father. I know 
that these things are true, I haven't 
any doubt concerning them. In that 
certainly there is peace, something 
to rely upon; something depend- 
able, something thati doesn't need 
any quibbling or questioning or 
doubt or. uncertainty, but convic- 
tion, the full conviction in my soul 
of the truth. And I have been able 
to bear that truth to others and that 
very certainty that sounded in my 
voice has carried conviction, thank 
the Lord, to many others in my 
travels and labors in the ministry. 
And this is what we all need, my 
brethren, the firm and solid convic- 
tion in our own souls that we have 
received the truth and that this 
priesthood and authority which the 
Lord has sent to the earth in the 
latter days through the prophet 
Joseph Smith is a reality. It is that 
which the President talked about 
this morning, the Priesthood after 
the order of the Son of God, which 
is without beginning of days or end 
of years, which existed ages upon 
ages before this world and others 
of its kind rolled into being. It is 
without beginning and without end. 
It is the power of God. It con- 
tains the light of truth. It carries 
authority to administer in the name 
of the Lord, and those ministra- 
tions, when properly observed and 
administered, are just as though 
the Father or the Son or some other 
great being had ministered them in 
person. That is the beauty of this 
authority which the Lord has re- 
vealed to us. Now in that we carry 
with us, wherever we go, the power 
of God to administer in his name, 
and it is effectual, and what we do 
on earth is counted for something 
in heaven, what we seal on earth is 
sealed in heaven ; what we loose on 
earth, when it is properly done, is 



loosed in heaven; and what is re- 
corded here is recorded there, al- 
though the manner of recording 
has not been told to us. 

There is another thing connected 
with this that we ought to under- 
stand fully in our minds, and that 
is that the time will come, according 
to the revelations of God, concern- 
ing the resurrection, that judgment 
will be given into the hands of men 
who hold that priesthood, so that 
what they do in the judgment will 
be as though done by the Father or 
by the Son. John, the apostle, in 
that beautiful revelation that is 
placed last in the New Testament, 
in the 20th chapter, 4th verse, says : 
"I saw thrones, and they sat upon 
them, and judgment was given 
unto them; and I saw the souls of 
them that were beheaded for the 
witness of Jesus,' 'and so on, "and 
they lived and reigned with Christ 
a thousand years." Judgment was 
given unto them! What does it 
mean? It meansi just what Jesus 
told the twelve apostles when he 
was with them in the flesh, that 
they who remained with him and 
traveled with him in the regenera- 
tion should sit upon twelve thrones 
and judge the twelve tribes of 
Israel; and what the Lord told his 
twelve disciples on this continent, 
and they also should receive similar 
power and authority. And the apos- 
tles of old, the apostle Paul par- 
ticularly, wrote about the saints 
even judging angels. So judgment 
is to be given into the hands of 
men who have received this priest- 
hood, and who have exhibited be- 
fore God and angels their capacity 
and the justice and equity and 
righteousness of decision, when 
they have had to sit in judgment 
upon others. 

Jesus, the Christ, in giving that 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



beautiful sermon that has been al- 
luded to today, the Sermon on the 
Mount, in the 7th chapter of Mat- 
thew, you can read it, said to the 
multitude, "Judge not that ye be not 
judged, for with what judgment ye 
judge, ye shall he judged, and the 
measure ye mete out to others shall 
be measured to you again." But 
judgment, to a great extent, is 
given into the hands of certain 
quorums and councils in this 
Church. One body to exercise judg- 
ment is the bishopric, the bishopric 
of a ward] are appointed and or- 
dained to be judges. A bishop is a 
common judge in Israel to sit with 
his counselors in judgment upon 
transgressors and upon those whose 
difficulties cannot be settled by the 
teachers who visit them in their 
hpmes. That arbitration power 
which is given to the teachers is a 
splendid thing, and it should be 
used 'when necessary. I was glad 
to hear President Smith say this 
morning he didn't have to call any- 
body in to settle his difficulties, he 
settled them himself. Thank the 
Lord, I have never had to call in 
teachers or a bishopric to settle any 
troubles that I have had. I feel 
like he does. I would rather give 
a little than want to take it all. I 
would rather suffer something than 
to do something that was wrong. 
But we do have difficulties in the 
Church, and the Saints should be 
willing to refer them to good men 
who go to their homes to teach 
them. I wish they always did teach 
when they go to the homes of the 
members, but we will pass that by. 
They should call in these good men 
if they have any difficulty they can- 
not settle with their neighbors, or 
with members of their own fam- 
ilies, committing it to the judgment 
of these good, wise men and do 



what they say is the right thing, 
even though they may have to, 
what you would call, sacrifice some- 
thing. But when this can't be done, 
satisfactorily, the bishop and his 
counselors can sit as common 
judges in Israel, and determine the 
rights of the conflicting parties, 
also the duties of men or women 
who are charged with transgres- 
sion. 

Now, brethren and sisters, what 
the Savior meant was that you and 
I, in our capacity as individuals, as 
members, outside of any official 
duty imposed upon us, should not 
sit in judgment upon one another. 
And yet we do it, and sometimes 
we say things about one another 
that we are not justified in saying. 
Some of our people do sit in judg- 
ment, even upon the President of 
the Church, and find fault with 
him. Of course, they are only a 
few, comparatively, but it is an- 
noying to hear anybody talk as 
some people talk concerning him, 
and concerning the president of the 
stake, or the bishop of the ward 
where they live. It is not our prov- 
ince as members of the Church, 
to sit in judgment upon one an- 
other and call bad names when we 
reflect upon the acts of people. We 
have no right, even if we are in of- 
ficial capacity, to form a one-sided 
judgment. There are two sides to 
every such question, if not more, 
always ; and we should hear both, 
"hear defense before deciding, and 
a ray of light may gleam, showing 
thee what filth is hiding underneath 
the shallow stream." Hear the 
other side before you begin to find 
fault, and pass judgment. Do not 
let us pass judgment upon our fel- 
low creatures, our brothers and sis- 
ters, or even people in the world. 
Let us look into our own souls and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



23 



find out our own defects, we will 
find them there if we look for them. 
He that seeketh findeth, but it de^ 
pends upon what you are seeking. 
You can always find something that 
you are seeking for. If you are 
seeking for the good, you will find 
it; if you are seeking for the bad, 
you will find it, sure enough, if you 
keep on ; but don't let us sit in judg- 
ment upon one another. Forgive 
one another of all our faults, as the 
Lord has commanded us, in our 
hearts, not merely with our lips, 
but in our hearts, and if we do not 
forgive one another, in our hearts, 
the Lord says we commit the 
greater sin. So when we are called 
upon to sit in judgment, either in 
a bishop's court or in a high coun- 
cil, (to which the decisions of the 
bishop's court may be appealed) if 
we are members of the high coun- 
cil, just remember what the Lord 
has said concerning such quorum or 
council. Every decision of these 
quorums that are organized must 
be given in justice, in righteous- 
ness in equity, in the fear of the 
Lord, and with the desire to do 
what is right, not out of personal 
feeling. Personal feelings ought to 
he banished from our squIs when 
we sit in judgment having the right 
to sit in judgment. The bishop's 
courts and the high councils have 
the right to sit in judgment, but it 
must be reached by testimony, not 
through any feelings or thoughts 
we may have in regard to the ini- 
quity of some individual. Sit in 
judgment in righteousness, ac- 
cording to evidence ! 

If we were to sit in judgment 
upon all the rumors that come to 
us in the President's office, we 
should have a very poor opinion of 
a good many men and women in Is- 
rael ; but we have to hear both sides 



and then we don't pretend to take 
the place of the bishop's co.urt or 
high council. I want to say that 
for the benefit of my brothers and 
sisters who seem to think that the 
President of the Church should de- 
cide on all these little matters of dif- 
ficulty that come ,up as in matters of 
doctrine, and that it is his job to sit 
in judgment on these matters, and 
give them a decision, and then back 
it up by Scripture. The President 
of this Church doesn't need to back 
up what he says by ancient Scrip- 
ture. He has the word of the Lord 
to us in this dispensation, just as- 
the prophets of old had to the peo- 
ple among whom they lived. Now, 
brothers and sisters, if you have 
something against your neighbor, 
or your neighbor has something 
against you, try and settle it peace- 
ably if you can, but if not, do not 
send it up to the First Presidency. 
Go to the bishop of your ward and 
get the matter settled by the bishop. 
But if you are so stubborn and self- 
willed and so self-opinioned that 
you think the bishop doesn't know 
as much as you do, then appeal it 
up to the high council, and if there 
is any unrighteousness in the de- 
cision of your high council, that can 
be looked over and examined by the 
Presidency of the Church, and they 
can decide; what is to be done in 
the matter, in regard to having a 
new trial or whatever the case may 
be ; that belongs to them but not 
till then. Do not keep writing up 
to the First Presidency about your 
little difficulties and trials that can 
he settled right in your own local- 
ity, but get the proper authorities, 
the, local authorities, to attend to 
them and save us a great deal of 
trouble. 

Now, brethren, men of God, 
holding the holy priesthood who 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have the right to sit in judgment, 
have got to do that in the way that 
the Lord has appointed. You are 
not to call names, nor to speak evil 
of your neighbors. It is right for 
them to give them a chance to speak 
in their own defense before you 
make up a decision in your mind, 
let alone anything else, and then 
always do what the spirit of the 
Lord and the judgment that you re- 
ceive and the testimony that is pre- 
sented make clear to you what 
should be done and do it fear- 
lesssly, and in honor and in truth, 
and the Lord will be with you and 
good will be the result, and then 
when the time comes that judgment 
is to be given to men of God in the 
world to come, why, it will be the 
kind of men in whom judgment 
can be properly vested. They will 
represent the Father and the Son as 
they do here on earth. The great 
judgment that is to come will not be 
altogether performed by one indi- 
vidual sitting upon a great white 
throne and passing judgment upon 
the millions upon, millions of the 
earth's inhabitants. God's house is 
a house of order, and the Lord will 
have agents appointed as he has 
now behind the veil as well as in 
the flesh, and when the great judg- 
ment comes, all will be judged ac- 
cording to their works, and the 
hooks will be opened, and the Book 
of Life will be scanned and the 
man's acts and the women's acts 
upon the earth will be disclosed, 
and we will all confess in our souls 
that the judgment is just and 
righteous, because it will be uttered 
and delivered by one having au- 
thority and the seal of God will be 
upon it. 

Now, while we dwell on earth in 
the flesh, let us take the good coun- 
sel that we get from our brethren, 



and particularly that we had this 
mor'ning tfrom our President. 1 1 
enjoyed his remarks to the people. 
I bear testimony that they were 
true, and if we will live by those 
words of God, that were delivered 
to us this morning, our path will 
be comparatively a path of peace; 
the sunshine of the Lord will beam 
upon our souls; we will have joy 
and satisfaction and contentment 
and full reliance, and we will not be 
shaken. We will stand firmly upon 
the rock of revelation and God will 
guide our footsteps in the way of 
life and by and by we will learn 
the things that we forgot when we 
came on the earth in the flesh, and 
we will retain all the light and truth 
and experience gained while in 
mortality, and if we are faithful to 
the last, we will shine forth in the 
presence of the Father like the stars 
of the heavens, and like the sun, 
forever and ever. And of the in- 
crease of our glory and our happi- 
ness and our peace and our domin- 
ions and our posterity, there will he 
no end. God help us to attain that 
great salvation, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah." 

PREST. FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

There shall be no inactive Latter-day 
Saints — -Spiritualities as important 
as temporalities; people should be 
active in both — The authorities of 
the Church, the stakes and the wards, 
examples of thriving activity — Every 
member of the Priesthood should be 
active in like manner — Of what ac- 
tivity consists — The sisters should 
be also occupied in good work — 
Duty of stake presidencies to fur- 
nish employment for all officials and 
members of the Priesthood, and this

25 



is also a duty of the bishops for 
those under their care — How every 
Latter-day Saint may be kept busy 
— What stake of Zion will be first to 
report the Priesthood all active in 
that stake? — A strong injunction to 
stir up and look after the inactive 
members of the Church. 

I hope that you can hear me as 
we have heard our brethren. Their 
voices have been good, and I am 
sure that we have been greatly ed- 
ified in listening to them. In look- 
ing over this body of Latter-day 
Saints, representing the various de- 
partments of Zion, I could not help 
thinking what a privilege is given 
us to come together to see and to be 
seen, to hear and to be heard. This 
body of people is not very large, 
considering the whole of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, but I take it for 
granted that all who are here and 
all who attend our conferences are 
active members of the Church, and 
not numbered among the inactive. 
This privilege we have of speaking 
to the representatives of the various 
stakes of Zion and missions in the 
United States, is a very great priv- 
ilege, -for when we talk, what is 
said will be taken to all the depart- 
ments of the Church in gathered 
Zion. 

I have had occasion latterly to 
draw the attention of the brethren 
in various stakes of Zion to the re- 
ports that we receive in regard to 
the priesthood throughout the 
Church. The numbers that are ac- 
tive, and also the numbers that are 
inactive, are reported to us, and I 
have taken the privilege of advising 
my brethren such as sit before me 
here, — presidents of stakes and 
high councilors, bishops and heads 
of departments, — how to correct, 
measurably, the reports that are 
handed in to the Presiding Bishop's 
office and that are submitted to us. 



The fact is, there should be no in- 
active Latter-day Saints, for inac- 
tivity tends to death and darkness, 
whereas activity tends to life and 
animation and salvation. We be- 
lieve that it is quite possible for you 
brethren who are leaders in the 
communities where you live, as we 
are here where we live, to set good 
examples, and !not any bad ones, 
and that your good examples will 
be followed by the priesthood with 
whom you are surrounded and with 
whom, you labor. If we ca-n get 
you to understand and discover how 
to make correction of unsatisfactory 
conditions, it will be very profitable 
to you and to the Church, as well 
as to all who are brought into active 
service for the Lord every day. We 
are all industrious and persevering 
in regard to the things of this 
world, what we call temporal things, 
things of earth, which call for a 
good share of our attention; and it 
is just as important, and a little 
more so, that we should be indus- 
trious and occupied with the spirit- 
ualities, the religious side of our 
natures, and the service which the 
Lord requires of us for our salva- 
tion and the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men. There is no-inactivity 
with the Presidency of this Church; 
there is no inactivity with the coun- 
cil of the twelve ; there is no inac- 
tivity with the council of seventies ; 
there is no inactivity with the pre- 
siding bishopric; there is no inac- 
tivity with the presiding patriarch. 
So that the general authorities of 
the Church, I am prompted to ad- 
vise you, in this regard are setting 
a proper example, and we are read- 
ily and easily found on all occasions 
when we are needed and we are at 
your service. Four times a year we 
go to every stake of Zion as nearly 
as we can. The general authorities 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Church are not very numer- 
ous, not a very large body of breth- 
ren, and we have seventy-two stakes 
of Zion and a great many hundreds 
of wards to give attention to, as 
well as to all the missions of the 
world. They must be taken care 
of and considered and kept supplied 
with officials. We must supply the 
world with missionaries by the hun- 
dreds and thousands to preach the 
gospel, and they go out from tinder 
our hands thoroughly advised, thor- 
oughly instructed and taught in re- 
gard to their duties. So with the 
brethren who are selected to pre- 
side over the stakes and over the 
wards, we give special attention to 
every man, as well as in the mis- 
sjons ; and thus we are active, al- 
ways. I believe that the presiden- 
cies of the stakes of Zion are always 
active. -We speak of them as active 
men. The bishops of the wards and 
their counselors are active men. I 
think the high councilors, as a rule, 
are active men. So that these 
brethren, standing at the head of 
the people, are thoroughly well em- 
ployed. But we do think and we 
do ask you, my brethren, who sit 
before us here today, from the vari- 
ous stakes of Zion, we want to ask 
you to see to it that every member 
of the priesthood is brought into 
active service, that is, that they do 
something every day. They may 
not all be called to be ward teach- 
ers, they will not all be called to be 
bishop's counselors, or high coun- 
cilors ; but there is no reason why a 
man bearing the divine authority of 
the Lord should ever be inactive 
one day. He should be able to re- 
port, and it be reported of him by 
his bishop, by the president of his 
quorum, that he is active, that he 
is performing some service, that he 
is intelligent enough to find employ- 



ment, and that he does not have to 
be told everything that is to be done. 
It is quite an accomplishment for a 
high priest or a seventy, for an 
elder, or any other person bearing 
the priesthood of the Lord, to learn 
the lesson of employing himself. 
And whenever m«n say something, 
whenever they do something that is 
worthy of imitation, and that sets 
an example in the community of 
virtue, of righteousness and of truth 
and of justice, they are entitled to 
be considered active. Whenever 
they say to a little boy, "The Lord 
bless you, my little boy, George, or 
John, or Joseph," or a, little girl, 
school children, anybody — or they 
have restrained a person that is in- 
clined to be reckless and disobe- 
dient, a transgressor in any line, 
whenever they have restrained 
those who are going astray, when- 
ever they give encouragement to 
those who need it, whenever they 
,open their mouths and bless, as 
President Smith suggested this 
morning, ( he having the keys of the 
kingdom and the keys of authority 
and power to bless,) — that should 
be regarded as activity in the ser- 
vice of the Lord. We all have 
power to bless and to give instruc- 
tion and to teach. I speak thus in 
regard to the brethren bearing the 
priesthood. 

I want to say also, although we 
are just a small representation of 
the Church here — yet it is a good 
congregation — not a large body of 
men, that the Church is well stocked 
with a numerous number of men 
bearing the priesthood. Almost all 
the male members of the Church 
bear the Aaronic or the Melchiz- 
c'ek priesthood, and how grateful 
these brethren should be ! Then the 
wives should be as industrious and 
active as the brethren, and so far as 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



27 



I remember, there is no report in 
our official accounts and records, of 
the inactive women. Presumably 
the sisters are all active, they are 
engaged, they are active teachers 
in their homes and in their asso- 
ciations and organizations, and are 
performing their duties fairly well. 
I don't know whether the bishop is 
particularly favorable to the sisters, 
and does not tell us of those things, 
or whether he does not report that 
the sisters are inactive, but I pre- 
sume that the sisters in this Church 
are, as a rule, very active, well oc- 
cupied, their time well taken up and 
occupied in good things. I hope 
so ; it should be so. But they need 
to labor, and their activities are just 
as much required with our sisters 
who are married and the young sis- 
ters who are not married. They are 
to labor among them and what they 
say and what they do and the good 
examples that they set in all the 
activities of life are just as impor- 
tant and valuable with their sex as 
the labors of the brethren are impor- 
tant and valuable among the breth- 
ren and the people generally. And 
I want to impress this upon my 
brethren: There is no one of us 
hardly that can visit all the brethren 
and teach them all the same lessons, 
but we give them the lessons here 
occasionally, twice a year, such as 
we have been listening to. 

I want to advise my brethren who 
preside over the stakes of Zion, sev- 
enty-two stakes, it is your duty to 
furnish employment for all stake 
officials and all men who bear the 
priesthood, that you furnish them 
occupation as far as possible and 
help them and devise means for 
their activities. Use the bishops, 
and help the bishops to bring about 
activity with their brethren, for I 
say that it is a reproach to the presi- 



dency of a stake, to the bishops of 
wards, when they have to report in- 
active men, whom they have en- 
trusted with the priesthood under 
the direction of the Lord, and have 
not found a way to give them em- 
ployment and make them active 
men. You don't need to worry par- 
ticularly about the officials. You 
.will find that the officials are pretty 
well occupied, pretty well employed, 
but the overwhelming, majority of 
the brethren who bear the priest- 
hood could possibly make consider- 
able improvement and increase their 
activities and take valuable lessons 
to the people. Those who are inat- 
tentive and careless in regard to the 
exhortations that have been given 
us today, in regard to their prayers, 
in regard to partaking of the sacra- 
ment, in regard to their tithes and 
offerings and so forth, they need to 
be aroused and stirred up, for their 
salvation, for their happiness, for 
their peace, their success and their 
prosperity in this life; for the Lord 
rewards us according to our works, 
I understand, and you will be re- 
warded, we will be rewarded ac- 
cording to our works, and it is im- 
portant that we look after the sal- 
vation of the people, half of whom 
are compared to the foolish virgins 
by the Savior, — five wise and five 
foolish. We want to make more 
wise Saints and servants of the 
Lord. We do not want them to be 
hampered ; we do not want them to 
be in questionable conditions and 
positions. We want them to be 
thoroughly established in the faith ; 
we want them to so live that they 
can keep and do keep the command- 
ments of the Lord, for that is the 
secret of their success ; for when a 
man is inactive, he will not be saved. 
He must be occupied, he must be 
employed, he must work, he must

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



labor, or he will be found delinquent 
and will be disappointed when the 
judgment comes. So I say to my 
brethren, these chief brethren in the 
stakes of Zion and in the wards and 
in all the departments, standing at 
the head of quorums of the priest- 
hood, we expect you to be respon- 
sible and to be wise enough to pro- 
vide means to employ the brethren 
and occupy them at home, when 
they don't go abroad, and we will 
find service for them abroad in the 
world, all that we can well take 
care! of. And so I desire to im- 
press upon my brethren presiding 
in these positions that the time may 
soon come — you are telling us now 
every three months what is being 
done by the teachers and whether 
they are coming up to one hundred 
per cent of visiting, when we want 
one hundred per cent of activity in 
all departments. Look over the field 
and discover if your brethren are 
occupied actively, so that there will 
be no high priests that are inactive, 
no seventies inactive, no elders in- 
active. The presidency of the high 
priests is responsible to see that the 
high priests are taken care of. In 
some of these large stakes of Zion 
they have a very large force of high 
priests. Then the seventies have 
their quorums and the elders theirs, 
and it is the duty of the brethren 
who preside, to look after them and 
help them ; as we help our brethren. 
You will find the Twelve will not 
complain that Brother Lyman does 
not find something for them to do. 
They are occupied all the time, reg- 
ularly. You see they go to you and 
they help you, and we want you to 
be taking as good care of the de- 
partment of the Church entrusted 
to you as w,e are taking of the de- 
partment entrusted to us. We are 
always on the line, on the firing line, 



going to the front, as far as we 
can make it, and we want you 
brethren to do the same. We will 
be delighted with the first stake of 
Zion that can represent that the 
priesthood in that stake are all ac- 
tive, no inactive members ; that the 
high priests and seventies and elders 
and the lesser priesthood under the 
direction of the bishops can be re- 
ported as all active. Give the boys 
something to do with the older 
brethren. Don't take all the rights 
and privileges of teachers away 
from the deacons and teachers and 
the priests and give it all to the high 
priests and to the seventies and the 
elders ; but let the boys go with you. 
Prav with them, labor with them, 
teach them, so that when they come 
to the age of marriage, settling 
down or going on missions and re- 
ceive the Melchizedek priesthood, 
that they have had some experience, 
that they know how to pray, how to 
bless the food, ,how to bless the 
sacrament, administer it properly, 
and so forth, well instructed, well 
informed, well read in the scrip- 
tures. Call a young man an active 
young man if he studies the scrip- 
tures, and do not call him inactive ; 
for if he is studying and qualifying 
and preparing himself for future 
life, that is magnificent activity and 
his example will help others, and 
he will naturally incline and en- 
courage others to follow his good 
example in the study of the scrip- 
tures. If all the Latter-day Saint 
boys and girls are well informed in 
scripture reading, if they know the 
testament and know the Bible and 
know the scriptures of the Nephites 
and the scriptures of latter-times, 
the revelations through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and so forth, they are 
well fortified. But let the effort be 
made to make a better report than 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



29 



we have succeeded in doing in the 
past in regard to the activities of 
the priesthood and of the people. 
Let us do that. And we want the as- 
sistance of our sisters therein, as 
well as of the brethren. We want 
every one to have an opportunity, 
and I believe that there is no excuse 
for any member of the priesthood in 
this Church or any member of this 
Church being reported as inactive, 
because there is opportunity in 
every person's way, for activity to 
labor. And I want to say this, it 
will not tax you so much that you 
need to neglect your temporal af- 
fairs or your business affairs. It 
won't injure you in your business 
affairs to be prayerful. It won't 
hurt you at all to spend the time 
that is necessary on the Sabbath 
day to partake of the sacrament, 
and the sacrament should be taken 
by all Latter-day Saints'. There is 
an activity there and everybody who 
partakes of the sacrament should be 
considered an active member in the 
Church. Every one who attends to 
his prayers and responsibilities 
thereof should be counted an active 
member ; every one who bears testi- 
mony in the fast meetings, and 
takes any part in praying or sing- 
ing. I would not like to see the 
brethren and sisters who do the 
singing for us in this splendid choir, 
when it is here — I understand it is 
to be here Sunday — -considered as 
inactive, I think they are active 
members of the Church and should 
be so reported;- if they hear the 
priesthood or are only members of 
the Church, they should be reported 
and considered active and given all 
the credit that can reasonably be 
given to the members of the Church, 
for it is a nice thing for one to be 
patted a little on the back, a little 
on the shoulder, say, the Lord bless 



you; glad to know of your activi- 
ties ; glad to know what you are 
doing; I am glad to know of your 
life as a husband, or your life as a 
wife and your life as a son, one of 
the larger boys, one of the larger 
girls; that your example, your la- 
bors and activities are very delight- 
ful and pleasing to us, certainly to 
the Lord, and profitable — profitable, 
for there is not anything that we do 
for the Lord that will not redound 
to our health and our happiness and 
our stability and security and safety. 
So I want to impress upon my 
brethren, as there are stake presi- 
dents here who have already heard 
my talk on this subject in their 
stakes, as I have not been able to 
get to all the stakes of Zion, but all 
that are here can hear the sugges- 
tions that I make at this time, and I 
want to impress them and want 
them impressed upon the minds of 
the leading brethren, that they will 
magnify their calling; for if they 
are active as they should be, they 
will furnish employment and find 
something, find some way to advise 
inactive men in the future, until 
every man shall be doing some- 
thing. Men grow by activity, by 
their labor, their efforts and their 
work ; not by inactivity. The more 
they work, the more they do, as I 
suggest sometimes to my brethren 
when we require something extra 
of them, and something extra is re- 
quired of them occasionally, I al- 
ways draw their attention to the 
fact that that is what you are to 
be rewarded for is the work that 
you are doing. Don't feel bad 
about it because you are doing 
more than somebody else. Do all 
that you can for it will take all that 
we can do to work out our salvation 
and exaltation in the kingdom of 
God. You want to be busy, in order 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to be occupied. And these who are 
inactive, brethren, we want you to 
take care of them because they are 
in danger of being lost, losing the 
faith and losing their love of the 
truth and of the gospel. It is a 
great thing to enjoy the spirit of the 
gospel, for that brings peace, it 
brings security and life and salva- 
tion. We cannot accomplish these 
thingg without the Lord helps us, 
and he is ready and willing and 
generous to bestow upon us his 
spirit in just such abundance as we 
are ready and prepared to receive; 
for the Spirit of the Lord is as gen- 
erous and as ready at our necessi- 
ties and commands through our 
faithfulness, as the light of day, as 
the heat of the sun, and the cold and 
the warmth, and so forth. The Lord 
is near us by his Spirit and his 
Spirit is ready for our possession 
and for us to enjoy in our homes, 
in our labors, in our work, publicly 
and privately, at home or abroad. 
When we live under the inspiration 
and light of the Spirit of God, we 
will be happy wherever we are, and 
we will accomplish a world of good 
and those who are about us and as- 
sociate with us will enjoy the spirit 
that we enjoy and will recognize it. 
Now, I have occupied my time as 
well as the other brethren. I thank 
you, brethren, for your attention, 
and I would like you to remember 
what we say — what the Presidency 
have said to us today. It is worth 
the time of coming here and spend- 
ing a few days to hear what they 
have said, and the other brethren 
will have things to suggest that will 
refresh also and that we will in- 
tensely enjoy. God bless you, breth- 
ren and sisters, who are here, and 
bless those brethren just like you 
who are at home and bless those 
brethren and sisters who are at 



home that cannot come who need 
consideration and attention. It is 
the sick that need attention. Those 
who are always here, right up to the 
mark, we need not worry about 
them at all, because they know how 
to employ themselves and to be oc- 
cupied and to be saved, but those 
who are not present and those who 
do not come to the sacramental 
table on the Sabbath day, whatever 
the percentage is in your ward, in 
your stake, those who are not there 
are the ones that need attention and 
consideration. Those who are al- 
ways active will take care of them- 
selves ; they know how to employ 
themselves, well occupied, but look 
after those who need your attention 
and care, please, so that you can re- 
port that there is not anybody in 
your ward but what has attention 
and consideration and are in line, as 
near as it is possible for them to be. 
I bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Thankfulness for the plan of Life and 
Salvation — Willingness to labor in 
positions without thought of re- 
signing — The greatest service men 
may render is to bring souls to a 
knowledge of the gospel — A plea 
for parents to look well after their 
children. 

I am very happy to have the op- 
portunity of again mingling with 
the Saints at a general conference. 
I rejoice in a testimony of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. Between the 
morning and afternoon meetings, I 
have had the privilege of attending 
the funeral of the mother of the 
President of the stake where I re- 
side, Sister Margaret W. Young. 
I never attend a funeral of a faith- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



31 



ful member of the Church but I 
thank the Lordl for the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and for the comfort 
and consolation that it gives to us in 
the hour of sorrow and death. I 
am convinced that the Latter-day 
Saints do not suffer as other people 
do when they are called upon to 
part by death with their loved ones. 
I never think of my own beloved 
mother without thinking of her as 
associated with those whom she 
knew and loved in Nauvoo, and 
with those whom she knew and 
loved in these valleys of the moun- 
tains. I never think of her as in the 
grave, but I think of her as one who 
has earned the greatest of all God's 
gifts to man, namely: life eternal. 
When I' attend the funeral of a 
faithful, true Latter-day Saint, as I 
did today, one who heard the sound 
of the gospel in a foreign land, and 
who came to this land for the gos- 
pel's sake and who lived all the 
days of her life faithful and true to 
its teachings, I am indeed thankful 
for the plan of life and salvation 
which finds earnest, true people all 
over the wide world who, when they 
have embraced it, are ready and 
willing to make any sacrifice in 
reason to fulfil the duties, the ob- 
ligations and the requirements that 
devolve upon them as members in 
the Church of Christ. 

I thoroughly enjoy my labors, as 
one of the general authorities of the 
Church, in visiting the various 
stakes of Zion. I find, as a rule, 
integrity and devotion and love of' 
the work of the Lord in the hearts 
those who preside and a desire on 
their part to labor that is very pleas- 
ing indeed to me. I regret, how- 
ever, that there is a growing ten- 
dency, as was referred to here by 
the President this morning, for 
many to desire to step down and out 



who occupy places of responsibility. 
I believe that the spirit which pos- 
sessed the people thirty-six years 
ago to remain in office as long as 
wanted is not as strong as 
it was then. When, as a> young 
man, I was made the president of 
the Tooele stake, although I con- 
sidered it quite a financial sacrifice 
to be president, and to have to leave 
my business here which was rea- 
sonably prosperous — it never en- 
tered my head but what I was to 
stay there all the days of my life. 
I never thought of anything else. 
I remember, however, saying to 
President Lyman : "Brother Ly- 
man, I am willing to have you send 
me on a mission for ten years, with 
the understanding that when the ten 
years are up, I may go back to Salt 
Lake City where my business, my 
mother, my relatives, and my na- 
tural associations are." The thought 
at the end of ten years or twenty 
years, provided I was wanted and 
possessed the ability to continue as 
president of the stake, of asking for 
a release never entered my head. I 
felt this way because of the train- 
ing I got in listening, in this taber- 
nacle, to President Brigham Young, 
and others in my early days also in 
listening to my own bishop, the late 
Edwin D. Woolley and associates, 
in the Thirteenth ward. I felt that 
when the Lord honored any man 
with a place or positions in this 
Church, that the first thing to which 
he should be loyal was the magnify- 
ing of that position. I found this 
spirit in the mission field. I can say 
of those who were chosen to preside 
over the various conferences in the 
British Mission, while I presided 
there, that they gave their first 
thought to the magnifying of the 
office of conference president, and 
endeavoring 'to the very best of

their abilities to direct the labors 
of the elders who were under their 
jurisdiction. They had in very 
deed the spirit of the service of 
God referred to in the revelation to 
the father of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, Section 4, of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men; 

'Therefore, O ye that embark in the 
service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and 
strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day; 

"Therefore, if you have desires to 
serve God, you are called to the work, 
for behold the field is white already to 
harvest, and lo, he that thrusteth in 
his sickle with his might, the same 
layeth up in store that he perish not, 
but bringeth salvation to his soul; 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, 
with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, 
temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, dili- 
gence, 

"Ask and ye shall receive, knock 
and it shall be opened unto you." 

Today "the field is white already 
to harvest" because among the va- 
rious stakes of Zion, there is grow- 
ing up a carlessness and disregard 
for authority, a disregard upon the 
part of many for the advice, the 
counsel and the admonitions of the 
servants of the Lord. There is a 
running after pleasure, there is a 
diesire to follow the styles of the 
world, there is a desire for wealth, 
and not that same loyal desire which 
formerly existed in the hearts of the 
people, to work for the salvation of 
the souls of men. I plead with all 
those within the sound of my voice, 
the fathers and mothers, to take an 
interest in the welfare of their chil- 
dren, and to teach them to follow 
the admonitions of the Lord's ser- 



vants which have been given to the 
people. To urge their daughters to 
dress in such a way and manner 
that shall stamp them as modest, 
and not as having a desire to appear 
immodest. I desire that the spirit 
of seeking after pleasure which is 
today growing among the people 
may be curtailed. I believe that the 
fathers and mothers, by taking a 
personal interest in the social affairs 
of their children, and in all their 
activities, will have an influence for 
good over their children. I believe 
that each and every person who is 
called to any place or position in 
the service of God in this Church, 
should feel the spirit of humility, 
the spirit of thanksgiving, and the 
spirit of determination to do their 
duty, to the full extent of their 
ability. 

Men seek for the honors of men. 
They seek after place and position 
in cities, counties, states, and in the 
nation, and they feel honored and 
lifted up when any place comes to 
them, and I do not know any of 
them who have secured a place of 
honor which they wish to resign. 
Why should we want to resign from 
any place in serving God, in labor- 
ing for the salvation of the souls 
of men? I remember that in reve- 
lation after revelation given just be- 
fore the Church was organized, and 
in its early days, that men came to 
the man whom God had chosen as 
his prophet, and asked that he in- 
quire of the Lord what was the 
most important labor for them to 
perform. Uniformly, the answer 
came that the greatest and most 
profitable labor in which they could 
engage was to bring souls to a 
knowledge of the gospel, viz., to the 
knowledge of the great and mar- 
velous work which was about to 
come forth among the children of

men. If we have faith, and love, we 
will pay our tithing; we will keep 
the word of wisdom ; if we have 
diligence, we will labor for the 
spread of the gospel at home and 
abroad. 

May God bless us and pour out 
his Spirit upon us through this con- 
ference, that we may have a time of 
rejoicing, and go home refreshed 
and with the determination more 
fully to sustain those who preside 



in the stakes and wards, and more 
faithfully to perform the duties 
which devolve upon us, is my 
prayer, and I ask it in humility, and 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"O ye mountains high." 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder John N. Henrie, President 
of the Panguitch stake. 



SECOND DAY.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

The word of the L,ord quick and pow- 
erful — Impressive sayings of the 
Savior in blessing and denouncing — 
Blessings upon those who have 
come up to Zion — Five important 
commandments on what the Saints 
shall do — Also others warning what 
they shall not do — How to observe 
the Sabbath — The freedom of the 
Saints to be used in keeping the 
commandments of God. 

Brethren and sisters, we have 
come up this morning, as we did 
yesterday, to hear the word of the 
Lord, and whether he speaks by his 
own voice or the voice of his Spirit 
or by the voice of revelation, his 
word is plain, simple, direct and 
emphatic, and he invariably speaks 
in the language of the common peo- 
ple that all may understand. It is 
said of his word that it is quick and 
powerful, sharper than a two-edged 
sword to the dividing asunder of 
both joints and marrow. The Lord 
never indulges in idle talk but his 
sayings are deep with meaning. As 
an illustration, it is said of him, 
when he was upon the earth, that he 
went up into the mount and his dis- 



ciples gathered around him, and he 
taught them, saying: 

"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven ; blessed 
are those who mourn, for they shall 
be comforted; blessed are the meek, 
for they shall inherit the earth; 
blessed are those who hunger and 
thirst after righteousness, for they 
shall be filled; blessed are the merci- 
ful, for they shall obtain mercy; 
blessed are the pure in heart, for they 
shall see God; and Messed are the 
peacemakers, for they shall be called 
the children of God." 

I submit to you, brethren and sis- 
ters, that these words of the Savior 
are impressive, far-reaching and 
comprehensive in their character, 
and if they were closely followed, 
would be a sufficient guide through 
life. On the other hand, the Lord 
was terrible in his denunciation of 
the wicked. He said upon one oc- 
casion : "Woe unto you scribes and 
Pharisees, hypocrites. For ye shut 
up the kingdom of heaven against 
men, for ye neither enter in your- 
selves, neither suffer ye those who 
are entering to go in. Woe unto 
you scribes and Pharisees, hypo- 
cites. For ye devour widows' 
houses, and for a pretense, offer 
long prayers. Therefore, ye shall 
receive the greater damnation. Woe 
unto you scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites ; for ye compass sea and 
land to make one convert, and when 
he is made ye make him two-fold 
more the child of hell than your- 
selves."- Now, it would seem from 
this that the Lord despised a hypo- 
crite, one who pretended to be one

35 



thing- and yet was another, and he 
pronounced against all such a woe. 

The word of the Lord in these 
latter days, my brethren and sisters, 
as it has come to us through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith — and he was 
a great prophet — is plain, simple, 
direct and emphatic, and given in 
such language as formerly used that 
all may understand. I refer you for 
a moment to a revelation given 
through Joseph, the Seer, in Zion, 
in Jackson county, Missouri, Au- 
gust 7, 1831 : "Behold, blessed, 
saith the Lord, are they who have 
come up into this land with an eye 
single to my glory according to my 
commandments ; for them that live 
shall inherit the .earth, and them that 
die shall rest from all their labors 
and their works shall follow them. 
They shall receive a crown in the 
mansions of my Father, which I 
have prepared for them. Yea, 
blessed are they whose feet stand 
upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my gospel, for they shall re- 
ceive for their reward the good 
things of the earth and it shall bring 
forth in its strength. They shall' 
also be crowned with blessings from 
above; yea, and with command- 
ments not a few ; and with revela- 
tions in their time, they that are 
faithful and diligent before me." 

Brethren and sisters, what a com- 
prehensive saying is this. There 
are two things connected with these 
words that impress me deeply, and 
that is this, blessed are those who 
have obeyed the gospel and, second- 
ly, who have come up to the land 
of Zion — Missouri was the land of 
Zion. I take it that this is also the 
land of Zion, and we are here in 
the midst of the stakes of Zion, and 
the word that was given to them 
might well be given to us. I think 
it was intended for us. It mattered 



little whether they lived or they 
died. If they died, they were to be 
blessed and were to enter into the 
mansions that were prepared for 
them, and if they lived, the earth 
was to be blessed for their sake, and 
it was to give forth in its strength; 
and, moreover, and what is of far 
greater importance, they were to 
receive the revelations of the Lord 
not a few. But now, it would seem 
from a further reading of this reve- 
lation, that it was not alone suffi- 
cient for them to have obeyed the 
gospel and to have come up to the 
land of Zion, for the Lord gave 
them a further commandment and 
in it he told them five important 
things that they should do and he 
told them at least three very im- 
portant things that they should not 
do. He uses the word "shall." It 
was not that they may not do those 
things, or that perhaps it would be 
wise that they should not do them, 
but he says thou shalt not do them. 
Theni again he says of the other 
things : Thou shalt do them. These 
were the things they were not to do : 
Thou shalt not steal ; thou shalt not 
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do 
anything like unto it. Now, it some- 
times happens that when a person 
finds a thing, he may pick it up on 
the street, he may pick it up in a 
building, but he has found it and he 
assumes that it is his by right of 
discovery. It is not his ; he has 
stolen it, and the Lord has com- 
manded against this sin, whether he 
finds a thing that does not belong 
to him or whether he has taken it of 
his own accord. It does not belong 
to him, and it ought to be returned 
to the owner. Adultery is the deadly 
sin of this age, and was the deadly 
sin of other ages. This great evil 
has led to the separation in thou- 
sands of instances of husband and 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wife, and it is perhaps the great 
cause, and the greatest of all causes, 
leading to divorce. The Lord has 
said to his people, Thou shalt not 
do it. You know that in early times, 
in the days of the Pilgrim Fathers, 
if it were reported throughout the 
country that a murder had been 
committed, great was the sensation 
among the people ; it caused a shock 
to all who heard it, but now, the 
account of a murder hardly arouses 
attention, and we give to it but 
passing interest, showing how 
things have changed since this great 
country of ours was first settled. 
Killing is very common today and 
particularly in those nations that are 
at war, when thousands and tens of 
thousands — well, shall I say hun- 
dreds of thousands? yes, are being 
slain, and really it would be difficult 
to find a just cause for it. The Lord 
has said to his people, Thou shalt 
not kill, and he said it with a voice 
of authority. These are the five 
things, brethren and sisters, that the 
Lord has said we shall do. He com- 
mands it. Thou shalt love the Lord, 
thy God, with all thy heart, with all 
thy might, mind and strength, and 
in the name of Jesus Christ, thou 
shalt serve him. What a glorious 
doctrine is this the first great com- 
mandment. If we could accept it, if 
we could carry it out in our lives, 
if we could only do it, the way 
would be easy and the burden would 
be light. And the next command- 
ment is like unto it, and given in the 
same strong, emphatic language: 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy- 
self. Oh, if a man could only do 
that. If it were possible — and I 
take it, it is possible, because the 
Lord has commanded it — but if we 
could only love our neighbor as we 
love ourselves, what a splendid vic- 
tory would he achieved. We always 



favor ourselves, we are always very 
charitable to ourselves, we are quite 
willing to forgive ourselves when 
we are in the wrong. Well, that is 
the way we must be towards our 
neighbor. We must be kind to him, 
we must be charitable to him, must 
be forgiving, and, must look with 
mercy upon his weaknesses and im- 
perfections. I take it to mean just 
that much at least. Thou shall thank 
the Lord thy God in all things. 
Blessed is the man or blessed is the 
woman that has a thankful heart 
who does not murmur nor com- 
plain nor find fault with the Lord if 
some little trouble comes, some little 
misfortune, something perhaps, that 
will benefit him in his after experi- 
ence, yet he does not find fault. He 
takes life as it comes; he meets it 
fairly and squarely, and thanks the 
Lord. The revelation further says : 
"Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto 
the Lord thy God in righteousness, 
even with a broken heart and a con- 
trite spirit, and that thou mayest 
more fully keep thyself unspotted 
from the world, thou shalt go to 
the house of prayer and offer up 
thy sacraments upon my holy day. 
For verily, this is a day appointed 
unto you to rest from your labors 
and pay thy devotions unto the 
Most High." 

How direct, how exact, how per- 
fect, is the thought expressed, re- 
garding the observance of the Sab- 
bath day to. keep it holy. Now, here 
is the people of the Lord the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and this command; 
ment applies to them even if others 
reject it. It is not supposed that they 
will remain at home upon the Sab- 
bath day, even to read, or to read 
good books, or to read the scrip- 
tures, when they ought to be in the 
house of prayer, in the house of 
worship, in the house of the Lord, 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

where they are commanded to go. 
It is not supposed that they will 
rush off into the canyons to hunt 
and fish; it is not supposed they 
will go off on pleasure excursions, 
or go to various resorts, and I am 
sure it is not supposed, never in- 
tended, that they should go to the 
theatres and to moving picture 
shows on the Sabbath day, and thus 
desecrate it. 

I remember once upon the Sab- 
bath day while in the city of Lon- 
don, the biggest, the mightiest city 
on earth, I found it to be perfectly 
dead. There was not a thing doing, 
there seemed to be no life there at 
all, hardly anybody upon the 
streets. The buildings were all 
closed up and it was difficult even 
to get a meal of victuals. In Can- 
ada, under the English government, 
if a man is seen) traveling along 
the highway on the Sabbath day 
with a loaded wagon, his team 
struggling, sweating, and fuming, 
the, man is immediately arrested for 
desecrating the Lord's holy day. 
How different that is from what we 
see in free America. Yes, it is a 
great free country, and the Latter- 
day Saints, the people of the Lord, 
are supposed to use that freedom 
by observing his word and keeping 
his commandments. 

The Lord bless you, brethren and 
sisters, the Lord bless our president 
and prophet, and his counselors and 
the authorities of the Church, and 
all, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

country to live beyond their means

I pray and I crave the blessings 
of my heavenly Father for what 
few moments I stand before you to- 
day, that I may have the same spirit 
of testimony, of admonition, that 
has manifested itself with all of the 
speakers during this conference, so 
far. It gives me great joy to be 
able to testify to my brethren and 
sisters upon this occasion that I 
know that the gospel of Christ is 
true. I know that in the end it will 
accomplish all that God intended it 
to, and I know that if it were put in 
force in all the world, we would 
have a better world to live in. i 
am thankful to my heavenly Father 
that I was born of goodly parents. 
I never forget to thank him that I 
was born under the covenant of the 
holy priesthood, and that my par- 
ents taught me in my early life all 
the principles, the doctrines and the 
teachings made manifest to the peo- 
ple of God through the revelations 
to his prophet in this dispensation, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I never 
tire of testifying to this fact wher- 
ever I go, and I never am ashamed 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it 
is the power of God unto salvation. 
No person, no matter to what posi- 
tion he attains, can ever be success- 
ful in this world if he loses his own 
soul, and it seems to me that the 
way the world is drifting today and 
the conditions of many of the peo- 
ple of our own beloved country are 
such that care must be taken or else 
there will be less of the love of God 
among the people than exists today. 

We find for the last fifteen years 
or more there is a tendency of the 
people of our country to live beyond

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



their means, to indulge in practices 
that cannot help but have the effect 
of making them unworthy of the 
blessings of our heavenly Father. 
We read, once in a while, a warning 
through the press, and hear occa- 
sionally a protest in the pulpit, but 
it must of necessity be more widely 
called to the attention of the people 
or there will be sorrow and trouble 
come to them. I noticed the other 
day an editorial, in one of the New 
York papers, calling attention to 
this age of luxury and what it 
means to the people of the United 
States. I am going to take time to 
read it to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, for I notice there is a tend- 
ency among our own people of liv- 
ing faster than they should live, and 
indulging in luxuries that do them 
no good whatever, and only bring 
trouble upon them and upon their 
loved ones. The editorial is as fol- 
lows : 

"An age of luxury is always an 
dge of decadence. When the simple 
life is given up, temptation begins. 
When a man or a woman sacrifices 
thrift for the love of luxury, it is a 
Jay of evil foreboding, for the love 
of luxury puts a premium on discon- 
tent. A taste for luxurious food and 
drink is followed by a desire for ex- 
pensive garments, silks, satins, laces 
and jewels, things that add nothing 
essential to comfort or the joy of liv- 
ing. The story of the decadent na- 
tions is always the same. When the 
simple life was abandoned, an era of 
luxury set in and extravagance 
drained the nation's resources. Right 
living went the way ( of plain living. 
Luxury, extravagance and vice fol- 
low each other in natural sequence. 
A luxurious nation finds its resources 
swept away, its patriotism sacrificed 
to effeminacy, and its physical well- 
being to the common vices of man- 
kind. Thoughtful men in this day 
are endeavoring to impress the les- 
son of thrift on the American people, 
but the drift is all the other way, here 
and everywhere. It is a situation 



full of danger and the oft-repeated 
warning is given again in the hope 
that some may listen and profit, 
though many scoff and suffer. Don't 
blame the prosperous worker if he 
apes the opulent drone. When the 
latter spends a hundred dollars a plate 
for a dinner, bedecks himself with 
gaudy jewels, bestows a one hundred 
thousand dollar necklace on wife, 
daughter or favorite, let no one won- 
der that the flagrant examples of ex- 
travagance exert an evil influenec 
on those who toil for their daily 
bread. The influence of a bad exam- 
ple is proverbial. Rich as well as poor 
need to be taught the lessons of right 
living and right doing." 

My brethren and sisters, I know 
there is a tendency among the peo- 
ple to live beyond their means, and 
indulge in extravagance. I deliv- 
ered a speech in the Senate, at this 
last session of Congress, upon home 
economics. I called attention to the 
waste that is going on among the 
people of our country, and asked 
Congress to make an annual appro- 
priation for research work by all of 
our agricultural colleges, for the 
purpose of bringing to the homes of 
the people the proper way of pre- 
venting waste of foodstuffs, and the 
proper care of a home. I have not 
the time now to go into the details 
of this subject, but I may say to the 
brethren and sisters that I have re- 
ceived thousands of letters com- 
mending in the highest terms my 
calling attention to the American 
people on the floor of the Senate, to 
this pressing question, and I know 
that if it were more generally called 
to the attention of the people of our 
country, it would be better for the 
American homes. I understand our 
Relief Society is doing a great work 
along this line, and I pray to my 
heavenly Father that they will have 
success. I predict that it will not be 
many years before necessity will 
compel a change in the mode of liv-

ing today, that it will have to be 
brought to the homes of all the 
American people. 

I notice in my meeting peoples of 
the world, that many of them are 
very much interested in the princi- 
ples of "Mormonism," and particu- 
larly in the organization of our 
Church, and I know that they are 
anxious to learn of our beliefs and 
learn of the work of our organiza- 
tions, and what is accomplished by 
them. One fault of most of the re- 
ligions of the world today is that 
they are not interested in the tem- 
poral welfare of their people. They 
preach, it is true, sermons from the 
Bible, and many times in a most 
learned way, but after the people 
leave the services, there is very lit- 
tle thought given them until the fol- 
lowing Sabbath. When I call atten- 
tion to the wonderful work of the 
Felief Society and how they visit 
the homes of the people every 
month, how they assist in caring for 
the sick, how they help the helpless ; 
when I call attention to the work of 
the teachers, visiting all of the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints ev- 
ery month, learning of their condi- 
tion, temporally and spiritually, and 
make a report to their bishop every 
month, ready and willing to assist 
all who need assistance ; when I call 
attention to our fast-day meeting, 
and the offerings of the people 
there, and the purposes for which 
those offerings are given, and 
when I speak of the old folks and 
the reverence we pay to them, irre- 
spective of creed or color, all ex- 
press surprise and even approval. I 
have expressed myself as surprised 
that the world generally has not fol- 
lowed the examples set by this peo- 
ple in honoring the aged. We are 
interested in the temporal welfare 
of our people. We are looking out 



for their welfare in this life because 
we believe in doing so, we assist 
them greatly in living the principles 
that will lead them to a greater life 
beyond. I want to acknowledge to 
the brethren and sisters that my 
obedience to the laws of the Church 
has never been a drawback to me 
in my life ; and I want to testify, 
upon the other hand, that it has 
been a strength and a power to me, 
and I have never lost a friend that 
was worthy of being a friend, from 
living as near as I could to the re- 
quirements of the gospel. I plead 
with you, old and young, to live 
strictly to the requirements of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, its teachings, 
its admonitions,- and I promise you 
if you do, you shall receive the 
blessings of heaven, even greater 
than you have received them in the 
past. 

Mothers and fathers, I am a little 
alarmed over our young people and 
the temptations that are besetting 
them daily. Twenty years ago we 
used to think there were many 
temptations, and there were, but to- 
day there are many that we never 
thought of then, and I think they 
are even more deadly than the 
temptations that we, as middle-aged 
members of the Church, had to 
withstand. At that time we had no 
automobiles, there were no moving 
pictures, and there are hundreds of 
other temptations that we knew 
nothing about. I believe that the 
moving pictures could be, and in 
many cases are, made a great agen- 
cy to educate the people of this 
country. I have not attended many 
exhibits ; in fact, until this year, I 
had never entered a moving picture 
show, with the exception of twice, 
in my life. But the last few months 
I have attended a few, and I want to 
frankly say that some of them were 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



unfit for young people to attend. No 
good could come from seeing them ; 
the story as told by the picture was 
one that no father or mother would 
allow repeated in their home or at 
their fireside. You cannot tell me 
that it has not made an impression 
upon the minds of the young peo- 
ple, and Well may we, as parents, if 
our children are to attend them, 
know beforehand what the picture 
is that is going to be presented. 
There are many of them, I admit, 
that are clean and they are worthy 
of the people seeing because of their 
educational nature, but a great 
many of them, my brethren and sis- 
ters, ought never to be shown, par- 
ticularly to the young people. I plead 
with you that you be careful and 
watch over your children, for they 
either bring great joy or great sor- 
row to the parents. God intended 
that every man and woman who 
enters wedlock should bring chil- 
dren into this world. Children are 
precious in the sight of God, and to 
the father and the mother. I trust 
that all Latter-day Saints homes will 
be such that our children can obtain 
wholesome pleasures without seek- 
ing them outside. I pray my heav- 
enly Father that he will instil in 
the hearts of the mothers and fath- 
ers of Israel a desire to look more 
carefully after their children. We 
must understand that it will not be 
many years until they will be the 
men and the women bearing the re- 
sponsibilities of this great work, and 
if they are unspotted from the sins 
of the world, they will do so, with 
honor. I want to say that there 
never was a man who lost his virtue, 
there never was a woman who lost 
hers, but what it was detrimental to 
them, no matter how humbly they 
repented of it. 

I ask God's blessing upon his peo- 
ple, and that they may be humble 



and prayerful, that he may bless 
them, with a testimony which I 
know most of you have, and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

Greetings from the European mission 
— Terrors of the Great War — Fail- 
ure of the Churches to influence the 
hearts and minds of men — Reasons 
therefor — The efforts of so-call'ed 
Christianity to feed the people the 
bread of life have failed — The devil 
is stirring the minds of men to ha- 
tred and bloodshed — Only the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ in the hearts of 
men will bring lasting peace — Duty 
of the Latter-day Saints to uphold 
God's ensign of peace, and bring a 
knowledge of his gospel to the chil- 
dren of men. 

I thank the Lord, this morning, 
for the privilege I have of meeting 
with the Saints upon this occasion. 
A long time has passed since I had 
the opportunity of attending a gen- 
eral conference of the Church and 
of meeting with multiudes of the 
Latter-day Saints here in the taber- 
nacle. I have been laboring, as you 
know, as a missionary abroad, and I 
bring to you a greeting and a mes- 
sage of love and fellowship from 
the Saints of the European mission. 
The Latter-day Saints throughout 
that mission are like the Latter-day 
Saints here, in the valleys of the 
mountains, devoted to the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. They are full of the 
hope of salvation, and they place 
their trust in the Lord and in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ for that sal- 
vation. They are generally faithful 
and obedient to the laws of the gos- 
pel, and next to their desire to en- 
dure to the end, next to their hope 
of eternal salvation, is their desire 
and hope, sometime to gather with 
the Latter-day Saints in the land 
and the place appointed for the 
gathering of the Lord's people.

In the countries comprising the 
European mission there is at the 
present time, great ' disturbance, 
great sorrow and anxiety, and the 
Latter-day Saints have their por- 
tion of these untoward things; yet 
they are enduring them in patience. 
They are going through these try- 
ing times trusting in the Lord and 
endeavoring to keep their hearts 
free from the spirit of hatred and 
animosity that seems to fill the 
hearts of the children of men in 
those troubled lands. I don't be- 
lieve there is any spirit of anger or 
hatred in the hearts of the Latter- 
day Saints of any one of these 
countries against the people of any 
other. We have endeavored at least 
to instil into the hearts of the Saints 
a spirit of brotherhood and love, 
and a willingness to pray even for 
those who are called their enemies, 
and I believe they have succeeded 
and are succeeding to a marked de- 
gree in keeping their hearts pure 
from these defilements. I have been 
pained to learn that here at home 
Latter-day Saints who have emi- 
grated from various countries in 
Europe, or whose fathers came 
from those countries, have taken a 
very active part in the conflicts now 
being waged in the world . They 
have taken sides with the countries 
at war, and they have upheld as 
right and just the cause of their 
own lands or the lands of their 
fathers, and have become more or 
less angry with each other in their 
discussions and arguments upon 
those questions. This seems to me 
to be quite wrong and altogether out 
of keeping with conduct of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The Latter-day 
Saints who have been gathered out 
of the world and planted in the val- 
leys of the mountains have in a 
sense been born again. When they 



have taken their citizenship in this 
goodly land they should have fore- 
sworn allegiance to foreign lands, 
and to the dominion of corrupt 
kings and princes, and they should 
hold themselves aloof and apart 
from the quarrels and the wars that 
the nations of the earth engage in. 
It would be just as consistent for the 
Latter-day Saints, who have come 
out of the Protestant churches or 
the Catholic church, or for the chil- 
dren of men and women who came 
out of the Presbyterian church or 
the Baptist, or the Methodist, or the 
Congregationalist, to take sides with 
those corrupt and apostate churches 
in their contentions and their quar- 
rels among themselves. We, or our 
fathers who received the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, as it has been pro- 
claimed by divinely appointed and 
authorized men in this dispensation, 
have been born again. We have 
forsaken the corrupt religions of 
the world, and we have foresworn 
all allegiance to these false 
churches. We have no interest in 
their contentions. At least the only 
interest we have in them is a desire 
that the adherents of these various 
churches may also see the light, 
come to a kowledge of the truth, 
and forsake evil and error and 
falsehood, and receive the gospel of 
Christ which is the power of God 
unto salvation. The only interest 
which the Latter-day Saints have 
or can have in the contentions of the 
nations of the earth, political or 
otherwise, is that the time may 
come when peace may be restored, 
when men shall cease to make war 
upon each other, and live in peace 
and love and in a desire to make 
every land a^ blessed land and all 
men brothers. 

You have been called out of 
goodly lands ; but we have the word 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Lord for it that this land 
where the Lord has brought you 
and planted your feet is a land, 
choice above all other lands, a land 
held in reserve by the Lord upon 
which should be gathered the right- 
eous, among his children, even all 
who would hear his voice and obey 
his commands. It is indeed the 
land, also, upon which Zion is 
being built and where the pure in 
heart shall dwell. Our only inter- 
ests in other countries is, that out 
of Zion shall go forth the law that 
shall make all men lovers of God 
and friendly among themselves. 

Christianity, as it is known in the 
world today, has fallen far short of 
the accomplishment of what might 
have been expected of it. It has 
failed in establishing those prin- 
ciples which Christ taught among 
the children of men. The great 
Catholic division of the Christian 
world, the Catholic church, is a na- 
tional liability to any country. It 
wields a great power over the minds 
and the hearts of the children of 
men, but it is a power for evil 
rather than for good. It brings 
countless thousands regularly to 
confession ; it rarely brings a single 
man to repentance and the aband- 
onment of his sins. The power 
wielded by that organization is one 
that does not promote civilization, 
nor advancement morally or spirit- 
ually, but it binds its adherents in 
the thralldom of superstition and 
ignorance and fear, and denies 
them the liberty to make an open- 
minded investigation of other ques- 
tions ; and the nations and the peo- 
ple governed and controlled by that 
power are the least advanced in- 
tellectually and morally and indus- 
trially of any people in the world 
called Christian or civilized. 

The Protestant division of 



Chrstianity has practically ceased to 
exert any influence whatever over 
the hearts and the minds of the 
children of men. Mankind has 
largely ceased to be very much in- 
terested in Protestantism, as one 
promiment official in the British 
Government told me when I had oc- 
casion to visit him, that all profes- 
sors of religion and particularly the 
ministers of religion were narrow- 
minded and that no broad-minded 
man. no thinking man in this day 
paid any attention to the religions 
of Christianity, or other religions 
for that matter. That was his view. 
My observation confirms, that view. 
What is the reason for this? Why, 
my brethren and) sisters, even the 
dumb brute will not answer many 
times to the call to the crib or the 
lick, when no food or salt is pro- 
vided. They will soon cease to 
come, when they have learned that 
nothing is provided for them, and 
it is the same way with Protestant 
Christianity. Are men less intel- 
ligent than the lower animals ? The 
call is made to the people to come, 
and when the people have come 
they have been given, too often, 
the empty husk or the blighted ear, 
therefore many have ceased com- 
ing. Yet I would not have you un- 
derstand me as believing all man- 
kind, Christian or otherwise, have 
turned away entirely from thoughts 
of God and from the hope of salva- 
tion. The very image of God is 
impressed upon the children of men. 
They belong to him ; He owns 
them, and he will never rest until 
he has brought them into a condi- 
tion where they gladly and vol- 
untarily render unto God that 
which belongs to God. They have 
been deceived and are deceived by 
corrupt professors, corrupt min- 
isters. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

Let me explain, when I use the 
term "corrupt" with reference to 
these ministers of the gospel, that I 
use it in the same sense that I be- 
lieve the Lord used it when he made 
that declaration to Joseph Smith, 
the prophet, in answer to the proph- 
et's prayer. He did not mean, nor 
do I mean, that the ministers of re- 
ligion are personally unvirtuous or 
impure. I believe as a class they, 
perhaps, in personal purity, stand 
a little above the average order of 
men. When I use the term "cor- 
rupt" I mean, as I believe the Lord 
meant, that they have turned away 
from the truth, the purity of the 
truth, the beauty of the truth, and 
have turned to that which is false. 
A false doctrine is a corrupt doc- 
trine ; a false religion is a corrupt 
religion; a false teacher is a cor- 
rupt teacher. Any man who teaches 
a false doctrine, who believes in 
and practices and teaches a false 
religion is a corrupt professor, be- 
cause he teaches that which is im- 
pure and not true. That is the 
trouble with Christianity today. It 
is not true. Christianity is, perhaps, 
no truer or falser than any other 
religion, than Mohammedanism, 
Confucianism, Buddhism or any 
other ism or philosophy. In fact, 
my brethren and sisters, if 'the 
falsity of a religion can be measured 
in any degree by the amount of 
trouble and turmoil and strife and 
bitterness and hatred that it has en- 
gendered in the hearts of men, if it 
can be judged by the number of 
wars it has carried on and the rivers 
of blood it has shed, the amount of 
misery and sorrow, it has caused, or 
the extremes of impurity, found 
among its adherents, then Chris- 
tianity, that which is known as 
Christianity, is the falsest of all 
religions in the world. For in these 



last sixteen hundred years, if not 
longer, the small minority of the 
population of the earth known as 
Christians, have carried on the 
great majority of the wars in the 
world and have destroyed the 
greatest amount of life and of 
property and have inflicted upon 
the world the greatest degree of 
misery. And, so far as my obser- 
vation goes — and I have tried to ob- 
serve some of these things — there 
is less of piety, genuine sincerity 
and honesty in living up to their 
professions among Christians, than 
you will find among the confessors 
of any other religion whatsoever. 
The trouble is, as God declared to 
Joseph the Prophet, mankind 
have gone astray. Their religions 
are an abomination in his sight, 
and their professors are corrupt 
because they have turned away 
from the truth and have turned un- 
to fables. When men go to church 
nowadays they do not receive that 
which satisfies the soul, which the 
soul longs for ; they are not in- 
structed in the ways of life and of 
purity and right. They go away 
empty and disappointed. 

I look over the congregations of 
Israel, as they respond to the call 
made by the Presidency of the 
Church, from time to time, to come 
up here, to gather in our general 
conferences. For many years .the 
call has gone forth, and each call 
seems to be answered by ever in- 
creasing numbers. When we come, 
my brethren and sisters, we come 
hungry; yes, hungering and thirst- 
ing after righteousness ; and we 
are not fed as the world is gener- 
ally fed, in their religious assem- 
blies, upon platitudes and glittering 
generalities and sophistries and 
false philosophies and science, 
falsely so called, or empty elo- 



44

quence, but we are fed the very 
bread of life. We go home again 
having been instructed, in sound 
doctrine, having been built up in 
faith, having been filled with the 
Holy Ghost, as the Lord promised 
to those who would hunger and 
thirst after righteousness. We are 
sometimes reproved, sometimes ad- 
monished and rebuked, but we real- 
ize and understand that even re- 
proof is sometimes essential and 
is acceptable to the man who really 
desires to be corrected and instruct- 
ed and taught how to overcome his 
■own weaknesses and more fully do 
his duty. So we go home, rejoic- 
ing in that we have been reproved, 
that God has shown us some of the 
weaknesses that we failed, our- 
selves, to see, and we go away de- 
termined to strengthen ourselves 
and try to overcome these weak- 
nesses. 

Well, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, as established 
by the instrumentality of Joseph, 
the prophet, through the personal 
ministry of God and the revelations 
of God to him, is the truth; it is 
+V>° rhurch of God and the only one 
which he recognizes as his, the only 
organization where his authority 
obtains, where the ordinances of 
•the gospel may be performed ef- 
ficaciously in behalf of those who 
seek to obtain them, and where the 
gospel is preached with power and 
authority, by men recognized by 
the Lord.. 

It is the word that if heeded will 
bring salvation to all who obey it, 
and that will bring condemnation 
to those who reject it. 

We stand in the world for peace 
among men and not war. We de- 
test war ; we love peace. Does the 
world love peace? No. Do they 
want peace ? It is not apparent that 



they do. The devil reigns in the 
world, and he has stirred up the 
hearts of men to anger and to 
hatred and to bloodshed. It is ter- 
rible to contemplate that in certain 
nations, among millions of the in- 
habitants of this earth today, in- 
fants are drawing from their moth- 
ers very breasts the poison of hate 
of their fellow men. Hatred is 
being engendered in the hearts of 
innocent children by the placards 
posted upon billboards, in street- 
car windows, in the newspapers and 
by cartoons and on moving picture 
screens. By picture and inscrip- 
tion, the teaching of parents, and 
even sermons in the church, the 
people, old and young, are being 
taught and pledged to the policy of 
the "absolute and permanent extir- 
pation of all enemies and enemy 
gfoods from their countries." After 
this war is over will there be peace ? 
No, there (will be no peace. It 
will take generations to outlive the 
impressions of hatred and animos- 
ity that are now being made upon 
the hearts of the children against 
their fellow men. The nations, 
while looking forward to a cessa- 
tion of hostilities in this great war, 
are laying the foundations right 
now for another war which they 
call an industrial war, pledging 
themselves to make war upon other 
nations industrially, to cease to 
trade with each other in a friendly, 
brotherly manner. What must be 
the outcome of it? Peace to be 
permament must come from within 
as well as to be seen externally. 
Man must have peace in his heart 
arid love in his heart both for God 
and man, else there will be no 
peace. It is as President Smith ex- 
pressed it yesterday, the decision 
of the court, the decision of a battle 
that goes in favor of a man or a

nation, fills that man or that nation 
with jubilance, with joy and even 
arrogance, and it fills the man or 
the nation against whom the de- 
cision goes with bitterness of hate. 
Externally he may appear to be 
at peace, but in his heart there 
lurks that hatred which but waits 
an opportunity to get even some- 
time in the future; and the peace 
that shall be established after open 
warfare has ceased, it seems to me, 
will be but the seeming peace that 
may be seen in the graceful coils 
of the rattler as he rests in that po- 
sition which is the best one to strike 
the deadly blow. Not until man 
humbles himself before God and re- 
pents of his sins, acknowledges his 
guilt, asks forgiveness for his own 
wrong doing and stands ready to 
forgive those who have injured 
him, when forgiveness is sought ; 
only when God Almighty is recog- 
nized as the Father, and Jesus 
Christ as the Elder Brother and Re- 
deemer of men ; only when those 
glorious principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which is the power of 
salvation, shall be believed in and 
accepted and obeyed, will there be 
peace on earth. Not until the king- 
dom of God is found within us as 
well as outside of us, can we hope 
for peace on earth and good will 
for men. To accomplish this God 
has spoken in the latter days ; for 
this God has raised up prophets in 
the latter days ; for this he has put 
his Spirit upon men, and inspired 
their minds and their hearts and 
brought them in humility to repent- 
ance ; for this the priesthood of the 
Almighty has been restored to men, 
that priesthood which must be ex- 
ercised in love and kindness and 
charity and mercy and patience for 
the salvation of men, and never for 
the oppression of men. For that 



purpose has the gospel been 
preached in the world by men called 
of God, who speak by the power 
and demonstration of the Spirit of 
God and exercise their authority as 
God has given authority for the 
bringing of peace on earth, for the 
preparation of the gospel of peace, 
for the preparing of the world for 
the coming of the Son of God who 
shall dwell upon the earth and who 
shall execute judgment in justice 
and mercy and love among men and 
nations. My brethren, for this rea- 
son was the gospel restored, and 
that is what this Church stands for. 
It is the destiny of this Church and 
this people and this priesthood to 
stand for these things and uphold 
these standards, to uphold the en- 
sien which God has raised to the 
nations of the earth — an ensgin of 
peace — a welcome to all men to 
come to a place of refuge, a Zion 
for the pure in heart, where the 
oppressed and the downtrodden 
among men may find rest and peace 
to their souls, and teachers after 
God's own heart to lead them in 
the paths of truth and salvation. 

Are we doing our duty? There 
is a little law among the boy scouts 
which is admirable, but to no or- 
ganization or people is it more ap- 
plicable than to the Latter-day 
Saints. The scout law declares that 
a scout is clean, a scout is honest, 
a scout is truthful, a scout is kind, 
and so on and so forth. Now that 
is what Latter-day Saints are. A 
Latter-day Saint is a man of God ; a 
Latter-day Saint is a man who 
loves the Lord first and foremost ; 
a Latter-dav Saint is a man who 
loves his neighbor ; a Latter-day 
Saint keeps the Sabbath day holy; 
a Latter-day Saint honors his father 
and his mother; he revernces the 
priesthood, he honors it in himself 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and performs his duty in it ; a Lat- 
ter-day Saint is pure, he is virtu- 
ous, he is an honorable, upright, 
virtuous husband, and she is a pure, 
noble, motherly wife. Latter-day 
Saints are good fathers and good 
mothers; they are good brothers 
and sisters ; they are good neigh- 
bors, and they are good citizens. 
Latter-day Saints are everything 
that God desires them to be ; and it 
should not be said that Latter-day 
Saints ought to be, should be, might 
be, may be, or can be, what God 
wants them to bje — Latter-day 
Saints are the chosen of God and 
the salt of the earth by whom the 
whole world will be salted and 
whose destiny, as we have said, is 
to bring the knowledge of God unto 
the children \of men, until truth 
and righteousness shall prevail in 
the world and cover the earth as 
the waters do the mighty deep. Let 
us then arise to the great and glo- 
rious position and work that the 
Lord has placed us in and called us 
to perform, and let it be performed 
in humility and to the glory of God, 
the Eternal Father, and to the eter- 
nal salvation of his children, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Kedeemer of Israel." 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder Edward H. Anderson.

ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

"Mormonism" the gospel of Jesus 
Christ — The growth of the Church 
has come in spite of opposition — Re- 
sponsibility of the Saints to pro- 
claim the gospel — Need of prepara- 
tion for the work — A great field for 
missionary work at home to teach 
our friends and neighbors the gos- 
pel — Let us do the work lying at our 
doors, and so qualify for the work 
to come. 

If I did not know that the Lord 
is able and willing to inspire men 
to teach the truth, when they are 
called to the work, even when they 
themselves are fearful, I can assure 
you I would not stand here this 
afternoon. 

I have experienced great joy in 
the testimony and instruction of my 
brethren, and am grateful that I am 
permitted to be here at this con- 
ference to rejoice with you. I 
know that we are identified with 
the Church that our heavenly 
Father has restored in this day and 
if we will do our part, we will gain 
exaltation in his celestial kingdom. 
Observing the lives of my brethren 
and sisters throughout the Church 
I see evidence of the divinity of 
this work in their conduct, and it 
gives me hope that the leaven of the 
gospel will leaven the whole lump 
of humanity. Reference has been 
made to the fact that this world is 
in turmoil and that those nations 
that are at war are among the so- 
called Christian nations. We realize 
that their pitiable condition is not 
because of Christianity, but because 
the people have departed from the 
teachings of Jesus Christ. Our 
heavenly Father knew what was 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



47 



coming when in this latter day he 
restored the gospel in its purity. 
He knew of the apostasy in the 
world among his children, and that 
they had departed from the plain 
truth, and in his great mercy, he 
revealed this latter-day work. From 
the country he chose a boy from 
among the people, and inspired him 
to begin the work that was destined 
to revolutionize the religious world. 
He knew that the world was grop- 
ing in darkness, and in mercy re- 
stored the light. There is no other 
way that happiness may be enjoyed 
by the children of men but by lives 
of righteousness, and people cannot 
live righteous lives and be out of 
harmony with truth. There was 
much truth in the world but it was 
so mixed with error that the Lord 
himself told the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that the men who were the 
teachers and instructors in the 
churches taught for doctrine the 
commandments of men, and warned 
the boy that he was not to he iden- 
tified with them. He then restored 
the gospel, the power of God unto 
salvation, unto all those who will 
believe and obey it. The fact that 
our brethren and sisters of other 
churches believe much that we be- 
lieve, is a source of satisfaction to 
me, and I discover that the various 
denominations are gradually ab- 
sorbing the truth that has been re- 
vealed in our day, that had been 
forgotten by them. They are be- 
ginning to see the necessity of re- 
form in religious organizations. 
The articles of faith of the Church 
of Jesus Christ are the same as 
promulgated when the Church was 
organized, the same principles are 
in force today. There has been no 
change in them, but many of the 
great churches of the world have 
changed their creed to conform to 



the demands of the members of 
those churches, and sometimes 
they have changed their creed re- 
peatedly as new light has come to 
them. They have perceived the 
darkness they were in, and they 
have been groping for something 
that was more important than what 
they already had, and in that way 
they are gradually absorbing the 
doctrines of "Mormonism." It is a 
great claim that we make, and we 
make it without fear of contradic- 
tion, because it is the truth, that 
this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
We may be few in number com- 
pared with the multitudes of the 
earth, but we have the truth and 
the authority of the holy priest- 
hood, and this work will spread 
abroad until the decrees of our 
Father have been fulfiled. 

I feel today that w.e ought to be 
very grateful that our lot has been 
cast under such favorable circum- 
stances. When we look around and 
see the conditions of our kinsfolk 
in many lands, when we see our 
brothers and sisters in the various 
portions of the earth without the 
truth, we ought indeed to feel that 
we are willing to dedicate our lives 
to the service of the Lord in return 
for the blessings that we enjoy. 
When we realize that from six 
members in 1830, this Church has 
grown to number hundreds of 
thousands, I see the hand-dealing 
of our Father with his children. 
The growth of this Church has not 
come because it was popular. It 
has been in spite of the opposition, 
of the wise men of the world ; it 
has been in spite of the opposition 
of religious teachers, and it has 
continued to gather here 'and there 
choice spirits who have lived in 
such a way that they could compre- 
hend the truth. The lack of faith 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the world today would be ap- 
palling, but for the fact that the 
Lord has set his hand to redeem 
Israel. The condition of humanity 
today, their lack of knowledge that 
God lives, is not altogether the re- 
sult of their desire to do wrong, 
but it is the result of having done 
wrong, of disobedience to the com- 
mandments of God. Throughout 
the world, those who have not faith 
in God have not complied with his 
teachings, have not listened to the 
whisperings of the still small voice, 
have not done their best, else the 
Lord would not have forsaken 
them. The Spirit of God continues 
to strive with men everywhere as 
long as they make the effort to keep 
his commandments. When men 
abandon the truth, refuse to do the 
right, the Lord of necessity with- 
draws his Spirit and men are left 
to the buffetings of the adversary. 
Today this body of people, this lit- 
tle handful of God's children have 
the responsibility of proclaiming 
the truth to the millions who are in 
darkness. This is a great labor. At 
present, we are excluded from 
many of the nations of the earth, 
but our heavenly Father in his wis- 
dom has located us in a great, free, 
liberty-loving nation where we have 
the privilege of proclaiming the 
truth and teaching his gospel. He 
has led people from all portions of 
the earth, one here and another 
there, they have been pricked in 
their hearts, have investigated and 
received the truth and their anxiety 
has been for those from whom they 
descended, the people of their own 
race. Missionaries have traveled 
throughout the earth as a result, 
and the truths of the gospel of our 
Lord have been proclaimed in a 
convincing manner to many hun- 
dreds of thousands of our Father's 



children. When I speak of the mis- 
sion field, I realize the great work 
that is to be accomplished. I am 
impressed, my brethren and sisters, 
with the importance of preparing 
for the work. It is not sufficient 
that a boy signify his desire, be- 
cause of his confidence in his 
parents, to do what they would have 
him do, go into the world and 
preach the gospel ; it is not sufficient 
that he answer the call that our 
heavenly Father makes from time 
to time through his servants for 
mission service ; but it is also neces- 
sary that he qualify for the work, 
search the scriptures, and learn 
what the Lord would have him 
know. It is important that our sons 
and daughters become established in 
their faith and know as their par- 
ets know, that this is our Fath- 
er's work. 

If I, as a father in Israel, fail to 
impress my children with the im- 
portance of this work and later they 
are called to go into the world to 
teach, it seems to me that I will 
regret that I have not done my full 
part if I have neglected to properly 
instruct them. A dozen men qual- 
ified for the work are worth more 
in the mission field than a hundred 
who are ignorant of the truth and 
who themselves have to be taught 
before they are capable of explain- 
ing it to others. The opportunity 
to teach the gospel will increase 
after the war and preachers of the 
true gospel will be in demand. I 
know of no better field in which to 
qualify than right here at home. 

Do you realize, brethren and sis- 
ters, that in this city, the headquar- 
ters of the Church, there are ap- 
proximately fifty thousand people, 
who know very little about the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ? They are our 
neighbors, they are our Father's

children, they are identified with the 
other churches, or else they do not 
belong to any church, but I think I 
am safe in saying that ninety per 
cent of them have no idea what the 
gospel of Jesus Christ really is. I 
believe that the greatest mission 
field in all the world is in the val- 
leys of these great mountains. If 
we, as members of the Church, 
were keeping the commandments of 
God, if we put upon the truth the 
value that we ought, if our lives 
conformed to the beauties of its 
teachings, so that our neighbors, 
observing our conduct, would be 
constrained to seek after the truth, 
we would be doing splendid mis- 
sionary work. Within the last year, 
I have had the privilege of meeting 
and conversing on the gospel with 
some men who live in this com- 
munity, not members of our 
Church. One man had resided here 
for twenty years, a man whose life 
is above reproach, a good citizen, 
a splendid business man, one who 
has kindly feeling towards our peo- 
ple. He told me that he had lived 
here twenty years, and lie had come 
to the conclusion that we were just 
as good as our neighbors who are 
members of other churches ; he 
could not see any difference in us. 
I want to say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that is no compliment 
to me. If the gospel of Jesus Christ 
does not make me a better man, 
then I have not developed as I 
should, and if our neighbors not in 
this Church can live among us from 
year to year and see no evidence of 
the benefits that come from keeping 
the commandments of God in our 
lives, then there is need for reform 
in Israel. What I say of Salt Lake 
City is true of our other cities. 
Men and women take for granted 
that thev know what we believe. 



Many of them have come into our 
midst prejudiced beforehand, and 
for some reason, we do not seem to 
think enough of their souls to go 
out of our way to do a little plan- 
ning to get into their homes, and 
to remove that prejudice, and teach 
them the plain truth. 

I might say, with reference to the 
one man, that after talking to him 
a couple of hours on the train, 
"Why," he said to me, "Mr. Smith, 
that is beautiful to me. I think you 
ought to send your missionaries to 
such men as I am, right here in Salt 
Lake City. There are hundreds of 
men here who would like to hear 
what you have told me tonight, and 
we would be better men for the 
teaching." He told me he employed 
members of our Church, some re- 
turned missionaries, and none of 
them had ever spoken to him about 
the gospel. I said, "You would not 
expect a man to ask you to give 
him time in your office to teach you 
'Mormonism.' If you were to in- 
vite him to come in, he would be 
glad to explain his views. Then he 
said, "Do your missionaries who are 
in the world go only to the homes 
where they are invited?" That 
awakened a thought in my mind, 
are you doing your duty? are we 
performing the labor that the Lord 
has entrusted to our care? do we 
sense the responsibility that is upon 
us? or are we idly floating down 
stream, 'going with the tide taking 
it for granted that in the last day, 
we will be redeemed? 

It is my firm conviction, my 
brethren and sisters, that unless we 
stir ourselves more than we are do- 
ing, that when we go to the other 
side of the- veil, we will meet there 
men and women who have been our 
neighbors, and associates, and lived 
among us, that will condemn us be-

cause we have been so inconsiderate 
of them in not telling them of the 
truth of the gospel of our Lord. 
When a man is sick, if he is our 
neighbor, we minister to him glad- 
ly ; if there is a death in his family, 
we try to comfort him. But year in 
and year out we allow him to walk 
in paths that will destroy his oppor- 
tunity for eternal life, we pass him 
by, as if he were a thing of naught. 
That is, some of us do. I realize 
that there are many grand men and 
women among us whose hearts are 
warm with the desire to do good 
in the world. I believe that the 
mission field right here at home, 
right here among the Latter-day 
Saints, is the best that we can find 
anywhere. Many people here, if we 
will go to them and teach them the 
truth, will see the beauties of the 
gospel, because they see some of 
the fruits of "Mormonism" in the 
lives of its members, and I feel that 
we ought to sense the importance 
of this work. We spend most of 
our time, many of us, seeking the 
things of this life that we will be 
compelled to leave when we go 
from here, yet there are the im- 
mortal souls all around us whom, 
if we would, we could teach and 
inspire to investigate the truth, and 
implant in their hearts a knowledge 
that God lives. What treasure in 
all the world could be so precious 
to us, 'for we woiuld bave their 
gratitude here and their everlast- 
ing and eternal appreciation in the 
world to come. It is a most im- 
portant mission. The Lord has pros- 
pered the Latter-day Saints. We 
are abundantly blessed, and now 
that we have been placed in a posi- 
tion beyond want, it is our duty to 
cease striving for the things that 
perish in this life, all the time or 
even most of the time, and think of 



the children of our heavenly Father 
who are in need of our ministra- 
tion and who are our neighbors. 

One of the very first revelations 
that was given by our heavenly 
Father, as contained in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, reads as fol- 
lows : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men; 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the 
service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and 
strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day." • 

Now, I do not understand that 
we are serving God with all our 
might if we forsake his children, 
or if we spend so much of our time 
selfishly building up ourselves, ac-. 
cumulating things of this life, and 
leave his children in darkness, when 
we could bring them into the light. 
My understanding is that the most 
important mission that I have in 
this life'is: first, to keep the com- 
mandments of God, as they have 
been taught to me ; and next, to 
teach them to my Father's children 
who do not understand them. It 
makes little difference, when I go 
to the other side, whether I have 
been a man of wealth in this world 
or not, unless I have used that 
wealth to bless my fellow men. 
Though I be a wanderer in this 
world, and suffer for the necessities 
of life, if by reason of the knowl- 
edge that my Father has given me, 
I devote myself to the instruction 
of his children, to planting faith in 
their hearts, to dissipating the er- 
rors that have come to them by tra- 
dition, I believe when I go to the 
other side that I will find there a 
bank account that will be beyond 
compare with what I would have, 
if I lived for the things of this

earth alone. I read a portion of the 
section 4 and I want to read that 
last verse again : 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the 
service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and 
strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day; 

"Therefore, if ye have desires to 
serve God, ye are called to the work." 

It is not necessary for you to be 
called to go into the mission field in 
order to proclaim the truth. Begin 
on the man who lives next door by 
inspiring confidence in him, by in- 
spiring love in him for you because 
of your righteousness, and your 
missionary work has already begun, 

"For behold the field is white al- 
ready to harvest, and lo, he that 
thrusteth in his sickle with his might, 
the same layeth up in store that he 
perish not, but bringeth salvation to 
his soul; 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, 
with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, 
temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, dili- 
gence. 

"Ask and ye shall receive, knock 
and it shall be opened unto you." 

Brethren and sisters, let us do 
the missionary work that is at our 
doors, preparing our sons and 
daughters for the missionary work 
that will be theirs when this awful 
war is over. It will not be long 
until there will be a demand for 
capable men and women in this 
Church to teach the truth in por- 
tions of the earth where heretofore 
we have been excluded ; and if we 
would have eternal joy in the king- 
dom of our Father with those he 
has blessed us with here, let us be 
unselfish in our lives ; let us prepare 
for the work, and go out into the 
world and proclaim the truth, when 



the opportunity comes, and be the 
means in the hands of our Father 
of drawing his children back to him 
by teaching them the beauties of his 
gospel. 

I pray that his Spirit may be 
throughout Israel, that the love of 
our Father's children may be in our 
hearts, that we may sense the im- 
portance of our mission in the 
world, while we are grasping for 
the things that are not ours, that 
are only loaned to us as stewards, 
that we may not forget the price- 
less gift, the priceless privilege, 
within our reach, of teaching the 
gospel and saving the souls of the 
children of men. I pray that this 
blessing may be ours, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Seven hundred years before the 
birth of our Savior, a prophet of 
God upon the eastern hemisphere 
predicted the coming forth of "a 
marvelous work and a wonder." 
"Mormonism," so /tailed, accord- 
ing to the faith of its adherents, is 
the fulfilment of that ancient pre- 
diction. And indeed it would be 
difficult to conceive of anything 
more marvelous, more wonderful, 
than the foundation facts upon 
which rests the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. What 
could be more strange, more un- 
expected, than the re-opening of 
the heavens in an age when it was

believed and asserted that the heav- 
ens were permanently sealed, that 
God no longer spoke to man, that 
revelation had ceased, and that 
angels would never again commune 
with earth's inhabitants? But lo! 
the heavens are opened ; angels 
come to earth; and not only this, 
but God himself descends from his 
glorious throne and appears unto 
man, opening the last and greatest 
of the gospel dispensations. An 
angel reveals the hidden past of the 
American continent — the Book of 
Mormon, containing the fulness of 
the gospel, a history of the Amer- 
cas in pre-historic times, and a 
prophecy of their wondrous future. 
An angel restores the Aaronic 
priesthood, which holds the keys of 
repentance and baptism ; and other 
angels bring back the higher or 
Melchizedek priesthood; holding 
the keys of heavenly mysteries; 
and under this delegated divine au- 
thority, without which no man can 
lawfully represent God, or admin- 
ister the sacred ordinances of the 
gospel, the Church of Christ is or- 
ganized once more upon the earth. 
Truly, a marvelous work and a 
wonder — so marvelous, so wonder- 
ful, that most men reject it, deem- 
ing it a fable. And yet it is noth- 
ing more nor less than the plain 
fulfilment of prophecy. 

This Church was founded for a 
definite purpose. It is not merely 
one more added to the hundreds of 
religious sects with which the world 
is filled. It is the lifted ensign for 
the gathering of God's chosen 
Israel from the four quarters of the 
globe, for the purpose of building 
a Zion, the New Jerusalem, and 
preparing a people for the glorious 
coming of the Lord. It is an icon- 
oclastic as well as a constructive 
work. Reference has been made by 



previous speakers to the changing 
of creeds and breaking up of old 
traditions, as the result of the res- 
toration of the everlasting gospel. 
I have no time for details; I can 
only hit the high places and throw 
out a few thoughts pertaining to 
this theme. I will call your atten- 
tion to the fact that science, art, dis- 
covery and invention have been 
supplementing the work of preach- 
ing the gospel. Scholarly men, 
learned investigators and demon- 
strators have been following in the 
wake of the Latter-day Prophet, 
confirming the doctrines that he 
taught and virtually bearing testi- 
mony to their truth. We are liv- 
ing in an age of wonders, of mir- 
acles; for what are miracles, after 
all, but improved methods of doing 
things, accompanied, of course, by 
a greater measure of power than is 
usually possessed and exercised by 
man? You who are in attendance 
at this conference and the State 
Fair now in progress, saw, last 
night and on yesterday, what would 
have been deemed a miracle by peo- 
ple living less than a hundred years 
ago. You beheld an airship sailing 
through the heavens. When I saw 
it I recalled the words of the 
prophet-poet Tennyson : 



"I dipt into the future, 

Far as human eye could see; 
Saw the vision of the world, 

And all the wonder that would be; 
Saw the heavens fill with commerce, 

Argosies of magic sails, 
Pilots of the purple twilight, 

Dropping down with costly bales; 
Heard the heavens fill with shouting, 

And there rained a ghastly dew 
From the nations' airy navies, 

Grappling in the central blue. 
Far along the world-wide whisper 

Of the south wind rushing warm, 
And the standards of the peoples 

Plunging through the thunder 
storm.

Till the war drum throbbed no longer, 

And the battle flags were furled 
In the parliament of man, 

The federation of the world. 
There the common-sense of most 

Shall hold a fretful realm in awe, 
And the kindly earth shall slumber, 

Lapt in universal law." 

In these beautiful lines the Eng- 
lish poet describes the coming of 
the airship and the advent of the 
Millennium, a prediction that we of 
today have seen in part fulfilled. 
This prophecy was uttered sixty 
years ago and more. What will the 
next sixty years bring forth? 
Probably the complete realization 
of the poet's forecast. 

What would the first man — the 
first white man who ever entered 
this region, have thought, could he 
have "dipt into the future," and 
seen what we now behold ? Do you 
know who that man was? He was 
a Spanish priest named Escalante, 
and he came from Santa Fe, New 
Mexico, one hundred and forty 
years ago, starting in July, 1776, 
the very month and year that the 
Declaration of Independence was 
signed at Philadelphia, and a new 
nation was born upon Atlantic 
shores. The region comprised with- 
in the present states of Utah, Ne- 
vada, California, Arizona and New 
Mexico then belonged to Spain, and 
most of it was in the heart of what 
was designated upon the maps and 
in the school books of a later per- 
iod as "The Great American Des- 
ert," a region infested by wild 
beasts and savages. At that time 
there 1 were but two towns of any 
consequence throughout this vast 
stretch of country. One was Santa 
Fe, capital of the Spanish province 
of /New Mexico ; and the other 
was Monterey, on the California 
sea coast. Santa Fe was in the lat- 
ter half of its second century, but 



Monterey was only six years old. 
Monterey had been made a port of 
entry by the Spanish government, 
for the transmission of troops and 
supplies to the New Mexican cap- 
ital, and it was important that a 
road should be opened between the 
two places. Father Escalante, who 
had had experience among the In- 
dians, volunteered his services to 
the governor of New Mexico to 
look for such a route — an old Span- 
ish trail leading westward from 
Taos. With seven companions he 
set out from Santa Fe for that pur- 
pose. Pursuing a devious north- 
westerly course, they crossed Green 
River, ascended the Uintah, and 
came out upon the tops of the Wa- 
satch Mountains, at or near the 
head waters of Provo river. Thence 
they descended into Utah Valley. 
The native "Yutas" received them 
kindly, but could give them no in- 
formation respecting a route to the 
sea, or of white settlers in all the 
surrounding region. The explor- 
ers did not come any farther north, 
though they heard of the Great 
Salt Lake, and after christening 
some of the streams and giving 
them Spanish names, they proceed- 
ed southward with two native 
guides. Passing down the Sevier, 
and over the mountains about 
where Beaver now stands, they 
found themselves in the valley 
since called Escalante. There their 
food supplies gave out, and they re- 
luctantly abandoned the expedition. 
Turning eastward they traveled to- 
ward the Colorado, crossed the 
Grand Canyon, and by way of the 
Moquis Indian villages reached 
Santa Fe, January, 1777. Those 
■were the first white men who are 
known to have penetrated to these 
parts. 

Next came the British and Amer-

ican fur hunters. Great Britain 
had inherited the fur trade from 
the French at the conquest of Can- 
ada, and had established the power- 
ful Hudson Bay Company, which 
for many years held almost undis- 
puted sway among the Indian tribes 
of the Northwest. John Jacob 
Astor, the patriarch of the fur trade 
in the United States, proposed to 
break the British monopoly and 
make New York instead of London 
the emporium of that lucrative en- 
terprise. In 1808-09 he established 
the trading post of Astoria, at the 
mouth of the Columbia river, in- 
tending to found similar stations 
along the Columbia and Missouri 
rivers. But the war of 1812 broke 
up his operations, and it was not 
until 1822 that the American Fur 
Company was organized at St. 
Louis by General William N. Ash- 
ley and others. They pushed their 
brigades .of trappers over the Rocky 
Mountains, and by the year 1825 
were firmly established in the Green 
river country. One of these trap- 
pers was James Bridger, the reput- 
ed discoverer of the Great Salt 
Lake. He built the famous Fort 
Bridger, the site of which is now 
in Southwestern Wyoming. The so 
called "Fort" consisted of a few log 
houses surrounded by a stockade. 
General Ashley built a similar fort 
on Utah Lake, which was then 
known as Lake Ashley. In these 
lonely log forts lived the trappers 
and traders with their Indian wives 
and half breed children, baiting the 
bear, trapping the beaver, and act- 
ing as guides for chance travelers 
or occasional emigrant trains ota 
their way to the western ocean,. 
Most of this emigration was for 
Oregon, then jointly occupied by 
Great Britain and the United 
States; the remainder went to Cal- 



ifornia, which was still possessed by 
Mexico, as an inheritance from 
Spain. 

In 1847 the Latter-day Saints, 
under the leadership of President 
Brigham Young, began to fulfil the 
prediction of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, who had declared, two years 
before his death, that the Saints 
would "become a mighty people in 
the midst of the Rocky Mountains." 
In the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants there is a revelation entitled 
"The Word and Will of the Lord," 
to a people encamped upon the Mis- 
souri river, who had left civiliza- 
tion behind, who had been driven 
from their homes and were making 
preparations to cross the great 
plains and mountains and settle in 
this then empty and desolate land. 
That "Word and Will of the Lord" 
commanded the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints to organize themselves 
into companies of hundreds, fifties, 
and tens, preparatory to the long 
and wearisome ox-team journey to 
Salt Lake Valley. 

And now I would like to ask a 
few questions : Would it be wise or 
sensible in anyone at this time to at- 
tempt to carry out the terms of that 
revelation? What would you think 
of a man, in a day of railroads and 
automobiles and aeroplanes, who 
would yoke up an ox team here in 
Utah, and make a start for the Mis- 
souri river ? What would you think 
of a man who would set a trap for 
a bear or a beaver out here in front 
of the Bureau of Information? You 
would think he ought to apply to 
the Bureau for a little up-to-date in- 
formation, wouldn't you? The les- 
son I wish to convey is this : We 
are a progressive people, for we 
are God's people, and as such we 
have the right to use these modern

methods, these improved scientific 
facilities, which the Lord has pro- 
vided and placed in our hands for 
the promotion of his marvelous 
work. 

"New occasions teach new duties, 

Time makes ancient good uncouth; 
They must upward be and onward, 

Who would keep abreast of Truth; 
Lo! before us gleam her camp-fires, 

We ourselves must Pilgrims be, 
Launch our Mayflower, and steer 
boldly 

Through the desperate winter sea; 
Nor attempt the future's portal 

With the past's blood-rusted key." 

Many years ago there came to 
Utah a learned prelate of the Greek 
Catholic church. You who are 
conversant with the history of the 
Christian church are aware that it 
divided itself, during the early cen- 
turies, into two parts, one with its 
headquarters at Rome, and the 
other with its headquarters at Con- 
stantinople. The Western church, 
with the Pope of Rome at its head, 
became known as the Roman Cath- 
olic church; while the Eastern 
church, with the Patriarch of Con- 
stantinople as its chief presiding of- 
ficer, is the Greek Catholic church 
of today. This learned man — I be- 
lieve he was the Archbishop of 
Athens — visited Salt Lake City, and 
I had a conversation with him. He 
had been to a "Mormon" sacrament 
meeting, and had much to say in 
criticism of our method of admin- 
istering the Lord's Supper, partic- 
ularly our use of water instead of 
wine on such occasions. He said it 
made him shudder when he saw the 
people sipping the water; and he 
pointed out the fact, for it is a fact, 
that according to the Bible the Sa- 
vior, when he instituted the sacra- 
ment among the Jews used wine, 
declaring that it was his blood, or 
that it represented his blood. I 



could add that the Book of Mormon 
also states that the Savior used wine 
when he introduced the sacrament 
among the Nephites. 

My Greek Catholic friend, wheth- 
er he knew it or not, had hit upon 
the great distinguishing feature that 
differentiates God's Church from 
all other churches under the sun — 
in this, that while they are founded 
upon books and traditions and the 
precepts of men, this Church is 
built upon the rock of Christ, upon 
the principle of immediate and con- 
tinuous revelation. The Latter- 
day Saints do not do things because 
they happen to be printed in a book. 
They do not do things because God 
told the Jews to do them ; nor do 
they do or leave undone anything 
because of instructions that Christ 
gave to the Nephites. Whatever is 
done by this Church is because God, 
speaking from heaven in our day, 
has commanded this Church to do 
it. No book presides over this 
Church, and no book lies at its 
foundation. You cannot pile up 
books enough to take the place of 
God's priesthood, inspired by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. That is 
the constitution of the Church of 
Christ. If we use water instead of 
wine in the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper, it is because Christ has so 
commanded. Divine revelation 
adapts itself to the circumstances 
and conditions of men, and change 
upon change ensues as God's pro- 
gressive work goes on to its destiny. 
There is no book big enough or 
good enough -to preside over this 
Church. 

In saying this, I speak with all 
due reverence of the written word 
of God, that which is printed in the 
books, part of which may be obso- 
lete, having fulfilled its purpose 
and been laid upon the shelf, while 



56

the other part is virile, full of life, 
and applicable to our present state 
— our present degree of develop- 
ment. But even this part must be 
interpreted aright. No man ought 
to contend for what is in the books, 
in the face of God's mouthpiece, 
who speaks for him and interprets 
his word. To so contend is to de- 
fer to the dead letter in pref ernce to 
the living oracle, which is always a 
false position. What the Lord said 
to the Jews and Nephites, two thou- 
sand years ago, or what he said to 
the Latter-day Saints fifty or sixty 
years ago, has no force whatever at 
this time, unless it agrees with pres- 
ent-day revelation, with the Lord's 
most recent instructions to his peo- 
ple through his chosen or appointed 
servants or servant ; and they who 
ignore this fact are liable to get into 
trouble. It is the latest word from 
God that must be heeded, in prefer- 
ence to any former revelation, how- 
ever true. The same God who says 
do thus and so today, can repeal 
that commandment tomorrow, with- 
out being changeable or inconsist- 
ent. The legislature, meeting every 
two years, repeals old laws, or such 
of its former enactments as have 
served their purpose ; but no one 
thinks of charging the law makers 
with inconsistency or self-contradic- 
tion. How then can God be con- 
sidered inconsistent if he says one 
thing today, and changes it tomor- 
row, or next month, or next year, 
in order to suit altered circum- 
stances? He commanded Abraham 
to slay his son, and 'Abraham was 
about to do so, when the same God 
said ; "Lay not thy hand upon the 
lad." Abraham was under obliga- 
tion to carry out the first command, 
until the second one was given, and 
then he was under obligation to 
obey the second command instead 



of the first ; and he would have been 
a transgressor had he failed. 

I might continue the theme in- 
definitely, but will close now with 
this thought. God's work is pro- 
gressive. It changes its appearance, 
but never its principles. The truths 
upon which it is founded are eter- 
nal, unalterable, but there are many 
regulations that change and change 
and change, as the work of God 
goes on. The everlasting gospel is 
something more than a fire-escape, 
the way out of a perilous situation. 
It is the divine plan for human pro- 
gress, the pathway to perfection; 
and the spirit of the gospel is the 
spirit of improvement, of advance- 
ment. God's work will go on, but 
will you and I go on with it? "His 
purposes will ripen fast, unfolding 
every hour," but will we ripen and 
unfold with them? That is the 
problem. Let us take it home to our 
hearts. How can we go along with 
the Lord's work? There is but one 
way, and that is to do the things 
which he has commanded, and leave 
undone the things which he has for- 
bidden. There are two ways of los- 
ing the spirit of this work, and be- 
coming non-progressive, barren and 
unfruitful. The quickest way is to 
trangress God's commands by do- 
ing the things which he has said we 
shall not do ; the other way is to ne- 
glect and ignore what he has com- 
manded us to do. O my brothers 
and sisters of the Church of Christ ! 
Let us be awake and up and doing. 
Keep alive in your hearts the spirit 
of eternal progress, and go on to 
perfection. Do not be among those 
who weary of well doing, who fall 
by the wayside and allow the great 
rrocession to sweep on without 
them. Keep on doing something 
for God, that the spirit of his work 
may abide in you, and guide you

along that path "growing brighter 
and brighter unto the perfect day."

Grandeur of the Church organization 
— Great responsibility of teachers 
therein — Every man should first 
take heed unto himself — Illustration 
of proper preparation for the work 
— No man can teach what he does 
not feel and know — What to teach, 
and how to prepare — Teaching 
should suit conditions and the needs 
of those who are taught — A word 
to bishops. 

At this moment there is just one 
supreme wish in my heart, and it 
is this : That the divine feeling ex- 
perienced by all present this after- 
noon intensified just now as we sat 
in profound silence, listening to 
those inspired words so beautifully 
and impressively sung by Sister 
Shipp, might be felt in every home 
and in every heart throughout the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I rejoice that the Lord, 
in his wisdom, has so organized his 
Church that this wish might, at 
least in a measure, be fulfilled. As 
that thought came to me, just a mo- 
ment ago, I saw in my mind's eye 
an army of approximately twenty 
thousand men on whom rests the 
great responsibility of carrying the 
gospel message of peace to every 
fireside throughout Zion. Those 
who comprise this army are the 
ward teachers. 

I never contemplate the organi- 
zation of this Church in any least 
degree whatsoever, but I am im- 
pressed! with the divinity of the 
work. I can not see, for my life, 
why every honest man in the world, 



who gives even but little thought to 
this great organization and the op- 
portunities it offers for producing 
men and women of character, can 
not get a testimony, even by reason 
and observation, of the divinity of 
the Church of Christ as established 
in this latter day. Why, the stamp 
of divinity is upon every feature of 
the work ! All who labor sincerely 
in it can truthfully say that if any 
man will do the will of God he shall 
know for himself whether the doc- 
trine is of God or whether it is of 
man. 

These twenty thousand men men- 
tioned comprise only a very small 
portion — an important portion, 
however, — of the work of the min- 
istry. 

It is said in Ephesians, fourth 
chapter, that Christ gave some 
apostles and some prophets, some 
evangelists and some pastors and 
teachers ; "for the perfecting of the 
Saints, for the work of the min- 
istry, for the edifying of the body 
of Christ." The teachers, in the 
Church, holding the holy priest- 
hood, have devolving upon them the 
great responsibility of perfecting 
the Saints, and of edifying the body 
of Christ; therefore, I think it is not 
too much to say that it is their duty, 
their duty, to carry into every home 
just such a divine spirit as we have 
experienced here in these sessions 
of conference. No greater respon- 
sibility can rest upon any man, than 
to be a teacher of God's children. 

When Paul said good-bye to the 
churches in Asia, knowing that he 
would never again come back to 
those branches among which he had 
labored so incessantly and diligently 
for several years, he called the 
elders of Enhesus to him one day, 
over to Miletus. He did not go 
over to the Church where he had 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



recently spent nearly three years, 
because he wanted to hasten to 
Jerusalem; but he could not pass 
them without saying good-bye to 
them. He sent word to them to 
meet him over at the town of 
Miletus, where he gave them in- 
structions. You remember that 
among other things he said : "Take 
heed, therefore, to yourselves, and 
to all the flock over the which the 
Holy Ghost hath made you over- 
seers, to feed the Church of God, 
which he hath purchased with his 
own blood ; for I know this that 
after my departing shall grievous 
wolves .enter in among you, not 
sparing the flock." The admonition 
to these men — and among them 
were bishops, for the word that is 
interpreted there "overseers" is used 
in another place as bishops — was to 
take heed unto themselves first and 
then to the people over whom they 
presided. Associated with those 
bishops were elders, just as we have 
them in the Church. That same ad- 
monition is applicable to the elders 
today, who are presiding over the 
Church as ward teachers. Some of 
them feel that their calling is of 
little importance, that there is not 
much dignity attached to it, when 
the fact is, that there is no more 
important work in the Church. We 
can not say of any one calling in 
the Church, that it is of more im- 
portance than another, because all 
are devoted to the development, to 
the instruction, to the salvation of 
God's children. So it is with the 
calling of teacher; but if there be 
any preference given, because of 
superior advantages in winning 
these people to salvation, it will go 
to those men holding the priesthood 
of God, who come in direct contact 
with the individual members of the 
Church. The duty, however, of each 



man who has accepted this calling 
is to first take heed unto himself. 

The other day it was my privilege 
to drive through the fields in my 
old home town. I passed through 
two farms up near the mountain 
canal. I saw one that had yielded 
an exceptionally good crop of oats. 
Notwithstanding the drought, the 
cold in the spring, and other disad- 
vantages, the farmer had thrashed 
an excellent yield. Just over the 
fence was another oat field, but a 
failure, comparatively speaking. I 
said to the man : "Why, what is the 
matter? You' must have planted 
poor seed." "No, it is the same seed 
that my neighbor has." "Well, 
then it was planted too late, and 
vou did not have enough moisture 
in the ground to bring it up." "It 
was sown the same afternoon that 
he sowed his." Upon further 1 in- 
quiry, I learned that the first man 
had plowed his in the fall ; then he 
had disked it carefully in the spring, 
making a mulch on the surface, and 
by such tilling had conserved the 
moisture of the winter. His neigh- 
bor, on the other hand, had plowed 
his late in the spring, had left the 
furrows unharrowed ; the moisture 
had evaporated. Following the 
sowing of the seed came four weeks 
or six weeks of drouth, and there 
was not sufficient moisture to ger- 
minate the seed. The first man had 
made preparation, the proper kind 
of preparation, and nature yielded 
the increase. The second man la- 
bored hard, but his preparation was 
poor ; indeed, he had made inade- 
quate preparation. 

I now can picture in my mind 
twelve thousand divisions that may 
be compared in a way to these two 
fields. In each one are found — not 
oats, not wheat, not grasses, not 
things that perish, — but living be- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

ings as eternal as the Father him- 
self. Over each of these divisions 
in God's great garden have been 
placed overseers called teachers, and 
they are asked to nourish and to 
inspire God's children. I venture 
the thought that the Great Gardener 
in looking over his fields can see 
some that are thriving in righteous 
activity and others are starving be- 
cause of the drought of neglected 
duty, of the chilling atmosphere of 
vanity, or the blight of intemper- 
ance. Why? Perhaps because the 
gardeners, the overseers, had not 
made necessary preparations, or 
performed their duty well. 

The first thing to do, my breth- 
ren, is to look to yourselves, to see 
whether or not you are prepared to 
teach. No man can teach that which 
he himself does not know. It is your 
duty to teach that Jesus Christ is 
the redeemer of the world, that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, 
and that to him in this last dispen- 
sation there appeared God the 
Father and his Son in person. Do 
you believe it? Do you feel it? 
Does that testimony radiate from 
your being when you enter into the 
home? If so, that radiation will 
give life to the people whom you 
go to teach. If not, there will be a 
dearth, a drouth, a lack of that spir- 
itual environment in which the 
Saints grow. 

Second, Is your heart free from 
backbiting, from fault-finding, from 
hard feelings one to another? It is 
your duty, to see that there is no 
backbiting, that there is no iniquity 
existing in the Church. You can 
teach effectively only that which 
you yourselves feel. Part of the 
preparation of a teacher consists in 
freeing his own heart from those 
things. In doing so follow the ad- 
vice of one good writer who says : 



"In the very depths of your soul dig 
a grave ; let it be as some forgotten 
spot to which no( path leads ; and 
there, in the eternal silence bury the 
wrongs which you have suffered. 
Your heart will feel as if a load 
had fallen from it and a divine 
peace come to abide with you." 
With that divine peace in your soul 
go into the homes and teach the 
people. 

But that condition is but the be- 
ginning. Three other things should 
be kept in mind for thorough prep- 
aration. The first is a knowledge 
of those whom you are to teach; the 
second, a knowledge of what you 
are to teach; and third, a knowledge 
as much as may be obtained at least 
by thoughtful consideration and 
prayer, of how you are going to 
teach. 

I have never understood just why 
we have limited our duties of teach- 
er to a visit once a month. A visit 
is not teaching. Reading the out- 
line as prepared by the bishop or 
the high council is not teaching. 
Just repeating some passages of 
scripture, or merely the telling of 
something to the members of the 
family in a home is not teaching. 
Teaching is the awakening of 
thought in the minds of those whom 
we visit, and the convincing of their 
souls of the truth of the message 
that we bring to them. There must 
be giving and receiving, a reciprocal 
condition. How necessary it is, 
then, to know those whom we 
teach ! No two families in any dis- 
trict are alike. I call to mind now 
one group of six families, one mem- 
ber of which is a patriarch in the 
Church, living in the sunset of a 
faithful life with his daughter, a 
teacher in the public schools, and a 
grand-daughter, a student in the 
high school. On the same block 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



next to him, reside a young couple, 
who have but recently joined the 
Church. The girl had grown up 
in our communities, but she had not 
joined the Church until recently. 
Two of their little children are also 
baptized. Across the street reside 
a widow and her daughter, the 
daughter a typist in one of the bus- 
iness offices of the city, and the 
other three families present condi- 
tions just as varying. Brethren, the 
message, and particularly the man- 
ner of presenting that message 
might not be the same when given 
to one who had spent his life in 
faithful labor in the Church, as 
when given to those who are newly 
converted. As each family is dif- 
ferent from another so each indi- 
vidual in the family differs from 
others, so our messages and our 
methods, particularly our methods 
of presentation, might vary. I cite 
this just to impress us with this 
thought, that it is our duty to know 
those whom we are going to teach. 
That is one reason, I think, why the 
Lord says : "It is the duty of the 
teacher to watch over the Church 
always." Not just once a month but 
always a teacher ; no hour in the day 
when you are free from that re- 
sponsibility. There is no day in the 
week when you are free, and when 
you should not feel it your duty to 
do something, if possible, to make 
that group of memhers in the 
Church better and happier. 

What you are to teach is the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. When the 
bishop gives you any special mes- 
sage — tithing, for example, study 
that principle, first by "taking heed 
unto yourself" to see if you can 
teach it consistently. If it be prayer, 
"take heed unto yourself" in regard 
to prayer. Do you get down on 



your knees before you go out to 
teach that message? D,o you study 
some boy who is a little questionable 
in his life to know just what atti- 
tude he will take towards prayer? 
Do you pray for God to inspire you 
to say something to lead such a one 
to see the necessity of prayer ? 

O teachers, yours is an important 
calling ! God help you to be true to 
it, to feel that part of the responsi- 
bility of carrying on God's work, in 
this the last dispensation, rests upon 
you. 

Even after you have studied your 
groups as indicated or just hinted at 
here, and presented your message 
in the most effective manner you 
are capable of, your duty is not 
ended. President Lund, I think, re- 
ferred to the light attendance at 
some of our sacrament meetings. 
You carry the responsibility, teach- 
ers, of seeing to it that members of 
the Church attend to sacrament 
meeting. How can you teach that 
duty effectively unless you yourself 
be present, that you may be able 
intelligently to commend those in 
your district who are in attend- 
ance, and to teach those who are 
absent ? 

Just a word to the bishops. I 
believe that teaching will be more 
effective in the Church if you will 
call your priesthood to you, and 
point out to them in meeting, after 
prayer, in humility, what it means 
for them to go out from house to 
house as your representatives. Don't 
just call them somewhat indiffer- 
ently from the pulpit, and make an 
asignment in an indefinite way ; but 
rather there in your bishop's meet- 
ing tell them individually what it 
means to be a teacher, ask them if 
they will stand by you in your 
efforts to uphold the standard of 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

the Church. When you have occa- 
sion to release them, do it in a dig- 
nified and honorable manner, by 
telling them how you appreciate 
what they have done, and why they 
are at present released. 

I bear you my testimony that this 
is the work of God. I know it, I 
know it. I know that God will help 
us in this work. I know that he is 
by us, if we will but call upon him 
and ask him to direct us, if we will 
live so that he can. He sometimes 
prompts us, and we go on headlong 
without heeding the prompting ; but 
he is near to help us. I know that 
the happiest time of our lives is 
when we are devoted to his work. 
God help us to be true to it while 
we are in this life. There is only 
one life, and we shall pass through 
this probationary state but once: 



"Not many lives, but only one have 

we! 
One — only one. 
How precious should that one life 

ever be! 
Day after day filled up with precious 

toil, 
Hour after hour bringing in new 

spoil." 

May God guide us day after day 
and hour after hour in the great 
work of teaching, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Notices of overflow meetings on 
Sunday to be held in the Assembly 
Hall and under a tent near the Bu- 
reau of Information, were read by 
President Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"My country, 'tis of thee." 

Prayer was pronounced by Elder 
J. S. Page, Jr., president of the 
Nebo stake of Zion. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the 
Tabernacle, 10 a .m., Sunday, Octo- 
ber 8, 1916, President Joseph F. 
Smith, presiding. 

President Smith announced that 
an overflow meeting will be held 
this morning in the Assembly Hall 
adjoining, under direction of Elder 
Hyrum M. Smith ; also one in the 
newly erected, and seated tent, east 
of the Bureau of Information, un- 
der direction of Elder David O. 
McKay, both for the accommoda- 
tion of those who can not find seats 
in the now overcrowded Taher- 
nacle. 

The choir sang the hymn : "Great 
God, attend while Zion sings." 

Prayer by Elder Rey L. Pratt, in 
charge of New Mexican division 
of the Western States Mission. 

A tenor solo was sung by John 
T. Hand, entitled, "If with all your 
hearts ye truly love me," from 
"Elijah," by Mendelssohn.

Faith exists among the Latter-day 
Saints — Devotion to duty, charity, 
and good order found in the presid- 
ing officers and offices — Affairs of 
the Church of Christ administered 
with great care by men having deep 
faith in its destiny. Some things 
that need careful watching and 
safeguarding — Prosperity has 
brought extravagance in expendi- 
tures of borrowed money — Inor- 
dinate public and private disposi- 
tion to borrow and bond — A warn- 
ing for -\the day of reckoning — 
Mexican affairs — If war comes, let 
it not be of our making — Ultimate 
triumph of the work of the Lord. 



Since the opening session of this 
conference, my brethren and sisters, 
one thought has been uppermost in 
my mind. It has been gratitude to 
the Lord that I am identified with 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; that, notwithstand- 
ing my weaknesses and imperfec- 
tions, I' am permitted to be here 
with you this Sabbath mornnig in 
worship, enjoying your fellowship 
and, I trust, your confidence. 

The Redeemer, during his minis- 
try upon earth, on one occasion pro- 
pounded this question to his dis- 
ciples : "When the Son of man com- 
eth, shall he find faith on the 
earth?" And that thought came to 
me this morning, as I contemplated 
this vast congregation of Latter-day 
Saints come up here to worship the 
Lord, not because of idle curiosity, 
but that they may hear his word and 
learn to walk in his paths. 

The President of the Church 
stated, in his opening remarks, that 
there are now seventy-two organ- 
ized stakes of Zion. I returned only 
a few days ago from a protracted 
trip which took me into and 
through a great number of these 
various stakes, beginning with the 
Alberta and Taylor stakes, in Can- 
ada, through Idaho, and Southern 
Utah where I had been in attend- 
ance at conferences of the Pan- 
guitch, Kanab, St. George and the 
Parowan stakes of Zion. I endeav- 
ored, as I associated with the peo- 
ple, to determine as far as possible 
their condition, believing it to be 
my duty to be informed regarding 
the spiritual and temporal welfare

of the people, and I want to say 
this to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that wherever I have gone, 
from Canada on the north to Ka- 
nab and St. George upon the south, 
large congregations of Latter-day 
Saints have assembled in all of the 
meetings which have been held. I 
have been impressed with the fact, 
as I mingled with the people, as 
I felt of their spirit, that faith does 
exist, that never before in the his- 
tory of the Church were greater 
numbers of people gathered to- 
gether upon similar occasions to 
hear the word of the Lord. I have 
been impressed as I have come in 
contact with the bishops, who pre- 
side over the more than eight hun- 
dred wards in the Church in these 
various stakes of Zion, with their 
faith and devotion to the responsi- 
bilities which have been placed up- 
on them. I have been impressed, 
as I have come in contact with the 
presidents of these various stakes, 
with their devotion, with their faith, 
with the splendid service they are 
giving to the Lord and to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in the discharge of 
the duties and responsibilities which 
have been placed upon them. They 
are young men in years, many of 
them young in experience, but I 
believe as devoted, as full of faith 
and hope and charity as men have 
been at any other period of the 
world's history. 

My thoughts have then carried 
me a little farther, while I have 
been considering the proceedings of 
this Conference, and I want to say 
the same thing in regard to my per- 
sonal association, acquaintance, and 
knowledge of the character of the 
men who preside over the missions 
of the Church. They are devoted, 
faithful, capable men. For years, 
I have had my desk in the office of 
the presiding bishop of the Church. 



I have studied carefully, I have 
been an observer, because I wished 
to know, I wished to satisfy myself, 
and to speak intelligently and truth- 
fully, if required to speak — so 1 
have studied conditions there. All 
that I have said and more, if possi- 
ble, applies to the administration 
of the affairs of the office of the 
presiding bishopric in this Church. 
The spirit of charity is there, the 
spirit of sympathy is there. No 
one is turned away without assist- 
ance, where it is necessary to ren- 
der it. The business of the office 
is conducted in the most orderly 
manner. 

I have been associated with the 
First Council of Seventies. I know 
their devotion to be just as great 
to duty, to the requirements of 
their offices, that they are men ready 
at any moment to go or to come — 
to be, as far as frail man may be, 
what the Lord desires them to be, 
and to go where he wants them 
to go. It is needless for me to say 
that this same eulogy applies to the 
Council of the Twelve, with whom 
I am directly associated. There 
may have been more devoted men, 
there may have been men more 
united, there may have been men, 
every one of whom more earnestly 
desire the welfare of the Church, 
but if so, it has never been my priv- 
ilege to come in contact with them. 
I am becoming an old man, and 
have been personally acquainted 
with many, in fact, nearly all, of 
our brethren who have presided 
over us in the past. 

I bear this same testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters, regarding 
the administration of the affairs of 
the Church under the direction of 
the First Presidency. I have 
known personally every man who 
has presided over the Church since 
the days of the prophet, not, of 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



course, acquainted with him, but I 
knew President Young, I knew 
President Taylor, I knew President 
Woodruff, intimately, every one of 
them, and President Snow — and I 
believe that I intimately know our 
brethren who preside over the 
Church today. I bear testimony 
to you that the affairs of the 
Church were never administered 
with greater care, they never were 
administered in greater humility, 
they were never administered by 
men possessing greater faith as to 
the destiny of this work, the, accom- 
plishment of God's purposes, than 
those men who preside at present 
over its affairs. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
am not saying this by way of com- 
pliment, I am not saying it because 
it appears to . be necessary ! I am 
saying it because it is the convic- 
tion of my heart, and I know that 
I stand here speaking the truth as 
it applies to the body of the Church, 
where I have visited, as it applies 
to the bishops of wards and to pres- 
idents of stakes, as it applies to 
the men who preside over the tem- 
poral affairs of this Church, and 
men who direct its missionary activ- 
ities, and the presiding authorities. 
I thank the Lord in my heart that 
I can stand here and bear this wit- 
ness before you truthfully this 
morning. Those are the observa- 
tions, the conclusions which have 
come to me from my observations 
during this long journey which I 
have just made in the Church. 

I would not have you understand 
that every condition which exists 
is satisfactory, that it is all just as 
we would like it to be. Not at all. 
It never has been, and I want just 
briefly to call your attention now — 
after referring to those things 
which seem so encouraging to me, 
which give me the absolute assur- 



ance that should the Redeemer 
come today, he would find faith 
upon the earth — to some of the 
things which it appears to me these 
men who are here before me must 
safeguard and carefully watch in 
their various stakes and wards of 
the Church. Wherever I went I 
found a degree of prosperity which 
perhaps has never before existed 
in the Church. The products of the 
soil, the flock, and the herd, the 
products of the factory, the busi- 
ness done by the stores and banks, 
are greater perhaps than ever be- 
fore. The prices of commodities 
are high, and the consequence is 
that money is coming easy to many 
people where it came under great 
difficulties before, and I fancied, 
my brethren and sisters, that I 
could see a tendency to the extrava- 
gant expenditure of money, a lack 
of economy on the part of many 
people which might properly and 
profitably be corrected. 

I passed a splendid farm ; there 
were large stacks of hay and grain 
there, and cattle and horses in the 
pasture. I remarked to a man who 
happened to be a banker, that those 
boys, who were acquaintances of 
mine, would be rich after a little. 
I said, "Look at their abundant 
harvest, and the cattle that they 
have gathered around them." 

"Yes," he said, "it would be all 
right if it were not tor the fact that 
so-and-so has a mortgage on their 
farm, and we have a mortgage on 
their cattle." How I regretted to 
hear that ! 

I went into one small incorpor- 
ated city, and in discussing the ap- 
parent prosperity of the community, 
the man with whom I was talking, 
said it would take five hundred 
thousand dollars to pay the debts 
which this community owed to the 
banks. I went through a series of 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS.

splendid fields and farms and the 
man who owns one of them said to 
me, "Eighty per cent of these farms 
are mortgaged." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
refer to this earnestly, and I earn- 
estly admonish you that while this 
period of prosperity lasts, while 
money is so easy, see to it that 
mortgages are lifted from, your 
farms, and from your cattle,, and 
that the debts you have incurred 
are paid, because a day of reckon- 
ing is coming! I want to tell you 
that. This condition cannot always 
continue. The facility with which 
money can be acquired because of 
the great amounts which are accu- 
mulated in the banks makes bor- 
rowing easy, but it is not so easy 
to pay back. I don't want you, 
when that; day of reckoning shall 
come, to find yourself in bondage 
to money lenders and brokers. I 
believe it will be worth your while 
to pay your debts. I fancied, my 
brethren and sisters, that I saw this 
same spirit of extravagance enter- 
ing into the affairs of the little mu- 
nicipalities that I visited, a disposi- 
tion to borrow and to bond and to 
increase the taxing power of the 
administration, with the result that 
many little towns are bonded until 
it| will be exceedingly difficult for 
them to pay their debts. Don't you 
know that a bond on the town or 
city where you live is a mortgage 
on your home, a mortgage on your 
own personal possessions? There 
are times, it is true, when it may he 
necessary, both in personal and pub- 
lic affairs, to borrow money. I only 
want to urge the greatest care ; I 
only want to urge consistency; I 
only want to urge economy in the 
administration of public affairs to 
the end that you do not involve 
yourselves in debts which it will 



be impossible to pay. I fancied 
that I had seen that same thing in 
the administration of State affairs, 
a disposition to be extravagant in 
the expenditure of public funds. 
Twenty years ago this State came 
into the Union under a constitution 
which was framed by men who had 
been carefully selected from every 
section of it. I know how carefully 
every clause which went into that 
constitution was weighed. I know 
how anxious those men were to 
throw safeguards around the people 
which would protect them from ex- 
cessive debt, limiting the power of 
legislative bodies to assess and col- 
lect taxes. I see a disposition grad- 
ually working to break down those 
barriers. Laws which appear to be 
very innocent and simple in them- 
selves are proposed by which the 
constitution of the State in its 
meaning may be entirely changed, 
and I have observed that these pro- 
posed changes are all in the direc- 
tion of increased taxation, the issu- 
ing of increased bonded indebted- 
ness, and it appears to me the plac- 
ing of additional burdens upon the 
people. I only want to admonish 
you that whatever you do in matters 
of this kind, you do with the utmost 
care ; that you carefully consider ; 
that you understand before you 
act; before you change the funda- 
mental laws of this State or before 
you change the fundamental laws 
of this Nation, or of the Constitu- 
tion upon which it is based, — be 
sure that step is a necessary and 
beneficial one. True, changes may 
be necessary and they will come. 
I am only advising and counseling 
the greatest caution in matters of 
this kind which may come before 
you. I refer to it because I have 
heard it discussed in my travels. 
I have heard men who advocate the 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thought that we are a progressive 
people, a progressive State, a pro- 
gressive Nation, and that is very- 
true. But we must progress along 
conservative, consistent lines, tak- 
ing care not to break away from 
those moorings which God caused 
to be fixed by wise men whom he 
chose to give us the Constitution of 
this country, and the constitution 
and laws which govern this State. 
Now, another thing that came 
under my observation in this jour- 
ney. I met men as I have traveled 
who advocate war, who tell us that 
our dignity has been injured, our 
pride has been humiliated, and that 
the only way that we may obtain 
redress is to go and humiliate the 
man or the people who have humil- 
iated us. Three days ago, a man 
who stands before the American 
people asking for the highest place 
in their gift [Hon. J. Frank 
Hanly] publicly announced, and 
it has been published in all of 
the principal papers of this Repub- 
lic, that if elected, he would imme- 
diately intervene forcibly in the 
affairs of Mexico. In other words, 
there would be an immediate declar- 
ation of war, because that is just 
what his policy would mean. Now, 
my brethren and sisters, it may 
seem a very simple thing to have a 
war with Mexico, just a handful of 
people, a few more in number than 
the inhabitants of the state of New 
York. Whenever you begin a war, 
you don't know just where it is 
going to end. It appeared to he a 
very simple thing to Austria to go 
over into Serbia, where a man and 
his wife had been killed, and to de- 
mand and enforce reparation by 
punishing the perpetrators of that 
crime, and it was a crime. The re- 
sult is the death of millions of men, 
the destruction of property of un- 



told value, a condition of degen- 
eracy and immorality established 
among the people that a generation 
never can eradicate, — all from that 
simple, little beginning. 

We might find ourselves lacking 
in judgment. Some of the lessons, 
the impressive lessons of my life, 
have been taught in very simple 
ways, and this was one of them : In 
my early life, inj a limited way I 
was a freighter. The etiquette of 
the road required that a man going 
down hill should give the road to 
the man going up hill ; or the man 
with the lighter load should give it 
to the man with the heavier load; 
but there were some men on the 
road who were possessed of the 
idea that no matter what the eti- 
quette of the road demanded, the 
other fellow should always turn out. 
I remember once a friend of mine 
driving along a freight road lead- 
ing to Pioche. He met a team with 
a -young fellow 'driving it, and they 
came up pretty close together. Hank 
stopped his horses and said, "Are 
you going to get out of the road?" 
"No," the boy replied, "I can't very 
well get out, where I am here." 
"Well, you will have to get out," 
and one word brought on another 
until Hank climbed down off of the 
high seat of his wagon and started 
over to take it out of the boy's hide. 
A little later some of us drove along 
and found him sitting there by the 
creek washing the blood off of his 
face. One of the boys said, "What 
is the matter, Hank?" "Oh," he- 
said, "nothing. I just made a mis- 
take in judgment; that is all." 

Well, sometimes nations make 
mistakes in judgment as well as 
men. Now, my brethren and sis- 
ters, shortly after that affair to 
which I have referred, I was again 
on the 1 road. There was a man 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



67 



freighting there who always car- 
ried a gun on the spring seat with 
him, not a gun around his waist, 
but a double-barrel shotgun that he 
could use very quickly. He never 
was without it, and he was a terror 
wherever he went. I suppose there 
are men in this congregation who 
have met and know him. One day, 
when I was pulling up a grade, in 
the mud, after a rain storm, I saw 
the ears of his big mules flopping 
over the top of the hill, and when 
he came in sight about the first 
thing I noticed was the shotgun, 
as he drove along down the slope. 
The etiquette of the road required 
him to turn out, and when our 
teams came close together, they 
stopped. He looked at me through 
his grizzly beard and said, "Young 
man, are you going to get out and 
give me the road ?" I said, "I can't 
very well get out." He said, "Do 
you know what I will do, if you 
don't?" "No, sir," I said, "I don't 
know." "Why," he said, "I will get 
out." "Well," I said, "if you will 
just pull your mules' heads around 
a little, I will make my horses pull 
this load out of the road if they 
can." We both turned out and 
each, giving part of the road, 
passed. Now, I have told you that 
simple story because it illustrates 
the thought that I want to leave in 
your minds. Which of the two men 
was the good neighbor? Which of 
the two men did the right thing, the 
sensible thing? — the man who was 
determined that the other fellow 
should turn out and who made a 
mistake in judgment, or the man 
who might very easily have pre- 
vailed and dominated the road, who 
was willing himself to give half of 
it and be satisfied? My brethren 
and sisters, if war comes to this 
country, let it not be of our mak- 



ing ; let us not advocate it ; let us 
not lend ourselves to it, but stand 
for the establishment of peace by 
which a great and a powerful nation 
may be an example to the world in 
patience, in long-suffering, kind- 
ness, in righteousness, which shall 
bring men to a condition when that 
great Confederacy of Nations re- 
ferred tot during this conference 
may become possible, and peace 
prevail on earth and good-will exist 
among men. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
happy irf, the truth. I bear testi- 
mony to the truth of the things that 
I have named as the result of my 
observation in the Church. I feel 
happy in the Lord, happy in the 
association of the Saints, happy in 
the character of the men who ad- 
minister its affairs ; and there is no 
fear in my heart as to the ultimate 
triumph of this work. God's king- 
dom has been established upon 
earth to endure, never to be thrown 
down, never to be given to another 
people, but to stand forever, and 
through righteousness, and not by 
the shedding of blood, to bring unto 
it all nations of the earth. 

The Lord help us to keep the 
faith, and to faithfully and humbly 
discharge the duties that devolve 
upon us from clay to day, leaving 
the past to take care of itself, ex- 
cept in so far as we are, able to 
profit by its successes or its errors, 
looking hopefully forward, believ- 
ing that each tomorrow will bring 
us greater happiness, will bring us 
greater strength, and that when this 
life is finished, we will be on the 
threshold of another tomorrow, still 
looking hopefully forward towards 
that ideal and eternal life to which 
we all aspire. I pray for these 
blessings through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

Prophets have foretold of the judg- 
ments poured out on the nations — 
Power and purity of the gospel not 
found in the churches which are not 
in fellowship with the Lord — The 
people ,of this land in danger of de- 
struction, unless they hearken to the 
God of the land who is Jesus Christ 
— The Saints under solemn cove- 
nant to keep his commandments — 
A warning against partaking of the 
sins rampant in our midst — Extrav- 
agant amusements, modern dancing, 
public dance halls, night carousing, 
boisterous street conduct, and card 
playing denounced — The Saints 
warned against Sabbath breaking — 
A call to repentance, and an admon- 
ition to be true to the teachings of 
our leaders and to the trust imposed 
in us. 

My brethren and sisters, I trust 
this morning that I may be led by 
the Spirit of the Lord in what I 
shall say unto you, that it may be in 
harmony with that which has been 
said during the sessions of this con- 
ference. I feel to endorse most 
thoroughly the remarks that have 
been made by the brethren. We 
have been instructed in the princi- 
ples of the gospel; we have been 
taught our duty as members of the 
Church ; we have been admonished 
and guided and helped, if we will 
only put into practice the things that 
we have heard. I know that this is 
the work of the Lord; that these 
people here assembled are people 
who have made covenant with him 
to keep his commandments and who 
have come out of the world from 
among the various nations and have 
partaken of the waters of life freely 
accepting the gospel of our Lord. 
With Brother Ivins, who has just 
spoken, I can testify that when the 
Lord will come he will find faith 
upon the earth. That faith, how- 
ever, which he will find, shall be 



limited to a very small portion of 
the inhabitants of the earth. He 
will not find faith in the nations 
abroad to any noticeable extent ; he 
will not find faith among the peo- 
ples of the earth who have not re- 
ceived the gospel as it has been re- 
stored, but there will be faith among 
those of the house of Israel who 
have been gathered out from the 
nations and who have repented of 
their sins and received the message 
that came through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

I am very sorry that the greater 
portion of the earth at this time 
should be in turmoil ; that the great 
nations abroad should be at war and 
in such deadly conflict. Neverthe- 
less, I realize that these are judg- 
ments that have come upon these 
nations, who have departed from 
the gospel of the Lord and have 
not repented of their sins, and will 
not hearken to the message of the 
elders of Israel. These judgments 
now being poured out on, the na- 
tions have been predicted by the 
prophets and they are coming be- 
cause of the iniquities that exist in 
the earth. If the people were of 
one mind, if they were of one heart, 
if they were living the gospel of 
our Lord, as he has instructed us 
to live it, then such conditions could 
not possibly prevail. The Lord has 
declared that unless we are one we 
are not his, and where his gospel 
has taken hold of the people there 
can not be such bitterness of feel- 
ing, contention and bloodshed, as 
we find over the greater portion of 
the earth today. The present con- 
dition of the world is an incontro- 
vertible evidence that the power 
and purity of the gospel is not to 
be found in their churches and that 
they are not in fellowship with the 
Lord. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

I desire to read to you a few 
verses from the second chapter of 
the book of Ether, and, if I may be 
so led, I desire to make some com- 
ments bearing upon these expres- 
sions. These are the words of the 
Lord to his prophet, many centuries 
before the' advent of our Savior in 
the earth, speaking of this land in 
which we dwell : 

"And the Lord would not suffer that 
they" [that is, the people of Jared] 
"should stop beyond the sea in the 
wilderness, but he would that they 
should come forth even unto the land 
of promise, which was choice above 
all other lands, which the Lord God 
had preserved for a righteous people; 

"And he had sworn in his wrath 
unto the brother of Jared, that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, 
from that time henceforth and for- 
ever, should serve him, the true and 
only God, or they should be swept off 
when the fulness of his wrath should 
come upon them 

"And now we can behold the de- 
crees of God concerning this land, 
that it is a land ,of promise, and what- 
soever nation shall possess it. shall 
serve God, or shall be swept off; for 
when the fulness of his wrath shall 
come upon them. And the fulness of 
his wrath cometh upon them when 
they are ripened in iniquity; 

"For behold, this is a land which is 
choice above all other lands; where- 
fore he that doth possess it shall 
serve God, or shall be sewpt off; for 
it is the everlasting decree of God. 
And it is not until the fulness of in- 
iquity among the children of the land, 
that they are swept off. 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye 
Gentiles, that ye may know the de- 
crees of God, that ye may repent, and 
not continue in your iniquities until 
the fulness come, that ye may not 
bring down the fulness of the wrath 
of God upon you, as the inhabitants 
of the land hath hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and 
whatsoevet nation shall possess it, 
shall be free from bondage, and from 
captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus 



Christ, who hath been manifested by 
the things which we have written." 

These words were recorded by 
the Prophet Moroni as he testified 
concerning these things which the 
Lord declared to the brother of 
Jared, and in commenting upon 
them, after the destruction of the 
Jaredites and also his own race, the 
Nephites, Moroni wrote for the 
benefit of the Gentiles, who, in the 
distant future, were to possess the 
land, that they also would be in 
danger of destruction ; that they 
would also be swept off from the 
face of the land, if they should 
practice iniquity and refuse to 
hearken to the voice of the God of 
this land, who is Jesus Christ. I 
wish to raise my voice in warning 
to the Latter-day Saints, and not 
only to them, but to all the people 
of this American continent, and to 
all the world, that these predictions 
will be fulfilled, providing the peo- 
ple in this land continue until their 
cup is full, unrepentant in their 
abominable practices and their in- 
iquity and their opposition to the 
teachings of the Son of God and his 
commandments, as that opposition 
is increasing at this time. We Lat- 
ter-dav Saints have received the re- 
stored gospel and have made cove- 
nant with the Lord that we will 
serve him and accept him as the 
God of this land. Nevertheless, I 
want to call your attention to the 
fact that the ways of the world have 
crept in among us and are becoming 
established in the midst of the peo- 
ple of Zion. Right here in this city, 
which at one time was indeed a city 
of the Saints, but is that no longer, 
can be found all manner of abomi- 
nation and iniquity. ' The ideas, 
theories, the fashions and ungodli- 
ness of the world, their sins and evil 
practices are to he found within the 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



borders of our cities. Unless we 
are on our guard we are in constant 
danger. This people who are under 
solemn covenants to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord are threat- 
ened by the sins and worldly abom- 
inations of this generation, and 
many among us are liable to be led 
astray, unless we keep a careful 
vigil and hedge them about by every 
means at our command. We have 
been called out from the world into 
the kingdom of God, and while we 
are yet in the world, we are not of 
the world in the sense that we are 
under any necessity to partake of 
their evil customs, and fashions, 
their follies, false doctrines and 
theories, which are in conflict with 
the spirit of truth. 

Today is the Sabbath day and yet 
in this city the theatres, moving 
pictures and places of amusement 
are running full blast as they are on 
every Sabbath day throughout the 
year, because of the selfishness of 
men and their disregard of the 
command of the Lord to obey his 
law and keep his day holy. We are 
inflicted not only with these tempta- 
tions, but they come to us in many 
other forms, and if we are not 
aware, there is danger of us losing 
the Spirit of the Lord and falling 
into transgression by yielding to 
temptations that may not appear to 
us as being of much consequence. 
But little things lead to greater and 
step by step we are carried away 
from that which is right and just, 
and gradually we become blind to 
the truth. The Lord has called 
upon us to be a sober-minded peo- 
ple, not given to much laughter, 
frivolity and light-mindedness, but 
to consider thoughtfully and thor- 
oughly the things of his kingdom 
that we may be prepared in all 
things to understand the glorious 



truths of the gospel, and be pre- 
pared for blessings to come. Let 
me read a verse from the Doctrine 
and Covenants. This is the com- 
mand of the Lord to the Latter-day 
Saints : 

"Remember the great and last 
promise which I have made unto 
you. Cast away your idle thoughts 
and your excess of laughter far 
from you." And then again, in the 
same section, I have read from sec- 
tion 88 :69 ; I now read from verse 
121 : "Therefore, cease from all 
your light speeches, from all laugh- 
ter, from all your lustful desires, 
from all your pride arid light- 
mindedness, and from all your 
wicked doings." This is the word 
of the Lord to the Latter-day 
Saints. I believe that it is neces- 
sary for the Saints to have amuse- 
ment, but it must be of the proper 
kind. I do not believe the Lord in- 
tends and desires that we should 
pull a long face and look sancti- 
monious and hypocritical. I think 
he expects us to be happy and of a 
cheerful countenance, but he does 
not expect of us the indulgence in 
boisterous and unseemly conduct 
and the seeking after the vain and 
foolish things which amuse and en- 
tertain the world. He has com- 
manded us to the contrary for our 
own good and eternal welfare. 

I deplore the fact that these mod- 
ern dances, some of which had their 
origin in unsavory places, have 
come among us. I regret beyond 
measure the public dance which, in 
my judgment, in its baneful results, 
the destruction of good morals and 
virtue, is second only to the saloon. 
This evil is growing and taking 
root in the stakes of Zion, in the 
communities of Latter-day Saints. 
There is today an excess in dancing. 
In some communities one or two 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



71 



each week which is not good no 
matter how innocent the dance may 
be. In these public dance halls, 
which are runi for the making- of 
money, the people, in some localities 
without regard to character or 
standing of the individual,- permit 
any one to enter without question, if 
he will pay the price of admission. 
This is an abominable custom and 
should not be tolerated by members 
of the Church in the settlements 
under their control. 

The world, is drifting. I do not 
believe, I cannot feel, as I read 
the signs of the times, ponder over 
things that come before me for con- 
sideration, that this world is grow- 
ing better ; I do not believe it for a 
minute. I believe that we are drift- 
ing. Many things are tolerated to- 
day that would not have been toler- 
ated for a moment twenty years 
ago. New problems have arisen 
with which we must now contend 
that we never dreamed of even in 
the, days of my youth. We have 
evils in the world now to combat 
that have been brought into exist- 
ence through modern invention and 
discovery, such as the moving 
picture show, joy riding in automo- 
biles and the rapid means of trans- 
portation from place to place as a 
means of seeking pleasure during 
the hours of both dav and night. 
The moving picture should be of 
the greatest value in the education 
and instruction of the people, and 
would teach us history, geography 
and science, to the very best ad- 
vantage, if properly presented, but 
to the contrary, it is largely con- 
trolled bv unscrupulous men who 
give to the public a flood of mis- 
erable stuff that excites their pas- 
sions and appeals to the baser side 
of man. 

T live on one of the main thor- 



oughfares in this city, and at all 
hours of the night I am disturbed, 
and my neighbors are disturbed, by 
hearing the boisterous laughter and 
ribald jests of carousing men and 
women as they ride through the 
street in a drunken condition — I 
judge that they are drunken because 
I do not think for a minute anybody 
in soberness could possibly carry on 
in such a disgraceful manner as 
they do. We must contend with all 
these things. I don't say that these 
are Latter-day Saints who do this ; 
of course, they are not. I don't say 
that they are members of the 
Church, but I want to say that I 
think the parents in Israel should 
protect their children, they should 
have a little more watchcare over 
them, they should pay a little more 
attention to them and train them a 
little more carefully in the princi- 
ples of the gospel, both by precept 
and by example. Children should 
not be permitted to go unprotected 
and without proper escort to places 
of amusement, no matter where or 
how harmless the amusement may 
be. A little more supervision in this 
regard would be far better in the 
homes of Latter-day Saints. I draw 
attention to these matters as a 
warning because these evils prevail 
in our midst, and we are under the 
necessity of meeting them and over- 
coming them. Our children will 
have to be taught to discern between 
good and evil, otherwise in many 
respects they will not be able to 
understand why they are not per- 
mitted to indulge in practices that 
are common with their neighbors. 
Unless they are instructed in the 
doctrines of the Church, they will 
not, perhaps, understand why there 
is any harm in the Sunday concert, 
a Sunday theatre, picture show, ball 
game, or something of that kind, 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when their playmates, without re- 
straint and with encouragement, in- 
dulge in these things forbidden of 
the Lord on his holy day. The 
parents are responsible for the 
proper teaching of their children, 
the Lord will condemn the parents 
if their children grow up outside of 
the influence of the principles of the 
gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. I 
want to see righteousness prevail 
throughout Zion. I do not believe 
that it is necessary in the least for 
us to partake of all the notions and 
customs of the world. We should 
give our attention a little more seri- 
ously to the things of the kingdom 
of God. We are living in the latter- 
days when, it has been predicted, 
perilous times would come. These 
perilous times are here, which fact 
should cause us thoughtful reflec- 
tion. 

Let me say that these passages 
of scripture that I have read from 
the Book of Mormon are true, and 
that this nation is not exempt, and 
the people, if they continue to pur- , 
sue the course of evil and ungodli- 
ness that thev are now treading, 
shall eventually be punished. If 
they continue to disregard the 
warning voice of the Lord, deny 
their Redeemer, turn from his gos- 
pel unto fables and false theories, 
and rebel against all that he has 
through his servants in this day de- 
clared for the salvation of man ; and 
if thev increase in the practice of 
iniquity, I want to say to you, that 
if they do these things, the judg- 
ments of the Lord will come upon 
this land, and this nation will not be 
saved ; we will not be spared from 
war, from famine, from pestilence 
and finallv from destruction, as a 
nation. Therefore. I call upon the 
people, not onlv Latter-dav Saints, 
but to all throughout the whole land 



to repent of their sins and to accept 
the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our 
Redeemer and the God of this land. 
Turn from your evil ways, repent 
of your sins and receive the fulness 
of the gospel through the waters of 
baptism and obedience, that the 
judgments which shall be poured 
out upon the ungodly may pass 
you by. I rejoice in the truth. I 
am very grateful for the knowledge 
I have that this is the work of the 
Lord established for the last time 
never to be destroyed or given to 
other people. I desire to prove 
faithful and to teach others to do 
the same. 

In regard to these other evils that 
I have spoken of, my attention is 
called to the fact that there is an- 
other one, the effects of which are 
very, very harmful. This is card 
playing, which is indulged in, I am 
sorry to say, by some members of 
the Church. We have been taught 
all the days of our lives, that card 
playing is not good and is contrary 
to the order and discipline of the 
Church. The authorities have called 
upon the people, and it is published 
in our magazines, to refrain from 
this evil indulgence. Notwith- 
standing all this, we find among us 
some who look upon card playing 
as a very harmless pastime. It isn't 
harmless, but very harmful. It 
shows a lack of obedience to the 
counsels of the Lord on the part of 
members who indulge in this evil, 
and if nothing more could be said 
of it, it is at least a most pernicious 
waste of time that could be em- 
ployed in some better occupation. 
I believe in physical sport, I believe 
in recreation and amusement of the 
kind that is beneficial to the body 
and the mind of man, and that play 
of the proper kind is good and 
ought to be indulged in at times, 



ELDER JOSEPH F SMITH, JR.

especially by those whose work is 
such that they do not get the neces- 
sary physical exercise required by 
their bodies. I do not believe in 
the waste of good time in practicing 
anything which is condemned by 
the authorities of the Church, as 
they give the counsel as it comes to 
them through the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord. The Latter-day 
Saints should put their trust in their 
leaders, and follow the teachings of 
the authorities of the Church, for 
they speak unto them with the voice 
of prophecy and inspiration. The 
Lord has declared in the very first 
section in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that whether he speak by his 
own voice or through the voice of 
his servants, it is the same. There- 
fore, we are under just as great re- 
sponsibility and obligation to 
hearken unto the voice of the one 
who stands at the head to teach the 
people, or to listen unto the voice of 
the elders of Israel, as they carry 
among the people the message of 
truth, as we are though the Lord 
should send from his presence an 
angel or should come himself to de- 
clare these things unto us. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us 
be humble, let us be faithful, let us 
be true to every trust, and acquit 
ourselves as faithful members of 
this Church and labor diligently in 
the kingdom of God, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

A fulfilment of prophecy — The sure 
word of revelation compared with 
the deductions of men — Let God be 
true though men be liars — The com- 
ing forth of the Lost Tribes of 
Israel. 

I know that I have been in accord 
with the feelings of the vast multi- 



tudes that have assembled at the 
several sessions of this conference, 
in appreciation of the words of in- 
struction and encouragement to 
which we have listened. The people 
have been fed upon substantial fare. 
They have heard the truths of the 
gospel declared in no uncertain 
terms. Your presiding servants 
have called your attention to mat- 
ters that require your present atten- 
tion. They have not confined them- 
selves to words of praise unmixed 
with words of warning, but havti 
adapted their testimonies, their ad- 
monitions, and their instructions to 
the needs of the hour. 

In the gatherings of the Saints at 
this time, as on other conference oc- 
casions, I find fulfilment of proph- 
ecy, and see a working out of the 
purposes and plans of the Eternal 
One, a vindication of the prophets 
ofi God who have spoken in days 
past, and of the words of the living 
prophets who minister amongst the 
people in the authority of their holy 
office. In this respect, I feel that 
the Latter-day Saints cannot be too 
careful lest they be led to doubt the 
strict and literal fulfilment of the 
Lord's word as it has been made 
known to them. There are men in 
the world who; have set themselves 
up against the God of Israel, men 
who have undertaken to measure 
arms with the Almighty, and to pit 
their wisdom against the eternal 
wisdom of God, men who have un- 
dertaken to construe, or rather to 
misconstrue the holy Scriptures, 
and to declare to' the people that 
these writings do not mean what 
they say. Beware of them, Latter- 
day Saints. Stand we firm and 
steadfast by the revealed word of 
God and on the words of instruc- 
tion that are given us from time to 
time by those whom we sustain be-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fore the Lord as his representatives 
in our midst ; and should there come 
a question of issue between the 
opinions of men and the word of 
revelation, I say, as said the apos- 
tle, Paul, of old, in his written ad- 
dress to the Saints of Rome : "Yea, 
let God be true, but every man a 
liar." Men have made themselves 
liars before God because they have 
undertaken to question and even to 
deny his word. 

Do you lack or do you want illus- 
trations? The restoration of the 
gospel furnishes one. The words 
of the Christ himself, the words of 
the apostles who followed him in 
the ministry on earth, the words of 
prophets who had preceded his com- 
ing-, were to the effect that in the 
last days the gospel should be re- 
stored, for the reason that it would 
not be found upon the earth; and 
yet there were those who said that 
it had always been upon the earth. 
But the angel whom the apostle- 
prophet saw coming in the midst of 
heaven in the last days, has come, 
bringing the everlasting gospel to 
the inhabitants of earth ; and God is 
true though men be made out liars 
by the fulfilment of that sure word. 
Again, after the restoration, when 
the words of the prophet declared 
that the people who had embraced 
the restored gospel, a mere handful 
in comparison with those who be- 
longed to each of many so-called 
churches in the world, would come 
to the West and would establish 
themselves in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains where they would 
become a great and a powerful peo- 
ple, the possibility of such was de- 
nied by the nation's wise and great 
ones, by specialists and leaders. 
Surely, no people could prosper and 
become a great and mighty com- 
monwealth without ample means of 



subsistence. It was declared by 
statesmen that this vast domain in 
the West was a worthless area, in- 
capable of supporting human life 
on a great scale. One of the great- 
est explorers and pioneers in that 
period of American history declared 
that not a bushel of grain could be 
raised in this valley. Yet the people 
came, and the prophet-leader point- 
ed to the valley from the Wasatch 
barrier and declared it to he the ap- 
pointed place of gathering. Again 
God had spoken and again men 
were proved to be liars. If the word 
be a harsh one, remember I speak it 
within quotation marks; I take it 
from the scriptural record. 

Would you have other instances ? 
Scientists, psychologists, students 
of the human mind, have under- 
taken to analyze and dissect this 
strange organism "Mormonism," 
and they have said it arose from 
delusion ; that it has sprung from 
the seed of deception ; that it is the 
offspring of bigotry and fanaticism ; 
and the man whom we call a proph- 
et of the last days, through whom 
we say the gospel has been restored 
and the Church re-established, was 
an epileptic ; and consequently, ac- 
cording to the laws of heredity, 
which they have diagrammed and 
set forth in orderly array, the de- 
lusion could not persist beyond the 
third generation, for such would be 
contrary to formulated law. The 
world took comfort in that assur- 
ance, for it was given by those in 
whom the people had confidence; 
but what see we? Under this vast 
dome here today, are hundreds of 
the fourth and many of the fifth 
generation. Yea, let God he true, 
though every man be a liar. 

Only a few months before the 
outbreak of the terrible world con- 
flict, to which frequent reference 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



75 



has been made in this session and 
in earlier sessions of this confer- 
ence, there stood here in this pulpit, 
where I now stand, one of the na- 
tion's great men, who set forth the 
results of his study and his investi- 
gations regarding certain problems ; 
and who declared, as a result, that 
the conditions of the nations were 
today such as to make a great in- 
ternational war impossible. There 
would possibly be, said he, little up- 
risings, such as then had already 
begun in Mexico, but a war between 
the great powers could not take 
place. He emphasized by reitera- 
tion. The financial affairs of the 
world, he averred, were such as to 
link and weld the nations together; 
and should emperors, czars, or kings 
declare war, the bankers would veto 
their decision. I spoke with the 
gentleman here in this stand, at the 
conclusion of his address, in sub- 
stance to this effect: "I wish I 
could believe you, Doctor." "You 
don't?" "I do not." "What is 
wrong with my deductions ?" "They 
may be logically drawn, but your 
premises are wrong. You have 
failed to take into account certain 
essential factors ; you have discard- 
ed and ignored the predictions 'of 
the prophets ; and on such a ques- 
tion as this I shall accept the word 
of the prophet rather than 'the con- 
clusion of the academician, even 
though he be as distinguished as 
yourself, sir." I could not discuss 
the matter at length, but such I said. 
Within a short span of months after 
that time, several of the most pow- 
erful nations of the world were 
locked in the death-grapple, which 
has been tightening with the pass- 
age of the years. So, as I read the 
words of the prophet that war 
should he poured out upon all na- 
tions, and that in this day and dis- 



pensation, in which we live, this the 
land of Zion should be the only land 
wherein safety might be found, I 
said to myself again : Yea, let God 
be true, though all the world's wise 
ones be liars. 

With such examples before us, 
can we doubt as to the future ? How 
think you the Lord looks upon these 
"plans of mice and men" that "gang 
aft agley"? I take it that the con- 
templation of such developments is 
his humor ; for, mark you, the God 
of heaven is a great humorist. I 
read that "He that sitteth in the 
heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall 
have them in derision." I read in 
the further word of the psalmist 
that as the Lord looketh upon the 
wicked and seeth him in his tem- 
porary, seeming prosperity, spread- 
ing himself like a green bay tree, 
"The Lord shall laugh at him, for 
he seeth that his day is coming." 
When I see how often the theories 
and conceptions of men have gone 
astray, have fallen short of the 
truth, yea, have even contradicted 
the truth directly, I am thankful in 
my heart that we have an iron rod 
to which we can cling — the rod of 
certainty, the rod of revealed truth. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints welcomes all truth, 
but it distinguishes most carefully 
between fact and fancy, between 
truth ;.and theory, between premises 
and deductions ; and it is willing to 
leave some questions in abeyance 
until the Lord in his wisdom shall 
see fit to speak more plainly. 

As; the result of the combined 
labors of wise men I learn that man 
is but the developed offspring of 
the beast ; and yet I read that God 
created man in his own image, after 
his likeness ; and again, I stand on 
the word of God, though it be in 
contradiction to the theories of men.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



This spirit of misconstruction, this 
attempt to explain away the sure 
word of prophecy, the indisputable 
word of revelation, is manifest even 
amongst our own people. There are 
those who would juggle with the 
predictions of the Lord's prophets. 
I read that in the last days one of 
the conditions preceding the return 
of the Christ to earth shall be the 
gathering of the Jews at their an- 
cient capital, and in the land round 
about ; and that another sign shall 
be the gathering of the people who 
have been scattered among the na- 
tions; and yet another shall be the 
bringing forth of the Lost Tribes 
from their hiding place, which is 
known to God, but unknown to 
man. Nevertheless, I have found 
elders in Israel who would tell me 
that the predictions relating to the 
Lost Tribes are to be explained in 
this figurative manner — that the 
gathering of those tribes is already 
well advanced and that there is no 
hiding place whereto God has led 
them, from which they shall come 
forth, led by their prophets to re- 
ceive their blessings here at the 
hands of gathered Ephraim, the 
gathered portions that have been 
scattered among the nations. Yea, 
let God be true, and doubt we not 
his word, though it makes the opin- 
ions of men appear to be lies. The 
tribes shall come ; they are not lost 
unto the Lord ; they shall be 
brought forth as hath been predict- 
ed ; and I say unto you there are 
those now living — aye, some here 
present — who shall live to read the 
records of the Lost Tribes of Israel, 
which shall be made one with the 
record of the Jews, or the Holy 
Bible, and the record of the Ne- 
phrites, or the iBook of Mormon, 
even as the Lord hath predicted; 
and those records, which the tribes 



lost to man but yet to be found 
again shall bring, shall tell of the 
visit of the resurrected Christ to 
them, after He had manifested 
Himself to the Nephites upon this 
continent. For, as not one jot or 
tittle of the Law has been permitted 
to fail, so surely no jot or tittle of 
the Gospel shall go unfulfilled. 

I have heard it said that the pre- 
dictions relative to the coming of 
the Christ are to be explained in a 
figurative way, that he is to dwell 
in the hearts of men and that is the 
second advent. Verily, the Christ 
shall come in person and shall be 
seen of the righteous and shall stand 
upon the earth and reign as rightful 
King and Lord, and shall send 
forth the law for the government 
of the world. 

May we be kept in tune with the 
word of the Lord, as it hath been 
declared, is being declared, and yet 
shall he declared by his servants, 
the prophets, I ask in the Master's 
name. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn com- 
posed by John Lyon, "Hail, bright 
millennial day of rest." 

Benediction by Elder S. O. Ben- 
nion, President of the Central 
States Mission. 

The conference adjourned until 
2 p. m. 

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting of the con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., presided over by Elder 
Hyrum M. Smith. The singing was 
by the Pioneer stake United Choir, 
under direction of Tracy Y. Can- 
non, chorister, Edward P. Kimball, 
accompanist. 

The choir sang: "Come let us

hymn book. 

The prayer was offered by Elder 
Richard Lambert. 

The hymn, "Come, dearest Lord" 
was sung by the choir. 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I desire to be guided and directed 
by the spirit which has character- 
ized this splendid conference thus 
far. When occasion requires me to 
stand before a congregation to in- 
struct them in the gospel of our 
Redeemer, I feel very keenly the 
prayer that was offered by Jere- 
miah : "O Lord, I know that the 
way of man is not in himself. It is 
not in man that wajketh to guide 
his steps." Not only do we need 
the spirit of this great work, when 
we are called upon to address a con^ 
gregation, in order that the words 
we say may be the word of the Lord 
unto those who hear, but also that 
that spirit may grace our every-day 
'abors. 

President Smith, in his opening 
address, said that this religion is not 
for Sunday operation only, but it 
should be carried into the lives of 
the Latter-day Saints, in their daily 
labors, that thereby they might be 
guarded and protected from the 
evils and the temptations that beset 
them in their daily lives. There 
comes to my mind a passage of 
scripture, wherein instruction was 
given to a man of ancient Israel, 
which, had it characterized the peo- 
ple of the world today, would have 
made it less necessary for the prin- 
ciples of eternal truth to be carried 
into their lives. 

"And the Lord spake unto Moses, 
saying, See, I have called by name 



Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of 
Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I have 
filled him with the Spirit of God, in 
wisdom, and in understanding, and in 
knowledge, and in all manner of work- 
manship, to devise cunning works, to 
work in gold, and in silver, and in 
brass, and in cutting stones, to set 
them, and in carving of timber, to 
work in all manner of workmanship." 

Such was the qualification of this 
man Bezaleel, upon whom rested 
the responsibility of building the 
ark of the covenant and the taber- 
nacle of our Lord. I wonder if, in 
our everyday labors, we think of 
this great manifestation of God's 
goodness and kindness to this man, 
and if we, as members of modern 
Israel, when we are employed in 
cutting or setting of stones, or 
working in brass or in iron or in 
gold or silver, whether at the jew- 
eler's table or the blacksmith's 
forge, or at the lumber camp, if we 
feel the necessity of the Spirit of 
God to guide us. 

The gospel to me means service. 
"M-ormonism" spells service. I can- 
not think of a good, consistent Lat- 
ter-day Saint who is lazy. The very 
spirit of this work is that of activ- 
ity. It is said that idleness is the 
devil's workshop. When the curse 
or punishment was pronounced 
upon our father Adam, by the Lord, 
that he should eat his bread by the 
sweat of his brow all the days of 
his life, it was given to him for his 
development rather than for his 
detriment. Every individual who 
has found the love of Christ, who 
has a desire to develop according 
to the pattern that was laid down 
by our dear Savior, understood and 
annunciated before the foundations 
of the world were laid, will never 
consider work a curse. One of the 
greatest blessings that God has 
given to his children is work. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There is nothing that the Lord has 
done without a purpose. He has a 
purpose in the organization of this 
splendid Church, which is com- 
manding the admiration of thinking 
men throughout the world. Some 
of the most intellectual men that I 
have met in my life have paid very 
high tribute to the splendid, effec- 
tive organization of which we are 
a part. It is designed on the part of 
our heavenly Father that in the 
work of saving souls each one shall 
have his portion of the ministry to 
perform. It is not for an aristo- 
cratic, self-appointed priesthood to 
perform the work for the living and 
for the dead, and I might add 
further that this Church knows no 
aristocracy outside of the aristocra- 
cy of righteousness, but he who is 
righteous will have conferred upon 
him the priesthood of the. Lord to 
effectively work in his name, not 
for his own aggrandizement, but 
for the blessing of those unto whom 
he is appointed to labor. I cannot 
think that the Latter-day Saints 
hold the priesthood in order to exalt 
themselves above their fellow men, 
though the calling is an exalted one. 
There is no position in all the world 
that I would prefer to the calling in 
the priesthood which has come to 
me, and I would rather be a faithful 
deacon in this Church than] to be 
the pope of Rome, or the king of 
any nation, or the president of this 
great republic, for I feel that the 
power that is delegated to God's 
children upon the earth, when oper- 
ated according to the spirit of that 
calling, may result in far greater 
good, more eternal and lasting ben- 
efit, than that which can be per- 
formed bv the application of the old 
law of Moses, which is spread 
upon the statute books of every civ- 
ilized nation of the world, or by all 



the laws and institutions of man in 
the civilized world. 

It is not within the province of 
one holding the priesthood to exer- 
cise the authority thereof in one's 
own behalf. It is true w.e pray to 
our heavenly Father to bless us. 
But if one is sick, howsoever high 
the authority he may hold, he is 
under the same rule that was left 
on record by James, that he should 
call in the elders, who should anoint 
him with oil, and the prayer of faith 
shall heal the sick. It does not 
follow, either, that a person can 
ordain himself to the calling in the 
priesthood or baptize himself. And 
so thoroughly was this shown at the 
time when John the Baptist came 
and restored the keys of the Aaron- 
ic priesthood to Joseph and Oliver, 
in Harmony, Susquehannah Co., 
Pennsylvania, at which time he con- 
ferred upon them the priestly au- 
thority of Aaron, which holds the 
keys of the preparatory gospel and 
the ministry of angels, that the in- 
structions were given for Joseph to 
baptize Oliver and Oliver to baptize 
Joseph. Had Joseph announced to 
the world, that the priesthood had 
been conferred upon him by John 
the Baptist, and that he went into 
the Susquehannah river and there 
baptized himself, it would have ex- 
posed the cloven hoof, so to speak, 
of his claim. It was shown in the 
earliest organizing of this work, 
even in the method in which the 
Church was organized and estab- 
lished, that the priesthood was only 
operative in blessing our fellow 
men. That a man could confer 
upon himself the priesthood was the 
error into which the world had pre- 
viously fallen. They have arrogated 
or appropriated unto themselves 
vestments of authority and assumed 
to labor in the name of the Lord 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 



79 



without having that right and au- 
thority conferred upon them in the 
regular order of the Lord. Let me 
call your attention to an incident 
in the life of the Master which illus- 
trates very beautifully this principle 
of the priesthood being a calling to 
service and not one for glory in 
one's self, though it is through the 
priesthood that we shall obtain our 
glory as we magnify the calling 
therein. After the baptism of the 
Master, we are told that he was led 
into a high mountain to be tempted 
of the devil. When the adversary 
appeared to him in his emaciated 
condition, for we are told that he 
was an hungered, he tempted Christ 
to "turn these stones into bread. ' 
Why? He realized that our Savior 
v/as hungry, and he invited the Son 
of God to exercise the priesthood 
in his own behalf. Jesus answered, 
"Man shall not live by bread alone 
but by every word that proceedeth 
from the mouth of God." "Why," 
the adversary is assumed to have 
said, "if thou art the son of God, do 
these things." Think you not the 
devil stood on the bank of Jordan 
when Jesus was immersed by John, 
and on his coming out of the water, 
saw the heavens open, and the Spirit 
of God descend upon him in the 
form of a dove, and a voice from 
heaven say, "This is my beloved Son 
in whom I am well pleased"? Forty 
days after, the adversary of men's 
souls said, "// thou art the Son of 
God, cause that these stones shall 
be- turned into bread." I would 
have you remember that Christ en- 
tered upon his ministry with the 
temptation to exercise his priest- 
hood in his own behalf, which he 
refused to do. Also at the last 
agonizing moment upon the cross 
the same temptation was tauntingly 
hurled in his face. "He saved 



others, let him come down • from 
the cross and save himself." He 
would riot exercise his authority 
even to save his own life, though 
he exercised that authority that we 
might live. Note the difference 
between these instances and that of 
the hungry crowd of 4,000 who 
met on the shore of the Sea of Gali- 
lee, where with seven loaves and a 
few small fishes he fed the multi- 
tude who, after three days' fasting 
were going to send to the city to 
buy food ; but the Savior exercised 
his authority that others might be 
fed, but he exercised not the au- 
thority for himself, and the mirac- 
ulous feeding of the multitude fol- 
lowed. Thus was seen the example 
of the Master. Then it is our duty 
as Latter-day Saints upon whom 
has been placed the garments of the 
holy priesthood, to warn our neigh- 
bors, to labor for the salvation of 
others, and not settle upon our 
farms and sit in our work shops and 
say, "the Lord has required no spe- 
cial calling of me." Every son of 
Adam who bears the priesthood has 
accepted it with a promise and a 
pledge before Almighty God that 
he will magnify his calling in the 
service of others. The efforts and 
effects are so beautiful, considering 
that we have no standing ministry 
after the pattern of the world, but 
that each individual member who is 
blessed with a testimony has a right 
to arise and instruct his fellow men 
and commit into their hearing his 
testimony and his instruction, lest 
he he found with the stain of his 
brother's blood upon his garments. 
I trust the time will never come 
when a Latter-day Saint will even 
entertain the thought, much less let 
the word pass his lips, that was ut- 
tered by Cain when the Lord asked 
him, "Where is thy brother Abel," 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who said, "Am I my brother's keep- 
er?" Such persons, I tell you, are 
descendants of Cain, if not literally 
they are in spirit, and we as Latter- 
day Saints, we who have been 
warned have been taught to warn 
our neighbors thus hecoming our 
brother's keeper. 

When we are called from the 
congregation of the people, we 
should always be ready and willing 
to give a reason for the hope that 
is within us. "The Lord," it is said, 
"cannot play a good tune on a poor 
fiddle." It is our duty to be well in- 
formed, to be always ready and 
willing to give a reason for the hope 
that is within us, and instruct our 
fellowmen. 

We are told by the Apostle Paul 
in the 12th chapter of Corinthians: 
"Wherefore I give you to under- 
stand that no man, speaking by the 
Spirit of God,calleth Jesus accursed, 
and no man can say that Jesus is the 
Lord but by the Holy Ghost." Then 
if we are to know that Jesus is the 
Christ by the operation of the Holy 
Ghost, what manner of men and 
women ought we to be, that that 
Spirit might dwell in our hearts, on 
Sunday, and on every day of the 
week ? It matters not what our em- 
ployment may be. 

We are told in the 121st section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants that 
when the Spirit of the Lord is with- 
drawn, it is amen to the priesthood 
and the authority of that man, and 
if we do not exercise the authority 
that is given unto us according to 
the spirit thereof, we will come far 
short of the glory that we anticipate 
receiving, and which the gospel so 
beautifully depicts before our men- 
tal vision. 

The Latter-day Saints, upon 
whom the priesthood is conferred, 
have opportunities that are not en- 



joyed by the people of the world. 
It is always a source of strength to 
me, and I am sure it is to every one 
who is called to occupy a position of 
this kind, to express his desires in 
the hearing of his brethren and sis- 
ters, committing himself to his pub- 
lic utterance. When a Latter-day 
Saint has the privilege, seldom en- 
joyed by the people of the world, to 
stand up and instruct this people, it 
will have a tendency — it does have 
a tendency — to guide his feet in the 
paths of virtue and peace, and he 
will live circumspectly before all 
men. Also before one is called to 
speak, and a Latter-day Saint never 
knows when he will be called upon, 
if he has not the Spirit of the Lord 
to direct him, he is afraid that he 
will expose his own nakedness of 
spirit, and therefore it has a ten- 
dency to enforce him to be a more 
righteous and virtuous man. 

I believe that the meetings thus 
far in this conference have been 
conducted according to the word of 
the Lord. I think the testimonies 
that have been borne have been 
borne by the power and influence 
and dictation of the Spirit of the 
Lord, as was intended, as shown in 
one of the revelations contained in 
the Doctrine & Covenants: 

"Revelation given through Joseph, 
the Seer, at Hiram, Portage Co., Ohio, 
November, 1831, to Orson Hyde, Luke 
Johnson, Lyman Johnson and William 
E. M'Lellin. The mind and will of 
the Lord as made known by the voice 
of the Spirit, to a conference con- 
cerning certain elders, and also cer- 
tain items as made known in addition 
to the Covenants and Commandments. 

"My servant Orson Hyde was called 
by his ordinance to proclaim the ever- 
lasting gospel, by the Spirit of the 
living God, from people to people, 
and from land to land, in the congre- 
gations of the wicked, in their syna- 
gogues, reasoning with and expound-

ing all scriptures unto them. And, be- 
hold, and to, this is an ensample unto 
all those who were ordained unto this 
priesthood, whose misssion is appoint- 
ed unto them to go forth. And this is 
the ensample unto them, that they 
shall speak as they are moved upon 
by the Holy Ghost. And whatsoever 
they shall speak when moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost, shall be scripture, 
shall be the will of the Lord, shall be 
the mind of the Lord, shall be the 
word of the Lord, shall be the voice 
of the Lord, and the power of God 
unto salvation." 

Can you afford, my brethren and 
sisters, to part with his company, 
with that holy influence and Spirit 
that is given for the enjoyment of 
this people? 

"Behold this is the promise of the 
Lord unto you, O ye my servants: 
wherefore be of good cheer, and do 
not fear, for I the Lord am with you, 
and will stand by you; and ye shall 
bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, 
that I am the son of the living God, 
that I was, that I am, and that I am to 
come. 

"This is the word of the Lord unto 
you, my servant, Orson Hyde, and also 
unto my servant Luke Johnson, and 
unto my servant, Lyman Johnson, and 
unto my servant, William E. M'Lellin, 
and unto all the faithful elders of my 
Church." 

There are no elders, there are 
none holding the priesthood of the 
Lord, who should not be guided and 
directed, upheld and sustained in all 
their ministrations by this great gift 
and power which is enjoyed so 
abundantly by those Latter-day 
Saints who are living clean lives, 
who are upholding the truth and 
magnifying their calling. 

Now I pray that the blessings of 
the Lord might rest down upon 
Israel, that the spirit of this con- 
ference might be carried unto every 
home, every hamlet, and every vil- 
lage and! city of all the stakes of 
Zion, that those who are not for^ 



tunate enough to have the privilege 
of attending this conference might 
partake with us of these inspira- 
tional blessings. I see no reason 
why they should not enjoy the same 
spirit through your ministrations at 
home as we have enjoyed it here 
through the ministration and in- 
struction of the leaders of the 
Church, that they, too, might be 
benefitted by this plendid confer- 
ence. 

I always enjoy coming to- con- 
ference, where I can compare the 
teachings of the prophets and apos- 
tles of the Lord with what I have 
been led to teach to the world, lest 
the labors of those called to the 
Eastern States mission should ap- 
pear as a patch upon this great 
work, rather than an interweaving 
into the very fabric thereof. 

May God bless us, enable us to 
realize our true positions upon the 
earth, and help us to magnify our 
callings, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY. 

(Of the Presidency of the Liberty 
Stake, and Secretary of the Deseret 
Gymnasium.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am ad- 
monished that no poor word of mine 
will encourage you in the work of 
the Lord, but I am sustained with 
the thought that no word, be it ever 
so humble, spoken under the im- 
press and power of the Spirit of 
God. is forgotten or falls fruitless 
to the earth. In the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
there is no place for pride or vanity. 

As Elder Monson has well said, 
"Mormonism" spells service, and 
service in the Church cannot be ef- 
fective save it be attended by the 
Spirit of the Master.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I was very much impressed with 
the utterances in the prayer, which 
was offered here this morning. 
Brother Lambert prayed that the 
hearts of men might be turned to 
the Master, that peace might obtain 
in the earth. We live in a very 
great and important hour. The 
world has never been visited with 
such a devastating and cruel war 
as that which we live to witness, 
and on the other hand, there has 
never been a period in the history 
of this Church when peace and 
plenty have been more manifest 
than at this time. It seems to me 
that this should lead Latter-day 
Saints to reflect and rejoice in the 
fact that our Father has established 
us in these mighty hills, and has 
given us a proud place in the best 
nation of the world ; has established 
us upon the hilltops that the world 
might see us, and has made us the 
depositary of faith, faith in Jesus 
Christ, the one element the Lord 
has said through his prophets in the 
Book of Mormon that would save 
this land from desolation and de- 
struction. 

The great question of prepared- 
ness deeply concerns at this hour 
the people of the United States. 
When large and troubled questions 
confront me, I find solace in refer- 
ence to the Book of Mormon, a book 
which is written in the third reader 
stvle, but a book which is saturated 
with the spirit and essence of faith 
in God. The Lord said repeatedly, 
in the Book of Mormon, referring 
to this land, that it was a land 
choice above all other lands, and 
that the people who should inhabit 
this land should be a free people, 
free from bondage unto all other 
people so long as they would serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, and that word has been 



most completely vindicated in the 
past. He has said repeatedly that 
whenever the people inhabiting this 
land become sufficiently ripe in in- 
iquity,, they should be swept from 
the face of the earth. And the Lord 
said, through this book, that when 
signs and miracles cease among the 
people it is evidence that they have 
forgotten the God of the land and 
have forsaken him. 

The Lord has not said what agen- 
cies he would employ to consum- 
mate his purposes, but he has said 
that if the people would serve him, 
they would be prospered in the land, 
but if they should not they should 
be swept from the land. I thought 
while Brother Lambert was pray- 
ing, if one could visit the homes of 
the people of the Church, he would 
find them to be sanctuaries of 
prayer, and if he were to listen to 
the instructions there given, he 
would find them filled with faith in 
God and his redeeming and exalting 
power. I am not a prophet, but I 
am not afraid to say that if the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have faith enough, 
simple faith enough, to live the re- 
ligion which God in his mercy has 
given to them, they will become the 
pride of the world; they shall be- 
come the tribunes of justice and 
righteousness among men. 

We are engaged in the great 
problem of race building. We be- 
lieve that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints has in 
it the elements of the best civiliza- 
tion the world has ever seen. I 
wonder if we will forget in the days 
of our opulence and plenty the sim- 
ple principles that have distinguish- 
ed us in the past? I wonder if we 
will run after the vain and foolish 
things of the world, forgetting the 
great and weighty things of eter- 
nity? The Lord expects us to be, 



ELDER BRYANTS. HINCKLEY.

an extraordinary people, because he 
has called us to an extraordinary 
work. We belong naturally to the 
plainj people whom Abraham Lin- 
coln said the Lord loved, else he 
would not have made so many of 
them, but there is a something at- 
tached to this Church and this peo- 
ple that cannot be found among any 
other people or in any other organi- 
zation. I think that it centers 
around the plain principle ,of faith 
in God. No man, he he ever so 
great intellectually, be he ever so 
profoundly learned, has power of 
himself in the exercise of his finite 
powers to comprehend the scope 
and power and capacity of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. But still there is some- 
thins; about it so simple that the 
humblest can comprehend and ac- 
cept it, and their acceptance works 
their salvation as completely as 
would its acceptance on the part of 
anybody else. 

I am proud of my people. I am 
proud of the heroic history that 
stands behind them. I look with 
confidence into a future, full of 
hope, for the Lord has said that he 
has set his hand for the last time 
to establish his work among the 
peoples of the earth, and he has 
called us to become the exponents 
of that great work among his chil- 
dren here upon the earth. 

May the Lord help us to live 
worthy of this high calling. I hope 
that the second, the third, and all 
coming- generations may rise full 
up to the stature of their fathers in 
their service to this great cause. I 
would like to have my own home a 
center of faith. I should like to 
engender in the hearts of my own 
children a love and reverence, not 
only for the principles of the gospel, 
but for the men who have been 



instrumental in their establishment 
in this great day. The Lord has 
called us to a high place, and given 
us a great work, and may he enable 
us to perform this work after the 
grave and royal fashion which it 
demands. May he in his mercy 
overlook our weaknesses and sus- 
tain us in our honest efforts to 
glorify his name in the earth, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder William Cook sang a solo : 
"How long wilt thou forget me?" 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission. 

Lest we forget the mission and 
the message which the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
has to bear to the world, it seems 
eminently fitting and proper that 
the membership of this Church, at 
least a very large number of the 
brethren and sisters, should come 
to these semi-annual conferences of 
the Church, to have that message 
re-stated, to be impressed with the 
mission which the Church has to 
perform to the world. From the 
beginning, I think it has been very 
clear to the mind of every indi- 
vidual in the Church, that there 
was no other organization in all 
the earth that was capable of do- 
ing the work which has been de- 
manded of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. No- 
body else was nor is equipped to do 
the work which the Lord in his ten- 
der mercy has assigned to this 
Church. While many organizations 
are equipped to do good, and do 
much good, yet there is a distinc- 
tive, peculiar work that can be 
done only by this people. It is not 
because there is better blood in our 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



veins. Nor is it because the Lord 
favors us more than anybody else; 
but he has at least permitted us to 
engage in this work, and it is the 
knowledge and acceptance of the 
truth that qualifies us. I think that 
the truthfulness of the statement 
which the Lord made to the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith, when, in the very 
inception, it was announced that 
there was no organization in all the 
world acceptable to the Lord, norie 
qualified to do his work, and that 
it was the good pleasure ot the 
Lord that, he would reveal and re- 
store the lost truth, the things' nec- 
essary to be known, the authority 
necessary to carry these instructions 
and that organization in its effectual 
use in the world, is more and more 
apparent. We do not stand to con- 
demn our brethren and sisters be- 
cause they have not done better 
than they have. Perhaps we, with 
the same amount of knowledge, 
could succeed no better than they 
have. It is not their fault that 
there has been an apostasy. The 
fault was with those generations 
that have gone before, who depart- 
ed from the truth and left but a 
fragment of it, and that altered and 
changed and corrupted. When we 
think of the mission of the Master, 
how that it was necessary for him 
to devote three years of his life, 
extended purposely that length of 
time, in order to deliver that mes- 
sage which seemed to be important 
for the salvation of that generation, 
and when we think how little of 
that message has really reached us 
to this day, the wonder is that men 
have done as well as they have. 

I was reading recently an article 
written by an eminent divine, who 
was suggesting a revision of the 
scriptures and the elimination of 
those obsolete passages that have 
come down to us, and he concluded 



that we would have a book of about 
ninety pages left, and about seven- 
teen pages of the very words of 
the Christ. That is all that comes 
to us, as he concludes, from the 
many sermons that He preached. I 
have often been impressed with the 
fragmentary character of our New 
Testament scriptures, and that the 
part that comes to us does not fully 
explain all points of doctrine re- 
lating to the gospel of the Son of 
God, and many things are left in 
such uncertainty, that it is a won- 
der that men have done as well as 
they have. I believe that every 
word that Christ uttered was essen- 
tial to the salvation of men in that 
day, and I equally believe that every 
word he gave then is essential for 
the salvation of men today; and I 
believe that if we had all the words 
of Christ, in all the sermons deal- 
ing, evidently, with every act and 
thing that was necessary to be treat- 
ed upon, that we would have com- 
plete instructions and knowledge 
as to that plan. I think that the 
Master must have told the people, 
for example, on what day they 
should worship. I do not believe 
there is any doubt that he gave in- 
structions as to the manner of the 
administration of the sacrament, or 
as to the administration of the sav- 
ing ordinances of the gospel. It 
was necessary to the people in that 
day. Hence the apostles, in numer- 
ous sermons and discourses and 
epistles, could freely say that 
"though an angel from heaven 
should teach any other doctrine 
than that which we have preached, 
let him be accursed." There was 
no division among the apostles of 
Christ as to principles and doc- 
trine. Not until these inspired 
men were put to death, and not 
until the word of God was cor- 
rupted and part of it was lost, did

men come to this state of ignorance 
and lack of knowledge concerning 
the things of God. And that we 
have a perfect knowledge of the 
gospel of Christ with its perfect 
organization, is not because we 
have learned it from the scriptures, 
or that we are wiser than anybody 
else, and have devised that system. 
You may, so far as the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
concerned, destroy every Bible in 
the world, and that might apply to 
the time when the Lord conde- 
scended to speak to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and the Church 
would still stand forth if it were 
favored with the revelations that 
did come, just as strong, as clear, as 
definite upon every proposition as 
it stands today, for this Church was 
not built or its foundations laid be- 
cause of any information that we 
have obtained from the scripture, 
and while we regard the scripture 
with all sacredness and take second 
place to no one in that regard, yet 
we say that the Church can pro- 
duce a Bible at any time when that 
Church is actuated and inspired by 
the gifts and power of the Holy 
Ghost. The men who speak unto 
us the things of the Lord in our 
own day, I believe, give unto us 
that which is just as true as that 
scripture which has come to us 
from ancient times. I think that 
the evidences are appearing, and 
are multiplying very rapidly, to 
prove that the world itself is be- 
ing forced to accept the" decision 
which the Master made, that the 
world could not be saved with the 
fragments of knowledge it then 
had. These decisions are being 
reached by learned men. 

You have all been impressed by 
the terrible war which is now being 
waged in Europe. We have heard 



of it in this conference. Is it not 
one of the greatest evidences of 
the statement of Jesus Christ to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that 
the world had but a form of godli- 
ness and not the power thereof? 
Is that power of godliness in the 
Roman Catholic church? Look at 
it today, with its hundreds of thou- 
sands of adherents in the war, rep- 
resented in the soldiers of Italy, 
who are receiving the sacraments 
of that church and the benedictions 
and blessings of the priests of that 
church in opposing and slaying their 
Catholic brethren of Austria — no 
power within that church to make 
its adherents brothers, much less 
is there power in Protestantism to 
save those great nations from fly- 
ing at each other's throats. But 
don't blame the poor soldiers, three- 
fifths of whom are supposed to be 
Christian men. What is the exam- 
ple of their leaders? 

You will remember that an effort 
was made by one of our American 
philanthropists, who was actuated 
by high motives, to bring about an 
end to this terrible struggle, and 
so, in order to accomplish this he 
selected a lot of very fine Christian 
men and women who were also ac- 
tuated by the best Christian mo- 
tives, to go from court to court, 
and by their high standard and in- 
fluence to impress the neutral na- 
tions with a desire to join them in 
a movement for the cessation of 
hostilities and a settlement upon a 
Christian basis of their existing 
troubles. We all know the result. 

One of the eminent divines of 
this country who was a member of 
the company, said recently of that 
movement, "We went to end the 
war in Europe, but we started more 
than one war of our own. We 
breathed the air of suspicion and 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



jealousy, and we carried that feel- 
ing with us right to the court at 
Stockholm. The awful influence 
that had been at work was still with 
us. The strife in the trenches 
could not be more bitter, and its 
hatred more deadly than the strife 
and the hatred of our conference." 
And yet these were picked men 
who have had all the benefits Chris- 
tianity has to offer, and yet this 
was the spirit that they mani- 
fested ; and "as with the priest 
so with the people." So don't 
blame the people. I say were it not 
for "Mormonism," I would feel 
that the world had little hope to 
save itself and preserve faith in 
God and in Christ. There is a 
growing lack of faith on the part 
of the ministers and of members of 
the various churches in the world, 
a desertion from the old creeds. 
Now I do not say this to rejoice in 
their failures. God knows that I 
sorrow because the truth has been 
lost to the world, and I do not re- 
joice because my brethren and sis- 
ters of other denominations have 
failed, but thank God that inas- 
much as they lack something they 
are coming to acknowledge it and 
they must go to God for it, even 
as Joseph did. And unless men will 
turn to him, all their speculations 
are in vain. One word from him 
is more precious than all the phil- 
osophies and theories of all the 
men in the world. Men, I say, are 
acknowledging that they are in need 
of something more than they have. 
I have here a statement made by 
one of the leading ministers in the 
city of Portland, and indeed one of 
the most eminent men of his day, a 
broad-minded and liberal man. I 
have listened to him on a number 
of occasions. He is a man of great 
experience and stands, I think, far 
in advance of the membership of 



his denomination. At a meeting 
which was attended by a number of 
the most prominent divines, held 
July 23, 1916, at the University of 
Oregon, the Rev. Dr. J. H. Boyd 
in the opening address at an inter- 
national conference, said : "I can- 
not see a ray of hope for the pres- 
ent organizations that are attempt- 
ing religion, though there is a big 
hope for true religion." 

That is true, for we have wit- 
nessed the hundreds and thousands 
of men who are turning to Chris- 
tian science and other things, seek- 
ing for the truth if haply they may 
find it. "Having eyes they see not, 
and having ears they hear not, and 
hearts they cannot understand." 
And yet I believe down in their 
hearts there is a great hungering 
and thirsting after truth, and men 
are running up and down the earth 
seeking truth. They will find it 
some day, in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. This 
minister also said : 

"Already there are signs point- 
ing to a broader movement, but 
they are not within the denomina- 
tional lines. The old-time Presby- 
terians would rather see Christian- 
ity go down than give up a bit of 
their creed. There is no cohesive 
church of Jesus Christ in this state. 
There is no leadership to bring the 
denominations together. Little 
communities have been crowded 
with churches, and what do we find 
— ministers shifting from parish to 
parish m search of bread. No 
preacher can fulfil his mission 
when he is only in a community 
for a year or two years. Under 
our present system of creeds I can- 
not see a sign of anything that is 
going to help. Statistics are a 
failure in giving the situation." 

That is just what the Lord Jesus 
Christ saw and told the Prophet 



ELDER MELVINJ. BALLARD 



87 



Joseph Smith in the very beginning 
of this work, and that is why "Mor- 
monism" is in the world. O how 
my heart rejoices to see how men 
are beginning to recognize that 
there is truth in the declaration that 
the Lord Jesus has made, for there 
is hope when men begin to see. My 
heart goes out to them, for I have 
discovered hundreds and thousands 
who are honest and God-fearing; 
but while we stand upon the firm 
rock or the.unsinkable ship, where 
there is no danger of wreckage, 
out in the mealstrom are many mil- 
lions who are driven hither and 
thither, and my heart goes out to 
rescue them, to save them, and to 
bring them to the knowledge of 
this glorious truth, for it is the 
thing that the world needs, and the 
world ultimately will receive it. 

I believe that we are but demon- 
strators and teachers. We have not 
been called here, my brethren and 
sisters, one of a city and two of a 
family, to enjoy all these blessings 
alone. We have only been brought 
here to be trained to carry this 
message to the world, to preach it 
by our lives, so that men might be 
attracted to it. And while I would 
not give up one of the young men 
who come into the mission field — 
I thoroughly enjoy them and ap- 
preciate them, but many are not 
prepared to meet some of the peo- 
ple in the world who are hunger- 
ing and thirsting after righteous- 
ness. What about the lawyers, the 
doctors and the bankers whom our 
young men cannot reach? What 
are you lawyers going to do about 
your brothers of the fraternity in 
the world? What are you doctors 
and bankers going to do? I want 
to say to you that the responsibility 
of carrying the message of the 
gospel to the lawyers, doctors, 
bankers, and professional men 



largely devolves upon the men of 
their class in this Church ; and if 
they cannot go for long term mis- 
sions they should go for short term 
missions, and if they should lose 
the opportunity of fulfiling these 
missions I believe a responsibility 
will rest upon their shoulders for 
failing to do their part. We want 
you out in the mission field. Of 
course it is proper to have homes, 
to be well provided for, even to 
enjoy the luxuries; but do not for- 
get that all material blessings are 
but a means to an end. Do not for- 
sret that the possession of the 
things of this life should not be 
the end, but a means to assist us to 
demonstrate to the world that there 
is power in the gospel of Christ, 
and assist us to bear this message 
to a sinking world who today need 
it worse than anything else. And 
I want to say to you that no fam- 
ily in this Church will ever stand 
secure in the possession of their 
privileges, nor in the realization of 
the blessings which have been pro- 
nounced upon their heads, unless 
they do their duty in carrying this 
message to the world. . So, you 
brethren who have been upon mis- 
sions may take home the responsi- 
bility of preaching the gospel again, 
for the demands for laborers in the 
field will be greater than ever be- 
fore. It is an hour of prepared- 
ness. It is an hour when the 
brethren and sisters should be thor- 
oughly alert, not boastful, but feel- 
ing the consciousness of the respon- 
sibility that rests upon us, accept it, 
lest we should fall short and others 
come in and take our places. 

There is some objection on the 
part of the world to this Church, 
because they think we are domi- 
nated. I recall a statement that 
was made in the world's citizenship 
conference, a few years ago, by Dr. 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Coyle, with whom I had a rather 
heated controversy, and he finally, 
I am glad to say, deserted his posi- 
tion and refused to defend his at- 
tack. He said: 

"I hold, and shall show, that 'Mor- 
monism,' by its organization, its 
claims, its teachings and its practices, 
is a menace to which, as America'ns, 
as patriots and as Christians, we can- 
not be indifferent. First of all, because 
of its system. It is the most com- 
pletely centralized, the most compact 
and most unified religious body in the 
world. As a piece of ecclesiastical 
machinery there is nothing to com- 
pare with it." 

No less a person than the Vice- 
President of the United States said 
last year: 

"We insist on being efficient peo- 
ple, and we also insist on being free, 
but we cannot be both. We must take 
our choice. The German empire and 
the 'Mormon' Church are two of the 
most efficient organizations on earth, 
but in both the individual is subservi- 
ent to the (Organization. I hope some 
way may be devised by which we can 
become more efficient and yet retain 
our freedom." 

I ask you, and you can each an- 
swer for yourselves: Do you feel 
that you are slaves? Do you feel 
you are dominated and dictated to 
by any one? Are the missionaries 
compelled to go into the field? 
Why, they are the freest men on 
earth. Yet here is efficiency. 
Some may say, it is not possible for 
us to have efficiency and yet free- 
dom. But they know but little of 
the power of the Holy Ghost who 
gives a common understanding to 
all who receive him and he makes 
them one. This is a power that is 
lacking in the world. Men may 
even adopt the doctrines and the 
ordinances of the gospel of Christ, 
but still there will be something 



lacking. You may manufacture ar- 
tificial heat and light, but plants or 
animals, when made to depend upon 
that light will dwindle and die. For 
there is something else that comes 
from the sun in addition to light 
and heat. It also sends life forth 
into all things. So the organiza- 
tion may be ever so perfect, but 
still there is something more than 
form needed. There must be life. 
It is the gift and power of the 
Holy Ghost that has "touched the 
hearts of the Latter-day Saints 
that makes them do this wonderful 
thing. I say to you that I am ab- 
solutely free. No one has ever dic- 
tated to me. I go cheerfully into 
the world. I have done it with all 
my heart ; freely I have done it. 
No man has compelled me. And I 
thank God that I have the good 
sense to use my will and my judg- 
ment to do that which I conceive is 
best for me, best for my fellow 
men, and in keeping with what I 
feel to be the will of the Lord. I 
have done it as you have done it, 
with my whole heart, with perfect 
freedom. We will continue to do 
it, my brethren and sisters, and we 
will yet demonstrate to the world 
that we can have the most efficient 
organization and still be free. If 
men can devise systems, that seem 
to be good, and that by the power 
and wisdom of men, then what 
should the kingdom of God be ? It 
should be more perfect than all, 
even as the heavens are higher 
than the earth. We should expect 
the Church of God to be the most 
complete and that nothing on earth 
can compare with it. This Church 
is that, even in the judgment of our 
enemy. . 

Let us live our religion. Let us 
recognize the fact that the work 
of God to be done in the earth is 
not yet finished. The greatest, the

grandest part of it all lies yet in the 
future, and it affects every man, 
woman and child in the whole 
world. May God help us to see 
this, and prepare ourselves to be 
demonstrators of the word and 
preachers of it acceptable to God, 
and to the salvation of the souls of 
all of our Father's children, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

The only true Church established by 
God and not by men — Our duty to 
teach all mankind freely this truth — 
Compulsion not a principle of the 
gospel — Those who neglect to ac- 
cept the truth must take the conse- 
quences — Later-day Saints are obe- 
dient to the priesthood, because, 
they are a part of the priesthood 
which exercises its power in right- 
eousness — They are obedient to 
an organization, because they are 
the organization — No man since the 
great apostasy has been able to or- 
ganize the Church of Christ; it re- 
mained for the Lord to do, through 
the Prophet Joseph — We must con- 
tinue to teach these truths to our 
children. 

The things we have heard this 
morning are some of the principles 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They 
are some of the things that must not 
be forgotten by the Latter-day 
Saints. They are truths that must 
be taught by the Latter-day Saints 
to their children, and their chil- 
dren must be trained in the knowl- 
edg of them, and prepared to go 
out into the world and proclaim 
them for the salvation of the world. 
It must not be forgotten by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that the Church to 
which they belong is the only true 
Church in all the world. It must be 
remembered by them that there is 
no other church on the earth that is 
recognized of God as his Church. 



Will he acknowledge an organiza- 
tion that he has not established? 
Will he recognize ordinances and 
ceremonies and sacraments that are 
performed; by those whom he has 
not appointed? I tell you he will 
not. The Lord recognizes only 
those whom he has called and 
chosen and ordained and sent forth 
to do his work and accomplish his 
will. While it is true, as Brother 
Ballard has stated, that the world, 
the people of the world, are not 
necessarily responsible or blamable 
for perpetrating upon the earth 
false churches or denominations or 
religions, nevertheless it must not 
be forgotten that the world of man- 
kind will be held responsible if they 
continue to perpetuate in the earth 
these false religions that were in- 
troduced centuries ago by uninspired 
men or by the adversary of the 
souls of men. The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints did not 
come out of the Catholic church. 
It is not an offshoot of any protest- 
ant denomination. It is not a faction 
of any denomination or religion 
extant in the world. It is not some- 
thing that has been established by 
men. It came not by the will of 
man, nor by the wisdom of man, but 
it came from God. God estab- 
lished it, not man. The truth of it 
came down from heaven, by the 
revelations of God, and is not 
founded upon the ideas nor the 
speculations nor the sentiments nor 
the will of men. The priesthood and 
authority of this Church is not a 
power that man has arrogated unto 
himself. It is not authority assumed 
by men or conferred by one man 
upon another; but it is an author- 
ity that came down from heaven 
and was restored unto men by the 
messengers sent from God, and 
those who received it are author-

ized to speak and to minister in 
tilings pertaining to the salvation 
and the redemption of mankind. 
These things are true. Therefore 
these things must not be forgotten ; 
they must he remembered and 
taught unto our children and to our 
children's children to the latest gen- 
eration, because these truths are 
what we must possess in order that 
we may come to an understanding 
and to the unity of the faith. 

I pray God to bless his people, 
and to make them able to accomp- 
lish the work he has called them to 
perform. As Brother Hinckley has 
suggested, because we are the 
chosen of God and have embraced 
the gospel of Christ and are mem- 
bers of the only true Church in the 
world, there is no reason why we 
should exalt ourselves and boast 
/ourselves as hetter than 1 others. 
That need not follow. We are 
what we are because we humbly 
accepted the word of the Lord, and 
did not reject the message of salva- 
tion when it came to us or our fath- 
ers. And some of you and many of 
your fathers were what the people 
of the world are now ; and what we 
are now, multitudes in the world 
may he. All mankind may be num- 
bered with the Saints of God, if 
they will forsake following the 
footprints as well as the will of the 
adversary, and submit their wills to 
the will of God. It is a matter that 
every man must regulate for him- 
self. All men can serve God free- 
ly. All are invited to come and 
drink of the waters of life freely, 
and they may come if they will. No 
one will coerce them, nor compel 
them. Compulsion is not a prin- 
ciple of the gospel of salvation. 
The gospel will be preached to 
them. We will labor for them, and 



we will serve them. We will make 
great sacrifices for them, and en- 
deavor to bring them to a knowl- 
edge of the truth, a knowledge of 
the salvation of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and of the kingdom of God ; 
but if they neglect that message, 
they must, of course, take the con- 
sequences. Some of these learned 
ones, quoted by Brother Ballard, 
express themselves in their ignor- 
ance concerning this Church. Are 
the Latter-day Saints subservient 
to the priesthood ? Yes in the sense 
of being obedient to the priesthood. 
Why, we the male portion of the 
Church are the priesthood. All men 
in the Church, those who are wor- 
thy, all are entitled to bear the 
priesthood, and do bear it, so far as 
we know. Each man exercises that 
power inhis labor among the Saints. 
We rejoice in being obedient to God 
and to his power, and the priest- 
hood is his power, and he has dele- 
gated it unto men, and those who 
exercise the authority and power of 
that priesthood, how have they ex- 
ercised it? My brethren and sis- 
ters, have they exercised it in harsh- 
ness? Have they exercised it in 
unrighteousness? Have they ex- 
ercised any unrighteous dominion 
over you and your children, or have 
they exercised it as the humble ser- 
vants of God, and your servants, 
your helpers, your instructors, your 
teachers, your leaders, your fath- 
ers, your husbands, your brothers, 
your sons? All these hold the 
priesthood, and the exercise of that 
priesthood has been manifested in 
love and sacrifice and service and 
brotherhood and mercy and char- 
ity and patience and tolerance and 
in good will. We know that. And 
that is one of the causes that has 
made the Latter-day Saints united. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

Are the Saints obedient to an or- 
ganization? Why, they are the or- 
ganization. The Church of Christ 
as organized in the world is com- 
posed of the membership thereof, 
set in order according to the wis- 
dom of God. 

If there has been one single 
man, from the very first pope down 
to the last, in Catholicism, who 
has known what the Church of 
Jesus Christ is, or what the gospel 
of Jesus Christ is, then I say it is 
very unfortunate that he has never 
made it known to the world. If 
there is any man in any religious, 
denomination whatsoever, from 
the beginning of it until now, who 
has known what the organization of 
the Church of Christ is, and how to 
organize it, or who knew what it 
consists of, then I say it is a great 
calamity to the world, and the world 
is suffering terribly in consequence, 
that he has never made it known to 
the world, and organized the 
Church for the benefit and the sal- 
vation of the children of men. Is 
it not reasonable to suppose that 
if any man, in any dispensation 
gone by, or living at the present 
time, understood the organization 
of the Church, and how to effect 
it, who understood the order of the 
priesthood, and how to set in order 
the quorums of the priesthood for 
the work of the ministry, for the 
preaching of the gospel, for the 
perfection of the Saints, for the 
purpose of bringing all men to the 
unity of the faith — 'I say is it not 
reasonable to suppose that he would 
have made it known, and set up 
that organization, and set in order 
that priesthood, and commenced a 
work for the redemption and sal- 
vation of mankind. The very fact, 
then, that no man has been able to 



set up the kingdom of God and 
establish the Church of Christ, 
with prophets, apostles, etc., and 
the divine gifts of the Spirit, and 
set in order the quorums of the 
priesthood, and assign the duties of 
the priesthood to the members who 
hold it, that fact, I say, is positive, 
irrefutable evidence of the truth, 
that no man since the falling away, 
since the great apostasy which fol- 
lowed the establishment of the 
Church by Christ, has known what 
the Church is, or how to establish 
it, nor what is the power of the 
priesthood, nor how to regulate 
those who hold it. These things 
have been made known, in our day, 
not by man, but by the Lord. They 
have been declared by the revela- 
tions of the Lord. And this organ- 
ization and this authority has been 
established in the world by the wis- 
dom and mercy and loving kind- 
ness of God, our Eternal Father, 
for the salvation of his children ; and 
its destiny, as has been said time and 
time again and as we must continue 
to teach and declare to our children, 
is to bring about the salvation of the 
children of men who ever lived, and 
who do live, and who shall ever live 
upon the face of the earth. I know 
these things are true. I know it, 
not by the wisdom of men, nor the 
learning of men, but by the witness 
and power of the Holy Ghost. He 
has borne testimony to my soul, 
that these things are true, the very 
truths of heaven, and that Joseph 
Smith was an instrument in the 
hand of God through whom they 
have been given again to mankind 
in the world. 

May God help us to remember 
these things, and cherish them, and 
hold them up paramount in our 
lives, and in all our activities while

The choir sang the anthem : "Un- 
fold, ye portals everlasting." 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Louis Pond. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

In a tent seated and arranged for 
the purpose and located on the 
lawn, east of the Bureau of Infor- 
mation building, a meeting was held 
at 10 a. m., Elder David O. McKay, 
presiding. 

The singing was by the M. I. A. 
chorus of Ensign stake, John D. 
Giles, chorister, Henry Giles, ac- 
companist. 

The chorus sang : "Our God, we 
raise to thee." 

Elder T. Samuel Browning gave 
the opening prayer. 

The chorus sang: "Now let us 
rejoice in the day of salvation." 



ELDER WILFORD DAY. 

(President of the Parowan Stake.) 

My brethren, sisters, and friends, 
it is indeed gratifying to me to see 
such a large audience here this 
morning, in view of the fact that 
both of the main buildings are 
crowded to their capacity. 

As has been stated, I am the pres- 
ident of the Parowan Stake of Zion, 
two weeks old today. I, who am 
the baby member of the Stake Pres- 
idents, did not expect to be called 
upon so early. Some few years 
ago, as a shepherd from the range, 



I received a call to fill a mission, 1 
responded, and the burden of my 
prayer was that I would be called 
into service. While I have made 
this explanation, this morning, it is 
not in the nature of complaining — 
I thank God, again, that I am put 
into service, because to me, with the 
limited experience I have had in 
this work, it means good feeling. 
For the more we work, the better 
we feel, the more we appreciate the 
gospel of our Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ. I feel in every fibre 
of my being that this work in which 
we are engaged is, indeed, the Mas- 
ter's work. The teachings and in- 
structions I received from the 
brethren, the presiding authorities, 
when they set me apart and called 
me to that mission in a foreign land, 
was of such, a nature, as every man 
and woman should have in this 
world. They taught me to pray for 
those who despitefully use me, to 
have no malice in my soul, and to be 
at peace with my God, my neigh- 
bors, and all mankind. Today I 
am happy to tell you, my brethren 
and sisters, that there is not a touch 
of spite in my heart toward any liv- 
ing being upon the face of the 
earth. People there may be who do 
not like me; there are people with 
whom I do not harmonize — we do 
not work together just right, prob- 
ably; but, nevertheless, I do not 
have a bitter spot in my heart to- 
ward any man upon the face of the 
earth. That is one of the principles 
of "Mormonism." One of the teach- 
ings I received was that I should 
keep myself pure and unspotted 
from the sins of the world. That 
is a doctrine of "Mormonism." 
Every teaching that I have re- 
ceived, under all circumstances, has 
been of such a character as to cause 
me to grow stronger, and to become

a better citizen of this great Re- 
public, and a better member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

I have occasion at times to come 
in contact with people who are not 
of our faith, and I recall now a 
conversation I had, only a few days 
ago, with persons not of our faith, 
and not of our state, who were com- 
ing through the country, evidently 
anxious for information pertaining 
to our people. They wanted to 
know the conditions — wanted to 
know how we stood politically, how 
strangers were treated who were 
not of our faith. My answer was 
that if they exhibited manhood and 
womanhood, we knew no difference 
in the ordinary affairs of life. I pre- 
sume there are many here, prob- 
ably, who are not of our faith, but 
I want to say this : I have served in 
various capacities in our stake, 
away out in the far country, nearly 
three hundred miles from Salt 
Lake, in a school board, for in- 
stance, and have employed teach- 
ers, not knowing their political or 
religious beliefs. This was done in 
an inland, isolated "Mormon" com- 
munity. I mention it to show you 
the attitude of our people toward 
all mankind. That is the teaching 
that we receive : that is the teaching 
it seemd to me that we should re- 
ceive. Ability, and good character 
are what we desire in people, hon- 
esty of purpose and righteous de- 
sires — let their religious or political 
beliefs be what they may. 

My brethren, sisters, and friends, 
I want to bear you my testimony. 
I know of a surety that God lives, 
that Joseph Smith was indeed a 
prophet, and his teachings that are 
being taught today are such as will 
elevate and strengthen and make 
for better manhod and better wom- 



anhood ; and stand for those things 
for which we need not apologize, 
nor be ashamed. I rejoice, my 
brethren and sisters, in heing a 
member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I know 
this, that if we will do the will of 
the Father, we will know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of man or 
whether it be of God. 

I pray that God, our heavenly 
Father, will bless us with ability 
to appreciate our position here in 
life, and our mission, and so be able 
to live in harmony with the gos- 
pel truths ; and if we do this, we 
shall become even better citizens of 
this great Republic, better members 
of the Church, and have an influ- 
ence for good among' mankind with 
whom we come in contact. May 
God bless us to this end, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President Southern States Mission.) 

It is written in the Bible, "Where 
there is no vision, the people per- 
ish." The other day, before I left 
the South to come here to attend the 
conference, I received a letter from 
one of our young elders. In this 
letter, he said, "I want to be the 
kind of a missionary that my moth- 
er thinks I am." That young man 
has vision, and while he walks in 
the light of that vision, he will be 
a missionary such as his dear 
mother is praying for him to be. 

In one of the suburbs of Chatta- 
nooga, there is a large mound. Re- 
cently a scientific association, sent 
two of its representatives to ex- 
amine this mound and to discover 
its contents. They did so, and they 
found it to be a vast tomb, filled 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with dead men's bones. It revealed 
the fate of nations long since 
passed. The ministers of that city 
are wondering who these people 
were, and why they were buried in 
one vast tomb upon the face of the 
land. If these ministers had vision, 
they would know the source from 
whence this departed people came, 
and their minds would be enlight- 
ened and filled with knowledge. I 
presented one of them with a copy 
of the Book of Mormon, and told 
him that in that sacred volume he 
would find the history of those peo- 
ple, whose bones filled that mound 
in the southland. 

The fate of that people is writ- 
ten in the Book of Mormon. It 
was predicted by one of the proph- 
ets of God. He warned the people 
that if they persisted in committing 
iniquity, that if they continued in 
their rebellion toward God and 
disobedience of his commandments, 
"there hones should become as 
heaps of earth upon the face of the 
land." That mound in Chattanooga 
is a powerful testimony that this 
prediction has been fulfilled to the 
very letter. That tomb is a warn- 
ing to the people: it is a solemn 
proclamation that "the wages of 
sin is death, but the gift of God is 
eternal life, through Jesus Christ." 
The Prophet Daniel said that "in 
the days of these kings shall the 
God of heaven set up a kingdom 
which shall never be destroyed 
* * * anc j no f- be left to other 
people." That kingdom is here. 
The Almighty has established it in 
strength and beauty and power for 
the salvation of the souls of men. 

Why is it that many people do 
not see it? Jesus gives the an- 
swer. "Except," he said, "a man 
be born again, he cannot see the 
Kingdom of God." And again, 



"Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter 
into the Kingdom of God." And 
so, my brethren and sisters, when a 
man is baptized by immersion for 
the remission of sins, and receives 
the gift of the Holy Ghost by the 
laying on of the hands of the au- 
thorized servants of God, that man 
is spiritually born again. He re- 
ceives the vision by which he rec- 
ognizes the Kingdom of God, he 
sees it, and the gospel is the door 
by which he enters into the King- 
dom, there to have exaltation and 
glory bestowed upon him if he con- 
tinues faithful in serving the God 
of heaven. 

When the quorums of priesthood 
were organized, the Prophet 
Joseph said that these quorums 
were organized according to the 
vision. I testify unto you, as a 
humble servant of God, that the 
Prophet Joseph established this 
work, that he founded the Church, 
under the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, and according to the vision 
that God did give him. When men 
talk of the beauty, of the strength, 
of the efficiency of this Church gov- 
ernment, we do not claim the credit. 
It did not spring from the brain of 
man, it did not come from earth. 
It was organized according to the 
vision which God gave to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith ; and herein, 
Latter-day Saints, is your hope, 
herein is your salvation ; and in the 
power which the testimony that this 
Church was organized by the Al- 
mighty gives, we go to the world 
and call men and women to repent- 
ance, and invite them to become 
with us heirs of God and joint heirs 
with Jesus Christ. 

Let us not lay the flattering unc- 
tion to our souls that God is a re- 
specter of persons. As ruin and

death overtook the ancient people 
who lived on this continent, so 
wickedness today will destroy men 
and nations. Is it not appalling to 
think that many people will not 
learn righteousness until the judg- 
ments of God are in the earth? Do 
not we need to practice the prin- 
ciple of repentance in our lives, 
every hour, every day, and every 
year? for, as the prophet hath said, 
"There is not a just man on the 
earth that doeth good and sinneth 
not." Repentance is a total change 
of heart and life. Fear does not 
constitute repentance, sorrow for 
misdeeds is not genuine repent- 
ance ; but a change of life, a change 
in the conduct of our lives, a com- 
ing to God and doing his will, that 
is genuine repentance, the repent- 
ance which will exalt a nation and 
bring it unto God. God sends sanc- 
tifying afflictions to produce re- 
pentance in the hearts of men. Of 
course, repentance is produced by 
the preaching of the Word, but God 
has seen fit in all ages of the world 
to send afflictions unto men that 
they might learn that there is a God 
in heaven, and that our allegiance 
is to him. 

In the thirty-second chapter of 
the Book of Alma, it is recorded 
that many poor people were driven 
out of their churches, and came to 
the servant of God for instruction ; 
and Alma said, "Because ye were 
compelled to be humble, blessed are 
ye ; for a man sometimes, if he is 
compelled to be humble seeketh re- 
pentance * * * blessed are 
they who humble themselves with- 
out being compelled to be humble 

* * * and baptized "without 
stubbornness of heart." God de- 
clares in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that after the testimony of 
the elders, he would send the testi- 



mony of earthquakes, of pestilence, 
of war, of famine. Are not these 
words being fulfilled? The nations 
of the earth have turned deaf ears 
to the entreaties, to the persuasions, 
to the testimonies of the servants of 
God. In the pride of their hearts 
and the stubbornness of their souls, 
they have not received the Word 
of God sent to them in love and in 
kindness, and now the God of 
heaven is thundering his judgments 
in the earth, and out of the smoke 
and the dust and the terror of this 
awful war will stand out written in 
letters of blood, "The wages of sin 
is death." Shining clearly to the 
vision of all men, the justice of God 
will stand forth, his mercy will be 
there ; and men and women by 
countless thousands will come to 
him, receive the gospel, and be 
blessed of him. 

I bear you my testimony, breth- 
ren and sisters, that Jesus Christ is 
the Son of the living God. I know 
this to be true. I also bear you my 
testimony that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the Most High, a man 
who gazed into) the heavens, a 
chosen servant of God, who gave 
his life for the children of men, 
who, by the power of God estab- 
lished the Church, preached the gos- 
pel, that men might come unto God 
and be saved in the Kingdom of the 
Lord Jesus. I also bear you my 
testimony that the head of this 
Church today is a prophet of God, 
and that it is as necessary for a man 
to believe that the Church today is 
led by prophets and apostles as it 
was in the days of Jesus, as it was 
in the days of Joseph Smith. And 
when men forget this great truth, 
when they live too much in the 
past. It is a sign that their vision 
is blurred, that the vision to them 
is becoming dim. O brethren and 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sisters, let us keep the Spirit burn- 
ing in our hearts, that the vision 
may be ever with us, that it may 
never be written of us that because 
we had no vision we perished in un- 
belief. 

God bless this people, God bless 
this gospel. It is flying abroad, it is 
filling the earth, it is destined to 
conquer, it will conquer, in love, in 
kindness. Its mission is to bless 
men and women, and to increase the 
glory of God in the hearts of men, 
by inducing his children to obey him 
and keep his commandments. I 
bear you this testimony in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of the California Mission.) 

My brethren have borne witness 
to you of the restored gospel that 
Joseph Smith, divinely chosen and 
ordained of God the Father, hath 
been instrumental in his hands to 
reveal again, the covenant which 
bringeth salvation to the sons of 
men. They have stated that any 
man may know of the doctrine 
whether it be of God or whether it 
be of man, if he will do the will of 
the Father. We have been singing 
of these last days of salvation and 
grace, rejoicing in the fact that the 
testimony of Christ is ours, that all 
which has been spoken by the 
mouths of God's holy prophets, 
since the world began, has been re- 
vealed to man in this day and age. 
We have been admonished that it 
is essential to be born of the water 
and of the Spirit, in order that we 
should see and enter into the King- 
dom of heaven. And we may know 
all this with just as great surety 
and certainty, as did the apostles of 



ancient times. When the Lord 
Jesus was ministering among the 
sons of men, and they had learned 
of the miracles which he had per- 
formed — and great crowds had fol- 
lowed him in his ministry — he 
asked of his disciples, "Whom do 
men say that I, the Son of Man 
am?" And they replied, Some 
say that thou art John arisen from 
the dead, or Moses, or some one of 
the ancient prophets. Then, said he, 
Whom do ye say that I am ? ye with 
whom I have ministered and la- 
bored in love, ye who have joined 
me in service, who know my private 
life, my thoughts my doctrines? 
And Peter, the senior member of 
his. quorum, replied, "Thou art the 
Christ, the Son of the living God." 
This man, because of his sturdy 
character, because of his stability 
and evident immovability, had been 
called Cephas, a stone, or Petros in 
the Greek, Peter as it is rendered 
in the English. And the Master, 
ever quick with those illustrations 
taken from the home-life of the peo- 
ple, said, "Verily, thou art Peter," 
(or thou art a rock,) "and upon this 
rock," designating something other 
than Peter, "shall I build my 
Church — and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it." That, to me 
is not only the rock of revelation, 
but the truth revealed in that rev- 
elation,, the testimony, the witness 
that Jesus is the Christ. For "flesh 
and blood," said the Master, "hath 
not revealed this unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven." Flesh 
and blood, experience, association, 
did not give this knowledge to 
Peter, that Christ was the Messiah, 
but God revealed it unto him — and 
that witness of the Holy Spirit the 
gates of hell should not prevail 
against. 

We learn that he drew after 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

him multitudes of people who came 
for the loaves and fishes, who came 
out of morbid curiosity to learn 
something of his doctrine, and see 
the miracles which he performed. 
When he discerned this at one time, 
he upbraided them soundly for their 
lack of faith, that they came for the 
bread, not of life, but of the earth ; 
that, as their fathers had been fed 
with manna from heaven, so they 
had thought to be fed in that dis- 
pensation, but he said, "I am the 
bread of life ;" and those who would 
be truly his disciples must partake 
of his flesh and of his blood. This 
was a hard saying to them, and 
they muttered over it, and turned 
away from him. When he be- 
held them departing, he said unto 
his disciples, "Will ye also go 
away?" Then Simon Peter an- 
swered him, "Lord, to whom shall 
we go? Thou hast the words of 
eternal life, and we believe and are 
sure that thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the living God." 

I would like to ask the Latter- 
day Saints today, to whom else will 
you go? We are admonished that 
we need repentance here at home. 
We are told that we are lax in our 
obligations to keep the command- 
ments of God, that we follow after 
the follies and madness of the world 
in seeking its wealth and pleasures. 
It may not be my part to criticise 
my brethren and sisters at home, if 
this; be true; but where else shall 
we go for salvation than to the Lord 
Jesus Christ? and "what shall be- 
come of us, if we neglect so great 
salvation?" If we are satisfied with 
the fame of the world, if we are 
content with its riches, if we fail to 
lay up for ourselves treasures in 
heaven, if we are selfish in our lives 
and do not live the gospel of ser- 
vice, of what moment is life to us? 



Where shall we find a reward? And 
whence shall come our recompense? 

I have been in the world long 
enough to know something of its 
philosophies, and I want to testify 
to you here, in all soberness, that 
they are vain, that they cannot give 
comfort to the soul who is tried and 
sorely distressed. I want to bear 
witness that the gospel of Christ, 
as it is understood by the Latter- 
day Saints, is the only thing that 
will bring comfort and strength to 
the souls of men when tried beyond 
the things of mortal endurance ; and 
there are times which come to us, 
one and all, I take it, that seem like 
Gethsemanes to us, things that are 
tragedies in our lives ; and in it all, 
with the experience that I have, I 
have never yet found a man who 
could derive strength and comfort 
in the philosophies of the world, 
nor in the perverted teachings of 
the ministers of so-called religion. 

I have seen the expectant mother 
in the throes of travail, answering 
the end of her creation, as a co- 
helper with the Eternal One, to 
tabernacle one of the spirits of his 
children in the flesh. In the depths 
of her travail and distress, invari- 
ably she turns to God the Father 
for strength, for comfort and power 
to endure. Then, when happily de- 
livered, she rejoices like Sarah of 
old, because a soul has been born. 
Again to the Lord does she turn, 
with a heart full of thanksgiving 
and praise, exulting in her mother- 
hood. As she watches this little one 
grow and develop and approach ma- 
turity, unfolding its weetness as a 
bud into a flower in the garden of 
love, again I note that she seeks 
God, in her joy, for strength, for 
judgment, for wisdom, to guard 
wisely and well and direct aright 
the emotions of that living soul.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



When the dark angel of death 
comes and shuts down the sweet 
eyes in silence, stills the lips, makes 
cold the cheek and hand, again does 
the mother, aye and the father, too, 
turn to the Source of all light and 
truth and comfort, for from him 
alone can comfort come, and re- 
compense. 

Nothing in what the world says 
of our lives beginning in this earth, 
of its ending with death, brings 
recompense, brings compensation 
for the trials of travail; nothing 
that the world philosophies can 
give us, even in all their breadth 
and depth of anticipating immor- 
tality, can bring compensation for 
the blasted hopes, the aspirations 
and ideals and desires cut short by 
death. We have builded in our 
very souls for eternity. We look 
for our children to perpetuate our 
names and honor in the congrega- 
tions of Israel forever. Careless 
and indifferent, perchance, we may 
be, but we want our boys to be hon- 
orable, brave, and godly men; we 
want our girls to be virtuous, sweet 
and matronly in their lives ; and in 
our hopes, we do not circumscribe 
them with the possibilities of this 
life, but only with that which the 
eternities can offer and bring to us. 
When these hopes are crushed and 
dead, because of the loved ones 
taken away, there is nothing that 
the world can offer to make recom- 
pense for our cherished ideals and 
hopes. We must rest our faith with 
God . We must look unto him, the 
Author of light and life and salva- 
tion, for comfort, for the renewal 
of hope and faith, and for the ulti- 
mate realization of all that our fond 
hearts have dared to dream of and 
desire. 

I have seen a people expatriated 
from their country, stripped and 



pealed, foot-sore and weary, carry- 
ing in their hands their earthly pos- 
sessions, come from the republic 
south of us, into this goodly land 
of freedom. I saw the spirit of 
faith and courage rest upon them 
and give them hope when all else in 
this world would have robbed them 
of trust in God and made them feel 
that their lot was mean and miser- 
able indeed ; it was because they, 
with Peter, had the witness of the 
Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that with him are the words of 
eternal life; that with God there is 
recompense and reward, and if men 
be faithful and true, though all 
things may be wrested from them 
in this life, in the world to come 
there are eternal riches — where 
moth doth not corrupt nor rust cor- 
rode, nor thieves break in and steal. 
When I went to visit some of them, 
/one in particular, the mother of 
half-a-dozen little children, and the 
husband away in the mission field, 
and I found her with more than a 
hundred others gathered into a 
great, vacant house, just completed, 
cement floors, no comforts, nothing 
with which to cook their food, no 
beds, and no food — I expected tears 
and lamentations, and, perhaps, 
from this fond mother and wife, a 
request that her husband might be 
sent to her. Her first words, after 
greeting me were, "Oh ! sing for 
us ; sing 'I'll go where you want me 
to go, dear Lord, I'll be what you 
want me to be.' " From whence 
comes such faith and courage under 
adverse conditions? Only from a 
deep conviction that God is over 
all, that his providences will not 
fail, and that they who trust in him 
shall have eternal life. 

I saw a city laid waste by earth- 
quake and fire, and hundreds of 
thousands of people made homeless. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

No word from the outside world, 
except that rumor had said that 
even this our great city had fallen 
in ashes and ruin to the ground, and 
the Temple of God had been struck 
by lightning, and blasted — that the 
greater cities of the East had sunk 
into the sea. Many men believed it 
was the end of the world ; and then, 
not only did I see the saint pray; 
the nun telling the rosary, and the 
priest with the crucifix — but they 
who had declared themselves in- 
fidel and unbelievers, came to their 
knees, and called onj God for de- 
liverance — for in the hour of their 
extremity, they recognized the fact 
that aside from him there is no life 
eternal, and no safety in this world. 
I have seen the spirit of peace 
and comfort come to men under un- 
toward conditions because of this 
faith. If you will indulge me, I 
will tell one incident. One of our 
brethren who had been bereaved of 
a sweet baby at home, a most prom- 
ising little one, came with his wife 
and three other little children into 
the mission field, voluntarily giving 
his service as a representative of his 
quorum of Seventy, to preach the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. The spirit 
of comfort came to them there in 
the midst of service. One day, re- 
turning from his work, he met the 
two litle girls, seven and five years 
old at the door, going on an errand 
for the mother. "Wait a moment, 
my swethearts," said he, "and I 
will go with you," and he went in, 
as the fond father, first to greet his 
wife after the day's labor. The lit- 
tle ones, in their excitement or zeal, 
had gone on without the father, and 
when he searched for them, a ter- 
rible feeling came over him that 
they had met with some sad end, 
and he turned around to see a great 
automobile run them both down, 



and when they were gotten out 
from under the wheels, one little 
one, the fairest, the oldest, was 
crushed almost beyond recognition 
— not an organ of her little body 
left complete, let alone a bone. The 
other little child was unconscious. 
It was hurried to an emergency hos- 
pital. The doctors labored over 
her, and felt there was no hope for 
her life. Five years old that she 
was, she had learned the lesson of 
faith and prayer, and opening her 
eyes for a brief moment to the anx- 
ious watchers and workers over 
he; , she asked for the elders ; and 
they blessed her. She sank to sleep, 
and awoke the next morning en- 
tirely sound, so far as her limbs 
were concerned, though bruised 
from top to toe. She would never 
acknowledge that she was hurt at 
all. At the coroner's inquest, my 
good brother, this Seventy, was 
askedi what charge he wanted to 
make, and he replied he had no 
charge to make. They wanted to 
put the little one, on the stand to 
testify of the death of her sister, 
and the father said, "No! she is 
only a little child, she would not 
understand. Why should you per- 
plex her with questions. Death has 
come to my family, I accept it, and 
I kiss the hand that chastens me." 
And the Judge said, "Do you not 
desire to establish some grounds for 
a damage suit?" "Why should I? 
Accidents come to all men. This 
was not a wilful one. The man 
who has done it suffers more than 
I suffer. I have the sweetness of 
my child's life to remember, I have 
the assurance that I will have and 
hold her again in the eternities 
yet to come, while he must go 
through this life ever haunted with 
the thought of this dread day.". And 
the Judge burst into tears, and said, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Never in my life of twenty-five 
years practice have I heard such 
talk, or felt such a spirit." 

At the funeral services, next day, 
many strangers gathered in, and 
this fond father asked for the priv- 
ilege of saying a few words over 
the body of his own babe. "I want 
you Saints," said he, "and you, my 
brethren and sisters in the mission 
field, to remember that God is over 
all. I do not want you to question 
his divine providence. I. do not 
want you, for one moment, to al- 
low this to affect your faith, but see 
to it by your lives, by your ministry 
and service, that you set one niche 
higher the standard of truth and 
equity, that men, seeing your good 
works, observing your faith and 
your loyalty, shall be constrained to 
come into the fold of Christ and re- 
ceive the recompense which God 
alone can give in times like this." 

Where else in all the world can 
such strength come from except 
from a knowledge that God is over 
all, and that Jesus is the Christ? 
And so, men there had to bear hom- 
age to the testimony of that man, 
and were constrained to feel that 
there was something in the faith of 
the Latter-day Saint that passed 
the bounds of earth, that reached 
out into the infinite, struck hands 
with the Eternal One, and had fel- 
lowship with him, because buoyed 
up under such circumstances, he 
would not repine; would not find 
fault with God nor think him harsh 
or unkind, but meekly submit and 
await for a time to, come when, 
comforted, they could pursue their 
alloted ways until their earthly life 
was finished, and then again, could 
claim and hold for eternity that 
sweet little one whose life was sac- 
rificed. 



This is the same spirit that was 
with Peter, that was with old Job 
when he had wrested from him his 
family, his riches, and his home. 
Miserable companions or comfort- 
ers perplexed him with the thought 
that it was something that he had 
done or had not done — that had 
made these dread calamities come 
upon him; — his own wife, turning, 
it seemed, against him, or at least so 
overcome with suffering and hu- 
miliation, suggested that he curse 
God and die. Crying out from his 
absolute weakness, sickness and hu- 
miliation, from the dust of a once 
happy home, he said, "Though he 
slay me, yet will I trust in him. 
* * * For I know that my Re- 
deemer liveth, and that he shall 
stand at the latter-day upon the 
earth ; and though after my skin, 
worms destroy this body, yet in my 
flesh shall I see God : Whom I shall 
see for myself and mine eyes shall 
behold and not another : though my 
reins be consumed with me." If we 
have this testimony, this faith, such 
courage as this, my brothers and 
sisters, we need not fear for the 
future of Zion. But if we are re- 
miss in our obligations, if we are 
undutiful, unthankful, and unholy, 
we will come under the anathema of 
those who reject salvation and Jesus 
Christ against themselves There- 
fore, let us be faithful and true, 
that the promises made to our 
fathers, that the promises made un- 
to us by God himself, through 
revelation, and the inspiration of 
his Spirit in this day, shall be ours, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The M. I. A. chorus sang: "The 
Spirit of God like a fire is burn- 
ing."

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

We live in our posterity — Many young 
people love the faith of their fathers 
— Our religion is one of power and 
life — It causes men and women to 
testify and render service freely and 
willingly — We are all under obliga- 
tions to do so — Evidences of the ful- 
filment of the promises of the 
prophets — Prayer that the young 
men and women may love the truth 
given of God to the fathers. 

My brethren and sisters, I believe 
we have all felt that it has been 
good to be here in the worship of 
the Lord, and that our Father in 
heaven has been mindful of us, and 
has blessed his servants who have 
given us the word of the Lord. We 
believe in the power of God to so in- 
spire his servants, that they can 
speak to the people the very word 
that the Lord would have spoken. 
Some might think this presumptu- 
ous, but it is according to the scrip- 
tures that have been given to men, 
both in ancient and in modern 
times. 

I thank God for the gospel, my 
brethren and sisters. In looking in- 
to the faces of those who have as- 
sembled here in this meeting this 
morning, I have felt to rejoice in 
that there is present a goodly 
sprinkling of young people, who are 
the sons and daughters of those who 
received the principles of the gos- 
pel in days that have passed away. 
We expect to live in our posterity. 
Our fathers and mothers before us 
have sought God our Father that 
his blessings might be upon them in 
the rearing of their families, that 
they might have sons and daughters 
who would honor God and keep his 
commandments. That has been the 
cry of the fathers. I have very of- 
ten come in contact with it in the 
labors that I have performed as a 



missionary in far-off countries. Mis- 
sionaries very frequently hear the 
declarations of fathers and mothers 
concerning the anxiety they have 
in their souls about gathering with 
the people of the Lord. I know 
something of how they have labored 
and saved that they might come up 
to the land of Zion — not that they 
were desirous to increase their sub- 
stance, so far as the things of this 
world were concerned, but they 
were anxious to plant the feet of 
their offspring in the country desig- 
nated by our Father in heaven for 
the gathering of his people. Such 
parents had become convinced of 
the truth and into their souls had 
come the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
They saw very clearly the import- 
ance of the gospel message that had 
been revealed to men in this dispen- 
sation ; and they were anxious that 
their children after them might be 
in the companionship of those in- 
spired pastors spoken of by holy 
prophets of old who had been 
wrought upon by divine inspiration 
and foresaw the gathering of the 
people together in Zion, where they 
should be given pastors after God's 
own heart — pastors who should 
feed the people with knowledge and 
with understanding. 

It gladdens my heart, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to discover that the 
hopes of the fathers and the moth- 
ers who have lived in the past are 
not to be in vain. There is growing 
up in the midst of this Church many 
young people who are the offspring 
of those who have labored so faith- 
fully in days gone by, splendid sons 
and daughters who love the truth, 
and who stand pledged to keep the 
commandments of God. We should 
be able to see today in this great 
gathering of the people of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, a very remarkable 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



evidence of the truth of the work to 
which we have given our allegiance. 
I do not suppose that anything like 
it has ever been witnessed any- 
where else in the world. Where 
else do such hosts gather together 
for religious purposes ? Our build- 
ings are very commodious, but en- 
tirely too small to accommodate the 
people who desire to hear the word 
of God. Even in this overflow meet- 
ing, in the open air, notwithstand- 
ing the chilliness of the weather 
this morning, the people are anxious 
to come and hearken to the coun- 
sels that may be imparted. 

I thank God for a religion of this 
character, a religion of power and 
life, a religion that causes converts 
to labor for the uplift of humanity, 
and to feel that they are under ob- 
ligation to give service to the work 
of God. 

I heard a young man, who is a 
superintenednt of a Sabbath school 
here in Salt Lake City, say just re- 
cently, that his school was visited a 
few weeks ago, by three ladies who 
were passing through the city. They 
saw people going into the little 
church, and supposing that a public 
service was going on, they entered, 
with others, and thus found them- 
selves in a Latter-day Saints Sab- 
bath school. The superintendent, 
seeing they were strangers, paici at- 
tention to them, and invited them 
either to join in one of the classes, 
or to visit the various classes as 
they might elect. When they ex- 
pressed a desire to visit the various 
departments he escorted them from 
room to room. When they had gone 
through the school, one of the la- 
dies said, "How on earth do you 
get the money to pay all these 
teachers ?" They had a host of lit- 
tle children in the kindergarten de- 
partment; and quite a number of 



teachers engaged with that de- 
partment; and of course the usual 
number of teachers engaged in the 
other departments. She could not 
understand where the money came 
from to pay so many teachers in the 
Sabbath school. The superintend- 
ent himself was astonished at the 
question. He said, "I never heard of 
anyone being paid for work in a 
Sunday school. These men and 
women give their service freely and 
gladly to those who have assembled 
together." The lady desired to know 
how it was possible, and the answer 
was, "Because into their souls has 
come an understanding and knowl- 
edge of the truth of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ ; being converted them- 
selves, they feel that they are under 
obligation to render service to their 
fellows and help to bring others to 
an understanding of the truth that 
has filled their own souls with sur- 
passing peace." 

My brethren and sisters, that is 
what the gospel has done for men 
in all ages of the world, that is what 
the gospel is doing for men today. 
There cannot be found men or 
women who have received the truth 
understandingly and have been bap- 
tized by the Holy Spirit of intelli- 
gence, which Spirit takes ot the 
things of the Father and reveals 
them unto men, who do not feel 
within their souls that they are un- 
der obligation to lend a helping 
hand to forward the work of God. 
You all know they are made anx- 
ious to labor, to speak, to bear tes- 
timony to the truth as it has been 
made manifest. That is your obli- 
gation, that is my obligation, my 
brethren and sisters, and the obliga- 
tion of every soul who has been 
made acquainted with God's plan of 
saving the human family. God him- 
self has said in the revelations giv- 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



103 



en in our own age, that "He that 
hath been warned shall warn his 
neighbor." I hope we all feel this 
responsibility resting upon us. and 
that we feel under obligation to 
give that service for the advance- 
ment of the work of our God, that 
our Father in heaven demands of us 
and that we are all earnest laborers 
in his vineyard, and that not one of 
us shall be drones. 

I rejoice in the marvelous evi- 
dences of the fulfilment of the 
promises of the holy prophets — 
we see them in process of fulfilment 
upon this sacred square today, "a 
marvelous work and a wonder," as 
God declared over and over again 
by the mouth of his great prophet 
of the latter dispensation, Joseph 
Smith. "A marvelous work and a 
wonder is about to come forth 
among the children of men," — we 
could have read it frequently in the 
book of revelations, even before the 
Church was organized. When Jo- 
seph Smith stood as it were alone, 
among the great hosts of men living 
upon this earth, God said to him, un- 
der those conditions, that a marvel- 
ous work was about to be revealed 
to the children of men ; and God 
made marvelous promises in con- 
nection with that work. 

I will read a promise or two that 
has been made : 

"And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in 
these last days. 

"And they shall go forth, and none 
shall stay them, for I, the Lord, have 
commanded them. 

"Behold this is mine authority, and 
the authority ,of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my com- 
mandments, which I have given them 
to publish unto you, O inhabitants of 
the earth. 

"Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye 
people, for what I the Lord have de- 
creed in them shall be fulfilled." 



These words sound like one 
speaking who has authority. There 
is no uncertainty, my brethren and 
sisters, in the words of the living 
God, as they were given to the 
prophet at the opening of this dis- 
pensation. The words I have read 
were given to be published to all the 
inhabitants of the earth, as the pref- 
ace to the book of revelations that 
was to be published to the people. 
The purpose was that all the people 
might know — members of the 
Church and non-members of the 
Church — that the Lord God of 
heaven had said that his servants 
who had been chosen to carry the 
message of his gospel to the inhab- 
itants of the earth in these latter 
days should go forth and none 
should have power to stay them. 
And here is one of the evidences be- 
fore our eyes today, in these meet- 
ings. We are gathered from every 
nation, and from every people, ac- 
cording to the promises and proph- 
ecies of both ancient and modern 
prophets. Wherever the gospel 
message has been sounded, men 
have been found who have given 
their allegiance to the work as ft has 
come to them ; and they have given 
the right kind of allegiance, the 
allegiance declared to be necessary 
by the Lord Jesus Christ, who is 
the lawgiver to the nations of the 
earth. They have been willing to 
forsake houses and lands, father 
and mother, wives and children, for 
the gospel's sake, and have been 
given, as our history abundantly 
testifies, power even to give their 
lives in attestation of the truth of 
the everlasting gospel. 

All praise to the name of Jeho- 
vah, who made such clear and mar- 
velous promises, and who has so 
marvelously fulfilled and is fulfiling 
the predictions of the prophets. The 
work that is being accomplished,

evidences the fact that God estab- 
lished it, that it is his cause, that it 
is the means and power of salvation 
to the peoples of the earth! God 
help us to love it ! Young men and 
women, I say to you, love the truth 
that God gave to your fathers, and 
give that allegiance to this cause 
that has been given by the fathers 
and mothers of the past. God help 
us to be the class of men and 
women that the fathers and moth- 
ers who founded "Mormonism" 
have prayed for. If we are of that 
kind, we will bring honor to the 
cause of God, as well as honor to 
the names we bear. 

I bear record to the truth God 
has revealed. I know this cause has 
come from God, and not from man ; 
and, as has been testified in this 
meeting, it will conquer, not in our 
might, or wisdom, or power, but in 
the might of God, who has so de- 
creed. God help us to believe it, 
I pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 

The Power of the Holy Ghost comes 
through those who have divine au- 
thority — Paul and the Sons of Sceva 
— A missionary incident — Our duty 
to prove, by our acts, that God 
acknowledges this Church as his. 

The power that has prompted 
the inspirational remarks of those 
who have addressed you this 
morning, was manifest in Ephesus, 
on one occasion, when Paul found 
twelve men there who had been fol- 
lowing Apollos. He said to them: 
"Have ye received the Holy Ghost 
since ye believed ?" They said unto 
him : "We have not so much as 
heard whether there be any Holy 
Ghost." "Unto what then were ye 



baptized?" And they answered, 
"Unto John's baptism." Then said 
Paul, "John verily baptized with the 
baptism of repentance, saying unto 
the people that they should believe 
on him which should come after 
him, that is, Christ Jesus." 

There were seven sons of one 
Sceva, who lived by pretending to 
the arts of the magician. When they 
saw that Paul, through the power 
of God wrought miracles, they tried 
it. They commanded the evil spirit 
in a man to come out in the name of 
"Jesus whom Paul preacheth." But 
the evil spirit said : "Jesus I know, 
and Paul I know, but who are ye?" 
And the man who was possessed 
of the evil spirit leaped upon the 
seven sons of Sceva, and they fled 
from the house, naked and wound- 
ed. There are men in this day who 
perceive this power is manifest in 
the Church, but they do not know 
its source, at least they will not 
acknowledge its source, any more 
than Simon who received the re- 
buke of Peter, or any more than 
the seven sons of Sceva, who tried 
to use it without the proper author- 
ity. 

I call to mind now a man who de- 
voted several years of the best part 
of his life, and concentrated his tal- 
ents in an effort to disprove the di- 
vinity of this work. He was out 
visiting the members of his diocese, 
on one occasion, and while there, he 
met the president of the stake, and 
in conversation said: "While I 
speak thus against your Church, 
there are some things In it which 
I think most acceptable, and 
which I shall work to intro- 
duce into our Church." "What' are 
they?" asked the president. "Well, 
there is your tithing system. I be- 
lieve that that is the proper method 
of collecting church offerings. <I

think it is the right way." "Well," 
said the president, "why don't you 
have your people pay their tithing ?" 
He answered honestly, "We would 
like them to, but they will not pay 
it." "What other feature is there?" 
asked the president. "There is 
your missionary work. I think," 
said he, "that the opportunity you 
give your young men to go out and 
preach what they think is the truth, 
is the greatest opportunity that can 
come to any young man." "Why 
don't you offer your young men this 
privilege?" "We would, but they 
will not go," was his answer. 

Contrast that with the experience 
of a young man who left this city 
about three weeks ago, the first 
time, practically, that he has ever 
been away from home. He was 
reared in the Church, trained in 
Sunday schools and other auxiliary 
organizations, with a course in our 
Church school, and two years in the 
University, scarcely twenty years 
old now. When his call came he ac- 
cepted it without hesitation. When 
I said "good-bye" to him and 
his companions, as they boarded 
the Union Pacific, in Ogden, just 
three weeks ago, he could scarcely 
speak, and when I happened to 
mention his mother, he just broke 
down in tears and sobbed. But 
though he was going into an un- 
known world, to him, among 
strangers, he was glad in his soul — 
thankful that he had been considered 
worthy to represent his Church. He 
was sent, to the Eastern States 
mission, received his assignment to 
some litle town near Pittsburg, just 
out from that large city. When he 
arrived, there was nobody to meet 
him. He made some inquiry about 
the address which had been given 
him, and from which the elders had 



moved. There he was, alone in the 
city of Pittsburg. He went to a 
few houses in the neighborhood, in- 
quiring if they knew anything 
about the "Mormon" elders who 
recently were there, and he chanced 
to meet a man who was conducting 
a mission there. The man looked 
at him, saw how young and inex- 
perienced he appeared, and said : 
"Are you engaged in missionary 
work?" And the young elder an- 
swered, "Yes, I hope to be soon." 
Then followed a conversation of 
about thirty minutes, and the mis- 
sionary of the other church said: 
"I would like you to come and speak 
at our mission headquarters next 
Sunday, if you will promise not to 
tell the people who you are." The 
young man answered tremblingly, 
"I will gladly come to your mission, 
but I must tell the people who I 
am." The minister evidently was 
impressed with the young elder's 
spirit, but could not stand to have 
it labeled "Mormonism." 

The power that is guiding that 
young man, today, and thousands 
of others throughout the world, in 
the mission field, and here at home, 
is the power of the Holy Ghost, 
which comes to those who accept 
the principles and ordinances of the 
gospel, administered by men di- 
vinely appointed in things pertain- 
ing to God. 

It is our duty, my fellow workers, 
to prove to the world, by our acts, 
that God acknowledges this Church 
as his, and is willing to bestow his 
Spirit upon those who diligently 
serve him. I rejoice in this ser- 
vice, in the testimony of those men 
who know, as you know, that God 
has poken again from the heavens, 
and that he lives to bless us, his 
children. May the peace of this 
meeting abide in our souls for ever, 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

After the chorus had sung, 
"Count your many blessings," the 
meeting adjourned, benediction be- 
ing pronounced by Elder George 
Stewart, of Malad. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
p. m., Elder Orson F. Whitney, 
presiding. 

The singing was by the Pioneer 
United Choir, under the direction 
of Tracy Y. Cannon, chorister, Ed- 
ward P. Kimball, accompanist. 

The choir sang: "Ye simple 
souls that stray." 

Elder William Robinson offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir sang: "As the hart 
that pants." 

Elder O. F. Whitney presented 
the names of the General Author- 
ities of the Church, as presented 
at the session in the Tabernacle. 
Each and all were sustained by 
unanimous vote in the positions 
named. 

A soprano solo, "Recessional," 
was sung by Martha Cottrill. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(Pesident of the Western States 
Mission.) 

I am keenly appreciative of the 
responsibility of this moment; and, 
to the end that I may be divinely 
inspired, together with those who 
shall follow in this meeting, I crave 
your indulgence and your faith, for 



in and of myself I am quite help- 
less to say anything by way of 
profit or edification to you. 

As I listened to the splendid trib- 
ute paid by President Smith to the 
mission presidents, at the opening 
session of this conference, I exper- 
ienced a feeling of humility the like 
of which has seldom come to me, 
and when I realized from his re- 
marks the confidence he has in those 
men, his faith in their integrity and 
in their loyalty to the work of the 
Lord and to the presiding authority 
of the Church, I felt entirely inade- 
quate, even in a slight measure to 
fulfil the mission designed and the 
duties and responsibilities devolv- 
ing upon me as one of those men; 
and I determined in my heart to 
continue to do all that I could for 
the advancement of God's purpose 
in the earth and to maintain always 
a prayer for those who stand in re- 
sponsible positions in Israel. 

And when President Smith re- 
ferred to the responsibility upon 
the. Latter-day Saints, speaking of 
our obligations to the Church, he 
said it was a "terrible reality," I 
thought, where do we lack in ap- 
preciating the positions that we 
should occupy as men and women 
who have taken upon ourselves such 
obligations and covenants to serve 
the Lord? and I wondered if our 
faith is what it should be. I in- 
stinctively thought of the great en- 
couragement that is 'vouchsafed to 
all, in the words of James, wherein 
he says : "Is any sick among you, 
let him call for the elders of the 
Church, and let them pray over him 
anointing him with oil in the name 
of the Lord, and the prayer of faith 
shall save the sick." I then recalled 
a conversation I had recently at the 
home of a friend of mine in one of 
the Eastern cities, where I met a 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



107 



learned man, a professor of educa- 
tion, who himself broached the sub- 
ject of miracles. After he had given 
the company his views and told 
instances, some of which he seri- 
ously questioned, I ventured the 
suggestion I had every confidence 
in the word of the Lord, and when 
he or his servants said that the 
prayer of faith would heal the sick 
I believed what they said. "Well," 
he replied, "under ordinary condi- 
tions I would believe it, but I can- 
not believe all things pertaining to 
it." He said a personal friend of 
his came to him one time, and re- 
lated the following incident : His 
little son had broken his wrist, and 
he started with him to a doctor, but 
the boy having implicit faith, which 
undoubtedly was taught him at his 
mother's knee, said : "Father, if 
you will pray for me, my wrist will 
get well without going to a doctor." 
The father anointed that injured 
part with oil, and blessed his son, 
and the wrist went into place, and 
the bones knitted together. "Now," 
my friend said, "I do not credit 
that, and I cannot believe that 
statement." He enquired, "How 
would you view it?" I said, "If I 
thought the man's word was to be 
relied upon in other things, I would 
take his word as quickly for that as 
anything else. "Well," he said, 
"there was nothing to work on. The 
bones were broken, do you think 
that the Lord is going to make two 
bones grow together when they are 
broken apart?" I said, "I believe 
that he can make bones grow to- 
gether, and I know of cases where 
he has not only restored flesh, but 
he has restored bone that has been 
taken out of a hand which was 
mangled." 

I told him of a case that occurred 
in Denver recently, where a doc- 



tor, an old man, had invited our 
missionaries to his home, and they 
had held a few cottage meetings 
there. This man was injured by 
being thrown off a hone when he 
was a lad, fifty years ago, and as a 
result one of his hands was crip- 
pled seriously, not having been 
properly set, and aside from that his 
feet were badly crippled from rheu- 
matics. One evening after a meet- 
ing was held, he said to the confer- 
ence president who happened to be 
there, "if you elders would come 
and administer to me I would get 
well, I would be healed." And they 
made an appointment to go to his 
home the next day. A ' new elder 
accompanied the conference presi- 
dent, a young man from this city, 
who had been there only two or 
three weeks upon his mission. They 
anointed this man and prayed for 
him and blessed him. He sat for 
fully five minutes, looking out of 
the window, not saying a word. 
Finally he commenced to feel of his 
hand, and then realizing it had been 
healed, he called his wife, and she 
came in and attested to the fact, and 
then the conference president, 
knowing that he had been healed 
thus miraculously, said unto him, 
"Why don't you arise and walk, 
and see if your other trouble has not 
been benefited also ?" And the man 
arose like a boy, and walked across 
the room, and then accompanied the 
elders to the car line, half a block 
from his home, enthusiastically talk- 
ing and testifying until they parted. 
This man gave me his testimony to 
the same effect, and said, among 
other things, that he had been ac- 
cused by his neighbors and friends 
as being fanatical and crazy about 
some things : but, he said, "I have 
been teaching 'Mormonism' for a 
long time, and did not know what 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it was." And so I told my friend 
of this case. "Well," he admitted, 
"I agree that perhaps if there was 
a dislocation without a break, that 
that might be healed, that the pray- 
er of an individual might have the 
desired effect. But, I cannot be- 
lieve if two bones are broken that 
any kind of power other than the 
power of science can unite those 
bones together." I thought of this 
today as Dr. Talmage referred to 
one phase of activity that we ought 
to be careful about, that is, when 
educated men pretend to place 
themselves above the word of God, 
when they undertake to say that they 
can readily judge between things 
of earth, and heaven, and that 
they, through their scientific investi- 
gation, aver that the scripture is a 
fraud, that the lives of the old apos- 
tles and the life of the Savior 
were but a story or myth. I fear 
that too often young people who go 
to colleges throughout this land and 
in the world, imbibe false doctrines 
and theories, and they sometimes 
lack faith enough to withstand the 
arguments that are brought to bear, 
on this tremendously vital ques- 
tion. 

We have, aside from the Bible, 
the words of Moroni, when giving 
his final testimony to the world he 
said : "And Christ truly said to our 
fathers, if ye have faith ye can do 
all things which is expedient unto 
me." I like to dwell upon that 
thought. I like to believe that this 
system of ours teaches us to pray to 
a personage, to a living God, to one 
who will hear and answer prayer 
when it is expedient to him. There 
are times we know when the power 
of the priesthood is brought to bear, 
and we see no results. We know 
that men and women must die, their 
lives cannot be prolonged indefi- 



nitely, and yet we would pray for 
them, and we do pray for them 
when they are upon their deathbed, 
that they may be restored to health, 
and still they die. It is expedient 
in the Lord, because he has said that 
all must die. But if our faith is 
such that we can rely absolutely 
upon him, then we are entitled to go 
to him with an undying faith, with 
a simple faith, and he will hear and 
answer prayer. And if at times he 
fails to answer our prayers as we 
think they should be answered, then 
we should acknowledge his al- 
mighty power and realize that it 
was not expedient in him that such 
prayers should be answered. 

that we might have a living, 
abiding faith in God, above all 
things to realize the responsibility 
of life, to recognize the duties and 
the requirements that are made of us 
from day to day, to pray that when 
our young men and young women, 
boys and girls, go out into the world 
to preach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, that they are to get the 
best training that can come to them 
in life. The knowledge that will 
come to them, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that God lives, and that 
Joseph Smith was and is a prophet 
of God is above and beyond any 
other thing that can come to them. 
That is the kind of faith I like to 
have, and try to exercise. My faith 
in this work is simple, but it is ab- 
solute, and I hope to continue in 
that way, the Lord being my helper. 

1 recall, frequently with much 
profit and encouragement, the 
words of the great philosopher, 
Emerson, one who is looked upon 
perhaps as the greatest philosopher 
of our time, wherein he said, "I 
delight in telling what I think, but 
if you ask me how I know a thing 
I am the most helpless of mortals. 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK.

What I have seen teaches me to 
trust the Creator for what I have 
not seen," and so I believe that the 
great body of Latter-day Saints 
have seen enough, have known 
enough, aye have felt enough, for 
sometimes it comes as a spirit that 
tecstifies to our souls, and we do not 
know how it comes, nor from 
where, but I believe that we have 
enough of the spirit of vision that if 
there are things that we cannot see 
through, if there are things that 
science cannot take and dissect, and 
analyze as they do material things, 
then our faith is such that we can 
look to God for the information, 
that in his own due time he will en- 
lighten our minds and open our un- 
derstandings and make us to realize 
that we are indeed his children, and 
that we are here in a probation of 
mortality, seeking to know the way 
of life and salvation. 

May God grant his eternal bless- 
ings to us, that we may serve him 
with full purpose of heart, that we 
may magnify our callings, that we 
may sustain in our hearts and in our 
actions the Presidency of the 
Church, the presidents of stakes, the 
bishops of wards, and all to whom 
we owe allegiance in this great 
work, and cultivate humility and 
faith, I humbly pray in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 

(President of the Woodruff Stake of 
Zion.) 

It is with felingsof timidity, my 
brethren and sisters, that I stand 
before you this afternoon. I most 
earnestly desire that you will sup- 
port me with your faith and pray- 
ers the few moments that I may 
stand before you. 

While the general authorities of 
the Church were being sustained, 



this afternoon, I wondered in my 
mind if the Latter-day Saints sus- 
tain them merely as a form, by rais- 
ing their hands, or if we do sustain 
them in our lives, in our homes, and 
in our families. This afternoon we 
have sustained the general author- 
ities of the Church, the presidency 
of the Church, and the apostles, and 
patriarch, as prophets, seers and 
revelators to the people. It is 
through them the heavens are 
opened to us. It is the only source 
that we have as a Church of re- 
ceiving revelation from God, our 
Eternal Father, and I feel, my 
brethren and sisters, that the chil- 
dren in our homes should be taught 
to # pray for these men, to sustain 
them in their prayers, and should 
hecomei acquainted with them, so 
that they may know who they are 
praying for. 

I well remember when I was a 
small boy, in this city, for I was 
born here, my mother took me to 
the tabernacle every Sunday of my 
life, and she pointed out to me the 
men in the stand that she had 
taught me to pray for. I well re- 
member at that time, that the presi- 
dency of the Church were Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, and his coun- 
selors, George A. Smith and Daniel 
H. Wells. Every night before re- 
tiring to my rest, I was taught to 
pray for these men, and the council 
of the Twelve, and name them in 
my prayer. And on the Sabbath 
day, my mother taught me to go 
with her to meeting, and when the 
speakers arose she would point 
them out to me and say, that is 
the man you are praying for — 
naming him to me, so that I would 
know him when I saw him in the 
stand. In that way confidence and 
faith in the general authorities of 
the Church were instilled into me 
as a child. That faith and that con- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fidence until this day has never been 
shaken. I think it would be a good 
thing for mothers occasionally to 
point out, if they are unable to do 
so by the persons themselves, by 
photographs, the leading brethren 
of our Church. Have their photo- 
graphs in your homes, and name the 
brethren, occasionally to your chil- 
dren. Teach your children to pray 
for the brethren, and as they grow 
to years of maturity they will grow 
in faith in our leading men, and 
their confidence in them will be in- 
creased. 

I am reminded this beautiful day 
of the commandment of the Lord, 
that we remember the Sabbath day 
to keep it holy. Reference has 
been made, during this conference, 
to a part of the Stake of Zion over 
which I have the honor to preside, 
the Fort Bridger country, and I 
want to relate to you this afternoon 
a little incident connected with that 
country, showing what I thought to 
be a perfect Sabbath day. I don't 
know that in all my life, in my ex- 
perience, I ever before saw a per- 
fect Sabbath day until that day. It 
was in the autumn, at harvest time. 
Myself and companion' were ap- 
pointed to visit a small village be- 
tween old Fort Bridger and Fort 
Supply on the Black's Fork river. 
We arrived on Saturday evening, 
and remained with the bishop over 
night. He lived at one end of the 
village, and the meetinghouse was 
at the other ; perhaps two or three 
miles apart. In the morning when 
we started on our way to meeting, 
as we passed along the farms we 
beheld that the Sabbath day was 
observed by the people. We saw 
beautiful fields of ripened wheat, 
the binder standing as left the even- 
ing before. We saw the stacks of 
grain, partly built, and wagons 



loaded with bundles, as left by the 
side of the stack the evening before. 
Some ofi the grain was harvested 
and in the shock, and some was yet 
in the field. We saw the animals 
that had lahored all week, resting in 
the fields and yards. There was no 
sound of the hammer, machinery, 
or work heard from the bishop's 
home to the house of worship. But 
we saw people coming to the meet- 
inghouse from all directions, from 
their farm homes. It was in the 
autumn, a beautiful day, quiet, no 
breeze blowing, warm and pleas- 
ant; up the Black's Fork, flowing 
down from the mountains, a beau- 
toful picture met our eyes. The 
leaves were turning to their autumn 
hue, and the water came tumbling 
to the lower levels, over large 
boulders. On the slopes on either 
side of the water was the foliage of 
pine trees. Down along the river 
bottom were quaking asps and cot- 
tonwoods. The people had con- 
rstucted a large flour mill, near 
the meetinghouse, which was 
run by water. The mill race 
was perhaps fifty feet above the 
river, and the water was flowing 
idly over the race and dashing upon 
the stones below. The mill was idle 
upon the Sabbath day, and as we 
entered the meetinghouse, I said to 
the bishop: "Bishop, I presume 
this is something unusual." The 
meetinghouse was crowded with 
people to its utmost capacity. I said, 
"I suppose your people were ex- 
pecting visitors today. This is some- 
thing unusual, is it not?" "O no," 
he said, "not at all. President Bax- 
ter, our people observe the Sabbath 
day, and keep it holy." He said 
later, that every family in that lit- 
tle village "was represented at the 
meetifighouse that day." All the 
members of every family were not 



ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 



Ill 



there, but every family in the vil- 
lage was represented, and all of the 
members of many families were 
there in the meetinghouse. 

I thought, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I would mention this lit- 
tle incident, for it impressed itself 
upon me, not only that beautiful ex- 
ample of the observance of the Sab- 
bath day, but the thought of these 
grain fields being in the very local- 
ity where Col. Jim Bridger had 
told President Young that it was 
impossible for man to grow crops 
in this mountain country. Perhaps 
you are not all aware that the alti- 
tude of Fort Bridger is very much 
higher than in this region — it is 
nearly six thousand feet above sea 
level. There, in that high altitude, 
were beautiful fields of grain, beau- 
tiful homes of our people, a sweet 
spirit of contentment. The air 
seemed to be imbued, with the spirit 
of the Sabbath day, and I will never 
forget that beautiful picture. 

I believe we will be blessed of the 
Lord, if we observe the Sabbath 
day, and keep it holy. We labor 
six days of the week, but on the 
seventh it is the Sabbath day. Let 
us not labor on that day, but go 
up to the house of the Lord to wor- 
ship, and take our children with us. 
There seems to be a tendency, on 
the part of some Latter-day Saints, 
to allow their children to remain 
away from the general sacramental 
meeting. They feel that if they 
attend the Sabbath school, in the 
morning, perhaps that is enough for 
the children. But I do believe that 
it is a good thing to have the chil- 
dren go to Sabbath meeting with 
their parents, and partake of the 
sweet influence, the same as the 
parents do. 

May God bless us, my brethren 
and sisters, help us to serve him 



and keep his commandments, and to 
remember the Sabath day to keep 
it holy, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ORLEY S. STAPLEY. 

(President of the Maricopa Stake.) 

I bring you greeting from the 
Maricopa Stake, in Arizona, and I 
assure you that I feel my timidity 
in trying to address this inspiring 
congregation. I have listened with 
great interest to the testimonies 
borne during the different sessions 
of this conference. It makes me 
feel that I am well paid for the time 
which I have given to coming to 
conference. We live so far away 
from the headquarters of the 
Church, that there are only a very 
few of us who are able to come to 
the conferences. But we always try 
to have representatives here, so that 
they may bring back to us the words 
spoken by the mouths of the 
prophets of God, whose words 
may be thus disseminated among 
the people in our part of the coun- 
try. We live in the south central 
part of the state of Arizona, near 
the capital. We have about 2,700 
souls in the stake, and it takes us 
but a few minutes, less than an 
hour, to visit every ward in the 
stake except one, so that you can 
see we live very close together. A 
better people do not live any- 
where. They are all full of the 
Spirit of the Lord, and feel to do 
their duties. 

There was considerable anxiety 
in our stake when the troubles com- 
menced in Mexico ; but at present 
one hardly hears of it, and yet we 
are within a hundred miles of 
the line. But there has been opened 



112

up a good market for the products 
of the soil among our people. 
Hardly anything that we raise there 
but what brings fabulous prices, 
and cash in hand, so that the peo- 
ple are prospering in that land. 
When I heard Elder Ivins, this 
morning, addressing the congrega- 
tion in regard to his observations in 
the different stakes in which he had 
lately traveled, in regard to the ex- 
travagance of the people, it carried 
me back home to my people, and I 
wondered if it was the same in all 
of the different stakes of Zion: 
whether extravagance is running 
rampant everywhere and men and 
women are following the fashions 
of the world. Whether men who 
have not a roof above their heads, 
still put their little money into auto- 
mobiles, getting time, and then live 
on expectations. Of course, they 
must dress accordingly, but when 
the rent period comes they are com- 
pelled to move, generally speaking. 
This is not as it should be among 
the Latter-day Saints. The first 
thing, I think, that the head of a 
family should do is to procure a 
home, no matter how small, nor 
humble it is, and pay for it, as soon 
as he possibly can, and add conve- 
niences or even luxuries to it as cir- 
cumstances will permit. O how I 
used to like to hear men not of our 
faith come into my place of busi- 
ness and say to me, "Mr. Stapley, 
we know that the 'Mormon' people 
are honest, and pay their debts." It 
made me feel good. I was glad to 
be associated with and numbered 
among a people of that character. 
But since fads and fashions have 
been introduced into our commun- 
ities I am sorry to say that there 
are many who do not live up to this 
reputation. We want to go back to 
where we were before, We should 



avail ourselves of the opportunities 
that present themselves at present 
to pay our debts. Let it be said of 
us from henceforth, that we are an 
honest people. We are taught in 
knowledge, virtue, and all that will 
help us to build up character and 
make better citizens and husbands. 
These things I wish that we could 
i emember. 

President Herrick was tellling 
you of his testimony that signs do 
follow the believer. I remember 
an incident that happened when I 
was in the mission field. My com- 
panion and I were lost. We came 
to a home, after wandering around 
considerably, where we met a fam- 
ily who had never before seen a 
"Mormon" elder. The lady of that 
home had been afflicted with rheu- 
matics, for five years, so that she 
was unable to do her work at all. 
After we had visited their home 
several times, I placed in her hands 
the Book of Mormon, and asked 
her to read it. We visited again, 
numbers of times. One Sunday af- 
ternoon we were invited to hold ser- 
vices at her home. She called me 
aside, and said, "Elder Stapley, 
What am I to do to become a mem- 
ber of your church?" I asked her 
if she believed that the hook that 
she had been reading was true. She 
said, "I believe it with all my 
heart." "Do you believe that Jos- 
eph Smith was a prophet of God?" 
"Yes, I do, with all my heart." "Is 
your husband willing that you 
should be baptized?" "Yes, he is." 
And I turned to her husband, and 
asked him, and he said he was. 
After the service, I announced that 
this sister would be baptized. There 
were a number of people who came 
to witness the baptism. She told 
me that she knew that as soon as 
she accepted the ordinances of the 



ELDER ORLEY S. STAPLEY. 



113 



gospel she would be made whole. 
After the services her husband 
Helped me to take . her into the 
water. I baptized her and when 1 
raised her out of the water, she let 
loose of my hand and said, "Elder 
Stapley, I will walk out," and she 
did so to the astonishment of her 
husband and all the people who wit- 
nessed it. I testify to you that the 
signs do follow those who believe 
and have faith in them. 

We live in a land once inhabited 
by the people of whom the Book of 
Mormon gives a history. It is re- 
corded in the third chapter of Hel- 
aman, that they were great work- 
ers, canal builders, and agricultur- 
ists, no doubt. When our people 
went into that country, they asked 
for an engineer to run a line out for 
a canal to the river. He went over 
the land, and then said, "Gentle- 
men, it is impossible to bring this 
water up here upon this table land." 
Nevertheless, our brethren, with 
faith in their mission and in the call 
of those who were placed over them 
to go into that country, took 
a spirit level and went out to the 
river, and brought the water 
through the great, old canal con- 
structed by that ancient people. The 
ancient inhabitants had their distri- 
bution of water two hundred yards 
below where ours is at the present 
time, south and west. That is an- 
other testimony to me, brethren and 
sisters, that the Book of Mormon is 
true. That book was brought forth 
in 1830, before ever this country 
was inhabited, in this age of the 
world, and yet that canal could he 
traced across the country, con- 
structed by that ancient people, so 
carefully that it could not be done 
much hetter today. 

There is evidence all through 
there of great cities, fortifications 



of all sorts, and all that kind of 
thing, to be seen there at the present 
time. 

I trust and pray that we will al- 
ways maintain the truth, that we 
will take the spirit of this confer- 
ence home with us and give it to the 
people, so that they will be built up, 
and may be strong and able to up- 
hold those who are placed in au- 
thority to conduct the affairs of the 
kingdom of God, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

Fifty years ago, today, there ar- 
rived in this city, from the mouth 
of Parley's Canyon, a company of 
"Mormon" immigrants, about three 
hundred, souls, who had crossed the 
plains and mountains in forty-nine 
wagons drawn by oxen, and who 
had left the Missouri river just two 
months before. It was one of ten 
trains which arrived in the Valley, 
that year, from the Missouri river 
with "Mormon" immigrants. It was 
the year 1866, the last year that our 
brethren and sisters from Europe, 
or from any other part of the world, 
crossed the plains and mountains all 
the way from the Missouri river, 
to these valleys with teams. It 
was nearly the end of that long pe- 
riod of pioneers experiences — twen- 
ty-two years — which is so closely 
associated with the early history of 
the Saints in these mountains. The 
year 1866 was a heavy emigration 
year with the Church. During the 
year, nine large sailing vessels, 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



loaded with Latter-day Saints,' 
crossed the Atlantic ocean from 
Europe to America. Three of these 
sailed from London, three from 
Liverpool, and three from Ham- 
burg, Germany. The total number 
of "Mormon" immigrants from 
Europe, in 1866, was 3,241. Of 
this number 2,069 came from the 
British Isles, and 1,213 from Scan- 
dinavia. Included in the latter 
were a few saints from Germany. 
These ships spent all the way from 
thirty-seven to sixty days crossing 
the Atlantic ocean. 

I know something about that 
year's immigration because I came 
over myself in one of the nine 
ships mentioned, _ and that is one 
reason why I delight, on this par- 
ticular occasion, to refer to this 
matter. It happened that I crossed 
the plains in Andrew H. Scott's 
company which arrived in this Val- 
ley, Oct. 8, 1866, just fifty years 
ago today. 

I shall never forget my experi- 
ence in crossing the Atlantic in the 
ship Kenilworth and the plains in 
Captain Scott's ox team. I have 
often thanked the Lord that I came 
that year, and not later. Had I 
come the next year ( 1867), I should 
have been deprived of the privilege 
of traveling three hundred miles on 
foot, because that year the railroad 
had been built that far westward 
from the Missouri river; and the 
year following, (1868) it was built 
more than half way across the 
plains, and mountains, or as far as 
Ft. Laramie, and later in the year 
Ft. Benton, on the upper Platte. 
The next year (1869) all the fun 
was over. After that all the immi- 
grants had to travel all the way by 
rail (laughter), and the ox team 
travel then became a thing of the 
past. So I say, I am very thankful 



that I came when the last opportun- 
ity in this world was given the 
"Mormon" emigrants of crossing 
the plains with ox teams the whole 
distance from the States to Salt 
Lake Valley. As a fifteen-yea'r-old 
boy, I "hoofed' it nearly all the way 
from the little village of Wyoming, 
in Nebraska on the Missouri river, 
to the City of the Saints. 

Brethren and sisters, I speak 
feelingly, and with a degree of en- 
thusiasm and satisfaction, of the 
pioneer period. A great majority 
of those who are present here in 
this assembly have not had the op- 
portunity of crossing the plains with 
ox teams, and will scarcely have 
that privilege in the future ; but 
you, or a majority of you, are un- 
doubtedly sons and daughters, or 
grand children, of those noble pio- 
neers who sacrificed so much to 
come to this land of Zion — to a 
place where the feet of their chil- 
dren could be planted firmly and 
where they could have the oppor- 
tunity to learn more of the ways of 
the Lord, a privilege which most of 
you have had ever since you were 
born. 

The pioneer period will in one 
sense be forgotten soon, as the real 
actors are fast passing to the great 
beyond. Of the pioneers of 1847, 
only a few are left. There is only 
one left of those who came with the 
original pioneers, who with Presi- 
dent Young, entered this Valley in 
July, 1847 ; namely, Brother Wm. C. 
A. Smoot, of Sugar House ward. 
He is the only surviving member of 
that noble band of pioneers who 
first entered Salt Lake Valle*y. 
There is, however, one more alive 
of those who came in the original 
pioneer company, although then 
only a six-year-old boy. I refer to 
Lorenzo Zabriskie Young who 



■ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



115 



lives in Cleveland, Emery co., Utah, 
and is now 75 years old. These 
are the last two survivors of the 
original pioneer company. 

Following in the track of the 
first company of pioneers, about 
eighteen hundred other pioneers, 
consisting of men, women and 
children, arrived in the Valley, in 
1847. Among them were some of 
the members of the Mormon Bat- 
talion, who arrived in this valley 
from the west, after they had made 
the journey from the Missouri river 
to California the year before; they 
had served their term of enlistment 
and came into the Valley soon after 
the pioneers. Nor must we forget 
to speak of the so-called sick de- 
tachment of the Battalion, who, 
after wintering at Pueblo on the 
Arkansas river, arrived in the val- 
ley a few days after the original 
pioneers company. This was all in 
1847, and that you will understand 
was the beginning of the Latter-day 
Saints crossing the plains with 
mule, horse and ox teams. The 
original pioneers had mostly horses 
and mules, but most of the com- 
panies that followed were fitted out 
with ox teams, as it was found that 
oxen, as a rule, though slower in 
locomotion, could stand the journey 
across the plains better than mules 
and horses. 

The year 1848 witnessed the ar- 
rival of about four thousand souls 
in these mountain valleys from the 
Missouri river ; they were mostly • 
exiles from Nauvoo, who had been 
driven from their homes there in 
1846 by a ruthless mob, and who 
had spent two winters at Winter 
Quarters, Nebraska. Some of them 
had also resided temporarily in 
Iowa, on the east side of the Mis- 
souri river. They all came here in 
the latter part of 1848. 



The next year (1849), about 
three thousand people arrived in 
this valley, and the following year 
about the same number. By the 
end of the year 1852, nearly all of 
those who had been exiled from 
Nauvoo had arrived in the valley, 
and we had a population here of 
about forty thousand, including 
some who came from Europe ; for 
as soon as the pioneers got per- 
manently settled in the valley, the 
immigration from Europe, which 
had temporarily been suspended, 
commenced to pour in. 

I do not desire to go into details ; 
I will merely state that for a num- 
ber of years our brethren and sis- 
ters, at a great expense, migrated to 
Utah from Europe and from the 
United States as far as their means 
would allow. The Church, how- 
ever, at an early period — as early 
as 1849 — organized the so-called 
Perpetual Emigrating Fund Com- 
pany, and by the operations of that 
Company a large number of people 
were assisted to emigrate to Utah. 
In 1856, a new and novel method 
of crossing the plains and moun- 
tains was inaugurated. President 
Brigham Young conceived the idea 
that the Latter-day Saints, who 
were generally men and women of 
good, moral character and pos- 
sessed of good physiques and 
strong will power, could cross the 
plains without much assistance 
from either oxen, mules or horses. 
Hence,-' the handcart episode was 
introduced that year (1856), when 
five well organized companies of 
hand-cart immigrants crossed the 
plains. The first three of these 
companies under Captains Edmund 
Ellsworth, Daniel D. McArthur 
and Edward Bunker made the jour- 
ney successfully ; but the last two 
companies which, under Captains 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. . 



James G. Willie and Edward 
Martin, started too late from the 
Missouri river, encountered heavy 
snow storms in the mountains and 
suffered much. This handcart 
method of travel continued more or 
less until 1860. Thus two hand- 
cart companies crossed the plains 
in 1857, one company in 1859 and 
two companies in 1860. Captains 
Daniel Robinson and Oscar O. 
Stoddard's companies were the last 
that crossed the plains with hand- 
carts. 

And I desire to call your atten- 
tion to this fact: In all the over- 
land travel which has been under- 
taken in America, or in any other 
country, the handcart journeyings 
by the Latter-day Saints stand out 
alone and unique, inasmuch as no 
such travel has ever been attempted 
in any other part of the world, so 
far as I know. We have heard of 
a man traveling from the States 
to California with a wheelbarrow — 
not in a wheelbarrow ; he couldn't 
very well get himself to California 
in such a vehicle, but he traveled 
with a wheelbarrow. This man 
had not money to buy horses or 
wagons or any other kind of con- 
veyance, so he carried his few be- 
longings with him in a wheelbar- 
row. Of course he was an excep- 
tional character. You might, per- 
haps, be tempted to call him a little 
cranky, but he was so anxious to 
get to the gold diggings in Cali- 
fornia, that he chose this hard and 
novel way of getting to his desti- 
nation, rather than to be left be- 
hind. But when I speak of four 
thousand Latter-day Saints crossing 
the plains with handcarts, I do not 
speak of cranks, but of genuine 
heroes and heroines who, for the 
sake of their religion, exposed 
themselves to the hardships and 



perils of the desert, in order to get 
to Zion ; and I might say a majority 
of them arrived in these valleys in 
safety, while quite a number also 
died on the plains. 

In 1860, we again had a new 
experience in crossing the plains. 
It had been discovered that the cat- 
tle bought in the east — such cattle 
as had been raised on the luxuriant 
grasses of Missouri, Nebraska and 
Illinois — could not easily make the 
journey across the plains. They 
were not used to the bunch-grass ,or 
other grasses of the hills and there- 
fore many of them succumbed to 
the hardships of the journey, while 
the rest as a rule got very tired and 
could scarcely bring the immigrants 
to their destination. Hence, in 
1860, President Brigham Young 
conceived of another plan for 
bringing immigrants from the 
frontiers to Utah. It was this : he 
called upon the brethren who had 
already been comfortably located in 
these mountains, to send, or to take, 
their mountain oxen or mountain 
mules and horses that had been liv- 
ing on the bunch grass and other 
grasses here in Utah, to the Mis- 
souri river, and bring back the poor, 
those who had not the means to 
purchase their own outfit. This ar- 
rangement began in 1860. A little 
company was sdnt to the Missouri 
river that year under the leader- 
ship of Joseph W. Young, and made 
the journey successfully. After 
that, in 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 
1866, from two to five hundred 
teams were sent each year down 
to meet the immigration. We who 
lived in Europe were instructed to 
raise the necessary means to bring 
us to Florence or Wyoming, Ne- 
braska, as best we could, and there 
the Church teams would meet us 
and bring us across the plains and

mountains. This extensive emigra- 
tion business was carried out by the 
Perpetual Emigrating Fund Com- 
pany. 

I was speaking of the immigra- 
tion to this valley fifty years ago. 
The nine shiploads of saints (three 
thousand immigrants) from Europe, 
added to the natives of the United 
States who joined them on the 
frontiers, made nearly five thousand 
people, who came to Utah in 1866, 
and I may add here that during the 
immigration years (1847-1868 in- 
clusive) at least seventy thousand 
people crossed the plains in about 
two hundred twenty well organ- 
ized companies. This will give you 
an idea of what was done in the 
shape of travel, between the east 
and this valley. Some, of course, 
but not many, came by way of Cal- 
ifornia. 

Reverting again to 1866, I will 
state that the Church authorities, 
through the Perpetual Emigrating 
Fund Company, sent from Utah 
that year ten companies to the Mis- 
souri river after the poor. There 
were ten captains — a captain for 
each company — four hundred fifty- 
six teamsters, forty-nine mounted 
guards, eiehty-nine horses, one 
hundred thiry-four mules, three 
thousand forty-two oxen and three 
hundred ninety-seven wagons. 
Sixty-two wagons fifty oxen and 
sixty-one mules were sent for or 
bought in the east. These teams or 
companies left here, of course, in 
the spring, and they returned in the 
fall under the leadership, of Cap- 
tains Thomas E. Ricks, Samuel D. 
Wright, Wm. H. Chipman, John D. 
Holliday, Peter Nebeker, Daniel 
Thompson, Jos. S. Rawlins, An- 
drew H. Scott, Horton D. Haight 
and Abner Lowry. 



I do not wish to harass your 
minds by a detailed account of the 
emigrants in the last company. They 
arrived in this Valley Oct. 22, 
1866, three weeks later than An- 
drew H. Scott's company. The im- 
migrants in that ill-fated company 
were mostly those who sailed from 
Hamburg, in the ship Cavour and 
arrived in New York later than 
some of the other ships. The Ca- 
vour met with storms and contrary 
winds on the ocean and the hard- 
ships of the voyage and the inade- 
quacy of the supplies of food caused 
them to contract disease ; cholera 
broke out among these Saints as 
soon as they landed. I bring this 
matter to your attention just to 
show what some of the Latter-day 
Saints endured in their endeavors 
to come to Zion. Brother Elnathan 
Eldredge, who called at my office 
day before yesterday, drew my at- 
tention to this particular company 
and said that he helped to bury 
thirty-one corpses in one day at St. 
Joseph Mo., men, women and chil- 
dren, who had died in that com- 
pany. The survivors continued the 
journey up the Missouri river and 
several died before they reached the 
village of Wyoming. It being so 
late in the season, the brethren in 
charge there had to load the immi- 
grants into the wagons as best they 
could and start for the plains, at 
once. Time did not permit them 
to delay their departure. It is esti- 
mated that about one-third of the 
company which crossed the Atlantic 
in the Cavour, and the plains in 
Captain Lowry's train, died on the 
way, and never reached the Valley. 
But that was also the last of this 
overland travel from the Missouri 
river to Salt Lake Valley. Abner 
Lowry's emigrant train was the last 
of all "Mormon" emigrant trains to 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



suffer severely on the plains. Some 
of the emigrant trains, in 1853 and 
1854, had also suffered from 
cholera, but the fate of Abner 
Lowry's company was perhaps as 
sad as any. Thank God it ended 
there. 

I may add that while the comple- 
tion of the Union Pacific Railroad 
put an end forever to the long over- 
land, journey by oxen and wagons, 
about the same time the crossing of 
the Atlantic Ocean by Latter-day 
Saint emigrants in sailing vessels 
was also stopped. From that time 
until the present nearly all "Mor- 
mon" immigrants from Europe 
have crossed the sea in comfort- 
able steamships, and have come in 
comfortable railway cars across the 
American continent to these moun- 
tains. 

By way of' conclusion, I will say : 
How thankful, my brethren and sis- 
ters, ought we not to be, that we 
are here in Zion, that those pioneer 
fathers and mothers of ours came 
here at that early day and caused 
most of us to be born and raised 
here under the droppings of the 
sanctuary in this beautiful city and 
the other settlements of the Saints. 
I have seen nearly all the large 
cities of the world, and let me tell 
you, there is only one Salt Lake 
City — only one city like this in the 
whole wide world. And I may be 
pardoned for believing that our 
beautiful city was founded by men 
who were favored with inspiration 
from on high. I believe the Lord 
inspired Brigham Young to locate 
this city just where it now stands, 
to make the blocks as large and the 
streets as wide as they ar,e, and to 
do what was done on general prin- 
ciples, not only in this city, but 
throughout all the settlements of the 
Saints in the Rocky Mountains. 



The lessons we learned in cross- 
ing the plains were lessons of ex- 
perience for which we thank the 
Lord. We had a good time as a rule. 
It is true that some of our dear ones 
fell by the wayside, and now rest in 
lonely graves on the plains and 
mountain slopes, but the remainder 
of us lived to reach the Valley and 
to make our homes here. On the 
journey across the plains and moun- 
tains we also learned valuable les- 
sons of order and discipline. We 
had our prayers and devotional ser- 
vices morning and night. Our lead- 
ers spoke comforting words to us 
every day, and when we sometimes 
became weary and somewhat dis- 
couraged, we would sing, "Come, 
Come Ye Saints no toil nor labor 
fear," and then renew our exer- 
tions. Sometimes, after a long and 
dreary march, we felt like lying 
down, never to rise again, but when 
some of our musicians and vocalists 
began to sing or play, we frequently 
found ourselves, in spite of fatigue 
and tired; [limbs, dancing on the 
grass in the midst of the camp en- 
closure. By the blessings of God 
who gave us strength and courage 
sufficient for our day, our lives were 
preserved, and while many died on 
the plains, many others who were 
sick nigh unto death, were healed by 
the power of God, through the ad- 
ministrations of the elders. I have 
in my mind at this moment scores 
of instances where the elders laid 
their hands on the sick who were 
struggling between life and death, 
and they were raised up by the 
power of Almighty God; and their 
children are here today to praise 
the Lord for their fathers and 
mothers. 

May God bless you. May we not 
only honor the pioneers, but honor 
the God of heaven who inspired our 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



119 



fathers and mothers to do the things 
they did in bringing themselves and 
us to these mountains. May God 
bless us and help us to be faithful 
and true to our calling as Latter- 
day Saints, I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang : "We thank thee. 
O God, for a prophet." 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Rulon S. Wells.

ELt>ER C. ALVIN ORME. 

(President of Tooele Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I am pleased and grateful unto my 
Father in heaven for the oppor- 
tunity and for the confidence that 
has been placed in me that I should 
be honored to speak at one of the 
great conferences of our Church, 
which is the Church of our Father 
in heaven. I am also pleased to be 
called upon as a representative of 



the Saints who are living in the 
Tooele stake of Zion. I rejoice in 
the spirit I have partaken of with 
you in this tent and in reviewing 
our conditions as a people and the 
history of our Father's people in • 
different dispensations. 

One circumstance comes to my 
mind that is recorded in the Book 
of Mormon, where King Benjamin 
gave an address and instruc- 
tions unto the people just prior to 
delivering the kingdom to his son 
Mosiah. There were messengers 
sent far and near, and they came 
and pitched their tents, and there 
was a tower erected from which the 
great prophet could stand and speak 
to the people; and there wasn't 
room for them to hear his voice. It 
had to be carried by messengers or 
writing, that the people might hear 
his testimony concerning the work 
in which they were engaged, and 
concerning that great body of peo- 
ple. I am reminded of that today. 
This Church, which began with but 
six members, and grew, in poverty, 
being robbed and plundered and 
peeled by the enemies of the people 
— came into the valleys of the 
mountains, in fulfilment of proph- 
ecy by the Prophet Joseph Smith 
that they should come here and be- 
come a great and mighty people. I 
doubt whether in the history of 
nations or of men, any question 
could be discussed and presented 
before the people, that would bring 
them together as have the Latter- 
day Saints gathered upon this oc- 
casion. 

I am grateful-for the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints, and as I travel 
from place to place, and come in 
contact with young men, I find that 
there is a growing interest in 
Church work. There are some with 
whom I am acquainted, young men 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who, before they were married, took 
but little interest in the Church, but 
now, having assumed the responsi- 
bilities of family life, are becoming 
interested. I have been asking them 
questions concerning the Church, 
concerning its growth and develop- 
ment. In some of them at least, I 
testify that the faith that has been 
transmitted from the parents to the 
children, is taking root, although 
for a few years it may have seemed 
that there has been indifference and 
lack of interest in the principles of 
the gospel. That they are awaken- 
ing to the truth is a source of grati- 
tude to me. 

Whenever opportunity presents 
itself, I ask my young brethren how 
they feel respecting the Church ; 
how strong their faith is in what 
their fathers and mothers have es- 
poused ; what they know concern- 
ing the gospel ; and in that way, I 
get an opportunity to speak with 
them. I like to put my arm around 
these young men and encourage 
them to seek after a testimony, for 
I am convinced that anyone who 
will ask and work shall be rewarded 
with a testimony, and with a knowl- 
edge of the truth. 

There are other conditions which 
are improving compared with what 
they were. I am reminded of a 
passage of scripture that I am go- 
ing to read, and if I can get the 
inspiration and permission from 
the Spirit of our Father in heaven, 
I will speak concerning it. I refer 
to the closing verses of the epistle 
of James, recorded in the last chap- 
ter, commencing with the four- 
teenth verse: 

"Is any sick among you let him 
call for the elders of the church: and 
let them pray over him, anointing him 
with oil in the name of the Lord: 

"And the prayer of faith shall save 



the sick, and the Lord shall raise him 
up; and if he have committed sins, 
they shall be forgiven him." 

I wonder, my brethren and sis- 
ters, how many of us there are who 
have implicit faith in this doctrine 
and teaching. 

I am called frequently to admin- 
ister to people who are sick, and I 
bear my own testimony to you that 
there is efficacy in the anointing 
with oil and the imposition of hands 
and the prayer of faith offered unto 
our Father in heaven in behalf of 
the sick, and the afflicted. This 
passage of scripture is true and gen- 
uine. Modern revelation also gives 
unto us the same injunction, that 
the elders of the Church shall be 
called, and oil used for the anoint- 
ing of the sick, and the prayer of 
faith offered in their behalf. Many 
times have we seen men and women 
who were in sore distress because 
of accident, or disease in the body, 
relieved through this ordinance 
even while the hands of the elders 
were still upon their heads ! Not I 
alone, but you all have the same ex- 
perience and testimony. Let us 
then carry out this injunction, and 
even more faithfully offer prayer 
unto our Father in heaven in be- 
half of the sick and the afflicted. 

Not only do members of the 
Church have faith in this ordinance 
of our Father's house, but even 
non-members have believed. Quite 
a prominent physician in this state, 
not a member of this Church, said 
to me one day, "I would like to 
converse with you a few minutes 
before we enter into anything else, 
on some principles of your Church, 
and in particular, on the question of 
administering to the sick, for I have 
had experience for a number of 
years with your people, and have 



ELDER C. ALVIN ORME. 



121 



performed a great many operations, 
and I am thoroughly convinced that 
when men or women are going to 
be operated upon, and elders of 
your Church administer to them, I 
am more successful. I have more 
confidence in what I do; and the 
individual I know is strengthened 
and benefited by the administration. 
I would like to know its source of 
power." I then explained to him 
our belief in those things. 

Another prominent physician 
made this statement, that in the 
state he came from "where I have 
been practicing, we can nearly tell 
the length of an individual's life 
when he reaches a certain stage of 
certain diseases ; but here in your 
state, we give them up and set the 
time that they can live, and often 
when we return they are improved. 
I have asked the reason, and they 
tell me that the elders have admin- 
istered to them, and the power of 
God has healed them." 

These words have come to me 
directly from these two physicians, 
and they are men of good, sound 
judgment, good, clean, honest- 
hearted men, who have sympathy 
with us as a people. 

Now I want to bear testimony to 
you that this work in which we are 
engaged, is the work of our Father. 
It is not the work of Joseph Smith, 
who was the instrument in the 
hands of God our Father, in estab- 
lishing this work. All that he did 
was done under the inspiration of 
our Father in heaven. The visions 
of the Almighty were granted unto 
him, and he saw the existing con- 
ditions in the world. He was made 
to see the need of a Church di- 
rected under the inspiration of our 
Father in heaven. He knew that 
it could not be organized except 
under our Father's direction. He 



therefore placed his confidence in 
and relied upon the inspiration of 
our Father in heaven. Consequent- 
ly we have what we have here rep- 
resented today upon this Temple 
square. 

I pray our Father in heaven to 
1 less and inspire us with zeal, with 
determination to serve him and keep 
his commandments, and that every 
man and every woman will go from 
this conference feeling renewed in 
their faith, and strengthened in 
their determination to go forward 
and perform the duties that devolve 
upon them in this Church. Even 
though it be only as members, it is 
better to have our names on the 
records of this Church, than to be 
honored among men without being 
enrolled upon the Church records. 
It is a great honor to be a deacon 
and fulfil that office in righteous- 
ness before our Father in heaven 
— or a ward teacher, and perform 
duties in visiting the families in the 
allotted districts — or presidents of 
quorums or bishops of wards or 
presidents of stakes or auxiliary or- 
ganizations. 

In conclusion, my brethren and 
sisters, let me read the closing 
verses of the one hundred and sev- 
enth section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, an admonition given to 
those who bear the priesthood : 

"Wherefore now let every man learn 
his duty, and to act in the office in 
which he is appointed, in all diligence. 
He that is slothful shall not be count- 
ed worthy to stand, and he that learns 
not his duty and shows himself not 
approved, shall not be counted worthy 
to stand " 

May our Father in heaven bless 
us that we may hold fast unto this 
work, for it is the work of God, our 
heavenlv Father, I pray, through 
Jesus Christ, Amen,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER DANIEL G. MILLER. 

(President of the Yellowstone Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I rejoice with you this day in the 
privilege we have had of listening 
to the servants of the Lord, and lis- 
tening to the counsel that has been 
given during this conference. I re- 
joice in the great gathering here of 
the Saints of God, as they come to- 
gether with that desire in their 
hearts to hear the word of the Lord. 
I am sure we will not go away 
empty, but that we will feel that we 
can be better men and better women 
because of that which we have 
heard, if we will only carry it out 
in our lives. 

It gives me much pleasure to see 
a great many young men and wom- 
en in this audience, for the youth 
of Zion is the hope of Israel. I 
trust that they will remember the 
Lord in the days of their youth, for 
according to Ecclesiastes, he that 
remembers the Lord in the days of 
his youth, upon him an evil day 
shall not come. "O, young man, re- 
member the Lord in the days of thy 
youth, that the evil day come not 
upon you." Youth is the time 
to form character, to lay the foun- 
dation of our lives. If we will be 
careful to remember the counsels of 
God , we shall keep our bodies clean 
before him, so that the Spirit of 
the Lord may dwell upon us, and 
we shall not partake of the evil hab- 
its that are besetting men today. 
According to the counsels of God, 
in the Word of Wisdom, they who 
keep themselves free from evil hab- 
its will never see the evil day ; but 
those who partake of evils, and let 
evil become a part of their being, 
find that as age comes on, it is hard 
for them to get rid of their appe- 



tites and desires. Those who partake 
of the- evils of the world, find when 
they become old and decrepit, that 
they have not the stamina and de- 
termination to resist their appetites 
and hence must give way to them. 
This condition leads them into the 
path of sin, and as they tremble and 
go toward the grave, the evil day is 
upon them. 

I often think of the great prophet 
Nephi, the son of Lehi, and his ex- 
ample. His father was told to 
prophesy unto the people of the evil 
of their ways. They were driven 
out, as we are told, because the 
wicked had sought their lives. They 
went away /from Jerusalem, and 
traveled in the wilderness. When 
the time came, the Lord revealed 
unto Lehi that his sons should re- 
turn and get the record which 
Laban had. It was then the older 
of the brothers rebelled. Thev said 
it was a hard thing that they should 
be asked to do this. But Nephi 
never wavered ; he believed what 
his father said, and, "as the Lord 
liveth," he said, "we shall do that 
which he asked for, for he never 
requires anything of his children 
that he does not open the way for 
them to accomplish." And through 
the history of that boy we find that 
he always stood firm and steadfast. 
They returned to their homes, and 
those who have read the Book of 
Mormon know how they were 
turned away by their cousin Laban. 
He would not let them have the 
records. Nephi's brothers desired 
to turn back into the wilderness, 
where their father was, but he said, 
"No, as the Lord lives, we shall 
never return unto our father until 
we have accomplisheed that which 
God has asked us to accomplish." 
His confidence in his father, his 
obedience, made him strong. The 



ELDER DANIEL G. MILLER. 



123 



Spirit of the Lord rested upon him. 
He did not fear men, but he feared 
to do that which was not in accord- 
ance with the will of God. He 
earnestly desired to carry out the 
counsels of God in his life. They 
finally did accomplish that work, 
and returned to their father ; and in 
that journey across the wilderness. 
N,ephi became really the leader of 
that colony, because of his faithful- 
ness. 

When his father beheld that 
great vision of which he spoke to 
his family, he saw, six hundred 
years before the birth of Christ, 
down through the stream of time, 
to the coming of the Lord and Sav- 
ior. In that vision it was shown 
unto him that Christ would come 
upon the earth, and be born of the 
Virgin Mary. He told the story to 
his family, and related how that his 
two oldest sons would not partake 
of the fruit of life which was of- 
fered unto them. When Nephi 
came to them, they complained and 
wanted to know why it was. Nephi 
believed the words of his father, 
and not only was satisfied with the 
words of his father, but wanted to 
know for himself. He went off into 
the mount alone. There, before God, 
he presented himself, and plead- 
ed with him that he, too, might 
behold that which his father had 
seen. The Lord could not withhold 
it from him, because of the faith 
which he had. He told his brethren 
of the vision when they asked him 
to explain those things, and he said, 
"Have you asked God?" They re- 
plied, "No, he never makes himself 
manifest unto us." "Well," he 
said ; "ask God in the humility of 
your souls, and you shall know." 

So I say unto the youth of Israel : 
If you do not know that the gospel 
is true, ask God, your heavenly 



Father; seek him earnestly, keep 
his commandments, and it will be 
made know unto you. 

I thank the Lord for so many of 
our young men who go out into the 
world willingly to proclaim the gos- 
pel. When they declare the truths 
of the gospel, that God has spoken 
again from the heavens, and has re- 
vealed himself to the children of 
men, that men now go forth with 
the authority to preach and to 
teach in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ — they fear not to promise 
men that inasmuch as they will keep 
the commandments of God, believ- 
ing in him, turn away from their 
sins, and from that which is evil, 
and be baptized in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, that they shall 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
and know of the doctrine for them- 
selves. They need not take the tes- 
timony of any man, but shall know 
for themselves; and the elders fear 
not to state this unto the world of 
mankind for they know it is true. 

My brethren and sisters, I know 
the gospel is true, I know this is 
the work of God. I know that Jos- 
eph Smith is a prophet of the liv- 
ing God. It has been made known 
unto me. I know that, although I 
might deny the faith, might go into 
sin and lose the spirit of this work, 
yet in my heart, I know that God 
lives, and that the gospel is true. 
I could not get away from it. It is 
impossible for a man to keep the 
spirit of this work and do nothing. 
He cannot do it. He must be busy, 
must seek and he shall find ; for it 
is written, ask and ye shall receive, 
knock and it shall be opened unto 
you. This is the work of God. He 
is leading this people. The man 
who stands at the head, even Presi- 
dent, Joseph F. Smith, is a prophet 
of the living God. When I listen to 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



him and hear the sound of his voice, 
I know it is of God that he speaks, 
and I rejoice in hearing him. I 
thank the Lord for this testimony 
of the truth that has come to me in 
my youth. I rememher when I 
was a boy listening to the servants 
of the Lord speak of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Whenever I heard 
his name it caused a thrill to go 
through my being. I did not know 
why it was that I loved that name 
so well ; but as I became older, and 
sought God in earnestness of heart, 
I came to know that he was a 
prophet of the living God, and had 
been chosen to bring forth God's 
work in this day and age of the 
world ; and I rejoice in it, my breth- 
ren and sisters. 

May God bless us, and keep us 
true to him and the covenants which 
we have entered into ; and may we 
remember that if we walk in the 
path of righteousness, God's spirit 
will be upon us ; but if we depart 
from the path, we lose the Spirit, 
and begin to doubt within our 
hearts, and cannot testify as we do 
now. God grant that his Spirit may 
attend us throughout all our lives, 
I pray, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The chorus sang: "Invocation to 
Harmony." 

ELDER DON C. DRIGGS. 

(President of the Teton Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
certainly proud to be a citizen of 
Idaho, the Gem of the mountains, 
but I suppose I owe my allegiance 
to Utah, also, because it wa,s here 
that I was born. I am one of the 
young men who swarmed over into 
Idaho, in the later 80's, about the 



year '88, when the borders of the 
Church did not reach much beyond 
the Utah line. Statistics of the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office show that 
there are now residing within, the 
State of Idaho about 75,000 Latter- 
day Saints. When I went to Idaho, 
I felt that I was going to a strange 
land. I hitched up my team, and, 
with a covered wagon, traveled the 
distance, and it seemed to me that it 
was a wilderness all the way. 

I am glad, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I have learned something 
of pioneer life. I am glad that I 
looked upon a land that was unin- 
habited, so that I might appreciate 
that experience and learn to some 
extent what our fathers endured in 
settling this country. We live in the 
great Teton valley, and my first 
view of that country was a view that 
I imagined was like looking upon 
the land of promise, for it is certain- 
ly a beautiful country. We are right 
up against the National Park. Our 
boundaries on the north are the 
National Park, and on the east — I 
presume lies the Atlantic Ocean, be- 
cause I do not know of any other 
stake of Zion between us and the 
Atlantic. (Laughter). We have 
two beautiful valleys in our stake, 
the Teton valley and the Jackson 
Hole district, Wyoming. The Wy- 
oming and Utah line divides our 
stake in the center, so that we have 
the privilege of presiding over not 
only the Teton stake, but parts of 
the states of Idaho and Wyoming 
combined. ( Laughter. ) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the privilege of being with 
you at this great conference, in see- 
ing the great multitudes of people 
who have gathered here to be in- 
structed, and to hear the word of 
the Lord, as it is delivered by his 
servants. We have been admon- 



ELDER DON C. DRIGGS. 



125 



ished, brethren and sisters, regard- 
ing our shortcomings, as well as. 
praised for the good that we are 
trying to do. We have heard good 
reports from the Church officials. 
It seems that everything is prosper- 
ing, and we ought to rejoice in the 
blessings that we enjoy. 

It is good, I believe, for us to be 
admonished and reminded of our 
obligations. In ancient times, or 
in the days when the children of 
Israel were driven into the wilder- 
ness, they were led to the land of 
promise by prophets of God, and the 
great prophet, but a great general 
and a great leader in Israel, — ad- 
monished his people that they were 
forsaking the true and living God, 
and were seeking to worship idols, 
to look after other gods. He re- 
mnided them of their shortcomings, 
and finally told them, "And if it 
seem evil unto you to serve the 
Lord, choose you this day whom 
ye will serve ; * * * * but as 
for me and my house, we will serve 
the Lord." That is the declaration 
of a great prophet, teaching his peo- 
ple, reminding them of their short- 
comings ; and the declaration of his 
testimony and what he and his fam- 
ily or house intended to do. And 
the people said, "Nay, but we will 
serve the Lord." And Joshua 
caused a pillar of stone to be erected 
as a testimony that the people had 
agreed to serve the Lord, and said, 
"Ye are witnesses against your- 
selves, that ye have agreed to serve 
the Lord." And they accepted that 
statement, and were indeed wit- 
nesses against themselves that they 
had agreed to serve the Lord. And 
we are told in this Scripture that 
the people under Joshua did serve 
the Lord, and the people that lived 



after him served the Lord, and were 
true to this covenant. 

My brothers and sisters, the 
thought comes to us: we are wit- 
nesses against ourselves that we 
have agreed to serve the Lord, and 
we ought to say in our hearts, as 
Joshua did, "But as for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." 

I pray that we may have this 
spirit and this desire in our hearts, 
and that we will keep the covenant. 
It may not be necessary for a monu- 
ment of stone to be erected as a 
witness that we have agreed to serve 
the Lord, but we all know that we 
have agreed to serve him, and that 
we continue to make covenants, day 
by day, to serve him and keep his 
commandments . 

I have a testimony that the work 
of the Lord is true, that this is his 
Church ; and I desire to be faithful 
and true to the covenants that I 
have made. 

I am reminded, my brothers and 
sisters, that my grandfather stood 
upon this temple block, even before 
the great Tabernacle was erected, 
and preached to the people. He 
suffered imprisonment with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. My grand- 
father, on the other side, helped to 
build the wagons to carry the Saints 
across the plains. I feel proud of 
this memory lof my parents and 
grand-parents, and the part they 
took in the work of the Church. 
But I realize that their faithfulness 
is not sufficient for me. The only 
way I can honor their memory, and 
be a credit to them, is to do some- 
thing for myself and for those 
whom I might help. 

I pray that the Lord may con- 
tinue his blessings unto his people, 
and unto us all, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I enjoy this privilege very much, 
of speaking from the same platform 
with these faithful presidents of 
stakes. I have had the privilege of 
going into their stakes, and know 
of their good works, and of the 
faithful people over whom they pre- 
side. I have rejoiced with you in 
the sessions of this conference, at 
the timely and important teachings 
pertaining to God, and of our rela- 
tions- to him and of our duties. 

For the most part, in the scrip- 
tures, there is little reasoning from 
nature up to nature's God. The ex- 
istence of Deity is either assumed 
or directly asserted, without much 
by way of reasoning from creature 
to Creator. We have, however, 
some beautiful illustrations. For in- 
stance, the Psalmist exclaims, "The 
heavens declare the glory of God, 
and the firmament showeth his 
handywork. Day unto day uttereth 
speech, and night unto night shew- 
eth knowledge. There is no speech 
nor language, where their voice is 
not heard." 

In the 104th Psalm, after an 
enumeration of the works of the 
Lord, the Psalmist exclaims, "O 
Lord, how manifold are thy works ! 
In wisdom hast thou made them 
all : the earth is full of thy riches." 

There is a sublime passage from 
Job along the same line. "Lo, these 
are parts of his ways ; but how little 
a portion is heard of him? but the 
thunder of his power who can un- 
derstand ?" 

Naturalists of high standing 
have reasoned in the same way, and 
we have the scientist and philos- 
opher, Spencer, declaring, "One 
truth must ever grow clearer, the 



truth that there is an inscrutable 
existence everywhere manifested, 
to which we can neither find nor 
conceive beginning or end." And 
again, "Amid the mysteries which 
become the more mysterious, the 
more they are thought about, there 
will remain this one absolute cer- 
tainty, that we are ever in the pres- 
ence of an infinite energy from 
which all things proceed." 

But while this line of reasoning 
is valuable, reasoning from nature 
up to nature's God, it requires a 
revelation to know God in all his 
attributes. 

One of the three comforters of 
Job put this question to him, "Canst 
thou by searching find out God? 
Canst thou find out the Almighty to 
perfection ?" We have in the efforts 
of men without the aid of revela- 
tion the example of men struggling 
vainly to discover the attributes of 
God. I rejoice that in answer to 
the prayer of faith by the little boy, 
he was able to say, "I saw two per- 
sonages, whose brightness and 
glory defy all description standing 
above me in the air. One of them 
spake unto me calling me by name, 
and said, pointing to the other: 
'Joseph, this is my beloved Son, 
hear Him.' " In that one clear 
vision, the mystery, the doubt and 
the uncertainty of the past were 
swept away. 

If you wish to know what that 
meant to the world, take as an ex- 
ample the discussion in the Septem- 
ber, 1916, number of the North 
American -Review, by the Rev. 
Philip S. Moxom on "The Modern 
Conception of Deity," and see what 
value it is and has been to the world 
for that one clear, glorious revela- 
tion to be given of the personality 
of God. He discusses at consid- 
erable length this modern concep- 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



127 



tion. He confesses that it is diffi- 
cult to set forth just what this mod- 
ern conception of Deity includes, 
but argues for a personal Deity, one 
that has the power to know and 
feel and to will; and argues that a 
being may possess all those attri- 
butes of personality and still pos- 
sess the attribute of infinitude. He 
also asserts very strongly in favor 
of the divine immanence of God. 
Let me read the concluding words 
of the discussion, which is signifi- 
cant, in view of the general belief, 
at the time of the Prophet Joseph, 
that a mere static deity existed, an 
impersonal power which had ceased 
to reveal itself. They may call 
Deity, as the naturalist did, "an in- 
scrutable existence, an infinite en- 
ergy," but they denied to Him per- 
sonality. Mr. Moxom concludes 
his article in these words : 

"The deeper experiences ,of the hu- 
man soul cause it to repel the old no- 
tion of a static deity, — an impassable 
infinitude of being with which human- 
ity can come into no appreciable rela- 
tions. It seeks for a God who is not 
remote from mankind, who is so near, 
indeed, that the wide sweep and meas- 
ureless stretch ,of human experience, 
in some mysterious way, is also the 
experience of God, and that through 
the fulfilment of the life of beings 
whom he has created, God is finding 
his own self-realization and self-fulfil- 

merit ^ + + ♦ ♦ t¥ 

"No thought is more deeply rooted 
in the mind of man today than the 
thought of the divine immanence. Are 
we not beginning to see that the di- 
vine, immanence means much more 
than we have realized, and is freighted 
with consequences vaster than we 
have dreamed? The old theological 
battles have lost their zest because 
they have lost their meaning. The 
faint light of a new dawn trembles on 
the horizon. Let us look up and face 
the East." 

The leaven of "Mormonism" is 
beginning to leaven the entire lump 



of humanity. It was through the 
revelations in the "Pearl of Great 
Price" that we have the great 
declaration of God, "Behold this is 
my work and my glory, to bring to 
pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." The writer seems to 
have caught a little of that idea, as 
well as much of the "Mormon" be- 
lief in reference to the personal 
nature of Deity and of his divine 
immanence throughout the im-. 
mensity of space, as indicated in this 
article. 

There is need in the world of so- 
called "Mormonism." Bishop Greer 
is quoted as having said, on the 25th 
of last April at consecration ser- 
vices at the St. Thomas Church on 
Fifth avenue, New York, one of 
the fashionable churches of that 
fashionable street, as follows : 

"No more urgent question, vitally 
urgent question, confronts the church 
today than this, of how to close the 
gap which now too much exists be- 
tween the church's creed and the 
church's Christian life — for this at 
least is certain, it must somehow be 
closed. Otherwise the church will 
lose its influence in the world, its 
leadership and power, and will cease 
to be a force and factor in the world's 
affairs." 

Some years ago, as published in 
some of our prints, copied from the 
Anaconda Standard, of Montana, 
the remarks of a Reverend T. H. 
Martin of the Unity church, were 
made to the effect that the church 
had lost its magnet, "that the Chris- 
tian religion of the present is merely 
a social code and has nothing in it 
whereby it could claim a divine 
origin." I shall not take time to 
read more of his words, but will 
read an indictment, published in the 
September number of the Forum, 
which is illustrative at least of some 
of the charges being made against 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the church. I am not discussing the 
question to whether the proofs will 
sustain this indictment, in any or 
all of its counts, but simply call at- 
tention to the fact that these things 
are being said and published in 
leading and reputable magazines, 
charging inefficiency of the church 
today. If true, we would not exult 
in it but it would make all the 
greater our sense of responsibility 
to do missionary and evangelical 
work throughout the world. The 
writer, Mr. Mercer C. Johnson, 
says : 

"I have said that the Christian 
church is in a state of apostasy, that 
she has tried to serve God and Mam- 
mon, and has made an awful mess of 
it; that she has put away her real 
Christ; and set us in his stead a Mam- 
mon-pleasing Christ; that she is a 
captive church, under the shameful 
spell of her ungodly and inhuman 
captor; that she is the white slave of 
Mammon, and sits with folded hands 
watching the cross to which he nails 
whatever opposes his will, half horri- 
fied because of the dreams of the real 
Christ that haunts her still, half stupe- 
fied by the deadly dollar dope that is 
the meat and drink of her double life, 
hardly knowing what she ought to say 
or do, and not caring overmuch." 

I trust the charge is an exaggera- 
tion. As I said before, we take no 
pleasure in knowing of the failure 
to any extent of Christianity, and 
yet we realize the necessity for 
the restoration of the gospel — the 
explanation we have for our exist- 
ence as a Church. 

We also have problems of our 
own at home that will engage the 
serious attention of earnest men and 
women. Some of those grave prob- 
lems have been pointed out — the 
necessity of bishops and of stake 
presidents putting our machinery 
into operation for the purpose of 
reaching as many as possible of the 



young men and young women of 
the Church to keep them from 
temptation, to keep them in the 
straight and narrow path. 

In addition to the care which 
officers may give children, we need 
also the loving care of parents, — 
and there is no love that is equal 
to the mother love and the father 
love. We have a beautiful picture 
in Holy Writ of the mother love of 
Rizpah, the concubine of Saul, 
whose two sons with five others 
were offered to the Gibeonites as a 
sort of a sacrifice or peace offering ; 
and when thej lives of those boys 
were taken, and their bodies were 
placed upon the rock, unburied, 
there was one who kept faithful 
vigil for O such a long time ! The 
execution took place, we are told in 
II Samuel, 21 :9-10, in the early 
barley harvest, and that mother 
placed sackcloth upon the rock and 
sat there with her dead — her two 
sons and her husband's five grand- 
sons — and she kept vigil until the 
rainy season came, until the water 
from heaven descended. Just how 
many weary weeks or months that 
may have been. I could not at this 
moment tell you — but it is an illus- 
tration of the mother love that she 
"suffered neither the birds of the air 
to rest on them by day, nor the 
beasts of the field by night," and 
that she kept this lonely and faith- 
ful vigil from the beginning of the 
barley harvest "until water dropped 
upon them out of heaven." 

This is but an instance duplicated 
in a different way in this age of 
ours. Just last year, we saw, upon 
the banks of the Little Colorado, a 
lonely woman keeping vigil, watch- 
ing and wandering on the banks, 
pleading no doubt for that treach- 
erous stream to give up its victim, 
her little boy. All others had ceased

to search, but the mother still 
stayed, and the father afterwards 
declared that he would sell his 
flocks and would join the mother in 
keeping up the search, to find possi- 
bly somewhere in the debris that 
came downs from the breaking of 
the Lyman Reservoir, the body of 
their youngest child. We have ex- 
amples such as that of what people 
will do for the dead. In Cache Val- 
ley, when the son of the late pre- 
siding bishop of the church was 
drowned, Wm. B. Preston, Jr., with 
his companion Solon Barber, the 
nearby towns turned out in large 
numbers. Stores were closed and 
business suspended. The bishop of 
Wellsville called me by telephone 
to enquire how the search was 
going, and said, "Remember that 
Wellsville stands ready to send one 
hundred men if necessary to take 
part in this search." And it was 
. no idle promise ; it would have been 
fulfiled upon the slightest sugges- 
tion of need. 

And yet, in all these instances, 
no living soul could be helped. 
Rizpah could not bring back the 
lives of her two sons, or the five 
grandsons of her husband ; the 
mother, upon the banks of the Little 
Colorado, could not bring back the 
life of her child ; nor could anything 
be done for the boys in the Bear 
River, except to recover the bodies. 
But there are living children all 
over this Church who need the care 
of a mother and of a father ; and 
the plea I make is for fathers and 
mothers to safeguard their living 
children ! 

I have often quoted the words of 
the philosopher and the humorist, 
Mark Twain : 

"When we consider the tremendous 
forces of the upper and nether world 
which play for the mastery of the soul 



of a woman, during the few years in 
which she passes from plastic girl- 
hood to the ripe maturity of woman- 
hood, we may well stand in awe be- 
fore the momentous drama. Nature 
must needs center in her all the possi- 
bilities' of life. What capacities she 
has for tenderness, goodness; what 
capacities for vileness, bitterness and 
evil. Nature must needs be lavish 
with the mother and creator of men 
and_ center in her all the possibilities 
of life. And a few critical years can 
decide whether her life is to be full 
of sweetness and light, whether she is 
to be a vestal of a holy temple — or 
whether she will be the fallen priestess 
of a desecrated shrine." 

At no time since my remembrance 
has there been such a wave of un- 
rest and of evil as is sweeping over 
the country in this day. The cita- 
dels of modesty are being assaulted 
as never before in my remembrance. 
The forces of the nether world, to 
use the expression of Twain, are 
very active. It is necessary for the 
forces of good to be equally vigil- 
ant. We must be militant in this 
work. It will not do for us to sit 
supinely down and think that the 
ward teacher or bishop is going to 
look after our boy and girl. It will 
take the best ingenuity of the stake 
presidents and bishops to control 
wisely the dancing situation ; and 
they will need the help of every 
father and of every mother in doing 
this work. 

A few weeks ago, Governor Ken- 
drick of Woming attended one of 
our conference meetings. We in- 
vited him to speak, and he men- 
tioned the fact that before non- 
"Mormon" audiences he had held 
up the fact that "Mormon" people 
accompanied their children not only 
to the Church, but also to the bail 
room, and he commended that prac- 
tice. I could have wished that the 
examples he was generous enough 
to thus mention, were more general 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



among our people — an old custom 
which must be revived more gen- 
erally among the people. We must 
look after our living children, and 
not be content in case of an emer- 
gency to display wonderful zeal for 
the dead. Grown-ups must be more 
vigilant and militant in attacking 
evil. 

I was told by one of the leading 
lawyers of this city that there was 
exhibited in one of the playhouses 
of this very city, where this con- 
ference is being held, an act so in- 
decent that no right-thinking man 
or woman could view it without the 
blush of shame coming to his face. 
These things are not necessary, — 
the evils of the picture show are not 
necessary. You people in the coun- 
try districts do not need to sit down 
and see your children debauched 
and contaminated by the moving 
picture show, or evils of this sort. 
Legislative action may be necessary 
to control the dance as well as to 
censor the playhouse and the mov- 
ing picture show; and I urge dili- 
gence in this matter. When this 
problem was brought to me in one 
of the stakes, of one of our ad- 
joining states, I suggested if they 
could not control in any other way 
dancing in the hall owned by those 
not of the Church, that a town or- 
dinance be enacted which would 
make the close bodily contact or any 
other impropriety or indecency in 
the dance room a misdemeanor. 

We need not only all the faithful 
attention of the officers of the 
Church, but also that of parents, to 
their children ; and then have that 
supplemented by such legislation as 
may be necessary to protect us from 
this wave of evil which is attacking 
the citadels of modesty, virtue and 
integrity among the young people. 
Let parents know where their chil- 



dren are. I bear the memory from 
my own home of a mother whom I 
never went home so late as to find 
asleep, and very seldom even re- 
tired, because she would not do that 
until the last child came home. And 
children must be considerate not to 
drag their parents out to the ball 
room too often, and not to keep 
them sitting up waiting too often, 
or for too long hours ; but there 
must be a co-operation on the part 
of parents and of children, in order 
that they may be safeguarded. 

May the Lord bless us in this 
great and important and pressing 
work which is now before us in all 
the stakes of Zion, I ask in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The chorus sang: "I know that 
my Redeemer lives." 



ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH. . 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brothers and sisters, on two 
occasions during this conference 
time, one of the revelations of the 
Lord, given before the organiza- 
tion of the Church, has been quoted. 
The revelation referred to is the 
one found in the 4th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, wherein 
the Lord says, "A great and a 
mighty work is about to come forth 
among the children of men." Each 
time that revelation was quoted, my 
mind went back to the beginning 
of this great work. I stood again 
in the grove where the Prophet 
Joseph Smith prayed unto our 
Father in heaven ; and remembered 
my many visits to that sacred spot. 
Again I stood, in my mind, with 
the Prophet Joseph Smith upon the 
hill Cumorah, where he met the 
angel by appointment, and year

131 



after year was instructed concern- 
ing the great things that were to 
come to pass in this day. I saw 
him receive the plates from which 
the great record of the Nephites 
was printed. I was with him at 
Kirtland where, under privations 
and toil, he built the temple in 
which so many glorious visions 
were given to the Latter-day Saints. 
I followed him from Kirtland to 
Missouri, and from Missouri to 
Illinois. I was there where he, un- 
der the direction of the Spirit of 
the Lord, directed the digging of a 
drain ditch which turned unhealthy 
Commerce into the healthful, beau- 
tiful city of Nauvoo. I saw, in my 
mind's eye, that place grow from 
only a few houses, to a city of 20,- 
000, with prospects; of being the 
biggest city in the state of Illinois. 
I saw railroads directed toward that 
city, bridges constructed across the 
Mississippi and a permanent city of 
our thriving country built. 

Then I saw the Saints leave that 
city, under persecutions, following 
the death of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and his brother Hyrum the 
patriarch. 

I have wondered if the early 
Saints of the Church really realized 
what was meant in that revelation 
concerning the great and mighty 
work that was to be brought forth 
among the children of men. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith must have 
known what would come to pass, 
for he foretold of our coming to 
the Rocky mountians. Yet under 
his direction in the short space of 
five years, and that constantly dis- 
turbed by mob violence, the Saints 
worked with a heaven-born zeal to 
make that place part of the great 
and marvelous work that was to 
come forth. The people gave much 
time to public works, paving some 



walks with stone and dividing miles 
and miles of sidewalks from the 
street with splendid curb, much of 
which still stands today together 
with a number of fine old houses as 
a testimony of the wonderful in- 
tegrity of the Latter-day Saints, 
fired with the revelations from the 
Lord for the huilding up of Zion 
in the earth. But the building of 
this city was only one little part of 
the great work referred to in the 
revelation. 

Fourteen years ago I went back 
to that city, and found about 1,500 
people there. The public men asked 
when we were coming back, and 
offered' inducements that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints might get possession 
of some of their old homes, and help 
them build up that city again, for, 
said they, "we can do nothing until 
you come back." About two years 
later, I was offered some stock in 
an interurban coming into that 
place — for, you know, that while 
there were four or five railroads 
projected into that city while the 
Latter-day Saints lived there, after 
all these years, Nauvoo stands with- 
out, a railroad. Nauvoo is little 
known to the railroad people, but 
the city of Montrose, across the 
river, and that, too, only a very 
small village, is the shipping point. 

I went back about three weeks 
ago, to hold conference there. I 
found that instead of 1,500 people, 
there were about 900 people. I 
found the projected interurban still 
unbuilt, the waterworks they felt 
sure of having only half-realized — 
and the beautiful flat next to the 
river, where most of the city stood 
in the day when our people flour- 
ished, all grown to weeds ; the ' 
houses were unoccupied and much 
of it almost a wilderness. The peo- 
ple were free, to admit there could 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be nothing done here until we came 
back and helped them. I said, "We 
do not need to come back — you 
people who live here now are not 
responsible for the driving out of 
the Later-day Saints, and neither 
were your parents, for there have 
been several peoples lived there 
since the Latter-day Saints were 
driven away. All you need to do 
is to heed the counsels and the ad- 
vice and the testimonies of the 
elders that have been borne to you, 
from time to time; all you need to 
do is to repent of your sins, and be 
baptized, and become members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; if you will do this, 
you shall receive power to build 
this city, and make it known again 
as a flourishing city in the great 
state of Illinois." 

My brethren and sisters, it is a 
great and a marvelous work, "a 
marvelous work and a wonder," for 
God has set his hand in the last day 
to rebuild Zion, and to gather to- 
gether all those whose hearts thirst 
after righteousness. This goodly 
land in which we dwell is the land 
in which the honest in heart of all 
nations shall be gathered together; 
and if we, who have been born in 
the covenant, we who are heirs to 
the richest blessings upon this earth, 
do not arise and magnify our call- 
ings in the earth, God will raise up 
from the nations of the earth, men 
and women like unto our fathers 
and our grandfathers, who will 
buckle on the full armor of God and 
go forth and build up his kingdom 
in the earth. 

I often wonder if the young men 
of Zion, who are born heirs to the 
covenant, are like the sons of rich 
men, who fritter away the wealth 
that has been gathered by their 
fathers. I wonder sometimes what 



the destiny of that part of Zion 
that are born heirs to the covenant 
will be. Do we expect to compete 
with the world in the gathering of 
riches? Do we expect to compete 
with the world in the accumulation 
of wealth? Or do we expect to 
fulfil the great mission that the 
Lord has said must be done in this 
day? And that great mission is the 
proclamation of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ — the calling of the world to 
repentance. And how can we call 
the world to repentance, if we our- 
selves do not repent? How can we 
expect the world to listen to our 
testimonies, if we ourselves are not 
living lives worthy of emulation? I 
referred to Nauvoo, a city of possi- 
bly five or six years of age, rising 
from a few houses to 20,000. They 
kept the commandments of God, 
proclaimed the gospel to their 
neighbors, sent it into the surround- 
ing states, and to other nations. We 
do not need to be deprived of the 
riches of this world, if we would 
only seek God and his righteousness 
first, if we would only do the great 
things that our Father has said 
should be done by his children. 

There is nothing in this world 
that will bring more peace, more 
joy, and more happiness, than the 
preaching of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I think that our fathers 
and our grandfathers are permitted 
sometime to look down upon the 
earth today, and see what has taken 
place since they were called away 
— for the hearts of the children of 
men everywhere have been touched 
by the knowledge of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, restored by the Lord 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
preached by our fathers. There are 
few people in the world today who 
believe in infant damnation for the 
unbaptized. Hundreds of people 



GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



133 



today believe in the restoration of 
the gospel, if not literally, as we 
Latter-day Saints believe it, they 
believe in a restoration of light 
from time to time, and they are 
adding truth upon truth to their be- 
lief, and practicing all the light they 
receive. I meet hundreds of people 
today who believe that baptism is 
absolutely essential unto salvation. 
I meet many people who believe 
that the laying on of hands is essen- 
tial to the reception of the Holy 
Ghost. One of our elders told me 
the other day that a man converted 
in the state of Indiana to baptism 
in his own church, grew so enthu- 
siastic over the baptism he had re- 
ceived, he wanted to know what 
could be done for his sister, who 
had died. He had read in Corin- 
thians about baptism for the dead. 
The minister took him out and bap- 
tized him for the dead sister to sat- 
isfy his burning desire to have his 
sister saved in the same church as 
himself. 

There is a congregation of people 
in one of the conferences of our 
mission, who are feeling after and 
trying to find out how they can 
practice the great principle of bap- 
tism for the dead, that their fathers 
and their mothers may come into 
the same church in which they feel 
that they have found the light. 

About three months ago, in the 
city of Winnipeg, a minister there, 
to comfort the hearts of mothers 
who had been bereaved of their 
sons, and to administer hope and 
consolation to the widows of men 
who had died in the great struggle 
in Europe, preached a great sermon 
on salvation for the dead, declar- 
ing that he believed the merciful 
God would take care of those who 
had died for their country. Who 
can say that the leaven is not leav- 



ening the whole lump? Who can 
say that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
is not taking root in the hearts of 
the children of men? Thousands 
of men and women today believe in 
a personal God. Many people are 
growing to believe in Jesus Christ 
as the veritable Son of God, born 
of the virgin Mary and begotten 
of His Father. The Lord has said 
that this gospel would go forth) 
until it filled the whole earth; and 
there will come a time, my brothers 
and sisters, when they will only say, 
"Where can I find someone who 
can ; officiate in some of the ordi- 
nances of the gospel? Where can I 
find a man who has been called of 
God to take me into the waters of 
baptism and there bury me with 
Christ for the remission of my sins? 
They will want to know where they 
can find a man who has the right 
to lay his hands upon their heads 
after they have been baptized, and 
confer by the power of God the 
Holy Ghost. Why? Because the 
leaven is working and the proclama- 
tion of the gospel, made by our 
fathers and grandfathers, and be- 
ing made today, is taking root in 
the hearts of all the children of 
men. 

There is more tolerance in the 
world today than there has ever 
been before, at least in America, 
and they are only waiting for men 
to come to them who are fired with 
something that they have not got, 
something that will satisfy their 
souls, that will give them meat and 
drink. They are hungering and 
thirsting after something they know 
not what. 

Upon the Latter-day Saints, my 
brethren and sisters, has been laid 
this responsibility. The men of 
Zion, from the age of twelve years 
up, have received the Priesthood in 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



every degree, and that priesthood 
carries with it the responsibility of 
proclaiming to the world the things 
that have been revealed by our 
Father. My brethren and sisters, I 
sometimes think "Woe be unto 
Zion, if she preaches not the gospel ! 
What are we here for, if we are not 
to proclaim to the world this won- 
derful thing that has been restored 
by our Father? How many of us 
have stood in the grove with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, when he be- 
held God the Father and Jesus 
Christ, the Son ! Hoy many have 
followed the Prophet Joseph Smith 
to the hill Cumorah, where he re- 
ceived the Scriptures of divine 
truth, as revealed to the Nephites 
upon this continent? How many 
have learned the beautiful things 
contained in that wonderful book? 

Hundreds of thousands of Books 
of Mormon have been distributed in 
the last few years in the United 
States, and hundreds of people have 
the leaves of them turned down by 
valuable passages, all the way 
through from the beginning to the 
end. How many of your Books of 
Mormon are turned down, page 
after page, upon the gems written 
therein, upon/ the things that will 
bring comfort and consolation to 
your soul in times of sorrow, upon 
the things that will inspire you to 
go out and proclaim the gospel or 
prepare yourself to do these things 
that God has laid upon our shoul- 
ders ? How many of you know the 
value of this great and wonderful 
record that has been given to us to- 
day to prepare ourselves for the 
preaching of this great and glorious 
work? O, you say, we are not out 
in the world. 

I told the missionaries of the 
Northern States mission, last night, 



that there is a better chance here 
at home, than there is in the world, 
for •real missionary work. How 
many of you have sought to visit 
your neighbor? and make a friend 
of him, until you have won his con- 
fidence? After you have won his 
confidence, how many of you have 
sat down and asked him to read the 
Scriptures with you? How many 
of you have won the love of your 
neighbor, so that you can put your 
arms around the man of the house, 
or around his sons, and tell them in 
all soberness that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that the 
gospel of Jesus Christ has been re- 
stored to the earth that will save 
him and his family and bring them 
peace and happiness and salvation 
if he will obey it? 

The winning of the soul of your 
neighbor will bring just as much 
joy, just as much peace, yea more, 
because you will have him with 
vou all the time for you will not 
have to go and leave him. All you 
who have been upon a mission 
know how hard it is to leave your 
friends out in the world. But if 
you can convert your neighbors, 
vou could live with them and enjoy 
their society and companionship, 
and grow together in the knowledge 
of God our Father; so I appeal 
to the elders, and especially all re- 
turned missionaries, to continue 
their labors at home, seek as many 
opportunities as you can, to get into 
the homes of the people and teach 
them the restored gospel. 

My brothers and sisters, every 
part of my body burns when I hear 
men testify of the restoration of the 
gospel, and that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God, and that he was 
an instrument in the hands of God 
in establishing this great work ; for 



GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



135 



there is no greater work in all the 
earth. The building of the great 
cities of the world, the highways, 
the great bridges, all the wonderful 
inventions for the comfort and con- 
venience of man, and all the things 
that have been done in any other 
division of God's work, cannot be 
compared with the great work of 
salvation that has been established 
in the earth. You may not be called 
upon to build bridges, neither to 
build railroads, neither airships nor 
telephones, but all you Latter-day 
Saints are called upon, by God our 
Father, to preach this gospel of his 
kingdom to your neighbors and to 
the world, and woe be unto those 
who preach not the gospel ! 

I would to God that all the young 
men and young women of Israel 
could be touched by one-hundredth 
part of the Spirit of our Father that 
touched the heart of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, as he prayed in the 
woods of Palmyra. O that all of 
us could feel what Joseph Smith 
the Prophet felt when he was in the 
presence of the angel Moroni ; then 
we would feel a little of the respon- 
sibility that he felt, all the days of 
his life; -then our sons would go 
into the mission field better pre- 
pared, having had more opportunity 
to sing the songs of Zion. ' Some 
day, the world itself will hold us 
responsible for the great truths that 
we have. Doctors, in their code of 
etiquet, require every man to give 
the truth that comes to him to the 
medical world free. Scientific men 
are anxious to give their knowledge 
to the world, and all big men are 
happy to add all they can to the 
world for the good of their fellow 
men. We have something, as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that will do more 
good to the world than any other 



thing in it, but hundreds of us are 
holding it locked in our bosoms, 
being too close-fisted to let it out, 
feeling too stingy to open our hearts 
and teach it to the world. O that 
Zion could be touched with the 
Spirit of our Father in heaven, and 
take upon her the real mission of 
teaching every one concerning the 
restoration of the plan of salvation, 
given by our Father through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

God bless Zion. May he give us 
power to hold up the hands of his 
prophet, Joseph F. Smith, for I tes- 
tify to you, my brothers and sisters, 
that he is a prophet of God, a real, 
genuine leader, a mighty man, and 
a father in Israel, filled with love 
and good will toward all mankind. 
I wish that all you young men, if 
you cannot come in touch with an 
angel of God, might come in touch 
with the President of this Church, 
and those associated with him in the 
ministry for they are men of God, 
and have the welfare of Zion at 
heart. Their souls are filled with a 
desire that the young men and 
young women in Israel should arise 
in their strength and in the power 
of God, go among their neighbors 
and associates, and to thd world 
when they are called, and give the 
world a chance to become associated 
with the work that our Father has 
established in the earth. God grant 
that Zion may grow, that the young 
men and young women of Israel 
will not go seeking the pleasures 
that will mar their souls, and close 
up their hearts, but will open their 
hearts to the Spirit of God, and 
prepare themselves to be among the 
migfhty men who live in this day 
and time; and I pray for these 
blessings in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we 
have had a good time. We will not 
prolong this meeting. 

I would like to emphasize the 
good things, if it were possible, that 
have been said in this conference, 
in our lives, that we may go from 
here better men and better women, 
more determined to be beneficial to 
our Father's children, wherever we 
meet them, and with a determina- 
tion such as was manifest by the 
great Israelite, "As for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." 
God help us to do so, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The authorities were sustained, 
as in the Tabernacle meeting, the 
names being presented by Elder 
George Albert Smith. 

The chorus sang: "God be with 
you till we meet again." 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Patriarch Daniel McRae. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, the congrega- 
tion was called to order at 2 p. m., 
by President Joseph F. Smith, who 
presided. 

The choir sang : "Author of faith, 
eternal word." 

Prayer by Elder Nephi L. Mor- 
ris, president of the Salt Lake stake 
of Zion. 

The choir sang the hymn, "O 
awake, my slumbering minstrel."

Seventy.) 

A visit to Jackson County — A good 
word for "Liahona the Elders' Jour- 
nal" — Meeting with the old soldiers 
of the Civil War — -Meeting with the 
Saints and Elders in Independence 



— Civil War veterans dying at the 
rate of five hundred per year — An-

Hawk War veterans. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I realize more fully possibly than 
any of you can, the responsibility 
that rests upon me this afternoon 
in occupying this position. I want 
to say that I endorse very heartily 
the remarks that have been made 
and the sermons that have been 
preached by my brethren, and the 
sentiment that has inspired them to 
give us the word of the Lord, as 
they have done during the former 
sessions of this conference. I hope 
and trust that the prayer offered by 
Brother Nephi L. Morris will be 
surely answered this afternoon, that 
all who may speak now at this time 
and in this session may be filled 
with the same spirit that has actu- 
ated former speakers. I rejoice 
with you in being here present at 
this semi-annual conference of the 
Latter-day Saints. I am glad I am 
a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I re- 
joice that I have a name and stand- 
ing among you, and that I am 
hailed by my brethren and sisters 
where I go, as a friend, as one who 
appreciates the society and the love 
of my fellowmen, my fellow work- 
ers in this great cause. 

I am reminded now of a recent 
visit that I paid to the center place 
of Zion, Jackson county, Missouri. 
It is more than twenty-five years 
since my former visit to that hal- 
lowed ground, for it is and has been 
hallowed. It has been dedicated 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
by his prophetic utterances desig- 
nated as the place where the tem- 
ple of God shall be builded, in the 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



137 



future, upon which shall rest the 
glory of God as a pillar of fire by- 
night and a cloud by day. While 
there I had the privilege of asso- 
ciating with the brethren who are 
working there in the printing office, 
who are engaged in issuing 
Liahona the Elders' Journal and 
doing other works pertaining to the 
welfare of the Central States mis- 
sion, and other missions of the 
United States. I must say a good 
word for the "Liahona," because I 
believe it is hailed with delight by 
the elders scattered abroad through- 
out this great Republic, and it is a 
means of introducing them into the 
society of people that their voices 
alone could not reach. But the lit- 
erature of that little paper is ex- 
ceptionally good, and sets forth in 
a very fair degree the doctrines and 
principles of our faith. And so I 
gave a little note to Brother Sum- 
merhays, as a visitor to that place, 
stating that I believed it would do 
good to the elders, help them in 
their mission labors, and otherwise 
advance them, if the Latter-day 
Saints generally, especially the 
memhers of the quorums of the 
priesthood, would invest a dollar or 
two every year in Liahona the 
Elders' Journal, and leave it for the 
elders to distribute abroad in their 
mission fields. 

The primary cause of my visit, 
however, was to meet with the old 
soldiers of the Civil war, in their 
camp fire at Kansas City. When I 
visited Kansas City twenty-five 
years ago, it was not nearly as large 
a town as at present. I am told, it 
has now some four hundred thou- 
sand inhabitants. It hasi grown 
much more rapidly than Independ- 
ence, and I had to notice again the 
fact that the Latter-day Saints be- 
gan to build Independence in Jack- 



son county as one of the central 
places of Zion, in fact, the real cen- 
ter place. They placed confidence, 
properly, in the word of the Prophet 
Joseph that they should build up 
that little town by locating there, 
and finally the word of the Lord 
also came that the Saints had to 
make the best of the fact that they 
were driven from their homes in 
that town. What I intended to say, 
and to call your attention to, is that 
the town of Independence is about 
what it was in thirty-three, when 
the Saints left it, not willingly but 
because they were compelled to. 
And twenty-five years ago, at my 
former visit, I found it just as I 
found it recently, not very greatly 
improved, in the number of inhabi- 
tants nor in the jgreatness of its 
buildings. We have, however, a 
very beautiful little meetinghouse 
on one portion of the temple block, 
which originally consisted of about 
sixty-three acres, and in that house 
I had the pleasure of meeting with 
the Saints, the elders and the young 
lady missionaries, and holding re- 
ligious service with them, testifying 
of the gospel, of the truths that the 
Prophet Joseph brought to light, 
and the great organization which, 
under the inspiration of God, he 
brought to a fulness. 

In the march through Kansas 
City, the ranks of the old soldiers 
were not as well filled as in former 
years, for every year now sees them 
pass away, five hundred or more. 
This last year has reached beyond 
that mark, and the coming year will 
probably double it, and so on in the 
near future In a few years more, 
the ol.d soldier of the Union Army 
will be a memory of the past, as 
near as we can guess from present 
appearances and experience. As 
they marched through the citv of 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Kansas, headed by bands of music, 
led by the mayor of the city, by 
the governor of the state, and hon- 
ored in any way that they could 
honor the old soldier, the people 
shouted many times "hooray for 
Utah." Some, however, did so in 
derision, for, you must remember 
that in that city of Kansas, right in 
that little town of Independence, 
there are other people who do not 
feel very friendly to Utah and 
her people, and the Latter-day 
Saints generally. So they expressed 
themselves, a very few, in jeering 
remarks, in regard to Brigham 
Young, and the people here gener- 
ally. This, however, was only 
casually, not very common, but the 
greatest part of the reception there 
was friendly and cordial, and espe- 
cially so for the old soldiers of the 
G. A. R. 

In company with two of the old 
soldiers we went up to Independ- 
ence and, as I said, held meeting 
there. I was never more pleased in 
my life than I was to hear Comrade 
Kenard, an old soldier of the Union, 
and Comrade Westwood, another, 
bear faithful testimonies of the 
truth of "Mormonism." The gos- 
pel never found them, until after 
they had left the army, but when it 
did find them it fastened itself upon 
their hearts, minds, and thoughts, 
and from that testimony, that in- 
spiring thought, they have not de- 
parted, and could not change. 

I recently visited the hand-cart 
gathering, which we usually hold on 
Saturday evening in the Fourteenth 
ward meeting house. After the 
Saturday session, of conference 
yesterday, at 4 :30, we met as usual. 
There were about between fifty and 
sixty of the old hand-cart veterans 
present. Our meeting was espe- 
cially for a business which we 



transacted. With the exception of 
the recitation of a poem, composed 
by the sister who spoke it, no pro- 
gram was instituted. The poem 
was beautifully rendered, and was 
a glowing tribute of a very warm- 
hearted Latter-day Saint sister. I 
have to express my approbation, 
good will and fellowship for those 
old hand-cart veterans who endured 
so much to come across the plains, 
and to gather here with the Latter- 
day Saints, in their early gathering 
years, in the days when President 
Young and his brethren of the 
apostles instituted the hand-cart 
system for the gathering of Israel. 
For three years the Latter-day 
Saints gathered in this way. They 
pulled hand-carts from the Mis- 
souri river, and in some cases from 
Iowa, two hundred miles heyond, 
making twelve hundred miles that 
the first companies, in 1856, trav- 
eled to reach Zion. They pulled 
their hand-carts all that distance, 
excepting that a few of the later 
companies, which were caught in 
the snow storms, along about the 
South Pass, and on the Sweetwater, 
were met mercifully by bands of 
brethren with teams and wagons 
for their relief, to bring them the 
remainder of the way through the 
snowy roads to Zion. But many of 
them, or quite a number, sacrificed 
their lives in that journey through 
the cold and hunger which they had 
to endure; but these remaining 
whom I met yesterday were glad 
that they were permitted to reach 
the land which they desired, in 
safety. They have always expressed 
their gratitude to those brethren 
who came so stoutly and so earn- 
estly and so self-sacrificingly forth, 
to meet them and deliver them from 
their very painful experiences. 
I rejoice with you, my brethren 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG.

and issters, that our fathers and 
mothers, the Prophet Joseph, the 
Prophet Brigham Young, and those 
who followed them and the pioneers 
of this great work, instituted means 
and plans for the gathering of the 
Saints from other countries, for 
soon it was found that there was a 
better way. Better means were es- 
tablished for the gathering of the 
people, and large companies of our 
brethren were sent back in the days 
of President Brigham Young, with 
their teams and wagons well fitted 
with provisions, sufficient for the 
journey to and from the Missouri 
river in the one season of the year. 
They met at the frontiers, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints who had come up 
from other countries, and who were 
ready and waiting for transporta- 
tion across the plains, — in comfort- 
able wagons drawn by able teams 
and pioneered and captained by 
able men and drivers. And this was 
a very great improvement over the 
hand-cart system. But Brother 
Margetts composed a hymn on his 
hand-cart journey down to the Mis- 
souri river, which read something 
like this : 

"Cheer up, ye elders, you to the world 

will show 
That Israel must be gathered soon, 

and oxen are too slow." 



to gather to the land of Zion. The 
gathering spirit filled their hearts 
the moment they received the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. The mo- 
ment, my father testified, that he 
met the Prophet Joseph, he was in- 
spired with the thought, with the 
great thought, that he had then the 
privilege of meeting and striking 
hands with a man that had stood 
face to face with his God, and who 
was in communication with him 
constantly by revelation. And this 
is the testimony of every Latter-day 
Saint, I believe, that they could 
bear, for as Jesus said to his disci- 
ples, and to doubting Thomas espe- 
cially, "because thou hast seen me, 
thou hast believed ; blessed are they 
that have not seen, and yet have 
believed." I have echoed that 
thought in my heart, ever since I 
heard my father bear that testi- 
mony, "O blesed are the men and 
women who saw the Prophet Joseph 
and believed in him ; but equally 
blessed are they who did not see 
him, but yet believed in his glorious 
mission." I testify to you that the 
gospel is true, and I pray God to 
help us to be faithful to every prin- 
ciple and to every duty, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

NOTE TO THE ABOVE. 



But we found that with all the 
vicissitudes that had to he met, the 
hand-carts were too great a hard- 
ship for women and. children to en- 
dure, as long as a better way could 
be found, -and it was found. 

My brethren and sisters, I testify 
to you that "Mormonism" is true. 
I testify, to you, to the integrity of 
our parents and of your parents 
who had the love of the gospel so 
in their hearts that they forsook all 
for their faith, and for the desire 



I desire to add a word in relation 
to the Black Hawk veterans, for, 
like the hand-cart veterans and 
their organization, and the civil war 
veterans in their organization, so 
in the Black Hawk war organiza- 
tion, I am deeply interested, and 
was present in the service of each. 
And I intend to exert myself in the 
future, as in the past, for their wel- 
fare ; and shall especially bend my 
energies to help to secure a pension 
for those worthy men who served

in the Black Hawk war, or for their 
deserving widows, who represent 
their husbands who have answered 
the final roll-call. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

We live in a momentous age — Esti- 
mates of the lives and fortunes 
spent in the Great War — -The rela- 
tionship of the Latter-day Saints to 
the great calamity — Predictions of 
war to be poured out upon all na- 
tions — The warnings given in the 
word of God, contrasted with the 
statements of wise men of the 
world — Our duty to warn the inhab- 
itants of the earth — The promise of 
the coming of God's Kingdom and 
the peace and safety to be found 
therein — The duty of our Nation in 
the establishment of future peace. 

Surely, no man can face this con- 
gregation and not be overwhelmed 
with a sense of his own insignifi- 
cance, and only in the' belief that 
the Lord will give his Spirit and 
his strength, may one hope to dis- 
charge the responsibility of this 
position. 

It is a mere commonplace to say 
that we live in a momentous age. 
The world is now in the third year 
of the world's greatest and most 
destructive war. How great it is, 
is beyond the comprehension of 
man, but a few outline facts may 
enable us in part to grasp the great- 
ness of this calamity that has come 
to the world. Of course, at present, 
there can only be estimates formed 
of the casualties in the war, but 
these that I present, in round num- 
bers, are compiled from sources 
which I; believe the most reliable, 
by Gen. Hugh Scott, chief of staff 
in the army of the United States. 
He gives an itemized statement 
from each nation, but I shall 
merely report his totals. Of men 



killed outright in all the armies, he 
gives as 3,522,327. Of those wound- 
ed or missing, 10,035,300; total 
casualties thirteen million — that is, 
dead, wounded and missing, 13,- 
557,627. These figures were given 
out at the close of the second year 
of the war. There must be added 
to them the terrible losses since 
then at the battle of Verdun, and 
the recent great French and British 
offensive on the Somme. Those who 
have fallen in the great drives that 
have taken place on the southern 
end of the three hundred-mile battle 
line between Germany and Russia; 
the tens of thousands that have been 
killed within the last two months, 
since the opening of the offensive in 
Macedonia and Rumania, also in 
the battles in Asia Minor; so that 
it is safe to say that you would have 
of killed outright, more than four 
millions of men ; of wounded and 
missing, more than twelve millions, 
and a total of casualties of more 
than fifteen millions of men ! Of 
treasure employed in this war, some 
idea may be obtained from the fact 
that the warring nations have bor- 
rowed more than forty thousand 
millions of dollars ($40,000,000,- 
000) ; they have spent from their 
own exchequers, more than ten 
thousand millions, that they had on 
hand, and that has come from taxes. 
This of course, takes no account of 
the destruction of property, and 
laying desolate cities, towns, and 
countries through which armies 
have surged back and forth, and by 
the destructive battles that have 
been fought. These figures are be- 
yond our comprehension. W,e may 
be somewhat educated in thinking 
in millions, but thousands of mil- 
lions — billions — are beyond us. 

My reason for introducing these 
matters to this conference is to sub- 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

- mit to you this question : Does this 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints stand in any relationship 
to this great calamity that has come 
upon the inhabitants of the earth — 
upon the nations of Europe? Do 
we as a Church have any relation- 
ship to the great world movements ? 
I believe that we d,o, but I must 
needs point this out in headlines 
because of the limitation of time. 
We certainly do hold a relationship 
to these great calamities. We hold, 
for instance, the relationship of a 
fore-knowledge of them, for God 
has not permitted this calamity to 
come upon the inhabitants of the 
earth without warning. We have 
in a general way, a foreknowl- 
edge of the destiny of the 
nations that shall inhabit this 
choice land of America. We had 
read to us this morning by Elder 
Joseph F. Smith, Jr., the conditions 
on which nations may maintain 
themselves and their dominion upon 
this choice land, dedicated as it is 
to free institutions and to be the 
habitat of a righteous people. And 
they may maintain themselves here, 
whether of Israel or of the Gentile 
races; if they comply with those 
conditions — acceptance of the God 
of the land — who is declared to be 
Jesus Christ — and of his righteous 
law. The same message was de- 
livered to the Nephites. They were 
told that both the House of Joseph 
— son of Jacob — and the Gentiles 
should have special inheritance in 
this land, and that the Gentiles 
should be great in the eyes of the 
Lord, but there should be no kings 
that should raise up unto the Gen- 
tiles in this land ; "for he that rais- 
eth up a king against me shall per- 
ish," said the Lord, "for I, the Lord, 
the King of heaven, will be their 
King." The land is consecrated to 



free institutions, then, and to a 
righteous people, and God, under 
these conditions, is pledged "to for- 
tify this land against all other na- 
tions." It is the land of Zion, "and 
he that fighteth against Zion shall 
perish, saith God" (II Nephi x). 

The great calamity of the Civil 
war was predicted by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, as is common knowl- 
edge among you. twenty-nine years 
before it began, and in great detail 
the circumstances of the Rebellion, 
as to its ending in the death and 
misery of many- souls; as to the 
Southern States being divided 
against the Northern States ; as to 
the Southern States calling upon 
Great Britain, and Great Britain 
calling upon other nations, in or- 
der to "defend themselves against 
other nations," "and then" war shall 
be poured out upon all nations. It 
reads in the current print of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, "and 
'thus' war shall be poured out 
upon all nations." But when 
revising the History of the 
Church some years ago, we 
found that in the manuscript, it 
read, "then," that is. when Great 
Britain shall call upon other na- 
tions to defend herself against 
other nations, "then war shall be 
poured out upon all nations." Eng- 
land for a long while, trusting in 
the greatness and strength of her 
navy, rejoiced in what her states- 
men were pleased to call her policy 
of "splendid isolation" ; that is to say 
freedom from entangling alliances 
with continental European powers. 
But finally, under the stress of ris- 
ing circumstances, she departed 
from this policy of isolation, and 
united with other nations for self- 
defense, with the result that soon 
afterwards — that is, in a few years 
— came this outburst of the world's 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



war. "And thus with the sword and 
by bloodshed," continues the reve- 
lation, "the inhabitants of the earth 
shall mourn, and with famine and 
plagues and earthquakes and the 
thunder of Heaven and the fierce 
and vivid lightning also, shall the 
inhabitants of the earth be made to 
feel the wrath and indignation and 
chastening hand of an Almighty 
God, until the consumption decreed, 
hath made a full end .of all na- 
tions." 

Thus the note of warning of this 
great world war was sounded. In 
another section of the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants, the Prophet 
says: "I prophesy in the name of 
the Lord God, that the difficulties 
which shall cause much blood shed 
previous to the coming of the Son 
of Man, "will begin in South Caro- 
lina." "It may arise over the slavery 
question," said he, for "this a voice 
declared to me when praying upon 
the subject, on December 25, 1832." 

As stated here this morning, the 
general opinion prevailed that the 
world would not witness another 
great international war. Soon after 
the close of the secon,d Balkan war, 
the noted professor referred to here 
this morning, by Dr. Talmage, in a 
work of his called War and' Waste, 
said: 

"What shall we say of the great war 
of Europe, ever theatening and ever 
impending, but which never comes? 
We shall say that it will never come. 
Humanly speaking it is impossible. 
All Europe cherishes, is ready for the 
burning, yet Europe recoils and will 
recoil even in the dread stress of spoil 
division of the Balkan war." 

This was the universal feeling re- 
specting modern war. I remember 
that several young men of our own 
faith who came to me to converse 
upon this very revelation and warn- 



ing on war that the Lord caused 
to be written by his Prophet, and 
wondered if we would not have to 
find some interpretation that would 
be harmonized with continual peace 
among the nations ; but the word of 
God proved to be true, and notwith- 
standing all the hopes and opinions 
of men, the great calamity has 
come ; and we stand in the relation- 
ship of having fore-knowledge of 
the event, not by any wisdom of 
ours, but because the Lord was 
pleased to reveal the impending 
danger of the nations to our 
Prophet. 

There is another relationship in 
which we stand to this great event 
of the last days — one which grows 
out of our fore-knowledge of this 
calamitous event of the world's war, 
and that is the relationship of duty 
to warn the inhabitants of the earth 
of this calamity. If you will read 
that revelation which is called God's 
Preface to his Book of Command- 
ments, you will find it stated there 
that God, "knowing the calamities 
that were to come upon the earth," 
of pestilence, and war, and famine, 
he had sent forth his angel to his 
Prophet and had commissioned him 
to teach it, to establish his Church, 
make proclamation of judgments to 
come, especially of this calamity of 
war, and proclaim also the existence 
of a place of refuge and safety in 
the midst of these calamities, even 
Zion, the land of America — f or such 
America is, the land of Zion, "And 
it shall come to pass among the 
wicked", saith the Lord, "that 
every man that will not take up his 
sword against his neighbor, must 
needs flee into Zion for safety, and 
there shall be gathered unto it out 
of every nation under heaven; and 
it shall be the only people that shall 
not be at war one with another."- 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

One other relationship we stand 
in to these great world movements, 
and to this calamity of war, partic- 
ularly, and that is the relationship 
based upon hope, upon the assur- 
ance that notwithstanding the 
greatness and the fierceness of this 
cataclysmic war that has come upon 
the inhabitants of the earth, before 
they were aware of it, before they 
could avoid it, we know that beyond 
these scenes of turmoil, and strife, 
and sore perplexity of the nations, 
and this judgment, there is the 
promise of the coming of God's 
kingdom. In that passage, we often 
quote from Isaiah, referring to the 
time when the mountain of the 
Lord's house would be established 
in the tops of the mountains, and 
all nations would flow to it, that 
they would there be taught the ways 
of the Lord, and learn to walk in 
his paths— in that scripture it is 
also said that God would "judge 
among the nations and rebuke many 
people, and they shall beat their 
swords into plowshares, and their 
spears into pruning hooks." That 
nation should not "lift up the sword 
against nation, neither learn war 
any more." The revelations of God 
in these last days to his Church are 
replete with promises that after the 
world conflict, there shall come 
world peace, and the earth shall 
rest. It seems to me that it is at 
this point that we may be especially 
helpful to the inhabitants of the 
earth, first, by proclaiming the in- 
coming of this era of peace, and 
second by the introduction of those 
instrumentalities that shall make it 
possible for the establishment of 
that kingdom. Indeed I believe 
that light will break in upon the 
present gloom and darkness of the 
world's great sorrows. Already men 
are beginning to take account of 



what shall be "after the war shall 
close." Unhappily, as was pointed 
out by Brother Hyrum M. Smith in 
his remarks on Saturday, there are 
those who preach a war of trade 
after the war of arms shall have 
closed. I am happy, however, to 
note that while there are those who 
are engaged in an agitation of that 
kind, there are statesmen great 
enough, in contemplating this pros- 
pect, to say that to indulge in re- 
venue will be but to sow the seeds 
of future wars. Only a few days 
ago, on the third of the present 
month, there appeared in the dis- 
patches in our daily press a most 
statesman-like word from Lprd 
Bryce, who, up to a year or so be- 
fore the outbreak of the war, was 
Great Britain's ambassador to this 
country, and at a meeting of con- 
gregational ministers in Great Brit- 
ain, he decried this trade war of re- 
venge, and the agitation of the idea 
of so restricting trade and com- 
merce with the Central Empires of 
Europe, as to work their injury, to 
humiliate them, and for the pur- 
poses of revenge. He decried that, 
and hoped that such a policy would 
not obtain, and advocated a league 
to restrain aggression and compel 
arbitration. "If there is to be," he 
said, "a re-occurrence of wars, be- 
coming more terrible with the un- 
ceasing advance of science, we may 
well despair of the future." But 
instead of despairing, he called 
upon those before him to unite with 
all other forces that would look to 
the establishment of a permanent 
peace among the nations of the 
earth. He pointed to America, and 
called attention to the fact that both 
candidates for the high office of 
President of this Republic were 
committed by public utterance to an 
expressed willingness to forsake any 



144

position of isolation, heretofore as- 
sumed by our country, to participate 
with other neutral nations, and with 
the beligerent nations, in seeking to 
establish the world's permanent 
peace, holding that both these can- 
didates were equally pledged to 
such a policy, and he doubted not 
that they were both equally sincere ; 
which, also, I believe. So that there 
are those in the world who will 
work for the world's peace. I hope 
that the Latter-day Saints — that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints — will be numbered 
among those who will engage in 
such work. I have confidence that 
our nation, the United States, is 
going to be an instrument in the 
hands of God in accomplishing 
great things when it comes to set- 
tling the world's affairs, now so 
complex and confused by reason of 
this terrible war. I look for the in- 
fluence and power — the great influ- 
ence and power — of our nation to 
be thrown in the scale on the side 
of justice and righteousness, and 
for the establishment of a perma- 
nent peace among the inhabitants 
of the earth. There will doubtless 
be constituted a league of nations 
that will, in a way, establish an em- , 
pire of humanity, with such instru- 
mentalities created through which 
to exercise its just powers, that na- 
tionality shall be so far suppressed, 
that the intensity of national feel- 
ing shall not again be permitted to 
disturb the peace of the world. I 
see my time has expired. The Lord 
bless the cause of justice and of 
peace, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Two organ solos, "Nearer, my 
God, to thee," and "Andante Re- 
ligioso," were played on the great 
organ by Prof. John J. McClellan. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and 
sisters, that the few minutes I oc- 
cupy, I may be inspired of the Lord, 
that I may be assisted in relating to 
you conditions as they exist in our 
Mexican mission, and as they exist 
in the Mexican nation, among that 
people. 

I would like to call your atten- 
tion, by way of preface, to the 
words of the Lord as spoken 
through the Prophet Lehi in regard 
to the conditions that should come 
upon his descendants, should they 
forsake the Lord. When Lehi was 
told of this land and told to bring 
his family and come here, he was 
also told upon what conditions his 
people might remain in peaceful 
possession of the land. He says : 

"Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained 
a promise, that inasmuch as those 
whom the Lord God shall bring out 
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his 
commandments, they shall prosper 
upon the face of this land; and they 
shall be kept from all other nations, 
that they may possess this land unto 
themselves. And if it so be that they 
shall keep his commandments, they 
shall be blessed upon the face of this 
land, and there shall be none to molest 
them, nor to take away the land of 
their inheritance; and they shall dwell 
safely forever. 

"But behold, when the time cometh 
that they shall dwindle in unbelief, 
after they have received so great 
blessings from the hand of the Lord; 
having a knowledge of the creation of 
the earth, and all men, knowing the 
great and marvelous works of the 
Lord from the creation of the earth; 
having power given them to do all 
things by faith; having all the com- 
mandments from the beginning, and 
having been brought by his infinite 
goodness into this precious land of 
promise; behold, I say, if the day shall 
come that th«y will reject the Holy 
One of Israel, the true Messiah, their 
Redeemer and their God, behold the 



ELDER REY L. PRATT.

judgments ,of hitrn that is just shall 
rest upon them; 

"Yea, he will bring other nations' 
'unto them, and he will give unto them 
power, and he will take away from 
them, lands of their possessions; and 
he will cause them to be scattered 
and smitten." 

Without going into detail, breth- 
ren and sisters, the Lamanites that 
inhabit the land have forsaken, in 
their past history, their true Mes- 
siah, their Redeemer and their God, 
and as a result of such, they have 
brought upon themselves the fulfil- 
ment of this promise of condemna- 
tion, that the Lord made through 
their father Lehi. Contrary to gen- 
eral opinions, among a great many 
people that I come in contact with, 
I wish to state that the Mexican 
people are in the great majority the 
descendants, literal descendants, of 
Lehi, through his sons Laman and 
Lemuel, and they are the Laman- 
ites. A very small proportion of the 
people who inhabit Mexico are of 
mixed blood; the great majority of 
them are straight Indian tribes, but 
they have been conquered at the 
hands of the other nations whom 
the Lord had said should come in 
among them, if they should disobey 
him and forsake the gospel as he 
revealed it unto them. The same is 
true in regard to all of the Latin- 
American countries, south of us 
here. The Gentile nations, as it is 
explained in other parts of the Book 
of Mormon, have come in, and have 
literally taken away from those peo- 
ple the lands -of their inheritance, 
insomuch that statistics given out in 
regard to Mexico, during the last 
days of the regime of Porfirio 
Diaz, state that of the fifteen mil- 
lions of people, that there are in 
Mexico, there are only two millions 
of people who are property holders. 



My observation has led me to know 
that those two millions of property 
holders in Mexico are the descend- 
ants of the Spanish conquerors who 
came in. Hernando Cortez, in the 
year 1519, took away from the peo- 
ple of that land every part of their 
possessions, of the lands of their 
inheritance ; and they did not only 
take away from them their lands, 
but they took away from them their 
personal liberties. They believed 
that the right of conquest was 
vested in the Holy See, and it was 
given to them to conquer this peo- 
ple, and they made them the vas- 
sals and the servants and slaves of 
their king. In recompense for the 
part that they took, they received 
enormous grants of land, and 
grants of the natives of the land, 
with which to till their immense 
domains. The whole valley of 
Oaxaca, a valley almost as large as 
the Salt Lake valley, was given to 
one man, and thirty thousand men 
of the Indian population were given 
to him with which to till his land. 

Now the conditions that were 
thus started by the conquest of 
Mexico, by the Spaniards, have 
been perpetuated right up to this 
date. In the southern part of the 
country, these immense plantations 
are worked by man-labor only. The 
rich hacienda owners have intro- 
duced very little machinery, finding 
it cheaper and more to their interest 
to work their immense domains at 
the expense of the natives of the 
land, because the labor there has 
been so accessible to them, and so 
cheap. Men have been literally 
worked to death on some of the 
southern plantations. 

Perhaps many people will be 
startled to know that a system of 
slavery existed in Mexico, up to the 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



time that Madero started his revo- 
. lution, a system of slavery that was 
in every respect as bad as the 
slavery that existed in the South. 
Members of our own Church have 
fallen into the snare there, the na- 
tive members of the Church, and 
have heen sold into slavery. I re- 
call, just now, one young man who 
was wiled away from his home, 
near the city of Mexico, and was 
sold into slavery down in the state 
of Oaxaca, to labor there. He was 
abused there for three years, and 
only when he had become absolutely 
so emaciated and so weakened by 
constant labor that he could no 
longer work, was thrown out in 
the jungle as dead. After recovery, 
near a stream, he made his way 
back up to his family and told the 
elders and myself many times of his 
experiences ; and he related those 
of the several hundred people who 
were on the plantation at the time 
he went there. There were only a 
few of them left alive at the time 
that he came away. 

Now, there has been, in Mexico, 
revolutions from the time that the 
Spaniards conquered Mexico, and 
the conditions I have referred to 
are the cause of those revolutions. 
The people have never been con- 
quered in their spirits, although 
they have been conquered and held 
down by a force superior to their 
own. They have been struggling 
for liberty, and it was this desire to 
participate in the ownership of the 
land, and in the government of the 
country, that made possible the rev- 
olution by Madero there, with 
which we are all conversant. Al- 
though! it may appear different to 
those who are not very conversant 
with it, it is a fact that the struggle 
has always been between the two 
powers that I have mentioned — the 



wealthy people who are the de- 
scendants of the conquerors of the 
country ; and the poverty-stricken 
part of the population comprising 
the very great majority of those 
who have nothing but misery, and 
who do not even own the clothes 
that they stand up in. And although 
there have been men raised up in 
their ranks who have been leaders, 
but have later led counter-revolu- 
tions against the very people that 
they tried to put in power, it has 
always been because of the lament- 
able fact, in human nature and in 
human kind, that there are very few 
men who have not a price, and such 
men as Pasqual Orozco, and others 
who have led counter-revolutions 
against the real struggle for lib- 
erty have been bought off by the 
millions of the privileged and 
wealthy classes of that country. 
My observations, and letters that I 
have received from our twelve hun- 
dred native Saints, the representa- 
tives of them that we have in and 
around the city of Mexico, teach 
me that conditions are no better 
now than they have been for the 
past four or five years. I have let- 
ters under date of only last month 
stating to me that the revolutionary 
leader of the south, Zapata, is with- 
in twenty miles of the capital of 
Mexico with his forces; and we 
learn from newspaper reports that 
the revolutionary cause is gaining 
ground in the north. 

Now, many people wonder why 
the man who is recognized as the 
provisional president of Mexico, 
cannot bring about the pacification 
of that country. I would like to give 
you my opinion in regard to it, 
brethren and sisters. It is simply 
this : General Carranza is by birth 
and by training, and in every other 
way, an aristocrat — one of the priv- 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 



147 



ileged classes of Mexico, and he is 
a man who cannot inspire in the 
Mexican people any confidence. The 
idea that prevails generally, that the 
Mexican people would rather fight 
than eat, to me is erroneous. I 
don't believe it; but the Mexican 
people never again will lay down 
their arms until the people of the 
country have an opportunity to par- 
ticipate in the ownership of the 
country, and in the government of 
the country, in the politics of the 
country, something that they have 
never had up to this present time, 
since the country was conquered by 
the Spaniards. They have never 
had property, and they have 
never had political liberty, they have 
never had religious liberty, in that 
country" up until this time. Until 
the time comes that they get those 
things, the masses of the people, the 
thirteen millions of the people, will 
never lay down their arms, accord- 
ing to my belief. 

I had the privilege of staying in 
that country for three years of the 
present revolution, and I met those 
soldiers. Up on the cold sides of 
the Volcan, east of Mexico, I saw 
soldiers from the tropical parts of 
the country in rags, and I asked 
them why they desired to continue 
the struggle against such odds, and 
in the face of such great difficulties. 
They said: "It makes very little 
difference to us what sufferings we 
have to go through, but we are de- 
termined that our children, if it is 
possible on our part, shall inherit 
something besides the misery that 
we have had to live in, and we never 
again will lay down our arms until 
there is established for the humble 
class of Mexico liberty." 

In the city of Mexico today, there 
is greater suffering, according co 
the letter I received, than there ever 



has been. The money of the coun- 
try is absolutely depreciated in the 
country itself, and they are not able 
to buy the necessary things to sub- 
sist upon, and those things are not 
there, even if they had the money 
to buy them. I had a letter from 
a very sober, good branch president 
that we have there, in whose word I 
have every confidence, in which he 
said that many of the people in the 
streets of Mexico are picking up 
today fruit peelings or any other 
thing that they might pick up and 
devour, to satisfy the pangs of hun- 
ger. He says that there are many 
of our own native Saints, good, 
true, consistent members of the 
Church, who have paid their tith- 
ing, when they have made money, 
who have attended to their meet- 
ings, and who have acted as teach- 
ers, as home missionaries, in the 
meetings, and as officers in the or- 
ganizations of the Church, as we 
have them established in the mis- 
sion, and that there are among those 
many who are not eating but one 
meal in forty-eight hours. 

Such are the conditions in that 
country, at the present time. Breth- 
ren and sisters, it pains me to have 
to speak about these conditions. 
They are conditions that I keep in 
my heart, and I constantly pray to 
the Lord that other conditions 
might come about, because I keep 
in mind the word of the Lord as 
it came to Nephi, the son of this 
same Lehi, about whom I have read, 
when the Lord showed to him the 
same things that he showed to his 
father. But he showed to him fur- 
ther, and said to him: "The Lord 
God will not suffer that the Gen- 
tiles will utterly destroy the mix- 
ture of thy seed, which are among 
thy brethren, neither will he suf- 
fer that the Gentiles shall destroy 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the seed of thy brethren." If I 
had time, brethren and sisters, I 
could cite you passages wherein 
the Lord has said that the gospel 
should be restored even among that 
same Gentile nation that should 
come in to smite them, and that it 
should he restored in this period, and 
that a book should come forth hav- 
ing the fulness of the everlasting 
gospel in it, and having a history of 
this same people in it, and that there 
should be many among the Gentiles 
who should believe the words of the 
book that should be written, and 
that they would carry it back again 
to the remnants of the seed of Lehi 
for their redemption. , I have just 
as great faith in the fulfilment of 
that promise, as I have in the ful- 
filment we have witnessed in their 
behalf today. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, an 
honor in being called to carry the 
gospel to that down-trodden peo- 
ple, and I wish to testify to you that 
you can feehwhen you get under 
the crust of the curse that rests 
upon them, by means of the key of 
the gospel that we carry in our 
hands, you can feel in them the 
true blood of Israel. They are a 
great people, and I have absolute 
faith in their redemption. I wish 
to invite the charity of the people 
of the Church toward them. They 
may have committed against us dep- 
redations, and if it were only a po- 
litical issue, if it were only a na- 
tional issue, if we were only Amer- 
icans, we might have resentment to- 
ward them, but we have received 
the word of the Lord that they are 
our brethren ; and we cannot scoff 
at the Jews, because through the 
Jews we have the Bible, and we 
need not scoff at the seed of Lehi, 
because through them, we have the 
Book of Mormon. We, of all peo- 



ple in the world, should be the most 
charitable toward them; have the 
kindest and the greatest desire to 
lend our efforts for their redemp- 
tion, and be numbered among those 
who believe literally in the words of 
the book, and have a desire to carry 
the words of the book to them for 
their conversion to the truth, and 
for their redemption in the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

Our Saints, I wish to say in con- 
cluding, are faithful in that land. 
The twelve hundred that we have 
there come together Sunday after 
Sunday, even in their poverty, and 
partake of the sacrament and teach 
each other. The Relief Societies 
maintain their identity, and the 
Sunday schools, and they are work- 
ing for the assistance and for the 
help of each other; and they are 
praying for the day when the clouds 
of war will, roll by, and that the 
servants of the Lord will be permit- 
ted to come again and teach and 
belo them, and carry the gospe 1 to 
their brethren and to their sisters 
who are yet in darkness. I also 
pray for these things, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

Prosperity should remind the people 
that this is a good time to pay off 
obligations — Let the present not be 
to us the prosperity of fools — Sur- 
plus money should be invested at 
home where the investor is ac- 
quainted with conditions — Improve 
the home, the land, the cattle, where 
you reside — Save your wheat for 
local demand — Pay your debts now, 
not some other day — forget not the 
debt you owe to the Lord. 

I shall not take a great deal of 
your time this afternoon, as the time 
is already well spent. We have had 
abundance of instruction, admoni- 



PRESIDING BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 



149 



tion, counsel and advice given to us 
during this conference, and it has 
been given with the Spirit and 
ppwer of the Lord, so that it has 
reached our hearts, and we feel the 
better for having attended the con- 
ference. 

For the few minutes that I may 
occupy, I would like to emphasize 
what Elder Ivins touched upon in 
his remarks this forenoon with re- 
spect to paying debts and keeping 
out of debt. I give it to you as the 
best advice to myself and to you all ; 
that there never was so good a time 
to get out of debt as right now. The 
people are abundantly prospered 
and blessed. Coming over from my 
home this afternoon, I noticed both 
sides of the street lined with auto- 
mobiles. I suppose all around this 
block you will find it so. I am glad 
to see it ; I am proud to see it. But 
I hope that those who are owing for 
their automobiles, or any part of 
them, will lay this counsel to heart, 
for it is mighty good gospel for all 
of us — that we pay off our obliga- 
tions, and also that we lift the mort- 
gages on our homes and farms. 
Everything that you produce in 
these times commands a good price. 
Everything in the way of food 
stuffs, beef, mutton, swine and 
cereals as well as fruits ; they are 
called for in one form or another, 
canned or put up in different ways, 
to supply the armies of Europe. 
They are sent abroad by shiploads. 
The war has created a great de- 
mand for all that you produce, and 
still more and more is called for. 

A stream of gold is coming back 
into this country, so much so that 
our banks can hardly contain it, for 
I noticed that in the last few days 
the banks in New York have been 
sending seventy-five to one hundred 
million dollars back to London, to 



loan it there, because there is so 
much here that they can't loan it. 
That stream of gold is pouring back 
because of these war supplies. Not 
only the munitions of war, but the 
supplies of food, clothing, and 
everything that your farms produce, 
are called for to feed those armies, 
and the prices are of the best. 
Therefore, now is the time to pay 
our debts and having paid them to 
keep out of debt. 

If we are prosperous to such an 
extent that we forget our obliga- 
tions to each other and to the Lord, 
what kind of prosperity is that? 
You can read in the Bible a proph- 
ecy of Solomon; I wish I had time 
to read it for you, but these words 
are the closing of it : "The turning 
away of the simple shall slay them, 
and the prosperity of fools shall de- 
stroy them." I have wondered if 
in this immense and unbounded 
prosperity it shall not be to us the 
prosperity of fools, which may de- 
stroy us. For if it takes faith out 
of our hearts, if it destroys the 
faith of our children so that they 
do not love the work of the Lord 
as they should do, and are given to 
frivolity and going the ways of the 
world, — if it does all that, then it 
is the prosperity of fools that de- 
stroys us! 

Now, if we are not in debt, and 
have no obligations to pay, and 
have a little surplus on hand, in- 
stead of investing that money in 
some "get rich quick" scheme away 
off, say in South America or Mex- 
ico, investing in land, timber, rub- 
ber, or bananas, or in sending our 
surplus money to invest in coal in 
Wyoming, sending it away to these 
investments that we don't know 
anything about, I advise you to keep 
your money at home, and invest it 
in something you do know some- 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thing about. President Young used 
to tell the farmers in his day, and it 
is just as good counsel for us today 
as it was in Brother Brigham's time, 
"You tend to your farms, and let 
the mines alone." Why did he give 
this advice? Because, as he stated, 
you are farmers, and you are not 
miners. Mining is all right ; it is a 
distinct and necessary business and 
a very good one, but as you are not 
miners but farmers and carpenters 
and builders and whatever vocation 
you have, therefore it is the best 
counsel that the shoemaker should 
stick to his last. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, if 
you have a little surplus, instead of 
investing it in things that you don't 
and cannot know anything about, 
these "get rich quick" schemes, let 
me advise you to invest in one acre 
or two of land that you do know 
something about ; fix up the home ; 
make your wife and family more 
comfortable ; provide for them bet- 
ter ; not to excess in dress or in 
luxury, but make good and com- 
fortable provision for them. Add 
to your little herd of cows — you 
know something more about that — 
and what you get, let it be of the 
best kind of stock. If you are in 
the sheep business, get the best 
sheep that can be produced; if you 
are dairying, strive for the best cat- 
tle, and the best results. Try to 
make what you produce a little bet- 
ter than anybody else. We ought 
to be able to make the land produce 
much more than it does. 

I believe that our Agricultural 
College, under the direction of Dr. 
Widtsoe, now under the direction 
of Dr. Peterson, has done a great 
deal in showing us that we can 
make one acre of land produce as 
much as two or three have been 
producing. A man who makes ten 



acres of land sustain twenty people, 
where it only sustained ten before, 
is a public benefactor ; he has done 
something; he has accomplished re- 
sults ; he is somebody in the com- 
munity, and I take my hat off to that 
kind of a man. 

Bishop David A. Smith and his 
brothers have a dairy herd, and they 
are proving to us that one cow will 
produce as much butter fat, and 
bring better results in the way of 
food products, than two or three 
cows of the ordinary kind would do, 
and there are others engaged in the 
same line of industry that are teach- 
ing us the same lesson. They are 
taking the forage produced on one 
acre of land and by putting it in 
a silo and making ensilage of it, 
and by properly and scientifically 
feeding, they have proven that they 
can get better results with one cow 
than you could from two or three 
cows in the old way of doing things. 
Now, all this is good. An acre of 
good land properly tilled can be 
made to produce $100 every year; 
that is 10 per cent of the valuation 
of $1,000. You can make such land 
worth $1,000 an acre just as well 
as not. 

Let me advise you in another 
point. Do not sell all the wheat you 
have, but keep enough for your 
local demands. It is good to have 
enough wheat on hand for bread, 
so that we will not be obliged to 
call on some other country to feed 
our own people. I know when I 
went on a mission, forty years ago 
— it will be forty years next April 
since I went with President Smith 
to Europe — that I provided a bin 
full of wheat for my wife and two 
children before I left. In those 
days we used to make it a point to 
have a year's bread-stuff on hand. 
That was President Young's coun- 



PRESIDING BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY. 



151 



sel, and it is mighty good counsel 
today. It will not hurt you to keep 
a little of your wheat at home and 
not sell it all. So be wise in these 
temporal things. They are small 
things but, as I said before, the 
counsel is just as good as in spir- 
itual things, and we need to lay it 
well to heart. Don't send everything 
out of the country. 

The other day we had a call at 
the sugar company's office for 150 
carloads of sugar to feed the troops 
in Italy. The Italian government 
called for that amount, at one time, 
and so the products go, and so the 
gold comes back, and so many of 
us think that this kind of thing is 
going to continue, and we will all 
pay our debts some other day. Pay 
them now. There is no time in the 
world for paying debts like right 
now ; do it at once and don't put it 
off. For the war will be over some 
of these fine days and prices will go 
tumbling. 

Let me remind you also to pay 
your debts and obligations to the 
Lord. We owe him something and 
we don't settle these obligations, 
many of us, quite as strictly as we 
should. I know we are a mighty 
good people, the best in the world, 
good bishops, good presidents, 
good, faithful workers, good sisters 
in the Relief Societies, and in the 
other organizations. No better class 
of men and women in all the world 
than they. None any purer or more 
virtuous, or more honorable, or 
more desirous of doing good, or 
more desirous, of helping their 
neighbors, of blessing and being 
blessed, than these same Latter-day 
Saints. Let us remember the Lord 
with our tithes and offerings and 
not be niggardly about it. The Lord 
loveth a cheerful giver, one that can 
walk up and say, "I have been 



blessed so abundantly that I don't 
know howj to express it. Bishop, 
here is what I owe. Really, I wish 
I could do more, and next year I 
am going to do still better." The 
Lord loves that kind of a cheerful 
giver. God bless you. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Edward H. Anderson, as Clerk 
of the Conference. 

Each and all of those named 
were sustained in the positions des- 
ignated, by unanimous vote of the 
people. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

A short sermon — Glorious destiny of 
the United States — An Opinion on 
the Mexican situation. 

I have just one little short ser- 
mon: Get out of debt, keep out of 
debt; never mortgage your homes 
nor your farms. Put down intem- 
perance, and be a wise and sober 
people. Do not make war on, but 
love your neighbors. Keep the word 
of wisdom. Be wise and moderate 
in your amusements, and let your 
amusements be innocent and your 
enjoyment pure. Card-playing is an 
evil ; pool playing is an evil, gam- 
bling is an evil ; avoid every evil, 
and the waste of your time. Honor 
the Sabbath day and divine author- 
ity. Keep yourself pure and un- 
spotted from the world. Let every- 
body, who can, raise his own bread 
and meat. Patronize home produc- 
tions, and sustain home industry. 
Be not scoffers, but show kindness 
and sympathy to all, and especially 
to the unfortunate. 

I have a feeling in my heart that 
the United States has a glorious 
destiny to fulfil, and that part of 
that glorious destiny is to extend 
liberty to the oppressed, as far as it 
is possible to all nations, to all peo- 
ple. After hearing the remarks of 
President Rey L. Pratt, with refer- 
ence to the condition of our people, 



and to the masses of down-trodden 
and oppressed people in Mexico, 
thirteen millions of whom are held 
under serfdom and slavery, by the 
descendants of their conquerors — 
who could not devoutly wish that 
some mighty and just power, equal 
to the task, would extend the hand 
of freedom to those oppressed peo- 
ple, even if it cost the lives of their 
oppressors. I do not want war; 
but the Lord has said it shall be 
poured out upon all nations, and if 
we escape, it will be "by the skin of 
our teeth." I would rather the op- 
pressors should be killed, or de- 
stroyed, than to allow the op? 
pressors to kill the innocent. 

The choir sang a chorus from 
Beethoven's oratorio, "The Mount 
of Olives." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Presiding Patriarch Hyrum G. 
Smith who in his authority as 
Patriarch blessed the vast assembly. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 

It was announced that 15,064' 
people were in attendance at the 
meetings this afternoon. 

Prof. Anthon C. L un d conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at the Conference meetings 
in the Tahernacle, and Prof. John 
J. McClellan played the accompan- 
iments, interludes, etc., on the great 
organ, assisted by Edward P. Kim- 
ball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses_ were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Fred- 
erick E. Barker, and Fred G. 
Barker. 

Edward H. Anderson, 
Clerk of Conference.
